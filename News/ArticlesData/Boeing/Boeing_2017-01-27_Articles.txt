 Trump's administration is looking for ways to make Boeing's new Air Force One cheaper Benjamin Zhang Jan. 27, 2017, 2:56 PM 5,121 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing VC-25A that serves as Air Force One.AP Secretary of Defense James Mattis officially ordered a review of the US Air Force's next generation presidential transport program to determine potential cost cutting opportunities.  In a memo dated January 26, Secretary Mattis announced that his department will work with the White House Military Office to "identify means to substantially reduce the program's cost while delivering needed capabilities." "We welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with the Trump administration," a Boeing spokesperson told Business Insider in an email. "We are focused on providing the armed forces with needed capabilities at the best possible value." In December, then President-elect Trump tweeted that the two Boeing 747-8-based jet are too expensive and threatened to cancel the entire program citing a $4 billion price tag.  According to a report by the Government Accountability Office published in March 2016, the new aircraft that will serve as Air Force One — also known as the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program — has an estimated total cost of $3.21 billion spread out over the next decade or so. The PAR program will consist of the development, testing, and construction of two 747-8-derived jets set to enter service in 2024. This means that even if Boeing delivers on time, Trump will not have the opportunity to fly on the aircraft. By that time, the existing Boeing 747-200-based VC-25A aircraft — which were ordered by Ronald Reagan — will be 34 years old. In the memo, Secretary Mattis identified areas such as autonomous operation, aircraft power generation, environmental conditioning, survivability, and military/civilian communications capabilities as potential cost-cutting targets.  Earlier this month, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg met with President Trump prior to his inauguration at Trump Tower in New York. At the company's latest earnings call, Muilenberg made it clear to analysts and the media that he is optimistic about his company's future under the Trump administration.  The Department of Defense review of the PAR program is expected to commence immediately.  SEE ALSO: Check out the Boeing airliner President Trump is trading in for Air Force One NOW WATCH: There is a secret US government airline that flies out of commercial airports Loading video...

The suit capitalizes on historical designs, meets NASA requirements for safety and functionality, while introducing cutting-edge innovations. Boeing unveiled its spacesuit design Wednesday as the company continues to move toward flight tests of its Starliner spacecraft and launch systems that will fly astronauts to the International Space Station. Astronauts heading into orbit aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft will wear lighter and more comfortable spacesuits than earlier suits astronauts wore. The suit capitalizes on historical designs, meets NASA requirements for safety and functionality, and introduces cutting-edge innovations. Boeing unveiled its spacesuit design Wednesday as the company continues to move toward flight tests of its Starliner spacecraft and launch systems that will fly astronauts to the International Space Station. A few of the advances in the design: Lighter and more flexible through use of advanced materials and new joint patterns Helmet and visor incorporated into the suit instead of detachable Touchscreen-sensitive gloves Vents that allow astronauts to be cooler, but can still pressurize the suit immediately The full suit, which includes an integrated shoe, weighs about 20 pounds with all its accessories – about 10 pounds lighter than the launch-and-entry suits worn by space shuttle astronauts. The new Starliner suit's material lets water vapor pass out of the suit, away from the astronaut, but keeps air inside. That makes the suit cooler without sacrificing safety. Materials in the elbows and knees give astronauts more movement, too, while strategically located zippers allow them to adapt the suit's shape when standing or seated. "The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive," astronaut Eric Boe said. "It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it's simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this." Of course, the suit has to be as functional as it is safe, Boe said. If an astronaut gets strapped in but can't reach the switches or work the touchscreen, the spacesuit would not be effective. That's why astronauts have spent some of their time sitting inside a Starliner mock-up wearing the spacesuit. They climb in and out repeatedly and try out different reaches and positions so they can establish the best ways for astronauts to work inside the spacecraft's confines. "The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft's redundant life support systems," said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA's Commercial Crew Program. "If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don't need a spacesuit. It's like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed." Boe and astronauts Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Suni Williams are training for flight tests using spacecraft under development for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, including Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon systems. Flight tests with astronauts aboard are slated to begin in 2018. The spacesuits astronauts wear for walking in space are already aboard the station. Heavier and bulkier than launch-and-entry suits, spacewalking ensembles – called EMUs for extravehicular mobility units – have to function as a spacecraft unto themselves. Standing inside the company's Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, former astronaut Chris Ferguson, who is now director of Crew and Mission Systems for Boeing, modeled the new suit in front of a mock-up of the Starliner spacecraft. On launch day, astronauts will don the suit in the historic Crew Quarters before striding across the Crew Access Arm at Space Launch Complex 41 and boarding a Starliner as it stands atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. "We slogged through some of the real engineering challenges and now we are getting to the point where those challenges are largely behind us and it's time to get on to the rubber meeting the road," Ferguson said. Carrying up to four astronauts at a time for NASA, operational Commercial Crew missions are to take astronauts to the space station on a regular basis permitting the crew on the orbiting laboratory to grow to seven residents. That will mean more science and research time for NASA to seek vital answers for the challenges of future deep-space missions. From this point, Boeing will continue fit checks and other testing alongside the astronauts as all the teams train for the missions and push toward flight tests. "To me, it's a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we've been," Ferguson said. "The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft."

(IDF Spokesperson's Unit) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics James Mattis Donald Trump F-35 WASHINGTON (AFP) — US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has ordered a review of the Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighter program after President Donald Trump assailed its $400 billion price tag, the Pentagon announced Friday. At the same time, Mattis ordered a similar review of the $4 billion cost for developing a new aircraft for the US president, Air Force One, the ultra-high-tech and secure 747 built by Boeing. “The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is a critical acquisition program that warrants a detailed assessment to reduce associated program costs,” Mattis said in the order. He said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to find ways “to significantly reduce the cost” while ensuring the new jets, which cost about $100 million each, meet US defense needs.

Scott Applewhite) He said the review should also compare the F-35 with the Boeing-built F-18 Super Hornet fighter to see if the latter, which costs significantly less, can meet US needs. This file photo taken on July 12, 2016 shows the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II taking part in a flying display at the Farnborough Airshow, south-west of London. (AFP/Adrian Dennis) In December, Trump assailed both the F-35 and Air Force One programs as overly costly, and after that met with the chief executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to try to extract savings. “The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases,” Trump said on Twitter at the time. The first 200 F-35s of a program that envisions some 2,450 ultimately being acquired by the different US armed services have been delivered. The aircraft have also been sold to Israel, with the first two delivered in December. Illustrative photo of an F-35 fighter jet. (US DoD/Staff Sgt. Devin Doskey, US Air Force) Proponents tout the F-35’s radar-dodging stealth technology, supersonic speeds, close air-support capabilities, airborne agility and a massive array of sensors giving pilots unparalleled access to information. But the program has faced numerous setbacks, including a mysterious engine fire in 2014 that led commanders to ground planes until the problem could be resolved. News of Mattis’ order sent Lockheed shares tumbling. They were trading up about 1.0 percent before the announcement; dropping 1.0% at $252.18 afterward. Boeing shares fell in early trade and were off 0.9% after the announcement. Lockheed said in a statement that it “welcomes” Mattis’s review and its focus on costs. The company said costs can be cut if the program adopts a multi-year procurement approach that would allow components to be bought on a large scale. It also argued that the F-35 is the best alternative. “We are confident such a thorough and objective analysis will show that only the F-35, with its advanced stealth and sensors, can meet the 21st century air superiority requirements of all of our military services,” Lockheed said. On Tuesday, Lockheed chief executive Marillyn Hewson sought to assuage shareholders by saying the new president’s objective is not “about slashing our profits.” “We understand his concerns about affordability and we certainly share that,” she said in a conference call with analysts. “It’s about how do we get the costs down today and in the future.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  James Mattis,  Donald Trump,  F-35,  Air Force One,  US Defense Department,  Lockheed-Martin,  US Air Force More in Israel & the Region Trump orders 'great rebuilding' of US military Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments The Times of Israel Current top stories How Steven Spielberg grew a social conscience By JP O’ Malley   Storm washes explosives fuses up on Tel Aviv beaches By Times of Israel staff   As president, Trump less gung-ho about dramatic changes in Israel policy By Ron Kampeas   Trump’s Holocaust day statement fails to mention Jews or anti-Semitism By Eric Cortellessa   PM denies latest leaks from graft probe as ‘lies and exaggerations’ By Times of Israel staff   The Times of Israel Daily Edition Free to Your Inbox The email is either missing or invalid Almost finished...

The current Air Force One planes were built more than a quarter-century ago. (White House Photo) President Donald Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, has ordered reviews of the multibillion-dollar programs to acquire new Air Force One jets and more F-35 fighter jets – two programs that sparked his boss’ ire in the run-up to his inauguration. “Yesterday Secretary Mattis directed separate reviews of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program,” Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said today in a statement quoted by The Hill. “The purpose of these reviews is to inform programmatic and budgetary decisions, recognizing the critical importance of each of these acquisition programs.” Lockheed Martin is the main contractor for the F-35 program, which has experienced cost overruns and production delays. The Boeing Co. is working with the Air Force on the specifications for two replacement Air Force One jets to be used for presidential flights. Last month, Trump tweeted that the Air Force One project should be canceled. He charged that the estimated cost was mounting to more than $4 billion, even though Boeing and the Air Force were still working out the requirements for the two modified 747-8 jets under the terms of a much smaller $170 million contract. In a different set of tweets posted days later, Trump complained that F-35 costs were “out of control.” Lockheed Martin expects to sell thousands of the jets to the U.S. and its allies for a return that could eventually add up to close to $400 billion. During follow-up meetings with the then-president-elect, top executives for both Boeing and Lockheed Martin pointed out that they were already taking measures to control expenses but pledged to work for further cost reductions. Trump tried to play the two aerospace giants off against each other by hinting that the Pentagon could start buying modified F/A-18 jets from Boeing rather than Lockheed Martin’s F-35. Today the Pentagon said its review of the F-35 would include a comparison with the F/A-18. Boeing has said it’s willing to work with the Trump administration “to affordably meet U.S. military requirements.” However, outside observers say even modified versions of the F/A-18 would not be sufficiently stealthy to substitute for the F-35. In a tweeted statement, Lockheed Martin said it “stands ready” to support the Pentagon’s F-35 review, and repeated its view that “there are opportunities to continue to drive down program costs”: We stand ready to support @deptofdefense review of F-35 program pic.twitter.com/gpihELJyAG — Lockheed Martin (@LockheedMartin) January 27, 2017 Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

The KC-46A is a multirole tanker that can refuel allied and coalition military aircraft and also carry passengers, cargo and patients. (Boeing photo) Boeing has won a $2.1 billion contract to build more tanker planes for the U.S. Air Force, the manufacturer and the Pentagon announced today. Under the deal, Boeing will build 15 KC-46A tanker aircraft, plus spare engines and wing air refueling pod kits. It’s the third low-rate initial production order for the company. The first two orders were for seven and 12 planes. “This award is great news for the joint Boeing-Air Force team and reinforces the need for this highly efficient and capable tanker aircraft,” Mike Gibbons, Boeing’s KC-46A tanker vice president and program manager, said in a statement. The Pentagon gave Boeing the initial contract to design and develop the next-generation tanker aircraft in 2011. Eventually, the Air Force intends to buy 179 KC-46 tankers to replace its current fleet. When follow-on orders and international sales are included, Boeing could sell as many as 400 of the tankers for as much as $80 billion. “Placing an order for another 15 aircraft is another important milestone for the KC-46 program,” said Col. John Newberry, Air Force KC-46 System program manager. “I know the warfighter is excited about bringing this next generation capability into the inventory.” The aircraft will be assembled at Boeing’s plant in Everett, Wash. The tanker development project has suffered some setbacks along the way: In Wednesday’s fourth-quarter earnings report, Boeing announced it was taking $312 million in pre-tax charges on the program, primarily due to design modifications that had to be made in the course of flight tests. There are currently four test planes flying, including two that are configured as 767-2C jets and two as KC-46A aircraft. In the long run, Boeing sees the tanker program as a “great long-term franchise program,” said Dennis Muilenburg, the company’s chairman, president and CEO.   Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Southwest is launch customer for Boeing 737 MAX but won’t get the first delivery Originally published January 27, 2017 at 4:31 pm Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier: Norwegian Air Shuttle. Share story By Justin Bachman and Mary Schlangenstein Bloomberg News Southwest Airlines was eager to sign up as the “launch customer” for Boeing’s new 737 MAX, soon to be the Greyhound of the skies as it replaces its older, less fuel-efficient cousins in fleets worldwide. But Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier across the Atlantic, Norwegian Air Shuttle. Norwegian will receive the first MAX 8 in May, spokesman Anders Lindstrom said, with flights starting as early as June. Southwest made its bones as the low-cost carrier that famously flies only one airplane family. As Boeing’s largest customer for the 737, it’s been involved in the redesign, which included outfitting the workhorse with a more powerful engine. In 2011, the Dallas-based airline placed the first order for the 737 MAX, followed by Norwegian and Indonesia’s Lion Air. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said his airline will get the first of its 200 737 MAX’s by July — two months earlier than expected, but two months after Norwegian.  Most Read Stories Seattle ‘won’t be bullied,’ will fight Trump’s sanctuary-city order, mayor says Seattle cop’s son killed after trying to stop car prowler in Sammamish  VIEW For thousands, light rail could be the only way through downtown Seattle next year What does Trump’s action on sanctuary cities mean for Seattle? Here’s what we know Seahawks assistant head coach for defense Rocky Seto leaves team to enter ministryUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. The MAX’s sprightly release clip has prompted delivery questions for both Southwest and Boeing, given that an aircraft’s launch customer typically gets — and flies — the new plane first. This sort of arrangement has been upended before, when Airbus A320neo, destined first for Qatar Airways, didn’t arrive as planned. Qatar chief Akbar Al Baker last year balked over glitches in the A320neo’s engine software and refused to take the first plane, which went instead to Lufthansa. There’s more to being a launch customer than bragging rights — although that’s a large part of the appeal of being the first to market with a shiny new jet. Aircraft makers also promise that their newest models boast lower fuel and maintenance costs than prior airplanes, providing an immediate bottom-line boost to airlines. “We’re the launch customer, regardless of when we take the first delivery,” Southwest CEO Kelly said of the MAX. His chief operating officer, Mike Van De Ven, said Thursday that “we’re the ones that have done the service-ready operational validation for Boeing. We’re the ones working very closely with Boeing to make sure it’s operating as everyone intended.” Boeing’s MAX development is on-budget and ahead of schedule. All this good news, as far as production is concerned, is a rarity in an industry renowned for being late to everything. Southwest plans to put its first MAX into service later this year, once it retires its 87 remaining 737-300 Classics, the oldest planes in the fleet. And this is the sticking point: Southwest must first retire those old planes before it can accommodate new ones, a conundrum that traces back to pilot training issues. About 10 of Southwest’s 737 MAX planes will be finished by the time the carrier is ready to begin flights in October, Van de Ven has said. The carrier is in talks with Boeing about what to do with those planes between July and October, because several are now parked at the periphery of Boeing’s 737 factory in Rentonh. Norwegian, meanwhile, plans to take delivery of a half-dozen new 737 MAX this year and then deploy them for trans-Atlantic service, though it hasn’t revealed which routes or a time frame. The European carrier has been focused on smaller airports in the Northeast U.S., bypassing the large metropolitan hubs.

Boeing has been ramping up production of JDAMs at its plant in St. Charles. Photo courtesy of Boeing. ST. LOUIS • On a stage at Boeing, a charismatic Air Force pilot dressed in a flight suit told an auditorium full of executives, engineers and suppliers how impressed he was with the precision-guided bombs they help make. “I have been fortunate or unfortunate — depending on how you think about it — to employ these in training and combat,” said Maj. Mike “Pako” Benitez. He was speaking about joint direct attack munition, or JDAM, which converts conventional “dumb” bombs into guided “smart” bombs. The computerized tail fin kits are slapped onto warheads weighing 500, 1,000 and 2,000 pounds. Fitted with GPS, the $25,000 gizmos make bombs so accurate pilots like to say they can drive in nails from far away. The air-to-surface munitions have dramatically changed war since production began in the late 1990s beside the Missouri River in St. Charles. The military needed a coordinate-seeking bomb that could be dropped during all weather conditions with minimal collateral damage, for example, on a row of apartments in a metropolitan area. Boeing answered with JDAMs, which are being used a lot today, as coalition forces rely much less on ground troops and more on airstrikes in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. The meeting this week between operators and builders was called to celebrate a production milestone and to mark a new goal to make 36,500 JDAMs a year, up from 8,000 in mid-2015. As Benitez explained, once released from his fighter jet, it takes about 30 seconds — as long as he can hold his breath — for the JDAM to glide five miles to the fixed target. Lasers are used on the devices to hit moving objects. “There’s a lot of things that run through my mind having that great responsibility to employ this weapon on a particular target,” said Benitez, about to draw applause. “The one thing I have never thought about is if the JDAM will work.” To demonstrate in his presentation, Benitez narrated the scene of a silent video playing on an overhead screen. A coalition convey had been shot at in Afghanistan. Smoke from an artillery round marked the enemy position way up on a hilltop. An enormous explosion eliminated the threat. Playing the video back in slow motion, the glimpse of a 2,000-pound black dart was seen piercing the skyline at 750 feet per second. The pilot chose to detonate the bomb about 20 feet above ground, to cover more area. The blast unleashed a 700-ton-per-square-inch punch of molten metal at its center point that burned to 7,000 degrees. Benitez turned to the silent crowd of 70 people. “And that is what you guys do,” he said. Rebuilding stockpiles Boeing recently announced that it had made 300,000 JDAMs in the past two decades. They were sold to 28 countries, but the U.S. government is the largest customer, having dropped 60,000 of them in combat. “It is by far the weapon of choice,” Brig. Gen. Shaun Q. Morris, in charge of all munitions fired from the air for the U.S. Air Force, told the Post-Dispatch. But he said it had been used in excess of production. In 2016 alone, the Air Force dropped about 15,000 JDAMs. Last weekend, he said, 243 were used, some of them against jihadist in Mosul. A New York Times report from a photographer embedded with the Iraqi Army seemed to speak to this. “Though much of the worst fighting was over, the soldiers were still on alert for suicide car bombers, a fear well founded,” wrote Ivor Prickett. “Occasionally, a radio would crackle with news that a car bomber had been spotted nearby. After a few tense minutes, we would hear the sound of a missile fired by a coalition warplane and the car exploding.” A French television news report showed footage of a tunnel system the Iraqi Army discovered. Militants had spray painted on the walls as a reminder: “Watch out for jets.” One week earlier, two B-2 stealth bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base in western Missouri flew half way across the globe, with the help of multiple aerial refueling tankers, to hit desert targets in Libya with about 100 JDAMs, killing a reported 80 Islamic militants. In 1999, B-2s from Missouri were the first to use JDAMs in combat when they dropped the munitions during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. In May, Boeing won a $3.2 billion contract to make JDAM guidance kits for the U.S. government through September 2020. Production goals are expected to reach 150 a day by July, up from 40 a day less than two years ago. “We expect to sustain that rate for some amount of time, not only to support ongoing operations but also to rebuild our stockpiles,” Morris said. Evolution of bombs, holy war Eliot Cohen, former Counselor of the U.S. State Department, said the military was in a new era of warfare that was about routine and relatively cheap precision.

Our land forces may have drawn down, but effectively we are the Iraqi and Afghan air forces, as well as our own.” Paul Rogers, who teaches in the department of peace studies at Bradford University in England, warned that radical religious movements could be impermeable to smart bombs. For instance, a former most-wanted terrorist in Iraq was killed by a precision-guided bomb in 2006. At the time, Al-Qaeda in Iraq confirmed his death, yet it vowed to continue its “holy war.” “We want to give you the joyous news of the martyrdom of the mujahed sheik Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,” their statement said then. “In the short term, it appears to work, ISIS is in retreat,” Rogers said about JDAMs’ being dropped more recently in Mosul. “But what will probably happen is they will tend to go underground and not engage in open conflict and be subject to air raids. They will probably put more of a focus on staging attacks overseas, as they have been doing in Europe and other places.” Mistakes and collateral damage still happen. In 2½ years of coalition airstrikes in Libya, Iraq and Syria, an estimated 2,300 civilians have been killed, according to Airwars, which tracks the numbers. U.S. government estimates are much lower. Still, precision-guided munitions are significantly more accurate than free fall “dumb” bombs. JDAMs are tested to 95 percent accuracy — striking within 30 feet of the intended target. By comparison, most of the 2.7 million tons of bombs the Allies dropped on Europe in World War II missed their marks. According to an exhaustive government report, only 20 percent of daytime “precision” raids fell within the 1,000-foot target area “What JDAM gives us in a level of precision with the ability to minimize collateral damage, which really, in today’s warfare, are complete imperatives,” Morris said. “The only drawback we have today is we don’t have enough of them.” Greg Coffey, director of JDAM programs at Boeing, said during a tour of the nondescript assembly plant in St. Charles that they were currently running two shifts and didn’t anticipate hiring more employees to meet the higher production goals. The $105 billion air and space behemoth wouldn’t say how many people worked there. “We will grow to whatever the demand of the customer is,” he said.

Military U.S. defense secretary orders review of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program Most lethal fighter in Navy history reaches the fleet The Navy made aviation history (November 3rd, 2014) as an F-35C Lightning II carrier variant Joint Strike Fighter conducted its first arrested landing aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68) off the coast of San Diego. The Navy made aviation history (November 3rd, 2014) as an F-35C Lightning II carrier variant Joint Strike Fighter conducted its first arrested landing aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68) off the coast of San Diego. Carl PrineContact Reporter Taming two of President Donald Trump’s pet peeves in one move, the Pentagon has ordered military leaders to find ways to drive down the costs of both the maligned Joint Strike Fighter and proposed replacement jetliners for the Air Force One program. Announced Friday but issued on Thursday by new Secretary of Defense James Mattis, the pair of memorandums instructs the armed forces to reopen reviews into Lockheed Martin’s $1.5 trillion Lightning II strike fighter and Boeing’s $3.7 billion replacement plan for the two jets used to ferry the president around the world.       In a stream of tweets and in closed meetings with Lockheed Martin and Boeing executives, Trump has squabbled over the proposed costs for both procurement programs, but the project that remains most important to America’s defense needs in the 21st century is the Joint Strike Fighter, which is designed within the military as the F-35. Lockheed Martin plans to build 2,443 of the fighters for the Navy, Air Force and Marines, plus 741 more for foreign partners such as Denmark and the United Kingdom.  On Jan. 11, the defense giant delivered its 200th F-35, which come in three varieties. The Air Force’s F-35A uses a conventional runway.  The F-35Bs bound for the Marines can take off and land vertically from a ship or a battlefield.  The F-35Cs are slated for both the Navy and Marines because they deploy from carriers. The Mattis memo urged the Pentagon to find ways to “significantly reduce costs” for all three fighter variants but took aim at the F-35C, the most troubled line of Joint Strike Fighters.  He asked reviewers to consider whether Boeing’s non-stealthy and less technologically advanced F-18 E/F Super Hornet could be upgraded to “provide a competitive, cost-effective” alternative to Lockheed Martin’s F-35C. Mattis issued his order a day after four F-35Cs landed just outside Lemoore, a sleepy farm town south of Fresno that’s been slated to host 96 more of the jets over the next decade as the Navy swaps out its aging and increasingly rickety squadrons of “legacy” F-18 Hornets and Super Hornets. The quartet of F-35Cs are the first to be permanently stationed on the West Coast, but they’re expensive — they combined to cost more than $400 million — and they’ve been dogged by technological setbacks. They can’t safely catapult from an aircraft carrier and their wings are too weak to launch air-to-air missiles.   They lack a functioning gun, air flowing across the outer casing of the engine sparks oven-hot temperatures and the fighters can suddenly roll when flying below the speed of sound. Those and scores of other serious problems pepper a recent report from the Pentagon office tasked with operational testing and evaluation of the entire F-35 program. Strategists believe that the Navy and Marine Corps need the F-35Cs because dense missile arrays, advanced pursuit fighters and other recent military innovations by China and Russia put America’s “legacy” strike fighters like the F-18s and the Marines’ Harrier II jet increasingly at risk of getting shot down over the Pacific. As a “fifth generation” plane, the F-35 is designed to sneak past enemy radar to use its highly advanced sensors to detect and destroy everything from anti-aircraft defenses to warships, but Pentagon planners believe its stealthiness, raw computing power and communications system also could turn it into a much deadlier weapon. Think of it as part of a basketball team on a fast break.  It can become a swift power forward who slams the ball home, or it could morph into a point guard directing all the others to the basket — although staying invisible the entire time to opposing players. Navy Cmdr. John Turner Jr., skipper of the “Rough Raiders” of Lemoore’s Strike Fighter Squadron 125, calls it the “Ferrari” of fighters. “It’s absolutely incredible.  With its fifth generation stealth capabilities, and the avionics that it brings, it’s exactly what carrier strike groups need to continue its lethality,” he said. Vice Adm. Michael Shoemaker, the Navy’s “Air Boss” who controls all of the service’s air forces, said that the arrival of the four F-35Cs to Turner’s squadron is “a big deal” and he’s already brainstorming how they will be used against potential enemies. “It could do everything, from dropping mines to all the high end warfighting capabilities that I expect from the F-35, but we don’t have the time, bandwidth or the money to train a pilot to do all of those mission sets,” said Shoemaker, a Navy strike pilot decorated for his valor in combat.  “So I want them focused on high end mission sets. There are third- and fourth-generation missions that we’ve got the (F-18 E/F Super Hornet) to do and there are fifth generation missions I want to keep F-35 focused on.” Shoemaker believes that he’ll have a fully operational F-35C squadron in Lemoore by 2020 -- a prediction echoed by Rear Adm. Roy Kelley, chief of the Navy’s Joint Strike Fighter Fleet Integration Office inside the Pentagon. A Hornet pilot decorated for valor, Kelley now fights bureaucratic battles on behalf of the Navy while helping to fix glitches with the fighter alongside defense and industry leaders. “Being able to be the voice of the program for our program, the F-35C, is important,” said Kelley.  “It’s allowed us to make sure that in the middle of a conversation we’re able to voice our opinions.  I can say, ‘Hey, here’s the issue with what you’re trying to do.’ And if it’s a problem for us, we can bring it out and we can work through it.” If called to battle today, Shoemaker insists that his fleet of workhorse F-18 Hornets and Super Hornets, plus the highly advanced electronic warfare EA-18G Growler, would win a war in the skies of Asia, but the day is soon coming when he will need to field the F-35C as the lead strike aircraft. The Marines need it even sooner.  Two Marine F-35B squadrons are marked operational and one of them has been forward deployed to Japan, but in order to keep its legacy strike fleet flying the Corps had to buy scrapped Harrier II jets from Britain to cannibalize for spare parts. “Marine aviation kind of bottomed out around the 2013 time frame,” said William E. Taylor, the Marines’ assistant deputy commandant for aviation.   The former helicopter attack pilot called the problems with the Harrier and Hornet strike fighter fleet “systemic,” caused by wear and tear and corrosion on aging planes that flew too many hours providing air support to ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  “We’re about two years into a six-year readiness recovery plan,” said Taylor. “We’ve shown over the past two years positive results but it’s slow and painful.  We’re hoping to recover and get to where our objective is by 2020.” The F-35Cs are part of that solution, but August test flights aboard the flat top George Washington revealed “vertical oscillations” during catapult launches that were so “excessive” and “violent” that they threaten to make the jet “operationally unsuitable for carrier operations,” according to the recent Pentagon report. Lockheed Martin assembled a “red team” of Navy and industry experts who continue to go “very systematically through the aircraft” to ferret out the gremlins, said Jeff A. Babione, the company’s executive vice president in charge of the F-35 program. “We don’t have an answer yet, but I’m encouraged by what I see and that testing should begin next month” at the Naval Air Engineering Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, he said. Navy officials told the Union-Tribune that Lockheed Martin already cured several technological headaches raised in the Pentagon report, including an abnormal “green glow” inside the pilots’ top secret helmets discovered during carrier night operations. To slash the F-35C’s cost, Lockheed Martin’s Babione said that the Pentagon should place larger block orders, which would allow the company to negotiate cheaper prices with part suppliers. “Economies of scale generate reductions in price,” he said. “It happens when you buy commodities.  It happens when you buy fighter jets.  Making sure that we continue to add more and more airplanes and maintain that learning curve — that’s absolutely important.” Dan Grazier, a defense expert at the Project On Government Oversight nonprofit in Washington, urged Trump instead to halt F-35 production until the Pentagon finishes initial operational testing. Taxpayers, he said, are on the hook to buy 798 F-35s before Lockheed Martin has proved they can fly into battle. “To give us a really clear picture of the combat capabilities of the F-35, we’re looking at delays into the mid-2020s now,” said Grazier, a former Marine armor officer who fought in Afghanistan.  “When you consider that the origins of this program go back to 1993, here we are in 2017 and we still don’t know at all if this thing is ever going to be really ready for combat.  That’s really saying something about this whole program. “If we agree to this block buy, they’re promising us a discount — essentially, the Costco price for the F-35. But those savings are fake. What’s going to end up happening is they they’ll knock a few million dollars off the purchase price of each plane, but we’ll end up paying later because these immature planes we buy now will have to be sent back to be modified to integrate subsequent changes.” The Mattis F-35C memo didn’t set a deadline for when the F-35C review should finish but indicated it will begin immediately so that its findings can be used to inform “upcoming budget decisions.” Caption One major obstacle to U.S. military cooperation with Russia A National Defense Authorization Act provision prohibits military cooperation until Russia stops its occupation and aggression toward Ukraine.

REUTERS/Alwyn Scott WASHINGTON Boeing Co (BA.N) has been awarded a $2.1 billion U.S. defense contract for 15 KC-46 aerial refueling aircraft, the Pentagon said on Friday. The new agreement is in addition to the initial $4.2 billion contract awarded by the Air Force to develop and test the aircraft, and an earlier $2.8 billion award for 19 planes. Boeing expects to build a substantial business from the tanker, which is based on its twin-aisle 767 commercial jet. Boeing plans to deliver 179 tankers to the U.S. Air Force and expects to sell about 400 in total worldwide. The fixed-cost contract has incurred about $2.4 billion in cost over runs, including a $201 million after-tax charge Boeing announced on Wednesday. Boeing said it expects to deliver the first tankers to the Air Force in late 2017. On Wednesday, Boeing posted fourth quarter profits and operating cash that beat analysts' estimates and said it expected to generate a record $10.75 billion in operating cash this year.

The Boeing Black phone was specifically built to handle Top Secret information and, it is claimed, has been given to Donald Trump. However, confusion surrounds which handset the President is actually using.  Scroll down for video   It's the high-tech, secretive phone given to the incoming president – but it seems President Donald Trump may still being using his unsecured Samsung Galaxy. The Boeing Black phone was specifically built to handle Top Secret information and self-destruct  BOEING BLACK PHONE  The Boeing Black phone encrypts calls and is specifically designed for government agencies and others that need to keep communications and data secure. The dual-sim phone supports GSM, WCDMA and LTE for high speed data. It has a 4.3inch screen The handset also comes with USB , Wifi and Bluetooth. It will run a secure version of Google's Android software.   And it will self-destruct if someone tampers with it in order to keep Top Secrete data from falling into the wrong hands. On November 1, Lynn and President Obama were the first two, maybe even the only two, who received a Black Boeing phone, claims Patrick Tucker with Defense One. Tucker this week contacted the DISA asking if Obama's Boeing Black phone had been handed off to Trump. But the official's only response was that the phone 'goes with the office of that position'.  Before taking the oath of office on January 20, President Donald Trump was at first believed to have handed over his personal Android phone. The New York Times reported President Trump swapped his personal phone for a 'secure, encrypted device approved by the Secret Service with a new number that few people possess.' But it seems the story has since changed. Six days later, The New York Times published another article that included evidence that the President is still using his Samsung Galaxy. 'Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, went back to New York on Sunday night with their 10-year-old son, Barron, and so Mr. Trump has the television — and his old, unsecured Android phone, to the protests of some of his aides — to keep him company,' reported Maggie Haberman with The Times.

It encrypts calls and is specifically designed for government agencies and others that need to keep communications and data secure. The phone uses dual SIM cards to enable it to access multiple cell networks and can be configured to connect with biometric sensors and satellites. And the Department of Defense Information Networks head Lt. Gen. Alan Lynn confirmed the Boeing Black works with 'a large amount of encryption.' Many Android users know that their smartphones can be hacked at any moment, which makes many security experts worry about Trumps decision to keep his phone close. The New York Times published an article stating: 'Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, went back to New York on Sunday night with their 10-year-old son, Barron, and so Mr. Trump has the television — and his old, unsecured Android phone, to the protests of some of his aides — to keep him company (Pictured is Trump campaigning in 2016) 'This is a consumer device, and it's going to have security vulnerabilities,' Bruce Schneier, an internationally renowned security technologist, shared in a blog post. 'He's at risk from everybody, ranging from lone hackers to the better-funded intelligence agencies of the world. And while the risk of a forged e-mail is real — it could easily move the stock market — the bigger risk is eavesdropping. 'That Android has a microphone, which means that it can be turned into a room bug without anyone's knowledge. That's my real fear.' However, experts like Schneier might be able to sleep better at night knowing Trump was just using the Boeing Black phone. The system works by using the handset to access a remote server on the military's Top Secret JWICS network. The phone itself just send keyboard, mouse and other signals to the 'real' server. said Lynn: 'We're not too worried about losing data,' at least not off the phone,' aid Lynn. He also admitted he thought his boss liked that handset. On November 1, Lynn and President Obama were the first two, maybe even the only two, who received a Black Boeing phone, reports Patrick Tucker with Defense One . Tucker contacted the DISA asking if Obama's Boeing Black phone had been handed off to Trump. But the official's only response was that the phone 'goes with the office of that position'  'I think he does,' he told Defense One in a November interview. 'Haven't heard any complaints.' 'The phone will be sold primarily to government agencies and companies engaged in contractual activities with those agencies that are related to defense and homeland security,' Boeing says. It plans to limit the sale of the device to 'approved' buyers. 'The device will be marketed and sold in a manner such that low level technical and operational information about the product will not be provided to the general public.' Even if approved, buyers will have to sign an agreement agreeing to keep their details of the phone secret. WHAT COULD BE IN THE PHONE  A researcher from the University of  Maryland revealed other features and technology that could be included in President Donald Trump's official phone. One level of protection is what is called 'security by obscurity.'  Many people presumably had Trump's pre-presidential phone number.  Now, relatively few people will have his new number.   'Trusted Platform Module' is included that notifies authorities if phone has been tampered with. The phone may only be able to connect with certain predetermined phone and data networks that are regularly screened against intrusions. Limiting its contact with the internet would be key. Trump's phone likely has some degree of customization such as a unique operating system. The apps allowed on the president's phone should be few and limited only to those verified in advance.   Separately encrypting the memory spaces used by each app can boost security further. Perhaps the phone's microphone and camera could be shut off, and any active Twitter link disconnected, if the phone itself is in the Oval Office, and whenever the president is meeting with members of his national security team.  'Specifically designates and protects as 'proprietary information' the components, hardware, Product Software, applications, functionalities, or internal structure or workings of the Product provided by Seller, including without limitation those that can be obtained by disassembling or opening the Product or its software or components.' 'There are no serviceable parts on Boeing's Black phone and any attempted servicing or replacing of parts would destroy the product. 'The Boeing Black phone is manufactured as a sealed device both with epoxy around the casing and with screws, the heads of which are covered with tamper proof covering to identify attempted disassembly. 'Any attempt to break open the casing of the device would trigger functions that would delete the data and software contained within the device and make the device inoperable.'  Blackberry confirmed the existence of the project in 2015- but refused to reveal any more information. The FCC filing reveal very little about the phone - other than its shape and the fact it will take two sim cards. The system works by using the handset to access a remote server on the military's Top Secret JWICS network 'We're pleased to announce that Boeing is collaborating with BlackBerry to provide a secure mobile solution for Android devices utilizing our BES 12 platform,' BlackBerry's CEO John Chen said on a conference call held to discuss its quarterly results in 2015. 'That, by the way, is all they allow me to say.'  The Boeing Black device encrypts calls and is aimed at government agencies and others that need to keep communications and data secure.  It uses dual SIM cards to enable it to access multiple cell networks and can be configured to connect with biometric sensors and satellites.  Lynn confirmed the Boeing Black works with 'a large amount of encryption.' However, he said it was its ability to keep data on servers rather than on the handset that made it attractive. 'There's nothing that lives on the devices,' he explained. The system works by using the handset to access a remote server on the military's Top Secret JWICS network.  The phone itself just send keyboard, mouse and other signals to the 'real' server. said Lynn: 'We're not too worried about losing data,' at least not off the phone,' aid Lynn. He also admitted he thought his boss liked that handset.  'I think he does,' he told Defence One. 'Haven't heard any complaints.' It also reveals that the handset will be completely sealed, and any attempt to open it will destroy the phone and delete all the data on it.

Shakespeare, 86, pilot and engineer Jan 27 Evesham school official widens defamation suit, blames mayor for lost job offer Jan 25 More from David O'Reilly Arrow icon Charles B. Shakespeare of Moorestown, a pilot and engineer who designed helicopters and several innovative medical devices, died Jan. 21 of multiple myeloma at Samaritan Healthcare and Hospice in Mount Holly. He was 86. Starting as a young man Mr. Shakespeare worked for the Boeing Corp., where he helped to develop the fast, heavy-lifting, twin-rotor Chinook helicopter that played a major role in the United States’ involvement in the Vietnam War. He later worked for several medical technology design firms, where he played leading roles in developing a blood cell analyzer, a wearable heart monitor, and ultrasound devices. In junior high school he took up the tuba, but at Lower Merion High School, “Charlie” discovered the wind instrument that would be his truest love: the airplane. He took on several after-school jobs to pay for flying lessons and earned his pilot’s license while still a teenager. In 1949 he entered Lehigh University, where he joined Air Force ROTC and earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. After graduating in 1953, he married June Aletha Culp, then entered the Air Force. As the Korean War raged on a distant continent, he found himself stationed in Munich, where he piloted A-26 light bombers in a tow-target squadron. After completing his military service in 1955, he began work for the Boeing plant in Ridley Park,  which would win a contract to develop a new class of large, versatile transport helicopter for the U.S. Army. Mr. Shakespeare became a senior engineer on the project, and the Chinook — which is still in production — would prove one of history’s most successful aeronautic designs. “He felt he had his dream job: a pilot and an engineer,” his second wife, Kathleen Magee Shakespeare, recalled last week. But as Mr. Shakespeare grew opposed to America’s role in the Vietnam War, he came to regret his role in the Chinook’s creation, she said, and in 1968 quit Boeing to turn his attention to medical technology. He also took part in civil rights demonstrations because, she said, “he was passionate about social justice.” His daughter by his first marriage, Hannah Shakespeare, recalled that her parents would often co-sign for the mortgages of African-American couples who could not get mortgages from banks. “They had a lot of people indebted to them,” she said, “by which I mean grateful.” Their marriage ended in divorce in 1978. As head of engineering at Geometric Data, a division of Smith, Kline & French Laboratories, Mr. Shakespeare led the development of the automated differential blood analyzer, according to the family. In the 1970s he departed Geometric to found Aegis Medical Systems of Mount Laurel, which pioneered and marketed an innovative wearable electrocardiogram. In 1981 Mr. Shakespeare remarried, and in 1987 started at the Interspec Corp., where he participated in the development of ultrasound imaging devices. In 1994. he became head of engineering at Spectrasonics Imaging of Wayne and developed electronics that allowed imagining systems to distinguish various kinds of prostate cancer. “When he arrived with us, he was already a senior individual, but he kept up with the technology in what is usually a young man’s business, said Richard Bernardi, Spectrasonics’ president. “He was a very pleasant individual. A very good engineer and a very good manager of people and projects.”     Throughout his life he continually took to the skies, typically by flying his own glider out of Beltsville, Pa., and as recently as last year. He also was a maker of “gorgeous” wood furniture, according to his wife, who said that after retiring from Spectrasonics in 2008, he took up once again the the first wind instrument of his youth, the tuba. He started played with a Moorestown troupe called “Bob’s Bandits,” and took particular delight in playing at the annual Christmas Tuba Concert at the Kimmel Center. A lifelong Democrat who served for many years on his party’s township committee, he once joked with his wife that he wanted his funeral to be a “Democratic party.”   In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by sons Joseph and Matthew and two grandchildren. Donations in his memory may be made to Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in Camden. The family will conduct a memorial service with music for Mr. Shakespeare starting 10:30 a.m. March 4 at the Mount Laurel Home for Funerals in Mount Laurel.

(Jose Luis Magana/Associated Press) In one of his first actions at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary retired Gen. James Mattis has ordered a review of two costly programs that President Trump has pointed out as examples of wasteful government spending. In a pair of memorandums dated on Thursday, Mattis ordered Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work to initiate reviews of plans to build new presidential aircraft and another to move forward with fielding the F-35 stealth jet. [Trump suggests he would ditch F-35 in favor of cheaper plane] Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the reviews were a “prudent step” designed to assist the budget process and allocate military resources. “This action is also consistent with the president’s guidance to provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation’s defense, and it aligns with the secretary’s priority to increase military readiness while gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense,” Davis said in a statement. [The inaccuracies in Donald Trump’s Air Force One tweet] The reviews follow Trump’s criticism, before his inauguration, of the expected cost of replacing aging Air Force One planes, which are due to be supplied by U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing. While the final price of the new aircraft is not yet set, Boeing has a contract to design a pair of replacement aircraft for a cost of over $2.5 billion. Following Trump’s call to “cancel the contract,” Boeing’s leadership has promised it would build the planes for less than the $4 billion Trump estimated they would ultimately cost. Mattis’s order instructs Work to identify “means to substantially reduce the program’s costs while delivering needed capabilities.” The new Pentagon boss, who was sworn in a week ago, likewise asked Work in the second memorandum to work to determine ways to lower the cost of Lockheed Martin’s $400 billion program to build the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The plane, the U.S. military’s most expensive weapons program, has been under development for years but has been criticized for design flaws and high costs. It has not yet flown in combat. Last month, Trump complained of the F-35’s cost in a tweet and suggested he would explore replacing the plane with the F-18 Super Hornet, an older jet that is made by Boeing. Mattis’s order calls for a comparison of the two planes and an analysis of whether improvements to the Super Hornet can “provide a competitive, cost effective fighter aircraft alternative.” The Thursday memos also offered new information about which portions of the F-35 program could be the subject of cost-cutting measures. Mattis’s Thursday memo specified that the review would compare the F-35C with the F-18, whereas the president’s past tweets and statements referred to the program on the whole. The F-35A makes up 85 percent of the program and is somewhat cheaper than the F-35C because of its higher volume of production. The revelation that Boeing’s F-18 is being considered as an alternative to just the F-35C model — which makes up a very small portion of the F-35 program as a whole — negates much of the concern over Trump’s tweet that asked Boeing to “price out a comparable F-18.” “Unintentionally or intentionally, [Trump’s] tweet created more confusion in the military and aircraft universe than necessary, because it was vague,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis with Teal Group, a defense market research firm. “People who knew the program knew that was nonsense.” Trump’s comments about high-profile defense products and companies were a break from presidential custom, injecting an element of uncertainty and anxiety into the military hardware industry. They are in keeping with his public negotiations with other companies whose actions he says threaten to harm U.S. workers and consumers. The president’s public jabs at defense companies have rattled markets and sparked confusion across the industry. Defense stocks have soared as the prospect of a military buildup nudges closer to reality, but the specific companies and programs mentioned in Trump’s tweets have seen sharp fluctuations at each mention. News of the Pentagon review caused stock prices at both Lockheed Martin and Boeing to drop by about 1 percent. Defense companies have sought to play down the president’s desire to slash programs and have instead repeatedly suggested changes to procurement regulations as a way to cut costs. “We welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with the Trump administration. We are focused on providing the armed forces with needed capabilities at the best possible value,” Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an email. “Lockheed Martin stands ready to support Secretary Mattis’ review of the F-35 program and welcomes the appropriate focus on affordability and capability,” Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said in an email. “We also believe there are opportunities to continue to drive down program costs by using sound buying practices.” Any modification to the F-35 program has the potential to affect not just the company that assembles the plane, but also an extensive network of suppliers spanning at least 45 states. The chairman of BAE Systems, which services the F-35 program, hinted at the president’s plans in an interview with Bloomberg Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We’ve been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period,” said BAE Chairman Roger Carr. “We respect that and we’ll work towards a contribution towards that.” world national-security checkpoint Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

At a kilometre long and 500m wide, the building is the largest in the world by volume. The 28,000 plus employees are encouraged to make use of the 450 tricycles to get around, and stop off at six diners and coffee shops to fuel their journey. On any given day, 20,000 meals are served at the “Dreamliner Diner”, “Twin Aisle Cafe” and “Queen of the Skies” eatery, along with Tully’s coffee shops. Divided into various sections dedicated to different aircraft types, the factory operates 24/7 and uses no central heating or airconditioning.

Here magic is created, in the form of mammoth machines that carry hundreds of passengers each time they takeoff. Parts are sourced from all over the world including Australia, Italy, Korea and Japan and put together with painstaking precision. Those made of composite are coated with a white gel for the construction process and aluminium planes, like the 747 have a green protective coating before the livery is applied.

Picture: Robyn IronsideSource:Supplied There is some automation — in the form of driverless vehicles that deliver tool kits to the engineers and mechanics — but mostly the factory relies on hands on expertise to complete the high tech machines to Boeing’s specifications and those of the airline customer. Every few days a shiny new aircraft is completed and shunted out for testing by Boeing’s own pilots before being handed over to their new owners. Australian airlines have made many visits to the factory and in October, Qantas will return to take delivery of its first 787-9 Dreamliner. The 236-seat aircraft will be among the 84 787-9s completed at the factory this year. The same number of 777s and about six new 747s are also built in a 12-month period, and work is about to begin on the newest Boeing model — a 777X. Although staff are not allowed access to Wi-Fi and there are strict controls on mobile phones, the factory operates public tours — which bring in 300,000 people a year. Restricted to the upper deck of the cavernous space, public visitors must also surrender their phones — such is the concern about the theft of Boeing’s secrets. World’s biggest collection of brand new aircraft — fresh from the Boeing factory and awaiting testing before delivery. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Nevertheless, factory tours are the most popular tourist activity in Washington State, with visitors eager to explore the home of one of the world’s best known brands. The 90-minute tours cost $33 for adults and $20 for youths aged 15 and under. As well as the factory, the price includes the Future of Flight Aviation Center overlooking the mega warehouse and the aircraft testing area where the largest collection of brand new planes can be seen.

The change means a further shrinking of the already slim orderbook for the 747-8. Most of the new variant 747s ordered to date have been the -8 freighter version, as airlines increasingly turn to “big twins” for long-haul passenger services. Boeing has reduced the 747-8 production rate to 0.5 aircraft a month as it fulfills remaining orders. Arik Air’s order for the 747-8I dates back to 2011. The two 787-9s are worth $529 million at book value. A regional source, who requested not to be identified, told ATW the 787-9 “makes much better sense” than the 747-8I for Arik Air, notably on routes to the US and UK. Boeing said the delivery dates were a matter for the customer; an Arik Air representative said she did not have that information, but understood deliveries were “not imminent.” According to Arik Air’s website, the Nigerian flag carrier’s long-haul fleet comprises two Airbus A340-500s and two A330-200s. Its short- to medium-haul services are operated by a mixed batch of 10 Boeing 737-700s and -800s, while regional routes are operated by four Bombardier CRJ900s, a single -1000 and two Q400s.

More About: Trump and Manufacturing Getty Images Advertisement U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has ordered reviews of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and plans for Boeing Co. to build new Air Force One presidential aircraft, two high-profile contracting programs that President Donald Trump has singled out for criticism. Mattis issued the reviews in order to “inform programmatic and budgetary decisions, recognizing the critical importance of each of these acquisition programs,” Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement Friday. “This action is also consistent with the president’s guidance to provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation’s defense.” In December, Trump tweeted that F-35 costs are “out of control,” and this month he boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” without identifying which projects he was referring to. Trump extracted general promises to cut costs on the F-35 and on the new Air Force One after meetings with the chief executive officers of the companies, which are the two biggest U.S. government contractors. The F-35 is the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons program, at a projected cost of $379 billion, although defense officials under former President Barack Obama maintained that the program’s days of unending overruns and delays were past.

Presidential Aircraft “We have been responsive in providing information to the Trump administration and we look forward to continuing that dialogue as this process moves forward,” Todd Blecher, a Boeing spokesman, said in a phone interview. A Lockheed representative didn’t respond to a request for comment. Lockheed fell 1.1% to $252.17 at 2:51 p.m. New York time. Boeing declined 1% to $167.45. For Air Force One, Mattis said the review will identify how to “substantially reduce the program’s costs.” The Pentagon has budgeted $3.2 billion through fiscal 2021 for research and development, construction and acquisition of two of the aircraft used by presidents, with more spending anticipated after that, according to Kevin Brancato, a government contracting analyst with Bloomberg Government. The plane itself is a relatively small portion of the cost, he said. Air Force One planes are flying fortresses, outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses. F-35 Alternative In a memorandum on the F-35, Mattis said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to “determine opportunities to significantly reduce the cost” of the fighter jet, saying it should begin immediately. Mattis’s directive gives Boeing a chance--even if it’s a long-shot--to reenter a program it lost to Lockheed in 2001, when its candidate for a stealthy fighter was passed over. The new defense secretary ordered a study of whether Boeing’s older F/A-18 Super Hornet could be upgraded to provide a less costly alternative to the Navy version of the F-35. The deputy defense secretary “will oversee a review that compares F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assesses the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements (an advanced Super Hornet) can be made in order to provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative,” Mattis said in his directive. The Navy version of the F-35 is easier to target than those tailored for the Air Force and Marine Corps because it’s not scheduled to become operational until February 2019.  Relative Stealthiness While the F-35 has advantages over the Boeing plane, such as its greater stealth capabilities, that’s not always necessary, said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies. “The value you get for the F-35 on a maintenance basis and the differentials that you get relative to range, payload and speed don’t always warrant it being the first choice,” he said in a telephone interview. Under current plans, the Pentagon is scheduled to increase purchases of the F-35 in the coming fiscal year 2018 budget to 70 from 63 this year. Then, the number would grow to 80 in fiscal 2019. There’s also a pending “block buy” of 450 aircraft in the coming years as the Pentagon seeks a total fleet of 2,443, including 1,763 for the Air Force. Michael Gilmore, the recently departed director of the Pentagon’s testing office, said in a memo this month to senior Pentagon leaders that the Trump administration should “rigorously and comprehensively review” the F-35. He cited the fighter’s “significant, well-documented deficiencies in critical combat capabilities.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

An F-35C Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet prepares to make its first-ever landing on the Nimitz aircraft carrier off the coast of San Diego on Nov. 3, 2014. (Don Bartletti / Los Angeles Times) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter Defense Secretary James Mattis has ordered reviews of the Air Force One and F-35 fighter jet programs, two projects that have frequently been in President Trump’s crosshairs. Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said Friday that Mattis ordered separate reviews of both programs to “inform programmatic and budgetary decisions,” as well as his “recommendations to the president regarding critical military capabilities.” In a Thursday memo to the deputy secretary of Defense, Mattis said the review would look for opportunities to “significantly reduce” the cost of the F-35 program while still meeting requirements. As part of that, Mattis said a parallel review would compare the operational capabilities of the F-35C for the Navy, which is designed to withstand the stress of landing on carriers, with the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. This review would determine whether improvements could be made to an advanced Super Hornet that would provide a “competitive, cost-effective fighter aircraft alternative” to the F-35, the memo said.

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program can’t seem to escape the crosshairs of President-elect Donald Trump. In his first news conference since the election, Trump on Wednesday slammed the aircraft program, saying it is “way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.” He... (Samantha Masunaga) A separate memo from Mattis ordered a review of the Air Force One program to determine whether costs could be cut. Both programs have connections to Southern California. Boeing Co., which builds the iconic presidential 747 aircraft, has several hundred suppliers in the U.S. that support the 747 program. One of the largest is Triumph Aerostructures, which assembles the 747's center fuselage panels in Hawthorne. Northrop Grumman Corp. operates an El Segundo facility that produces fuselages for Boeing’s F/A-18. More than 100 Southern California suppliers provide parts and software for the F-35’s builder, Lockheed Martin Corp. Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement, “We welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with the Trump administration.” Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., said it was ready to support the review. “We are confident such a thorough and objective analysis will show that only the F-35, with its advanced stealth and sensors, can meet the 21st century air superiority requirements of all of our military services,” the company said in a statement. Since December, Trump has targeted the costs of both the Air Force One and F-35 programs in tweets and speeches. He has met with both Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s chief executives since then. But pitting an advanced Super Hornet against the F-35 is not a new idea. The U.S. Navy has been buying Super Hornets in greater numbers than the F-35 for years, said Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst for the Teal Group. The first F/A-18s flew in the 1980s, and proved their worth in the 1990s during Operation Desert Storm. “It’s been the reality for some time,” he said.  The F-35 has three variants to fit the needs of the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. The Air Force version is the most common type, with many planes going to U.S. allies. The U.S. Navy is the predominant customer for the F-35C, Aboulafia said.

At the same time, Mattis ordered a similar review of the $4 billion cost for developing a new aircraft for the US president, Air Force One, the ultra-high-tech and secure 747 built by Boeing. "The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is a critical acquisition program that warrants a detailed assessment to reduce associated program costs," Mattis said in the order. He said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to find ways "to significantly reduce the cost" while ensuring the new jets, which cost about $100 million each, meet US defense needs. He said the review should also compare the F-35 with the Boeing-built F-18 Super Hornet fighter to see if the latter, which costs significantly less, can meet US needs. In December, Trump assailed both the F-35 and Air Force One programs as overly costly, and after that met with the chief executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to try to extract savings. "The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases," Trump said on Twitter at the time. - Lockheed shares sink - The first 200 F-35s of a program that envisions some 2,450 ultimately being acquired by the different US armed services have been delivered. The aircraft have also been sold to Israel, with the first two delivered in December. Proponents tout the F-35's radar-dodging stealth technology, supersonic speeds, close air-support capabilities, airborne agility and a massive array of sensors giving pilots unparalleled access to information. But the program has faced numerous setbacks, including a mysterious engine fire in 2014 that led commanders to ground planes until the problem could be resolved. News of Mattis' order sent Lockheed shares tumbling. They were trading up about 1.0 percent before the announcement; dropping 1.0 percent at $252.18 afterward. Boeing shares fell in early trade and were off 0.9 percent after the announcement. Lockheed said in a statement that it "welcomes" Mattis's review and its focus on costs. The company said costs can be cut if the program adopts a multi-year procurement approach that would allow components to be bought on a large scale. It also argued that the F-35 is the best alternative. "We are confident such a thorough and objective analysis will show that only the F-35, with its advanced stealth and sensors, can meet the 21st century air superiority requirements of all of our military services," Lockheed said. On Tuesday, Lockheed chief executive Marillyn Hewson sought to assuage shareholders by saying the new president's objective is not "about slashing our profits." "We understand his concerns about affordability and we certainly share that," she said in a conference call with analysts. "It's about how do we get the costs down today and in the future."

Sneaker-like boots, and a hoodie for a helmet. And plenty of Velcro. Those are among the features of the spacesuit astronauts will wear aboard Boeing CST-100 Starliner capsules flying from Cape Canaveral to the International Space Station, possibly in the summer of 2018. The company earlier this week unveiled a new launch-and-entry suit inside a former shuttle hangar at Kennedy Space Center, where Boeing will assemble and refurbish Starliners. Compared to the bulky orange “pumpkin” suits worn by shuttle crews, the “Boeing blue” suits are lighter and more modern, said former astronaut Chris Ferguson, Boeing’s director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems.

Boeing’s suit, designed with the Massachusetts-based David Clark Co., weighs about 12 pounds, compared with 30 pounds for NASA’s orange suits formally called the Advanced Crew Escape Suit, or ACES. Developed as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, under which Boeing has a contract worth up to $4.2 billion, the suit is the first of several modern designs to be released. SpaceX will have its own spacesuit for crews flying from Kennedy Space Center to the International Space Station in Dragon spacecraft, possibly as soon as May 2018. NASA is modifying the ACES suit for crews expected to fly in Orion deep space capsules in the early '20s. Boeing’s suit includes boots that resemble running shoes, designed in collaboration with Reebok. White feet gradually bleed into blue pant legs that can be unzipped at the ankles. USA TODAY Boeing, SpaceX progressing toward crew launches Boxy gray pockets on the legs offer room to stow survival gear, pencils or tools. Velcro leg straps provide more places to secure gear that would otherwise float away in microgravity. Blue gloves clipped to the arms are slim and flexible enough to allow crew members to operate tablets loaded with procedures and checklists. “What the spacesuit does is create an artificial environment for them to survive until they can get safely back to land.”Chris Ferguson, former astronaut and director of Boeing’s Starliner Crew and Mission Systems In one fashion-forward flourish, blue and gray pleats line the upper arms and shoulders. Ferguson said the folds were mainly decorative, covering stitching that provides mobility when the suits are inflated. Astronauts will wear headsets for protection and communications, similar to those worn on aircraft carrier decks. Over those will be pulled a soft, blue hood and clear polycarbonate visor, rather than a hard “bubble” helmet. The hood’s front zips to the neck instead of a hard helmet fastening to a heavy metal ring. Interior flaps provide an airtight seal. The “get us home suit,” as Ferguson called it, couldn't be used for a spacewalk. It's intended to provide air and cooling to keep astronauts safe during launch and landings back on land, and during emergencies, like if a micrometeoroid strike caused a loss of cabin pressure. “Space is an unforgiving and hazardous environment,” Ferguson said. “What the spacesuit does is create an artificial environment for them to survive until they can get safely back to land.” Boeing plans to test the Starliner's launch escape system next January in New Mexico. An orbital test flight without a crew could fly by June 2018, before a two-person crew of Boeing and NASA test pilots boards that August in their new blue flight suits.

Credit: Boeing Boeing has unveiled the advanced new lightweight spacesuits that astronauts will sport as passengers aboard the company’s CST-100 Starliner space taxi during commercial taxi journey’s to and from and the International Space Station (ISS) and other low Earth orbit destinations. The signature ‘Boeing Blue’ spacesuits will be much lighter, as well as more flexible and comfortable compared to earlier generations of spacesuits wore by America’s astronauts over more than five decades of human spaceflight, starting with the Mercury capsule to the latest gear worn by Space Shuttle astronauts. “The suit capitalizes on historical designs, meets NASA requirements for safety and functionality, and introduces cutting-edge innovations,” say NASA officials. The suits protect the astronauts during both launch and reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere during the return home. Indeed Chris Ferguson, a former NASA Space Shuttle Commander who now works for Boeing as a Starliner program director, helped reveal the ‘Boeing Blue’ spacesuits during a Facebook live event, where he modeled the new suit. “We slogged through some of the real engineering challenges and now we are getting to the point where those challenges are largely behind us and it’s time to get on to the rubber meeting the road,” Ferguson said. The suits offer superior functionality, comfort and protection for astronauts who will don them when crewed Starliner flights to the space station begin as soon as next year. Astronaut Eric Boe evaluates Boeing Starliner spacesuit in mockup of spacecraft cockpit. Credits: Boeing At roughly half the weight (about 10 pounds vs. 20 pounds) compared to the launch-and-entry suits worn by space shuttle astronauts, crews look forward to wearing the ‘Boeing Blue’ suits. “Spacesuits have come in different sizes and shapes and designs, and I think this fits the Boeing model, fits the Boeing vehicle,” said Chris Ferguson, Boeing director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems and a former NASA astronaut. Among the advances cited are: • Lighter and more flexible through use of advanced materials and new joint patterns • Helmet and visor incorporated into the suit instead of detachable. The suit’s hood-like soft helmet sports a wide polycarbonate visor to give Starliner passengers better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space. • A communications headset within the helmet also helps connect astronauts to ground and space crews • Touchscreen-sensitive gloves that allow astronauts to interact with the capsule’s tablets screens overhead • Vents that allow astronauts to be cooler, but can still pressurize the suit immediately • Breathable, slip resistant boots • Zippers in the torso area will make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing • Innovative layers will keep astronauts cooler “The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive,” astronaut Eric Boe said, in a statement. “It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” The astronauts help the designers to perfect the suits very practically by wearing them inside Starliner mock-ups, moving around to accomplish tasks, reaching for the tablets screens, and climbing in and out of the capsule repeatedly, says Boe “so they can establish the best ways for astronauts to work inside the spacecraft’s confines.” Astronaut Sunni Williams puts on the communications carrier of Boeing’s new Starliner spacesuit. Credits: Boeing “The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft’s redundant life support systems,” said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. “If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don’t need a spacesuit. It’s like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed.” Boeing graphic of Starliner spacesuit features.

The inaugural flight tests are slated to begin in 2018 under contract to NASA. The procedure on launch day will be similar to earlier manned launches. But for Starliner, the capsule will launch atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket – currently being man-rated.

After reaching Space Launch Complex 41, they will take the elevator up, stride across the recently installed Crew Access Arm and board Starliner as it stands atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. The first test flight will carry a crew of two. Soon thereafter the crew size will grow to four when regular crew rotation flights to the ISS start as soon as 2019. “To me, it’s a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we’ve been,” Ferguson said. “The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft.” Boeing is currently manufacturing the Starliner spacecraft at the company’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

I assume that neither one has much in the way of radiation protection and are not meant for external EVA’s? Log in to Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) NASA unveiled its brand new blue spacesuit and it's a nod to the future. The new gear is Boeing-designed. "Lightweight. Highly mobile. Minimalist. Innovative," Boeing said of the new technology in a statement. The spacesuits will be worn by astronauts who will be on NASA mission aboard the Boeing-designed 'Starliner' spacecraft. "The 'Boeing Blue' suit will be worn by all Starliner crew members during launch, ascent and re-entry and will be customized for each crew member to maximize protection, capability and comfort," the Boeing statement added. NASA said the spacesuit is lightweight, flexible and reportedly comfortable, and includes features that will enable astronauts to use touch screen technology thanks to sensors in the finger areas of the suit. Similar to its predecessor, the suit is built with a bulb to be worn over the head that enables it to become pressurized in the event of an emergency, giving 'Boeing Blue' the iconic space exploration look.

Business Trump's Pentagon Chief Orders Review Of F-35 What is the F-35 fighter jet program? The F-35 fighter jet program is the most expensive weapons program ever with a total estimated cost of $379 billion. The F-35 fighter jet program is the most expensive weapons program ever with a total estimated cost of $379 billion. NAFEESA SYEED, TONY CAPACCIO, RICHARD CLOUGHBloomberg Defense Secretary James Mattis has ordered reviews of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, quickly drawing rebukes from members of Connecticut's congressional delegation defending the state's network of defense-related manufacturers. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement Friday that the review of the jet fighter and plans for Boeing to build new Air Force One presidential aircraft, are consistent with guidance from President Trump to "provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation's defense." U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he believes Mattis is responding to demands by the president, who made his first trip to the Pentagon Friday. "Speaking very bluntly and realistically, he had a visit from his boss today," he said. "One of the president's very few pronouncements on defense policy so far has been to express very emphatically and somewhat impulsively that there needs to be an effort to cut costs and perhaps production of the F-35." A spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, which manufactures the engine, did not immediately comment. Greg Hayes, chief executive officer of parent company United Technologies Corp., told investor analysts Wednesday that it negotiates separately from Lockheed and costs drop by about 12 percent each time production is doubled. A statement from Blumenthal, Sen. Chris Murphy and Reps. John Larson and Joe Courtney, all Democrats, said efforts are already being made to cut costs and improve efficiency and production. "Any review of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will affirm what has long been established – no aircraft in production today can compare with the Joint Strike Fighter's stealth and survivability," they said. Blumenthal said Friday he'd be surprised if a review of the F-35 concludes that its numbers should be reduced substantially. He said it is critical to U.S. superiority in the air and on the ground. Michael Gilmore, the recently departed director of the Pentagon's testing office, said in a memo this month to senior Pentagon leaders that the Trump administration should "rigorously and comprehensively review" the F-35. He cited the fighter's "significant, well-documented deficiencies in critical combat capabilities." Trump extracted general promises to cut costs on the F-35 and on the new Air Force One after meetings with the chief executive officers of the companies, which are the two biggest U.S. government contractors. The F-35 is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program, at a projected cost of $379 billion, although defense officials under former President Barack Obama maintained that the program's days of unending overruns and delays were past. "We have been responsive in providing information to the Trump administration and we look forward to continuing that dialogue as this process moves forward," Todd Blecher, a Boeing spokesman, said in a phone interview. A Lockheed representative didn't respond to a request for comment. Lockheed closed lower, at $253.50, down less than 1 percent. Boeing also declined less than 1 percent, ending the day at $167.70. For Air Force One, Mattis said the review will identify how to "substantially reduce the program's costs." The Pentagon has budgeted $3.2 billion through fiscal 2021 for research and development, construction and acquisition of two of the aircraft used by presidents, with more spending anticipated after that, according to Kevin Brancato, a government contracting analyst with Bloomberg Government. The plane itself is a relatively small portion of the cost, he said. Air Force One planes are flying fortresses, outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses. In a memorandum on the F-35, Mattis said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to "determine opportunities to significantly reduce the cost" of the fighter jet, saying it should begin immediately. Mattis' directive gives Boeing a chance -- even if it's a long-shot -- to reenter a program it lost to Lockheed in 2001, when its candidate for a stealthy fighter was passed over. The new defense secretary ordered a study of whether Boeing's older F/A-18 Super Hornet could be upgraded to provide a less costly alternative to the Navy version of the F-35. The deputy defense secretary "will oversee a review that compares F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assesses the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements (an advanced Super Hornet) can be made in order to provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative," Mattis said in his directive. The Navy version of the F-35 is easier to target than those tailored for the Air Force and Marine Corps because it's not scheduled to become operational until February 2019. While the F-35 has advantages over the Boeing plane, such as its greater stealth capabilities, that's not always necessary, said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies. "The value you get for the F-35 on a maintenance basis and the differentials that you get relative to range, payload and speed don't always warrant it being the first choice," he said in a telephone interview. Connecticut's congressional delegation criticized Trump in December for his tweets condemning the cost of the F-35 and call for an assessment of whether the Super Hornet can be an alternative to the fighter jet. Courtney said then the difference in stealth capabilities "is not even close." Under current plans, the Pentagon is scheduled to increase purchases of the F-35 in the coming fiscal year 2018 budget to 70 from 63 this year. Then, the number would grow to 80 in fiscal 2019. There's also a pending "block buy" of 450 aircraft in the coming years as the Pentagon seeks a total fleet of 2,443, including 1,763 for the Air Force.

He also ordered a study of whether Boeing’s older F/A-18 Super Hornet could be upgraded to provide a less costly alternative to the Lockheed fighter, a proposal defense analysts have said is probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. The deputy defense secretary “will oversee a review that compares F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assesses the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements (an advanced Super Hornet) can be made in order to provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative,” Mattis said in his directive.

The review of Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 program, which President Donald Trump has derided as being too expensive, would have two parts: one looking at how to cut costs, and the other determining whether Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, with improvements, could be an effective, cheaper alternative, the memo said. Costs for Lockheed Martin's F-35 program have escalated to an estimated $379 billion. The program accounted for 20 percent of the company's total revenue of $46.1 billion last year. The chances that the review would cause a major change were low, according to a report published by Byron Callan, an analyst at research firm Capital Alpha Partners. Callan said costs could be cut if requirements and the aircraft's capabilities were also relaxed. In a statement released on Friday afternoon, Lockheed Martin said it stood ready to support Mattis' review of the program, adding that the cost of the F-35 could go down if the United States and other customers committed to purchasing the planes in larger, multi-year batches. The review of the Air Force One replacement, which Trump has also called too expensive, would look at the plane's requirements and systems and identify courses of action to reduce acquisition and sustainment costs. In December, Trump extracted a promise from Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg that the cost of replacing Air Force One would not exceed $4 billion. "We're going to get it done for less than that," Muilenburg told reporters last month, "and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens." On Friday, a Boeing representative said the company has been providing information to the Trump administration for some weeks and was committed to providing equipment to the military as affordably as possible.

(The Washington Post) CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — They’ll take the elevator 175 feet above the shoreline, then march 15 steps across the platform and 13 down the grated gangplank to the double doors that open to a small white room. There the astronauts will make their final preparations, adjust their spacesuits, check their equipment, before stepping into the spacecraft. This is the walk the astronauts will take as part of the NASA’s effort to restore human spaceflights from U.S. soil by 2018, ending an ignominious hiatus that has endured since the space shuttle was retired in 2011. Now, NASA is depending on two commercial companies — Boeing and SpaceX — to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station, under contracts worth billions of dollars. Both companies have faced technical and design challenges that have forced them to push back the dates of their initial flights — delays that could prove costly. But there are growing signs that the companies are making progress, and this week Boeing provided a glimpse of what’s to come, opening up some of its new facilities here for the first time and unveiling its new spacesuit. The crew access arm extends from the newly built tower at Launch Complex 41. (Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post) A new crew tower at Launch Complex 41, the last place on Earth the astronauts will walk before stepping into the company’s Starliner spacecraft, is one example of the company’s progress. It’s a massive structure, made of 1.4 million pounds of steel, that adds yet another point to the cape’s skyline and offers a penthouse-like view of the shoreline. Boeing has also built a new mission control room at the Kennedy Space Center, with rows of computer consoles that will one day monitor the rocket’s health, its communications, fuel and navigation systems. Then there’s the sleek new blue Boeing spacesuit that, at 20 pounds, weighs 10 pounds less than the one worn by shuttle astronauts. It comes with gloves that work on touch screens and lightweight boots designed by Reebok that feel like slippers. Instead of having a huge fishbowl bubble helmet, as the shuttle astronauts’ suits did, the new suit’s helmet slips over the head like a hood. “We like to think this represents the future of what protective space gear will be,” said Chris Ferguson, a former NASA astronaut and ex-Navy fighter pilot who is now Boeing’s director of crew and mission systems. Because it’s so lightweight and flexible, Ferguson said, “it feels a lot more like a flight suit than a spacesuit.” Elon Musk’s SpaceX is designing its own suit that it has not yet been unveiled. But just across the cape, SpaceX has made visible progress with its new launch site, the historic Pad 39A that was used during the Apollo and shuttle eras. A SpaceX processing building sits next to Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Jan. 25. (Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post) That launch site, which years ago was rusting away in the salt air, has been completely renovated. Nearby, the company has built a massive rocket hangar that has the SpaceX logo emblazoned across it — a potent symbol of the private sector putting its stamp on the venerable government facility. SpaceX plans to christen the pad within days, launching the first rocket from 39A since the last shuttle mission, some six years ago. The work by SpaceX and Boeing is part of a broader effort to transform Cape Canaveral from an area once dominated by the government to what NASA calls a “multi-user spaceport,” one that is home to several commercial companies. Jeffrey P. Bezos’s Blue Origin is also leasing a launch site here. The company is building a massive 750,000-square-foot facility where it wants to build its New Glenn rocket, which it plans to fly from here by the end of the decade. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Moon Express, which is vying to land a spacecraft on the moon as part of the Google Lunar X Prize, has also had a partnership with NASA to test its lunar lander at the Kennedy Space Center. But nothing will represent the cape’s renaissance more than the return of human spaceflight from its shores. Boeing and SpaceX are competing to see which company will fly first. SpaceX says its first test flight with passengers is scheduled for May 2018. Boeing plans to make its first uncrewed flight in June 2018, with a two-person test flight in December of that year. Both companies, however, have faced delays that the NASA inspector general’s office last year warned could force NASA to buy more seats from the Russians, who currently take U.S. astronauts to the space station. The inspector general found that Russia’s price for ferrying U.S. astronauts jumped 284 percent over the past decade, growing from $21.3 million in 2006 to $81.9 million last year. In its report, the watchdog said it believed that neither company would “achieve certified, crewed flight to the ISS until late 2018.” In the past, funding shortfalls led to the delays, the inspector general said. But “technical challenges with the contractors’ spacecraft designs are now driving the schedule slippages,” it said. Boeing’s spacecraft, the Starliner, has had problems with its mass and the effects of vibrations during launch. SpaceX’s delays came when it changed its capsule design to land in the water instead of on land, it said. Boeing’s Ferguson said that “turning from the design effort to the manufacturing effort became more of a challenge than we anticipated.” The company has “slogged through some of the real engineering challenges, and now we are getting to the point where those challenges are largely behind us and it’s time to get on to the rubber meeting the road,” he said. Astronaut Sunita Williams stands on the roof of the newly built tower at Launch Complex 41. (Phelan M. Ebenhack for The Washington Post) Sunita Williams, one of four NASA astronauts chosen to fly on the first commercial flights, said she is “pumped” by the prospect of launching again from American soil. “We’re getting closer and closer,” she said. But she acknowledged that the companies still have “a long road and they have a lot to do. But I am really encouraged and excited at the pace at which both companies are taking this challenge. … Things are ticking along. It’s going to happen.” Correction: An earlier version of this post said the amount Russia charges to ferry U.S. astronauts had jumped 384 percent. It is 284 percent.

Airports and communities also court these new services. There are dozens of changes to airline routes each month. Here's a look at some of the most interesting from January. Southwest finally comes to Cincinnati Cincinnati and the Cayman Islands are in. The Ohio cites of Dayton and Akron-Canton are out. That was the shakeout as Southwest rolled out its summer flight schedule and extended its booking schedule through Aug. 14. Southwest's Cincinnati and Grand Cayman flights will each start on June 4. From Cincinnati, which had long been the biggest metro area that Southwest did not serve, Southwest will offer non-stop service to its bases at Baltimore/Washington and Chicago Midway. Southwest’s Grand Cayman service will operate from its base in Fort Lauderdale. Southwest will end all of its service to Dayton and Akron-Canton on June 3. Those destinations joined Southwest’s network after its 2010 merger with AirTran.

But Emirates’ Newark flights will not operate non-stop to its main hub in Dubai, but rather to the Greek capital of Athens. The flights will continue on to Dubai, operating with a stop in Athens in each direction. The Newark-Athens route launches March 12 and will become Emirates' second between the USA and Europe. It also flies from New York JFK to Milan. Those flights are in addition to the four daily round-trip flights Emirates operates between JFK and Dubai. FULL REPORT: Emirates to add non-stop Newark-Athens flights | ALSO ONLINE: Emirates shows off its Airbus A380 superjumbo at Washington Dulles Emirates’ U.S. rivals Delta and United each already fly non-stop to Athens from New York, but only seasonally during the summer. United serves Athens from its hub at Newark Liberty while Delta flies to Athens from its hub at New York JFK. Emirates’ non-stop connections between the USA and Europe are allowed under “fifth freedom” aviation rights granted to airlines in countries with which the United States has a liberal “Open Skies” aviation pact. Those rights allow an airline to carry passengers between two foreign cities as long as the flight continues as one-stop service to that carrier’s home-country. A number of other airlines fly fifth freedom routes from the USA, including Singapore Airlines' route between Houston and Manchester, England, and Cathay Pacific's non-stop service between New York and Vancouver.

The carrier will fly one daily round-trip flight on the Haneda route on Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. Narita is Tokyo’s primary international gateway while Haneda’s route map is more heavily tilted toward regional flights. For many travelers, Haneda is the preferred Tokyo airport because of its proximity to the city. JAL was able to add the route at slot-controlled Haneda airport by freeing up slots from another route. To make that happen, JAL’s Honolulu-Haneda route will be shifted to Narita, according to the airline.

Elements of this image furnished by NASA. (Shutterstock/Marc Ward)    5447326 Boeing unveiled its new NASA spacesuits Wednesday, and they look like something our of “Star Trek.” The new “Boeing Blue” spacesuits for the Starliner capsule weigh about 20 pounds each with all of their accessories, which is 10 pounds less than Space Shuttle suits. The suits are designed not for spacewalks, but to keep astronauts safe in the event of an emergency. “It is a lot lighter, more formfitting, and it’s simpler, which is always a good thing,” Eric Boe, a NASA astronaut, said in a statement. “Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this.” WATCH: Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg pledged in October that his company will beat billionaire Elon Musk’s rocket company SpaceX to Mars. Musk plans to send the first unmanned missions to Mars in 2018 or 2020. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at a conference.“That business model isn’t closed yet. At some point it will. The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability.” Boeing was deeply involved in NASA’s Apollo program, which sent astronauts to the moon, and is currently developing the space agency’s Space Launch System, which will eventually send U.S. astronauts to Mars. The aerospace giant is also working to build out the commercial space sector near earth as spaceflight becomes more routine.

The noticeably slimmer looking space suit is part of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, an under-construction capsule designed to transport crew to the International Space Station. SPACE CITY: NASA to display space vehicle during Super Bowl LI festivities For more than a decade, NASA has relied on Russia to transport crew to the ISS, paying roughly $70 million per seat to hitch a ride on the Soyuz spacecraft.  NASA astronauts and passengers that plan to travel to the ISS with Boeing now have a good idea of what they'll be sporting.  According to Boeing, the new space suits are about 40 percent lighter than previous suits, have touchscreen-friendly gloves, and a wide polycarbonate visor with a built-in headset. THE RED PLANET: The coolest photos from Opportunity rover's 13-year Mars mission "Spacesuits have come in different sizes and shapes and designs, and I think this fits the Boeing model, fits the Boeing vehicle," said Chris Ferguson, Boeing's director of Starliner Crew and Mission Systems and a former NASA astronaut, in a prepared statement.

Investors Should Listen To This Company's Outlook Rockwell Collins' outlook creates mixed conclusions for the industry. Here's what management said. Lee Samaha (TMFSaintGermain) Jan 27, 2017 at 10:13AM One of the largest aerospace and Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) suppliers, Rockwell Collins, Inc. (NYSE:COL), has released its first-quarter earnings and discussed its outlook for the aviation market in 2017. Let's take a look at what was said and what it means to the aviation industry and for Boeing. Rockwell Collins in 2017 Management maintained the guidance it gave in October, so no surprises there. That's all well and good, but in reality Rockwell Collins' near- to mid-term outlook will be heavily influenced by its pending acquisition of B/E Aerospace Inc. (NASDAQ:BEAV), a maker of aircraft seating and cabin interiors. Since the guidance doesn't include any assumptions regarding B/E Aerospace, the new outlook doesn't say much that investors don't already know about Rockwell Collins. Aside from the inherent uncertainty with the acquisition, there's also likely to be some competitive changes now that key rival Zodiac Aerospace has been bid for by fellow French company Safran. Bridging the gap between production of the 777 and the 777X is a key priority for Boeing Co. Image source: Boeing Co. Business jet market Turning to the industry outlook, CEO Kelly Ortberg remarked that the troubled business-jet market -- a highly cyclical industry affected heavily by business confidence -- "hasn't got any worse" but also hasn't started "to turn" as yet. However, he pointed out that customers are "generally reporting a pretty good fourth quarter" in contrast to last year. In other words, the underlying conditions are there for a business aviation recovery, and if President Trump spurs economic growth, then a turnaround could come. Commercial-jet market However, the nuance in Ortberg's outlook for the commercial aerospace cycle will greatly interest Boeing and aviation customers. Otberg expressed a "feeling" that the current order cycle won't "convert into an overall delivery cycle," meaning that the backlog created by strong commercial aircraft orders in 2013 and 2014 (see the following Boeing chart) will mean deliveries won't fall dramatically in line with the reductions in orders in 2015 and 2016. Narrow-body aircraft, such as the Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737, "are fine." Wide-body aircraft, such as Boeing's 777 and 747-8, will see continued softness, and the industry will "probably continue to see higher levels of retirements of the legacy wide-body aircraft." Conditions will improve for wide-body aircraft when the 777X (Boeing's replacement for the 777, which is expected to have its first delivery in 2020) comes "into the marketplace." Data source: Boeing Co presentations. Chart by author. What it all means Otberg's business-jet outlook isn't much of a surprise. It's a cyclical industry, and clearly the economy needs to see more growth before business confidence grows enough to encourage new business-jet orders. However, the commercial-jet outlook is interesting, because it creates mixed conclusions as the narrow-body aircraft market is set to do better than the wide-body market. On one hand, it's positive that Otberg sees sustained growth in deliveries and strength in the narrow-body aircraft market. This comes as Boeing's orders appeared to have peaked in 2014 (see the preceding chart) and as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that global airline net-tax profits will fall to $29.8 billion in 2017 from $35.6 billion in 2016. Data source: IATA. Chart by author On the other hand, Otberg's commentary with regard to continued softness in the wide-body aircgraft market would put some more pressure on Boeing if it proves to be accurate. Boeing is facing a challenge as it tries to bridge the gap between production of the 777 and the 777X. Boeing generated just 17 net orders for the 777 aircraft in 2016, forcing the company to cut to production on the 777 to five a month in August 2017, down from a rate of 8.3 a month in 2016. Given that the 777 is a highly cash-generative aircraft for Boeing, and the 777X faces increased start-up production costs, any further pressure on 777 sales could create challenges, not least for Boeing's plans to increase cash flows in the coming years. Looking ahead All told, Rockwell Collins' company-specific outlook is positive, but its year will largely be defined by how events unfold with B/E Aerospace. Meanwhile, the industry outlook is broadly positive but contains some question marks for Boeing. The aviation giant releases its earnings Jan. 25, and investors would be well advised to listen for analyst questions on 777 production and whether Boeing can grow cash flow as it prepares for the debut of the 777X in 2020.

That all changes now, and it’s thanks to Boeing’s stylish new space traveler gear. The suits are a complete rethinking of the personal life support system that astronauts have worn for decades, and they also happen to be really, really cool looking. Don't Miss: T-Mobile changes customer’s name to ‘IDIOT IDIOT’ after billing dispute Boeing’s new space suits, which the company reportedly nicknamed “Boeing Blue,” are a lot less bulky than the ones typically used by modern astronauts, and a great deal more flexible. The material used in their construction is lighter and new “joint patterns” have been engineered to facilitate more nimble movement. The traditional round dome helmet is long gone, and Boeing’s suit uses a hooded design and a pressurized zipper to provide the protection needed but with less clunkiness than the current designs. According to NASA, the new suit also has a few other tricks, including a venting system that allows water vapor to pass through while retaining air pressure, making it cooler to wear. Additionally, the integrated gloves feature touchscreen-compatible fingertips, and the new boots — which are more like athletic shoes than ever before — have been designed by the footwear gurus at Reebok. The all-new suits are expected to find their way into space in 2018 when astronauts head to the International Space Station via Boeing’s new Starliner space capsule, assuming they pass whatever tests NASA has in store between now and launch.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Read bio January 26, 2017 A military program has created an Android-based super secure smartphone that goes with the office of the President. Is Trump using it? Among the privileges and cool stuff that come with being the president of the United States is a highly modified Boeing Black smartphone, an encrypted device certified to handle Top Secret data. The Defense Department Information Systems Agency, or DISA, developed the phone with help from Boeing and other partners, the phone “goes with the office” of the President. But is Donald Trump using it — or his old and far less secure Android phone? The DISA phone emerged from the agency’s Mobility Classified Capability program. A fact sheet says the program uses “commercial mobile devices (smart phones and hotspot devices) and commercial mobile architecture components” such as commercial virtual private networking. The sheet describes the phone as “NSA-approved,” and lists “Top Secret” communication capability as “coming soon.” (The fact sheet does not mention the Boeing Black, but when Defense One asked DISA if the two were separate, an official replied, “no.”) As of November 1, DISA had handed out at least two of the phones, to President Obama and to Cyber Command leader Adm. Mike Rogers, according to DISA chief Lt. Gen. Alan Lynn, who spoke at the Milcom conference in Baltimore. Lynn was initially coy when asked who helped DISA make the device: “I don’t want everyone to know who’s making good stuff for me because there’s a lot of partners. I don’t want to just highlight one. Although I’m sure the question might have come from that one.” A moment later, he softened. “I’ll tell you who worked on the Top Secret one, Boeing did. Boeing Black is the device we’re working with.” Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. He added that DISA was “just now in the test phase of it.” Since then, DISA has become a bit shy in discussing the device. When we asked whether Obama’s Boeing Black phone had been given to Donald Trump, a DISA official, speaking on background, said only that the phone “goes with the office of that position.” Officials with White House Communications Agency, the DISA department that handles communications for the White House but is operationally independent, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A bit about the phone: In 2014, Boeing filed required paperwork with the Federal Communications Commission, and received FCC ID H8VBLK1. The filing details an Android-based, dual-sim-card phone that can switch between civilian and classified and civilian networks, including WCDMA, GSM, and LTE networking at 3G. The phone’s most important and famous feature: when you try to break it open, it self-destructs. According to the FCC filing: “Any attempt to break open the casing of the device would trigger functions that would delete the data and software contained within the device and make the device inoperable.” Boeing would not discuss how the phone has changed since those 2014 filings. But Lynn talked a bit about the agency’s numerous modifications. Almost no data resides on the phone itself, which he described as being “close to a VDI,” a virtual desktop infrastructure. That means that the phone is little more than a window into another computer somewhere else. In addition, there is “a large amount of encryption tied into it.” Is Trump using the phone that DISA made for the President? Boeing referred inquiries to DISA, who referred us to the White House, who did not answer. On Jan. 20, the Associated Press reported that Trump had surrendered his insecure Android-based Samsung Galaxy to security services. But on Thursday, the New York Times reported that the President was still using an unsecured phone: “Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, went back to New York on Sunday night with their 10-year-old son, Barron, and so Mr. Trump has the television — and his old, unsecured Android phone, to the protests of some of his aides — to keep him company.” This worries at least some security experts.  “This is a consumer device, and it’s going to have security vulnerabilities,” Bruce Schneier writes. “He’s at risk from everybody, ranging from lone hackers to the better-funded intelligence agencies of the world. And while the risk of a forged e-mail is real — it could easily move the stock market — the bigger risk is eavesdropping. That Android has a microphone, which means that it can be turned into a room bug without anyone’s knowledge. That’s my real fear.” Patrick Tucker is technology editor for Defense One. He’s also the author of The Naked Future: What Happens in a World That Anticipates Your Every Move? (Current, 2014). Previously, Tucker was deputy editor for The Futurist for nine years.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) NASA unveiled its brand new blue spacesuit and it's a nod to the future. The new gear is Boeing-designed. "Lightweight. Highly mobile. Minimalist. Innovative," Boeing said of the new technology in a statement. The spacesuits will be worn by astronauts who will be on NASA mission aboard the Boeing-designed 'Starliner' spacecraft. "The 'Boeing Blue' suit will be worn by all Starliner crew members during launch, ascent and re-entry and will be customized for each crew member to maximize protection, capability and comfort," the Boeing statement added. NASA said the spacesuit is lightweight, flexible and reportedly comfortable, and includes features that will enable astronauts to use touch screen technology thanks to sensors in the finger areas of the suit. Similar to its predecessor, the suit is built with a bulb to be worn over the head that enables it to become pressurized in the event of an emergency, giving 'Boeing Blue' the iconic space exploration look.

Every Saturday from 9-10am Show Info Share My Queue Listen Live Newstalk TV Podcasts Listen Back 60% Complete Watch Listen Off The Ball latest News Business & Tech Sport Life Shows Competitions BUSINESS & TECH all Consumer Finance Product Reviews How to Tech BUSINESS & TECH Boeing debuts new spacesuit More streamlined and weighing less, the suits should be taking astronauts to the ISS by next year Business & Tech [Boeing] 15:00 27 Jan 2017 James Dempsey 18 hours ago Blue, it appears, is the new orange, at least when it comes to space suits. The bulky NASA ones of the days of the space shuttle are now a thing of the past, as Boeing has unveiled a new model. The sleeker, more flexible piece of spacecraft tailoring is part of the aeronautics company’s Starliner system, a next-generation piece of kit designed specifically for astronauts to wear on journeys to and from the International Space Station, and maybe even beyond. The brains behind the new suit design come from former astronaut Chris Ferguson, the director of Boeing’s Starliner Crew & Mission Systems programme, and lead designer Shane Jacobs. “Astronauts had formerly had these relatively bulky, heavy suits with thick neck rings. And we learned throughout the years that maybe we didn’t need that,” Ferguson explained in a Boeing video. “We’ve simplified the suit. It’s lightweight.” Advancing astronaut apparel During the era of the NASA’s space shuttle programme, running from 1981 to 2011, a typical space suit weighed almost 15kg, while Boeing’s new model shaves off almost two thirds of that, coming in at 5.4kg. Other features include gloves enabled with touchscreen-sensitive material, a helmet and visor built into the design, and greater mobility at the elbows and knees. Vents in the suit also allow water vapour to escape, but keep oxygen in, meaning the internal temperature won’t rise like in the previous designs. The suits are specifically designed to be worn in Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, which will see its first test flight take off in 2018.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) NASA unveiled its brand new blue spacesuit and it's a nod to the future. The new gear is Boeing-designed. "Lightweight. Highly mobile. Minimalist. Innovative," Boeing said of the new technology in a statement. The spacesuits will be worn by astronauts who will be on NASA mission aboard the Boeing-designed 'Starliner' spacecraft. "The 'Boeing Blue' suit will be worn by all Starliner crew members during launch, ascent and re-entry and will be customized for each crew member to maximize protection, capability and comfort," the Boeing statement added. NASA said the spacesuit is lightweight, flexible and reportedly comfortable, and includes features that will enable astronauts to use touch screen technology thanks to sensors in the finger areas of the suit. Similar to its predecessor, the suit is built with a bulb to be worn over the head that enables it to become pressurized in the event of an emergency, giving 'Boeing Blue' the iconic space exploration look.

This satellite, ABS-2A, joins ABS-3A as Boeing’s second all-electric propulsion 702 satellite for ABS. Boeing is the first satellite manufacturer to build and deliver all-electric propulsion satellites. “We have completed our three-satellite build investment in launching three satellites in three consecutive years, including ABS-2 in 2014 as well as Boeing’s ABS-3A in 2015 and ABS-2A in 2016,” said Tom Choi, CEO of ABS. “ABS-2A is the latest high-capacity satellite providing expansion and continuity of satellite services at ABS’ prime gateway over the Indian Ocean region. It is located with ABS-2 at our premium neighborhood at 75°E optimized for video services for growing television community access and direct-to-home businesses.” All-electric satellites can be launched as pairs, as ABS-2A was in June 2016. This improves efficiency and affordability for the customer. “This latest delivery reaffirms our leadership with all-electric propulsion,” said Mark Spiwak, president, Boeing Satellite Systems International. “Our ability to stack and join the satellites using our patented design enables our customers to minimize the costs associated with launching a single satellite.” See other recent news regarding: Boeing, Satellite.

Eric Berger - Jan 27, 2017 2:41 pm UTC Enlarge / SpaceX revealed its Dragon V2 spacecraft in May, 2014. It's still a ways from the launch pad. SpaceX reader comments 44 Share this story This week Boeing made a public splash by debuting a new blue spacesuit for astronauts to wear aboard its Starliner spacecraft. What the company did not dwell on as it rolled out “Boeing Blue,” however, was when the lighter, more modern-looking flight suits might be put into action with crewed flights into orbit. That is because much work remains to integrate all of Starliner’s various systems, including qualifying them for flight, ensuring their compatibility, and writing and testing software that will make for smooth flying. And Boeing is not alone; its “commercial crew” competitor SpaceX also faces similar technical hurdles with the Dragon V2 spacecraft and the Falcon 9 rocket that will launch it into space. Further ReadingBoeing releases snazzy new blue spacesuits for Starliner fliers Boeing has set a “no earlier than” date of August 2018 for its first crewed test flight, and SpaceX has targeted May 2018. But those dates seem optimistic. Ars spoke to a handful of sources familiar with the commercial crew program this week, and all expressed pessimism about the public timelines the companies have for reaching the launch pad. According to this unofficial analysis, even a single crewed test flight in 2018 by either company now appears unlikely, as teams from both Boeing and SpaceX continue to work through significant technical issues. Space really is hard There is an old cliché in the aerospace industry that is nonetheless entirely true—space is hard. Only Russia, the United States, and more recently China have ever launched humans into orbit. Now two private companies, funded by NASA, are seeking to do the same. That no one else has yet done this speaks to the challenge. In the early part of this decade, a skeptical Congress hindered the commercial crew program by under-funding it, which caused initial delays from 2015 to 2017. Last year, for the first time, Congress more or less provided every penny NASA requested for its contracts with Boeing and SpaceX. In September, NASA Inspector General Paul Martin reported that delays beyond 2017 were largely due to technical issues. NASA, too, bore some of the blame for its lumbering evaluation and review processes as Boeing and SpaceX developed their spacecraft, Martin said. NASA, of course, desperately wants the private companies to succeed. Since the Space Shuttle’s retirement in 2011, the space agency has relied on Russia and its aging Soyuz family of rockets and spacecraft to transport its astronauts to the International Space Station. And in the meantime, Congress has groused about paying an increasingly steep price for Soyuz “seats.” Further ReadingAs leadership departs, NASA quietly moves to buy more Soyuz seats NASA currently has contracts with Russia through 2018 to get its astronauts to the station. However, a delay of test flights into 2019 would necessarily push the first “operational” commercial crew flights into spring or summer of 2019 at a minimum. So, earlier this month, NASA revealed a clever plan that would allow it to procure additional Soyuz seats for 2019 while also reducing the threat of political blowback. Officials within the ISS program, based in Houston, helped broker a deal for Boeing to acquire the “rights” to sell three Soyuz seats in 2019. Boeing received these rights from Russia's Energia as compensation for the settlement of a lawsuit involving the Sea Launch joint venture. In essence, then, when NASA tells the White House and Congress it needs to buy additional seats for 2019 due to commercial crew delays, it will be asking for money to buy them from Boeing—an American company—rather than Russia. Crew assignments NASA has therefore bought some more time for its commercial crew partners. As we get deeper into 2017, there are some clues that can help us track whether Boeing and SpaceX are making good progress. Foremost is the actual assignment of crews to the first missions. The space agency has previously designated four veterans as its commercial crew astronauts—Bob Behnken, Sunita Williams, Doug Hurley, and Eric Boe—who have since been familiarizing themselves with both new vehicles. These four astronauts are unlikely to be assigned to Boeing or SpaceX until such time that crews are formally announced, not only for the initial two-person test flights, but also for the subsequent operational flights. So there would potentially be two two-person crews named (one for each Boeing and SpaceX), as well as two larger crews, which would include astronauts flying to the station for a regular, multi-month increment. The timing of these announcements is critical, as they would have to occur at least 18 months before the operational flights begin. This would allow the astronauts flying to the station for long-duration missions time to prepare for all their work aboard the ISS. Ars understands the naming of these crews won’t occur before at least June or July of this year—probably later. Rocket concerns Both companies are having trouble with not only their spacecraft, but their rockets as well. The Starliner will launch on the highly reliable Atlas V rocket, but wind-tunnel tests have shown some problems with aeroacoustic issues when the Starliner is stacked atop the Atlas V during launch. Boeing may need to perform additional tests this year to demonstrate that it has moved beyond these issues. For SpaceX, it will be critical to watch the company’s development of its Falcon 9 rocket. With two failures in 18 months, the company needs to prove to NASA that its booster is safe. The issue is complicated by the fact that SpaceX continues to work toward a “final” version of its Falcon 9 rocket—Block 5—which founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk said will fly by the end of this year. The Block 5 variant of the Falcon 9 is being designed for optimal safety and easier return for potential reuse. It will also be the variant upon which the crewed Dragon spacecraft ultimately flies. Further ReadingSpaceX is about to launch one of its final expendable rockets NASA will want to see multiple flights of this Block 5 version before it allows astronauts on top of it. Among those flights will be an uncrewed test flight of the Dragon V2 spacecraft, which will likely dock with the space station. As part of its milestones for Dragon V2, SpaceX nominally plans to conduct this uncrewed test flight in late 2017. However, because it now seems unlikely that the Block 5 version of the Falcon 9 will make its maiden flight before late this year, the Dragon V2 test flight will almost certainly slip into 2018. How much it is delayed into 2018 should provide some clues as to how overly optimistic the rest of SpaceX’s commercial crew targets remain. Promoted Comments Statistical Ars Praefectus et Subscriptor jump to post Space is hard. Cliche but true. Delays are all but inevitable. They were inevitable in Apollo and they are inevitable now. That Congress created necessary political delays on top of the real technical delays you know were coming is just stupid. Still even if they don't fly crews until 2019, the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program, which includes both Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply, will be an amazing success. The development portion of COTS funding was $800M for resupply and $3.3B for crew (~$1.5B in development and $1.8B for certification flights). That includes funding for the spacecraft not selected as well. So for roughly $4B NASA got (or will get) three independent resupply vehicles and two independent crew transfer vehicles. That is just insanely low when you consider historically how much it has cost to develop a single new spacecraft. Plus those vehicles use a variety of launchers which means the entire fleet should never be grounded due to a fault in one launcher. The services portion of COTS is up to $3.5B for resupply for up to 20 supply runs to the ISS and up to $5.0B for crew to provide up to twelve round trip crew flights (at least 4 astronauts per flight). The services portion is paid on a per mission basis so the numbers represent the max awards if NASA opts to use the maximum number of launches allowed by the contract. Most of this hasn't been paid yet. 9930 posts | registered 9/27/2010 Eric Berger Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to wonky NASA policy.

Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 aviation Latest update : 2017-01-27 Flight MH370: Families of missing passengers search for the truth Tweet It’s a unique case in the history of modern aviation. Nearly three years after its disappearance, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, a Boeing 777 with 239 people on board, has still not been found. The official search has now been called off and no satisfactory conclusion has been reached to lessen the families’ immense pain. Some suspect the authorities are hiding the truth from them and have decided to carry out their own investigation. Our reporters followed them in their search efforts. On the night of March 7-8, 2014, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 took off from a runway in Kuala Lumpur, heading for Beijing. It was a regular scheduled flight, like thousands of others every day, with nothing special about it. On board were 12 crew members and 227 passengers, 153 of them Chinese nationals. But at 00:41 local time, as the plane prepared to enter Vietnamese airspace, all communications were cut off. The aircraft suddenly disappeared from radar screens. A few days later, the official version established that the 777 turned around, flew over the Malaysian peninsula and followed the Indonesian and Thai borders. Then, based on data provided by Inmarsat satellites, it apparently continued its path towards the south of the Indian Ocean until it ran out of fuel. According to the satellites, it eventually crashed somewhere out at sea, in a vast area off Australia. Very quickly, Malaysia, China and Australia began search operations. But the surface to be covered was huge – over 60,000 square kilometres – and the weather hostile. Radars, sonar technology and submarines were deployed for this unprecedented exploration effort. But after nearly three years of combing the seabed, no part of the Boeing has been located and almost 200 million dollars have been spent. On Tuesday January 17, Malaysia, Australia and China announced they were suspending their search, for lack of convincing results, fuelling the resentment of the families, be they Chinese, Malaysian or French. An American investigator in Madagascar Isolated and lacking official support, the relatives of the victims are clinging to a few fragile pieces of airplane debris found washed up on beaches in the Indian Ocean. In particular, fragments of a plane’s wing were found on Reunion Island in 2015 and in Tanzania the following year. Other pieces of wreckage have been recovered off Mauritius and Madagascar. There are around 30 in total, but only three of these fragments have been authenticated as belonging to the doomed Boeing. Meanwhile, the investigation entrusted to the Malaysian authorities is moving too slowly for the families’ liking. The leads first envisaged are ruled out one after the other: pilot suicide, a technical fault, a terrorist hijacking… Exasperated, the families’ representatives have now decided that they themselves will take part in the search for debris on the coasts of Madagascar, where some wreckage has already been found. In Antananarivo, the capital, they met up with an American private investigator, Blaine Gibson. For more than a year, this adventurer has decided to spend his own money to crisscross the Indian Ocean in a bid to find debris. He says he has collected around 15 pieces of wreckage just by himself. Our reporters Renaud Fessaguet and Pierre Chabert accompanied the families of victims in this hunt for debris against the odds. It's a painstaking task which may, one day, finally lead to the truth.

News Week In Review: Dow Hits 20K On Trump Rally; Boeing Hot, Google Iced The Dow industrials hit 20,000 as the Trump rally fueled infrastructure and financial stocks. (Adobe) IBD STAFF 1/27/2017 Reprints The Dow Jones industrial average hit 20,000 as the major averages rallied to fresh record highs on President Trump's early policy moves. Earnings reports generally were positive, but Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) were among those with disappointing results. M&A deals, buzz and rejections were rife. Dow Industrials Hit Milestone As Banks, Infrastructure Stocks Lead The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% for the week, topping 20,000 for the first time. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also hit record highs, up 1.9% and 1%, respectively, amid a slew of earnings, including Intel (INTC), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alibaba (BABA) and Boeing (BA). President Trump authorized a border wall and two key oil pipelines, lifting a wide variety of construction and materials related firms such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), but not steel makers. Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) broke out, joining other FANG+ stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield rose, lifting bank stocks. Alphabet Earnings Fall Short Google parent Alphabet said Q4 earnings per share minus items rose 8% to $9.36, below views for $9.64. Total revenue rose 22% to $26.1 billion, topping forecasts for 25.26 billion. Revenue growth slowed from 28% in the prior-year period. The internet search and advertising giant faced tough comparisons with the prior-year quarter, when it launched new advertising products. Capital spending soared 46% to $3.1 billion, which much of that related to its cloud computing efforts. Marketing costs for Google's new Pixel smartphones also were heavy. Alphabet shares fell 1.4% on Friday after hitting record highs earlier in the week. RELATED: Alphabet Q4 EPS Misses Expectations Microsoft Expands As Cloud Business Booms Fiscal Q2 earnings rose 9% to 83 cents a share while revenue climbed 2% to $26.07 billion, beating views for 79 cents and $25.30 billion. Credit a booming cloud computing business, including Azure. Microsoft guided Q3 revenue forecasts higher. Microsoft shares rose nearly 5% for the week, hitting record highs. RELATED: Microsoft Beats Q2 Targets On Cloud Computing Strength Intel, Other Chip Earnings Strong The chipmaker's EPS rose 4%, topping views, while its 10% sales growth was the best in four years. Intel also gave bullish guidance. Intel shares rose 1.1% Friday after breaking out of a base earlier in the week ahead of earnings. Texas Instruments (TXN) also reported strong earnings, while Samsung Electronics credit memory chip gains for its overall Q4 profit revival. Microsemi (MSCC) also had good results, along with chip gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC). But mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), facing FTC charges and Apple lawsuits over its licensing practices, reported mixed results. RELATED: Intel Q4 Earnings, Sales Top Expectations, Revenue Guidance Also Beats U.S. Economic Malaise Hits 11 Years The economy expanded at a 1.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, below views for 2.2% and not much more than half of Q3's 3.5% gain. For 2016, U.S. GDP grew just 1.6%, the 11th straight year below 3%. Meanwhile, durable goods orders unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in December. New-home sales tumbled to a 10-month low, though several homebuilders remained bullish after reporting solid earnings. Starbucks, McDonald's Revivals Doubted Starbucks (SBUX) reported its weakest earnings growth in five years, though that met views. Sales missed forecasts with customer traffic down 2%. The coffee shop giant, which also cut its revenue outlook, said its mobile order and pay was so popular that it created bottlenecks at order pick up, turning off some patrons. Starbucks shares fell 4% on Friday. Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) topped EPS and sales targets but U.S. comps fell as investors questioned if the momentum from the all-day breakfast menu has run out. McDonald's tested key support levels initially but closed the week up 0.5%. RELATED: Too Much Of A Good Thing? This Weighed On Starbucks' U.S. Performance McDonald's Stock Tests Key Support Amid Turnaround Doubts Judge Blocks Aetna-Humana Deal A federal judge ruled that the $37 billion Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) merger would violate antitrust laws by unduly reducing competition among health insurers. Aetna, which owes Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, may appeal. The deal also throws into doubt the proposed $48 billion Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) merger deal, which the Justice Department also opposes. RELATED: Aetna's $37 Billion Deal For Humana Blocked By Federal Judge Steel Stocks Break 50-Day Lines, Try To Recover Several steel makers sold off during the week, breaking below their 50-day lines as earnings reports failed to support stocks after a postelection run, even as President Trump touted various infrastructure plans and signaled more protectionism. AK Steel (AKS) topped views Tuesday, but shares reversed sharply lower on a weak pricing outlook. Steel Dynamics (STLD), which had decent earnings late Tuesday, tumbled Wednesday. Larger peers U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), which both report on Jan. 31, also sold off. But many of the steel makers rebounded Thursday and Friday. On the upside, specialty steel firm Allegheny Steel (ATI) delivered stellar earnings Tuesday, sending shares up 31% that day. RELATED: Steel Stocks Break Key Support Even As Trump Rally Resumes AK, Allegheny Earnings Top, Steel Dynamics Meets; Steel Stocks Bend Both Ways Boeing Flies, Lockheed Falters Boeing (BA) emphasized the importance of trade with China for aerospace industry jobs in the U.S. but is bullish about President Trump's tax reforms and regulations. Boeing reported Q4 EPS and revenue above analyst views. Its guidance was cautious, but its 787 Dreamliner is now cash flow positive,which bodes well for future stock buybacks and dividend increases. Boeing shares broke out of a base, hitting record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported Q4 earnings and revenue above analyst views with aeronautics revenue, which includes F-35 sales, soaring 23% to $5.41 billion. It expects a surge in F-35 deliveries this year. But Lockheed gave weak guidance amid continued concerns about F-35 costs, sending shares lower. Northrop Grumman (NOC) beat on Q4 views while Raytheon (RTN) fell short. Like Boeing and Lockheed, they gave weak guidance. General Dynamics (GD) reported strong earnings and gave bullish long-term guidance.

Verizon reported a mixed Q4, with revenue falling 5.4% but beating estimates while EPS was light. Wireless margins missed. Management pushed back its goal of returning to wireless service growth to 2018. The close of Verizon's purchase of Yahoo (YHOO) will be delayed until Q2 as regulators look into its data breaches. AT&T (T) reported in-line Q4 EPS, with revenue and EBITDA slightly below consensus. AT&T again lost wireless postpaid phone subscribers. AT&T remained upbeat on regulatory approval of its Time Warner (TWX) acquisition. Comcast (CMCSA) Q4 earnings topped views amid solid subscriber gains. The cable TV firm plans to buy back $5 billion in shares in 2017, hiked its dividend and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Comcast plans to launch its wireless service buy midyear. Comcast rose 3% for the week to new highs. RELATED: Verizon Stock Falls; EPS, Revenue Outlook More Of The Same Verizon, Charter Talks Heating Up?

J&J Makes Big Buys As Pharma Results Mixed Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) agreed to pay $30 billion for Swiss biotech Actelion. J&J reported weak sales and guidance earlier in the week. Celgene (CELG) missed on sales even after preannouncing Q4 results. Biogen (BIIB) stock popped despite light sales on "better-than-feared" 2017 guidance following its hemophilia unit spinoff. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) missed on earnings and gave weak EPS guidance amid weaker lung cancer drug prospects. RELATED: Johnson & Johnson Will Buy Actelion For $30 Billion Bristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O Competition Celgene Aims To Hurdle Revlimid Patent Loss Fast Times For Hard Drives Disk drive makers Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX) both reported quarterly results that topped views. Along with bullish guidance, the results suggested a multiyear slump disk-drive shipments may have bottomed. Both companies are also investing heavily in flash-based chip storage, following market needs. Seagate shares shot up 22% and Western Digital 9%, both setting 15-month bests. RELATED: Western Digital Gets Positive Reviews On 'Crisp Execution' Alibaba Soars On Strong Q3 Alibaba (BABA) revenue rose 54% in local currency to $7.67 billion, with EPS rising 30% to $1.30 above views. Revenue from its cloud computing unit rose 115% to $254 million. Shares of the e-commerce giant rose more than 6% for the week, as Alibaba builds the right side of a base. RELATED: Alibaba Crushes Earnings Estimates, Raises Guidance Ford: U.S. Plants 'Appropriate' Ford (F) topped fourth-quarter results expectations, and sees a sluggish 2017. CEO Mark Fields said the automaker has the right amount of U.S. plants it needs, despite President Trump's call days earlier for the Big 3 to build more U.S. factories. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), meanwhile, said net income doubled, helped by cost savings, while revenue ticked up 1% to $31.4 billion. Ford CEO Says U.S. Plants 'Appropriate'; Q4 Profit Meets, Sales Top Cisco Buys Almost-IPO AppDynamics For Hefty Premium Cisco Systems (CSCO) late Tuesday announced it would buy AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, a day before the latter was expected to price an IPO with a top target valuation of $1.7 billion.

Think Goldman, Boeing and IBM January 27, 2017, 05:00 AM By Marley Jay The Associated NEW YORK — Dow 20,000 wasn’t exactly a team effort. The index climbed to the 20,000 mark from 19,000 largely because of three stocks: financial firm Goldman Sachs, aerospace giant Boeing, and technology and consulting company IBM. Put together, those three companies are responsible for almost half the gain that brought the blue chip index to its latest millennial mark on Wednesday. It took the Dow just two months to go from 19,000 to 20,000, one of its quickest moves between round number milestones. The big jumps for Goldman, Boeing and IBM reflect the fact that investors expect financial firms and industrial companies to do very well. They’re so optimistic that they’re buying some very expensive stocks, as they are betting that the companies will reap large gains if economic growth picks up and the Trump administration cuts regulations that might keep their profits in check. The Dow had looked like it was going to blow past the 20,000 mark in the middle of December. It stopped tantalizingly close to that mark, in large part because a big rally in Goldman stock ended. Goldman led the index rapidly higher after the election and came close to an all-time high, but it’s trading a little lower today than it was a few weeks ago. It’s worth noting that Goldman is the most expensive Dow stock by a wide margin and IBM is the next-most costly. That matters because the Dow is weighted by stock price. When Goldman Sachs moves from $200 to $201, or one half of one percent, that counts exactly as much as Cisco rising from $30 to $31, which would boost that company’s stock price by more than 3 percent. Other indexes like the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq don’t work that way. They’re weighted by the market value of a company, and many investors feel that makes those indexes a better reflection of the broader market. Despite the huge gains the index has made in the last few months, some Dow stocks aren’t doing that well. Wal-Mart, which has lost the equivalent of about 20 Dow points since Nov. 22, is doing the worst. Six other components are down, and a few others haven’t moved much. The stocks in the Dow are more expensive than some of their peers, but they’re also less risky: while a small company in the Russell 2000 index might bring home bigger gains than a Dow component, as they did in the aftermath of the election, those companies are also more likely to suffer big setbacks or fail altogether.     Tags: goldman, index, stocks, companies, they, stock, Other stories from today: Indexes drift down; Dow ekes out gain How did the Dow get to 20,000?

Image: Boeing The brilliant white suits of the NASA Apollo missions are looking quite old in comparison to the new, bright blue spacesuits of the future, recently revealed by Boeing. It has been nearly 50 years since the Apollo 11 astronauts became the first humans to walk on the moon in their bulky spacesuits, but even by today’s standards, it would appear that not much has changed. Boeing has revealed its ‘Boeing Blue’ spacesuit, which aims to bring astronauts into the 21st century when they travel aboard the company’s Starliner spacecraft for trips to and from the International Space Station. Compared with previous spacesuits, the Boeing Blue will be 40pc lighter, offering the astronauts greater pressurised mobility, which should not only make it more comfortable, but better prepared in the event of an emergency. The suit is also designed to keep the astronaut cooler by emitting water vapour, while the boots are breathable and slip-resistant. With touchscreen-friendly gloves, they will be to interact with the capsule’s tablets. Some familiar zippers have also been placed on the torso area of the suit to make it easier for astronauts to comfortably transition from sitting to standing. The suit’s communications systems have been upgraded with a smaller, more powerful set-up in the helmet, which should make it easier to keep in touch with crews on the ground. The familiar visor on an astronaut’s spacesuit that prevents them from the blinding and irradiating sunlight is now made from polycarbonate, to give astronauts aboard the Starliner better peripheral vision throughout their ride to and from space. These spacesuits, which look more like something from 2001: A Space Odyssey than anything else, will likely be available by the end of 2018. Boeing’s Chris Ferguson. Image: Boeing Will likely see action in 2018 Similar to its competitor SpaceX – which has made huge leaps in reusable rocket technology – the Starliner crewed capsule won’t begin any testing with humans until at least August 2018. “To me, it’s a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we’ve been,” said Chris Ferguson, the director of crew and mission systems for Boeing. “The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft.” Testing the Boeing Blue in the Starliner.

Boeing has unveiled a new line of spacesuits for future astronauts under its endeavours, with a few unique touches. The suits, coloured in Boeing’s signature blue tone, have been designed specifically to be worn aboard their Starliner spacecraft, built to ferry astronauts between the Earth and International Space Station. Weighing approximately 9 kilograms, 40 percent less than NASA’s current space suits, Boeing’s design isn’t meant for protection against micro particle impacts and drastic temperature changes during spacewalks. Instead, it’s only a preemptive measure in case of a fire or hull breach during the Starliner’s launch, ascent, and re-entry. With strategically placed zippers, a soft helmet, and wide visor, the Boeing suit keeps the wearer cooler than NASA’s standard fare, and also features special touchscreen-friendly gloves compatible with the Starliner’s built-in tablets. “It’s more aesthetically appealing and it's not as bulky,” Boeing Starliner director Chris Ferguson told media. Even the boots are lightweight and foldable, thanks to a design collaboration with Reebok, Ferguson added. The suits have been designed with simple Earth-to-ISS transit in mind, a journey that could take anywhere between six hours on optimal launch day, to 24 hours. Consequently, Boeing’s design is fitted together as a largely singular piece, meaning astronauts will unfortunately have to wear adult diapers as bathroom breaks will be non-existent. Boeing built the CST-100 Starliner under NASA’s Commercial Crew program, an initiative to launch NASA’s astronauts into space aboard capsules manufactured by private companies. The first expected Starliner launch is expected to take place in August 2018, which means it’ll be more than a year before astronauts actually strap into the new space suits.

Unveiled today (Jan. 25), the new "Boeing Blue" spacesuits for the Starliner capsule weigh about 20 lbs. (9 kilograms) each with all of their accessories, compared to 30 lbs. (13.6 kg) for the old space shuttle suits, NASA officials said. Other advances include touch-screen-sensitive gloves, more-flexible material and soft helmets that are incorporated into the suit (rather than the hard, detachable helmets of the shuttle era). [See photos of the new Boeing spacesuits] Former NASA astronaut Chris Ferguson tries on the "Boeing Blue" spacesuit, a private suit for astronauts flying on Boeing's new CST-100 Starliner space capsule. NASA will use Boeing's Starliner vehicles as private space taxis for American astronauts. Credit: Boeing "It is a lot lighter, more formfitting, and it's simpler, which is always a good thing," NASA astronaut Eric Boe said in a statement. "Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this." Boe is one of four NASA astronauts currently training to fly aboard the Starliner and SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which the two companies are developing to provide taxi services to and from the International Space Station (ISS). Both vehicles should start flying crewed missions in the next year or two, NASA officials have said. Chris Ferguson wears the brand new spacesuit from Boeing and David Clark. Credit: Boeing The Boeing Blue suit, and the one that SpaceX develops, will help keep astronauts safe in the event of an emergency during trips to and from orbit. The suits are not designed for spacewalks; the large, bulky "extravehicular mobility units" that astronauts use for this latter purpose are already aboard the ISS. "The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft's redundant life-support systems," Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits in NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said in the same statement. "If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don't need a spacesuit. It's like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed." A look at the spacesuit astronauts will wear aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule. Credit: Boeing Since the space shuttles' retirement in July 2011, NASA has relied on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to get American astronauts to and from orbit, at a cost of about $70 million per seat. Starliner and Dragon will end this foreign dependence, if all goes according to plan. That plan is getting closer and closer to reality, said former NASA astronaut Chris Ferguson, who is now director of crew and mission systems for Boeing. "To me, it's a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we've been," Ferguson said of today's spacesuit unveiling. "The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft."

But Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier across the Atlantic, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA. Norwegian will receive the first Max 8 in May, spokesman Anders Lindstrom said Thursday, with flights starting as early as June. Boeing Co. Southwest made its bones as the low-cost carrier that famously flies only one airplane family. As Boeing’s largest customer for the 737, it’s been involved in the redesign, which included outfitting the workhorse with a more powerful engine. In 2011, the Dallas-based airline placed the first order for the 737 Max, followed by Norwegian and Indonesia’s Lion Air. Yesterday, Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said his airline will get the first of its 200 737 Max’s by July—two months earlier than expected, but two months after Norwegian.  The Max’s sprightly release clip has prompted delivery questions for both Southwest and Boeing, given that an aircraft’s launch customer typically gets—and flies—the new plane first. This sort of arrangement has been upended before, when Airbus A320neo, destined first for Qatar Airways Ltd., didn’t arrive as planned. Qatar chief Akbar Al Baker last year balked over glitches in the A320neo’s engine software and refused to take the first plane, which went instead to Lufthansa. There’s more to being a launch customer than bragging rights—although that's a large part of the appeal of being the first to market with a shiny new jet. Aircraft makers also promise that their newest models boast lower fuel and maintenance costs than prior airplanes, providing an immediate bottom-line boost to airlines. “We’re the launch customer, regardless of when we take the first delivery,” Southwest CEO Kelly said of the Max. His chief operating officer, Mike Van De Ven, said Thursday that “we’re the ones that have done the service-ready operational validation for Boeing. We’re the ones working very closely with Boeing to make sure it's operating as everyone intended.” Boeing’s Max development is on-budget and ahead of schedule.

And this is the sticking point: Southwest must first retire those old planes before it can accommodate new ones, a conundrum that traces back to pilot training issues. About 10 of Southwest’s 737 Max planes will be finished by the time the carrier is ready to begin flights in October, Van de Ven has said. The carrier is in talks with Boeing about what to do with those planes between July and October, because several are now parked at the periphery of Boeing’s 737 factory in Renton, Wash. Norwegian, meanwhile, plans to take delivery of a half-dozen new 737 Max this year and then deploy them for trans-Atlantic service, though it hasn’t revealed which routes or a time frame. The European carrier has been focused on smaller airports in the Northeast U.S., bypassing the large metropolitan hubs. —With Julie Johnsson in Chicago.

Boeing shows off the spacesuit astronauts will wear on the Starliner Posted yesterday by Devin Coldewey 0 SHARES Next Story Tell wants you to eat like a celebrity chef The commercial spaceflight industry is doing a great job creating new rockets, launch vehicles and all that good stuff, but spacesuits have seen few alterations. Until now. Boeing has publicly debuted what astronauts on its Starliner craft will be wearing, and it looks like a big improvement. Chris Ferguson, former astronaut and now leader of Boeing’s Starliner Crew and Mission Systems, showed off the suit for the cameras yesterday. This one isn’t for doing spacewalks, but rather for getting the astronaut from the staging area of the launch to the relative safety of the space station, and vice versa. It still needs to be airtight and resistant to extreme temperatures and other “extremis” situations — just not to hard vacuum and cosmic radiation. But there was definitely room to improve on the bright orange Advanced Crew Escape Suits made by NASA since the 1990s. “We’ve simplified the suit,” Ferguson said in a Boeing video. “Astronauts formerly had these relatively bulky heavy suits with thick neck rings, and we learned throughout the years maybe we didn’t need that.” 32141923950_c6a9a6069f_k 32141926980_3eb9cf5061_k starliner_gallery14_960x600 starliner_gallery13_960 starliner_gallery15_960 31677346374_c95e07194f_k starliner_gallery17_960  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Related Articles SpaceX successfully lands its first-stage Falcon 9 rocket on drone ship A new private space race as Boeing CEO says he'll beat SpaceX to Mars Elon Musk says he'll start digging a tunnel from SpaceX HQ next month The “Boeing Blue” suits weigh 12 pounds to the ACES’ 30, and are more compact while still building in plenty of functionality. They’re cooler inside, more flexible, have comms built into the helmet and lack the big metal neck ring — instead, the helmet attaches with a zipper and hangs back like a hood when not in use. The shoes, designed by Reebok, are more like giant soft runners than boots, and the gloves come with that all-important 21st-century feature: they’re touchscreen-friendly. Boeing plans to send its first commercial crew up on the Starliner CST-100 launch vehicle in 2018, and they’ll be wearing these suits. Now the question is, will SpaceX leapfrog Boeing with an even cooler suit? Chances are we’ll find out soon — they can’t afford to let Boeing hog the spotlight for too long. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase The Boeing Company Founded 1916 Overview The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures and sells fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft, rockets and satellites and provides leasing and product support services.

Cooper to Boeing? Plot thickens By Erik Lacitis, The Seattle Times Published: January 26, 2017, 10:39 PM A   A SEATTLE — You know the stories exploring whether D.B. Cooper was a Boeing employee? Never mind. Time for a new speculation. Now the attention of the “Citizen Sleuths” on whose research all those viral headlines were premised are pointing at another Pacific Northwest company as D.B.’s possible employer: Tektronix, out of Beaverton, Ore. Not quite the name recognition as Boeing, but it’s well-known in the electronics industry. The Boeing connection is still there, said Tom Kaye, of Sierra Vista, Ariz., who identifies himself as the principal investigator of CitizenSleuths.com. It’s just that now the group believes the titanium particles found on D.B.’s tie came from Tektronix, which may have been doing contract work for Boeing back in the 1960s through 1971 (when the project was canceled) on the supersonic transport jet, better known as the SST. The group was given access to the tie by the FBI and used an electron microscope and X-ray spectroscopy for its work. Kaye now believes that D.B. “was an engineer or manager type who was going back and forth between Boeing and Tektronix.” Boeing understandably said that “we have no comment on these reports.” It’s trying to sell jets, not be associated with D.B. speculation. As for Tektronix, it was founded in 1946 and holds 697 patents. It makes oscilloscopes and optical modulation analyzers. Last week, Amy Higgins, spokeswoman for the company, said it didn’t have employment documentation in its database that would go back some five decades. So it really couldn’t add much, she said. She also said if Tektronix had been doing work on the SST, it was likely “a confidential relationship.” It’s been 45 years since “Dan Cooper” hijacked that Northwest Orient Airlines jet, and somewhere between Seattle and Reno, Nev., parachuted out with $200,000 in $20 bills. His legend is the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to stories we can’t help but read. There was the woman who had undergone transgender surgery and claimed to have been D.B. as a way to get back at the industry that kept her from becoming a pilot. There was the Minnesota man who believed his late brother was D.B. when the family discovered unaccounted-for money in the brother’s bank accounts. And there are more potential D.B.s who have made the news but then not been linked to the case by the FBI. The agency suspended active investigation in July. It’s that black clip-on J.C. Penney tie found on the seat cushion 18E, the same seat assigned to Cooper, that has been at the heart of these latest speculations. D.B. had that now-retro look down pat. It was the look you often would see with the engineers and management at Boeing.

News Treasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform Boeing paid a 27.7% federal tax rate in 2015 but could get a check from Treasury under Republican tax reform. (Boeing) JED GRAHAM 1/27/2017 Reprints Boeing (BA) is going to bat for the BAT — the border adjustment tax that is a central part of the GOP plan to cut the corporate tax rate. The controversial Republican tax-reform plan, which would slap a 20% tax on imports but make exports tax-free, has gotten off to a rough start in the court of public opinion. The National Retail Federation has warned that it would raise prices and cause consumer spending to decline, while analysts have said that big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) could suffer major hits to profitability. House Republicans, with the help of economists, have countered that an anticipated 20% appreciation of the dollar would neutralize those negative effects, while removing what they call a "Made in America" tax. Now big exporters including Boeing and General Electric (GE) are reportedly gearing up to help House Speaker Paul Ryan make that case, and it's not hard to understand why. Consider Boeing: The company paid an effective federal tax rate of 27.7% in 2015, when it had a current tax bill of $2.1 billion, but would have had negative tax liability under the House plan. In 2015, 59% of company revenue came from non-U.S. customers. Given that Boeing does almost all of its manufacturing and sourcing within the U.S., it has limited exposure to the 20% import tax. Meanwhile, the House GOP tax plan exempts exports from any tax. Companies would be taxed on their cash flow, basically the total cost of (non-imported) goods, labor and capital outlays minus U.S. revenue. In effect, Boeing's U.S. cash flow, as far as the GOP tax plan is concerned, would have been dramatically negative once its $56.7 billion in non-U.S. revenue was excluded. IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in December that some big exporters "may pay little or no federal taxes — and may even accrue tax benefits in the form of net operating losses." Yet some tax experts say the only way to make the House plan work as intended would be for the federal government to write a check to exporters with negative liability. The border adjustment tax would effectively become a trade barrier, doing more to keep out imports than to facilitate exports "unless cash refunds were provided," wrote American Enterprise Institute scholar Alan Viard. William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, wrote that while it may create a "serious optics problem" for Treasury to write checks to big corporations, the issue is just one of perception. Because of the exchange-rate adjustment, the House plan shouldn't affect the after-tax profitability of either exporters or importers, he wrote. President Trump initially sounded wary of Ryan's tax reform approach, calling it "too complicated" and the wrong medicine for a dollar that is already "too strong." But he may have put those concerns aside: White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday that Trump would pay to build a wall on the Mexican border with funds generated by a 20% border tax as part of tax reform. But White House chief of staff Reince Priebus later said a 20% tax is just one option. The outcome of this rhetorical and political battle may be critical in deciding whether Trump can deliver on his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to a range of 15% to 20% from a statutory rate of 35%, among the world's highest. Without the $1.1 trillion in revenue that would come from the border-adjusted tax, analysts say a tax rate of 25% may be the best Trump can do.

DAVID MOSHER, BUSINESS INSIDER 27 JAN 2017   NASA isn't thrilled about having to pay Russia billions of dollars to launch US astronauts on Russian rockets inside of Russian spacesuits. But that's the current spaceflight pickle the space agency finds itself in; there's really no other option unless you're China. However, two aerospace companies - SpaceX and Boeing - are working hard to fulfil contracts for NASA to build and launch astronauts to low-Earth orbit as soon as 2018 (a delay of about three years). SpaceX is working on its Dragon spacecraft while Boeing is developing and testing its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft.   To that end, on Wednesday, Boeing for the first time publicly unveiled a crucial new piece of its Starliner system: a spacesuit to protect the next generation of astronauts as they launch toward the International Space Station, and eventually more exotic destinations like an asteroid, or even Mars. Behind the new suit is former astronaut Chris Ferguson, director of Boeing's Starliner Crew and Mission Systems program, and lead designer Shane Jacobs. "Astronauts had formerly had these relatively bulky, heavy suits with thick neck rings. And we learned throughout the years that maybe we didn't need that," Ferguson said in a Boeing promotional video. "We've simplified the suit. It's lightweight." Typical space shuttle suits weighed about 33 lbs (15 kilograms), while Boeing's new suit weighs about 12 lbs (5.4 kilograms) - roughly a few Macbook laptops' worth of mass. The suit, according to Boeing, is also much cooler than typical spacesuits. Below the shoulder material, for example, is a mesh that allows passive airflow to the suit.   "You can pretty much lay there without any external cooling. It's that comfortable," Ferguson said. The suit also features a helmet that comes on and off with a large zipper, and smaller and less bulky gloves (which, yes, are made with material that allows them to interact with touchscreens). Here are some of the first public views of Boeing's new spacesuit. This is the new CST-100 Starliner spacesuit that was designed and built by Boeing: Boeing Here's former astronaut Chris Ferguson, one of its designers, wearing the device. The gloves are compatible with touch screens. Boeing The helmet is attached with a thick, air-tight zipper - no heavy or bulky neck ring required. NASA astronaut Eric Boe is the guy in the suit.

Alwyn Scott Reuters Published Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017 7:45AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017 9:26AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Boeing Co beat analysts’ profit estimates on Wednesday despite another charge for its military tanker aircraft and said it expects to deliver more planes and higher earnings in 2017, though revenue likely will fall. The world’s biggest plane maker also said it expects to deliver between 760 and 765 commercial aircraft in 2017, topping 748 deliveries in 2016. It forecast 2017 core earnings of between $9.10 and $9.30 a share, which exclude some pension and other costs, on revenue of $90.5-billion to $92.5-billion. Analysts estimated $9.28 a share on $92.964-billion in revenue, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Boeing forecast operating cash flow of about $10.75-billion in 2017 versus record cash flow of $10.5-billion in 2016. The company generated $7.7-billion in operating cash flow at the end of the third quarter, fueling expectations it would hit its target of about $10-billion for 2016. But the year-end figure surpassed analysts’ estimates of $10.4-billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We think this release is pretty boring – and boring is good,” Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote in a note to clients. Boeing shares were up 1.4 per cent at $162.80 in premarket trading. Boeing’s higher cash target for 2017 suggested it can keep generating cash by reducing costs while it increases aircraft deliveries. Boeing expects to deliver more planes in 2017 despite plans to cut output of its 777 model by 40 per cent this year. Deliveries of its smaller 737 and 737 MAX models will make up the difference, producing a revenue decline in 2017. Core earnings rose to $2.47 per share in the fourth quarter from $1.60 a year earlier. The increase came despite a $201-million aftertax charge for Boeing’s KC-46A aerial refueling tanker program for the U.S. Air Force. Revenue fell 1.2 per cent to $23.29-billion in the quarter. President Donald Trump has been meeting with corporate executives in an effort to cut better deals with defense contractors. Boeing’s chief executive officer met with Trump earlier this month and said afterward that they had “made progress” on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft. CEO Dennis Muilenburg suggested after the meeting that a deal could be struck soon. Trump had complained that Air Force One planes were too expensive.

Mattis Takes Lead on Cost-Containment Effort The review will "determine opportunities" to cut F-35 costs "significantly" while "meeting requirements." While many berate Trump for looking into upgrades of the F/A-18 Super Hornet as a comparable alternative to the fifth-generation F-35, Mattis said that the review will investigate to what extent the Boeing-made Super Hornet can provide certain capabilities at reduced levels of military expenditure. The review will look into potential F/A-18 upgrades as well. Lockheed Martin and Boeing shares were both down Friday as of 1:30 p.m., Eastern Time. One official from the General Services Administration, which deals with procurement, told Sputnik News that research and development expenses are always factored into the price of an aircraft. The $100-$135 million price tag generally refers to just the production cost of an F-35, and this is usually what gets reported across media outlets, including here on Sputnik. In 2015, lawmakers authorized approximately $55 billion for research, development, and testing, in addition to $1.1 trillion for operations and maintenance. Lockheed Martin and Trump are "very close to a deal" Sputnik has reported that despite Trump's claims to personally oversee "beautiful" cost-cutting measures, the price of the F-35 was already slated to drop in 2017. An executive from one of the anti-missile designers, private UK defense firm Chemring Group Plc, remarked that cost reductions were "a given, regardless of Trump," due to economies of scale. Officials leaked that the Pentagon and Lockheed would reach an accord on the tenth order of F-35s by the end of January. In a recent earnings call, Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said "President Trump recognizes the F-35 is a very large program–the largest in the Department of Defense," but promised shareholders and investors that lower F-35 costs would not contribute to "slashing our profit." According to Hewson, the Joint Strike Fighter program is a "growth engine" for the defense mammoth. "We continue to see growing international demand for it," she said. Norway Will Ditch Old F-16 Fighting Falcon Fleet For F-35 Arrival Norwegian air squads will decommission a fleet of at least 50 aging F-16 Fighting Falcons to pave way for the arrival of new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Norwegian pilots have been training on F-35s at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona since 2015. This year, the highly-anticipated fifth-generation F-35s will make their debut in Norwegian air space. The Ministry of Defense is hoping that the move to scrap the F-16 squadron will pay off financially and politically. The politics of selling the F-16s to another party may be too complex, and Oslo does not prefer to front expensive maintenance costs to keep the F-16s as a reserve fighting fleet. The F-16 has been touted as the most combat-proven fourth generation fighter by its manufacturers, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. While officials cope with "out of control" costs of the F-35, which Trump hopes to lock-in for less than $100 million per aircraft, it is worth noting that, in the late 1990s, the price of an F-16 hovered between $14-$19 million. Three F-35s will be delivered to Norway this year, prompting the air force to lay the F-16 fleet to rest, Ministry of Defense officials said. Some F-16s will remain in operation until 2021 as more of the 52 F-35As ordered by Oslo make their way across the Atlantic Ocean. The Kingdom of Norway, instituted in 1905, has engaged in several armed conflicts since World War II. But Oslo has totaled just 10 casualties during these conflicts, all of which occurred during the War in Afghanistan, in which Oslo has supported US and NATO efforts against the Taliban. Oslo also contributed forces when NATO swooped into the Libyan Civil War. © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

Strong earnings from Boeing and other big companies helped push the Dow past the threshold early on and had U.S. stocks solidly higher by afternoon. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite were on course for record highs of their own after each closed at all-time highs on Tuesday. Financial stocks were leading the gainers, while real estate, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks were among the biggest laggards as bond yields rose. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, gained 151 points, or 0.8 percent, to 20,064 as of 1:09 p.m. Eastern Time. The S&P 500 index rose 15 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,295. The Nasdaq added 45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,646. The market has been marching steadily higher since bottoming out in March 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The rally continued after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president last fall. The Dow first closed above 10,000 on March 29, 1999. Wednesday’s rally comes against a backdrop of optimism on Wall Street that executive actions and policy goals announced by the Trump administration this week on trade, manufacturing and business deregulation will be good for corporate America. “Whether its tax reform or infrastructure spending, any of those tend to be optimistic conversations for the markets currently,” said Darrell Cronk, president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “We have to wait and see how they play out, obviously. The danger here, if there is one, is that the market gets ahead of itself a little bit.” Most professional investors are skeptical the Dow at 20,000 will have much effect on the market. They more often look to the S&P 500 index as a benchmark, because they consider it better representation of the broad market. “In and of itself, it is just a number,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But what it does is it lifts market expectations, in essence, to continue moving higher.” If the Dow reaching 20,000 has any impact, it will likely be a psychological one. Investors have been leery of the stock market for years, unable to stomach the prospect of losing more than 50 percent of their money for a second time if another financial crisis hits. That trepidation has caused them to pull money out of stock funds — even as the Dow made its march toward 20,000 — and depend instead on safer bond investments. Last year, investors pulled a net $27.1 billion out of U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to Morningstar. A year earlier, they yanked $66.5 billion. Over the same time, investors plugged a total of $218.6 billion into taxable bond funds. Anyone who resisted the urge to dump their stock investments through all the tumult of the last decade is now seeing the full benefit of a market with the Dow at 20,000. A $10,000 investment in the largest U.S. stock mutual fund made a decade ago, before the Great Recession began, would have dropped below $5,000 by March 2009. But investors who held on even through the worries of another recession hitting, U.S. debt downgrade, the euro crisis, Brexit and U.S. presidential election of last fall would now be sitting on nearly $20,000. This is expected to be the busiest week for corporate earnings news, with about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 reporting quarterly results. Several companies were moving higher after reporting results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Boeing was the biggest gainer in the Dow. The aircraft manufacturer climbed $7.70, or 4.8 percent, to $168.25. Seagate’s latest quarterly snapshot drove its shares 17.7 percent higher, to lead all other companies in the S&P 500. The stock added $6.64 to $44.08. Investors also bid up shares in Rockwell Automation, which rose $10.06, or 7.1 percent, to $152.09, and Logitech, which vaulted 15.5 percent. The computer gaming and accessories maker’s shares added $3.90 to $29. Some companies posted earnings that failed to impress investors. Textron slumped 10.5 percent after the defense contractor’s fourth-quarter revenue missed financial analysts’ estimates. The company also announced it is buying snowmobile maker Arctic Cat in a deal valued at about $247 million. Textron was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.21 to $44.17. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan fell 5.5 percent after it served up quarterly results that missed analysts’ forecasts. The stock slid 93 cents to $16.09. Major stock indexes in Europe moved higher. Germany’s DAX was up 1.8 percent, while the CAC-40 in France was 1 percent higher. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 0.2 percent. Earlier in Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 surged 1.4 percent after Japan’s government said that the nation had a trade surplus in 2016, its first in six years. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.1 percent. Oil prices edged lower. Benchmark U.S. crude was down 4 cents to $53.14 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $55.31 a barrel in London. Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.52 percent from 2.47 percent late Tuesday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 113.79 yen from 113.89 on Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0732 from $1.0723.

There's still a lot of things you'll never know. Like why each time the sky begins to snow, you cry" sang the late, great Dan Fogelberg. I've been known to quietly weep when the sky begins to snow - during rush hour - on 494 - on the drive home. Think of how much time we waste commuting, to do work we could probably do at home. Dr. Mark Seeley reports January temperatures are running 5-7F warmer than average, in spite of that crunchy subzero shuffle a few weeks back. 17 consecutive months warmer than average at MSP - 9 months in a row, statewide. For the next week or two tracking Minnesota's weather will be the rough meteorological equivalent of watching paint dry. I'm OK with that. Any big storms track south, a rag-tag parade of weak Alberta Clippers for us. Starved for moisture, they may spark an occasional coating. Models hint at plowable, 4-inch amounts on Monday from Bemidji to Duluth. That's as exciting as it gets. Slightly warmer than normal temperatures prevail the next 2 weeks. I suspect the worst of winter's chill is behind us now. January 2017: Another Warmer than Average Month for Minnesota. Here's an excerpt of Mark Seeley's Minnesota WeatherTalk: "...As we end the month of January early next week most of Minnesota's climate observers are reporting mean monthly temperature values that are from 5 to 7 degrees F warmer than normal. For the Twin Cities January marks the 17th consecutive month with above normal temperatures, while on a statewide basis it is the 9th consecutive month of above normal temperatures. Extreme temperature values for the month ranged from -46°F at Cotton (St Louis County) on the 14th to a high of 48°F at several locations over the 18th and 19th. In terms of record-setting daily temperatures, 31 daily record maximum temperature records were tied or set over the warm period from the 17th to the 21st, while over the same period 90 daily warm minimum temperature records were tied or set..." Lake Effect - Couple of Clippers. The pattern is (relatively) quiet and benign the next few days as lake effect snows slowly shut off downwind of the Great Lakes. A fairly impressive Alberta Clipper brush Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan by Monday and Tuesday. The western USA enjoys a rare spell of dry weather until the latter half of next week. 84-hour NAM guidance: NOAA and Tropicaltidbits.com. Fun With Positive Numbers. My expectations are pretty low in late January and early February, so the fact that the Twin Cities is forecast to stay consistently above 0F for the next 15 days is a small victory. Temperatures run near or even a degree or 2F above average through the period. ECMWF guidance: WeatherBell. 10-Day GFS Snowfall Guidance. Take all of this with a giant grain of (road) salt - the GFS tends to be overly generous with snowfall amounts. A plowable accumulation is quite possible Monday into Tuesday from northern Minnesota and Wisconsin into Michigan. Pacific storms return by Thursday of next week, adding to rainfall and already-outrageous mountain snows. The GFS is hinting at accumulating snow for the southeastern USA Super Bowl Sunday into Monday, February 7. No, I don't believe it yet, and neither should you. More March Than February. No guarantees this 2-week 500mb (18,000 foot) wind forecast will verify - there never is, but if it does come close much of the USA will be bathed in relatively mild Pacific air; the coldest arctic air pushed well north of the USA. It's still a volatile, fast-paced pattern and I wouldn't' rule out more numbing air, but the odds of record, sustained, day after day of subzero weather drops off fairly quickly by late February. So Long Exceptional Drought. The recent parade of storms off the Pacific has put a serious dent in the drought. Here's an overview from AerisWeather meteorologist D.J. Kayser: "This weeks Drought Monitor marks the first time since the March 29, 2011 issuance that there is no exceptional drought anywhere in the U.S. For California, it is the first time since the January 21, 2014 issuance with no exceptional drought in the state. California is also down to only 2.16% of the state under extreme drought this week. The last time they had no extreme drought across the state was the August 6, 2013 issuance." Map credit: Aeris Maps Platform. California Drought Shrinks to Smallest Level in Years After Onslaught of Rain and Snow. Jason Samenow has details at Capital Weather Gang: "A year ago, exceptional drought — the most serious kind — covered 40 percent of California. As of Thursday, following weeks of heavy rain storms and massive dumps of mountain snow, exceptional drought has vacated the state. The intensity and coverage of California’s drought has shrunk dramatically since October when 80 percent of the state was declared a drought area by the U.S. government’s Drought Monitor. Now just about half the state has drought conditions — entirely focused in central and southern California. The Drought Monitor indicated that Northern California was drought-free two weeks ago..."

It validates a total of 50-60 or more across the Deep South last weekend, including Florida. Here are Dan's comments: "Here's what I could gather from the other NWS offices that service Georgia: 22+ tornadoes in the Peachtree City, GA NWS service area - covers most of central and northern GA. 4 tornadoes in the Tallahassee, FL NWS service area (3 in GA, including one that killed 11 people, and 1 in AL) - they cover SW GA and west FL and far southeast AL.   0 tornadoes in the Jacksonville, FL NWS service area - covers far southeast GA and northeast FL   4 tornadoes in the Charleston, SC NWS service area - covers area around Savannah, GA and far south SC. So the total for GA alone is 29..." The Science Behind GOES-16's Color Composite Imagery. NOAA NESDIS explains why GOES-16 creates a superior "true color" image: "...The composite color images from GOES-16, however, are created by combining data from the satellite's 16-band Advanced Baseline Imager to produce a range of colors within visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (think the colors of the rainbow, ROYGBIV). The end product is an image much closer to what a human eye would see from space. âYet, as mesmerizing as GOES-16's color images are, the fact is that meteorologists don't always want to view the Earth and its atmosphere this way. This explains why GOES-16 carries an imager with 16 spectral bands as opposed to a camera..." Floods, Damaging Winds Most Destructive Natural Hazards in 2016. Claims Journal has some statistics about last year's storms I haven't seen anywhere else: "At $17 billion, total flood loss in 2016 was six times greater than the overall flood damage experienced in 2015. Five flood-related events in 2016 exceeded $1 billion in losses, including: The Louisiana flood in August with losses estimated at more than $10 billion. Hurricane Matthew in October with losses estimated at $3 billion. As of December 7, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) had received more the 10,000 claims and paid more than $70 million to policyholders and victims in the five-state area. The Sabine River Basin flood in East Texas and Louisiana in March with losses estimated at $1.3 billion. The Houston flood in April with losses estimated at $1.2 billion.

Only You Can Stop "Vacation Weather Shaming" I do the weather for free because I'm smitten by Mother Nature. They pay me to put up with the abuse. This is the time of year when friends, family and utter strangers share warm weather vacation taunts - there's more than a little gloating going on. "Paul, it's Tom in Scottsdale, where it's a balmy 66 degrees. How's the weather up in Minnesota?" Click. "Hi Paul, it's Joan in San Diego, where my 4-year old actually FORGOT how to put on a jacket. Isn't that PRECIOUS?" Uh huh. Heidi texted me from Cabo, complaining about high winds and rough seas for fishing. "Is your weather app right? Will winds die down?" God help me.My favorite is spring break trips in March. The greater the difference in temperature between Minnesota and the destination - the happier they are. Sad! Hey, we're thrilled you're going on a warm weather vacation. Just....keep it to yourself. Building to the Sky, with a Plan for Rising Waters. The New York Times reports on a growing trend: "...Along coastlines and lake shores and riverfronts across the country, tenants and homeowners, regulators and planners, private developers and public institutions are embracing the accumulating evidence of climate change and fortifying buildings and infrastructure against rising sea levels and ever more intense storms. To an extent that would have been unimaginable before Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, resilient design has entered the vocabulary of architects and engineers in parts of the country at risk of inundation..."

Details via Temblor.net: "The San Francisco Seawall was a key factor in turning San Francisco into the prosperous city it is today. Its construction, which took place from 1879-1916 allowed for tidal marshlands to be turned into the Embarcadero, and over 500 acres of downtown San Francisco. However, the Seawall is at risk from a serious threat, earthquakes. Last July, in a joint venture by GHD and GTC, two engineering consultants, a report on the Seawall’s earthquake vulnerability was prepared for the Port of San Francisco. In it, they highlighted the “greater than expected risk to the Seawall,” and strategies which could be taken to seismically retrofit it. This report, and more, was further highlighted at the 14th Annual Northern California Earthquake Hazards Workshop at NASA this last Tuesday and Wednesday..."

In fact, Republican governors in the Midwest are prioritizing economic growth and job creation by accelerating investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. In the few weeks after the election, leaders in Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan have adopted new policies that help tackle climate change and grow the clean energy economy..." Americans Overwhelmingly Support Clean Energy. Quartz reports: "...Just 27% of Americans surveyed this month by the Pew Research Center, a think tank, said they thought the US should prioritize expanding the coal, oil, and gas industries, while 65% thought alternatives like wind and solar should be the priority. (The remainder of the 1,502 US adults Pew surveyed didn’t express an opinion.) Those under 50, in particular, leaned toward cleaner forms of energy, with 73% favoring renewables. In the over-50 age group the majority was still in favor of expanding renewables, though by a smaller margin..." Photo credit: "Which do you back?" (Reuters/Brian Snyder). Trump Infrastructure Priority Plan Includes Transmission, Wind, Energy Storage. An "all of the above" strategy, including clean renewables? I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Here's an excerpt from Utility Dive: "...Trump's infrastructure wish list includes many provisions observers would expect — the document is heavy on the bridges and road projects he promised throughout the campaign would create jobs for Americans.  Those in the utility industry who hoped that affinity for big infrastructure projects would translate into power sector programs may take heart in the document released by McClatchy on Tuesday. Just how the Trump administration plans to encourage the projects remains unclear, but it could give an indication of the White House's priorities. Of the 50 infrastructure projects, seven focus on the electricity sector..." Tentative Infrastructure Priority List is here. Big Oil Roars Back. Texas Monthly has the story; here's an excerpt: "...But as 2017 begins, the outlook is radically different. Prices seem to have stabilized (albeit at half their mid-2014 level), and Donald Trump has tapped two prominent Texans with deep energy-industry ties for his Cabinet. Pending their respective confirmations (which had not been completed when Texas Monthly went to press), ExxonMobil chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson will be our next secretary of state, and former governor Rick Perry will run the Department of Energy. And an almost-Texan—Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt—has been nominated as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, where he would likely pursue a pro-oil agenda. After eight years of the cold shoulder, fossil fuels are back in vogue in Washington. “It’s a complete U-turn from the previous administration,” says Craig Pirrong, the director of the University of Houston’s Global Energy Management Institute..."

In a chat with Gizmodo Musk shares his views about pricing carbon and Exxon's Rex Tillerson at Secretary of State: "...My tweets speak for themselves. Please read them exactly as they are written. Tillerson obviously did a competent job running Exxon, one of the largest companies in the world. In that role, he was obligated to advance the cause of Exxon and did. In the Sec of State role, he is obligated to advance the cause of the US and I suspect he probably will. Also, he has publicly acknowledged for years that a carbon tax could make sense. There is no better person to push for that to become a reality than Tillerson. This is what matters far more than pipelines or opening oil reserves. The unpriced externality must be priced..."

Unlike a suit designed for extra-vehicular activity, it can’t shield astronauts from micro meteoroids or keep them from being baked like a potato by solar radiation. They’ll wear it primarily during launches and re-entries, when they face the greatest risk of something going wrong. “The nickname for it in the Apollo era was the ‘get me down quick suit,’ says Nicholas de Monchaux, who wrote Spacesuit: Fashioning Apollo, a book about spacesuit design..."

Here's an excerpt from The Daily Home: "...Serious scientists and public health leaders, and Pentagon leaders, are gravely concerned about climate change. We fear that the violent storms, floods, droughts, sea level rise and loss of agriculture associated with climate change will cause migrations hundreds of times larger than the displacement from Syria. An important aspect of this is that I really want to acknowledge and to thank meteorologists for very important work and outreach informing the public about weather threats. I would assert that both physicians and meteorologists are in a daunting and sacred position between people and the world of science. In meteorology the systemic disorder is climate heating as a result of climate forcing gases. I worry deeply about the future of my country, about environment and health, about our economy and about our security threats. Some will likely say that it is not meteorologists’ job to report on longer-term and global threats, such as climate. In response here’s a medical story..." Rain from Thunderstorms is Rising Due To Climate Change. Something I've been witnessing for the better part of 15 years, and I'm hardly the only meteorologist tracking these trends. Scientific American has the story: "Across a vast swath of Europe and Asia, rain is increasingly falling in the short, localized bursts associated with thunderstorms, seemingly at the expense of events where a steady rain falls over many hours, a new study finds. The study, detailed Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, directly links this trend to the warming and moistening of the atmosphere caused by rising greenhouse gas levels. The results fit with rainfall trends already observed in the U.S., as well as model predictions that massive rains associated with thunderstorms could become both more frequent and more intense in the U.S. as the world continues to heat up. The shift toward more extreme rains could have implications for water management and flooding because the ground is less able to absorb rainwater when it falls all at once..." As Climate Change Accelerates, Floating Cities Look Like Less of a Pipe Dream. Here's an excerpt from The New York Times: "You might call it a Noah’s Ark for an era of melting polar ice sheets. An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward, with the government of French Polynesia agreeing to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. The project is being put forward by a California nonprofit, the Seasteading Institute, which has raised about $2.5 million from more than 1,000 interested donors. Randolph Hencken, the group’s executive director, said work on the project could start in French Polynesia as early as next year, pending the results of some environmental and economic feasibility studies..."

The Wall Street Journal reports: "...An Environmental Protection Agency spokesman denied media reports from earlier this week that Mr. Trump’s administration was going to imminently delete the EPA’s website on climate change. Meanwhile, incoming Trump officials at agencies including the Interior Department, Agriculture Department and the EPA have demanded a cessation of certain public communication, prompting outcries from some congressional Democrats and progressive interest groups. With nearly seven days under Mr. Trump’s belt as president, many experts say the new administration’s moves aren’t that different from past transitions of power.

What has changed, some say, is a rapid-fire social-media scene and a new president facing opposition not seen in decades. Trump Sparks Fear of War on Science. Here's an excerpt from TheHill: "...The Associated Press reported Thursday that advisers have eyed a two-thirds reduction in the agency’s staffing, a possibility that would upset the EPA’s mission and one that has unnerved federal employees. Those moves come in contrast to the strategy employed by the George W. Bush administration, which used appropriations to pump funding into federal science programs, according to Matt Owens, the vice president for federal relations and administration at the Association of American Universities. Bush oversaw a doubling of the National Institutes of Health budget, an expansion of interagency research activities and a bump up in budgets at the National Science Foundation and the Energy Department, Owens noted..." Exxon Praises "Monumental" Paris Agreement in Signal to Trump. Call me crazy but this is a pretty big deal. Bloomberg has the story: "Exxon Mobil Corp., the U.S. oil giant that’s facing investigations over what it knew and when about climate change, sees the Paris agreement to mitigate global warming as a “monumental” achievement, according to a top executive. The company supports the December 2015 Paris accord as a “very meaningful and constructive process,” William M. Colton, Exxon’s vice president for corporate strategic planning, said in an interview in Berlin on Wednesday. Adhering to the accord’s commitments are achievable and compatible with Exxon’s business strategy, he said. President Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, former Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, cleared a key confirmation hurdle Tuesday in Washington, overcoming objections that his appointment would threaten climate-change efforts..."

Dr. John Abraham at the University of St. Thomas reports for The Guardian: "...When you use the recommended time period, it turns out that 2015 was the first year on record that passed the 1°C (1.8°F) mark. It means that 2016 was approximately 0.1°C (0.2°F) warmer than we had thought relative to the pre-industrial time period. To put this in perspective, it is almost an extra decade of warming. Why does this matter? Well it means that we have about a decade less time to act on climate change if we are going to avoid the most serious consequences. It means we simply have no time to waste, and no room for error. It also means that even if we take action right now, there will be consequences. That said, it is better in the long run to act now than to wait. The people denying or delaying action are costing us, and our future generation much in terms of financial, social, and human capital..." (File image: University of Wisconsin - Madison CIMSS). Good Luck Silencing Science. Here's an excerpt from techcrunch.com: "...There’s a word for that — a word frequently misused these days, but the correct word in this case: censorship.

The Streisand effect has for years proven the stronger force than even the most dedicated of information wranglers. But it won’t even get to that stage. You can’t just tell science to shut up. Climate change in particular is a nasty one to try to put to bed. It’s taken decades of research by thousands upon thousands of scientists all over the globe to arrive and strengthen the theory (in the sense that gravity and evolution are also theories) of anthropogenic climate change, or global warming if you prefer.

It is a dangerous cocktail for German industry. Photos REUTERS January 28, 2017  02:29 AM Print Feedback Comment It has been quite a scene at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York recently, with a never-ending parade of stretch limousines and armored S-Class Mercedes pulling up to the building. The heads of Ford, Tesla, Boeing and dozens of other companies have all dropped by for an audience with Donald Trump. The president has consistently gushed about the "great meetings," but little more than silence could be heard from the other side. Behind the scenes, this much has become clear: They didn't come for negotiations or even to offer advice to the new president. They came to hedge their bets. They are on the defensive, in the hopes that Trump will be less aggressive with those who he knows. Senior executives in Germany have been keeping close tabs on the stream of visitors heading for an audience with Trump, full of concern and nervous about what the future might hold. They have refrained from speaking about Trump publicly, but internally, it's the only thing they are talking about. There is significant fear that they too might become Trump targets. Nobody knows what rules are still valid in this new political era, one in which billions in value can be destroyed by a single tweet. An era in which it is no longer clear who is a friend and who is an enemy. It is an era that began on Donald Trump's first day in the White House, when he turned away from what has been the global economy's most important motor for decades: free trade and globalization no longer have any place in America's new populism. Trump immediately backed out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and is intent on renegotiating other such free trade deals, these "horrible deals," which he sees as the source of America's downfall. "This wave of globalization has wiped out totally, totally, our middle class," he said while on the campaign trail. On the same Monday, he received dozens of America's most important executives, representatives of the country's leading economic sectors. Trump called it a "listening session," but he didn't appear to be the one interested in listening. Rather, it was the business leaders who were to receive the new rules of this new era. "America first," is the only relevant philosophy, and those who go along will be rewarded by way of massive tax cuts and investments. Those who resist will be punished, with tariffs, special taxes, government reprisals and, more than anything, the fury of the president -- announced on Twitter and followed by a plunge in the stock price on Wall Street. Attack on the German Model Trump's first week was a power play, full of attempts at intimidation and threats. It was a week that raised new, fundamental questions: Can Trump really suspend the fundamental rules of economics, which force multinational corporations to maximize profits and minimize costs? Can globalization be reversed through a few tweets? And most importantly, is the U.S. president risking a global trade war so that he can impose his domestic agenda? For the moment, the answers to these questions appear to be: Yes. The consequences of this radical political shift are not limited to the United States. When the world's largest and most influential economy makes changes, the shockwaves can be felt everywhere. A new economic world order is coming into being. And it is an attack on the German model. In his campaign speeches and tirades against globalization, Trump primarily identified China and Mexico as his enemies, but Germany, a nation of exports, is likely to be third on that list. No other large economy is more reliant on the free exchange of goods and services, on border-free trade and barrier-free exports, than the German economy. DER SPIEGEL It is becoming apparent that Trump's presidency represents a break in the trans-Atlantic relationship, the kinds of which hasn't been seen since World War II. With a U.S. president who openly threatens a German carmaker with punitive tariffs of 35 percent, one who warns that the Germans were "very unfair to the U.S.," it could even mark a shift from friendship to animosity. In corporate headquarters and in Angela Merkel's Chancellery, executives and government officials are considering how best to stand up to this challenge. Is it better to remain composed and unperturbed, relying on rationality, on the strength of decades of ties and on the rules of the global economy? Or would it be better to prepare countermeasures, search for new allies in, for example, Asia or perhaps even to take advantage of the vacuum that is being created? Either way, with the world looking more fragile than it has in quite some time, there is a lot at stake. The consequences of an economic crisis or even a trade war would likely be disastrous for Germany, particularly with elections approaching in autumn. Right-wing populists, who would love to see Trumpism imported to Germany, would be certain to take advantage of any economic downturn by posing as the champions of the victims of globalization. Much will depend on the economic recipes that Trump ultimately mixes together and the effects they will have -- whether the U.S. economy will begin to wobble or whether it will actually become stronger, at least for a time. Tax cuts and additional government spending would usher in a period of sustained economic growth. That, at least, is what the new president is promising, and the stock markets seem inclined to believe him. Optimists believe that good times are on their way and that if the American economy does well, Trump's threats will quickly fade. A Clear Signal However, most economists believe that anti-globalization policies can only end in a global trade war that would kill corporate innovation and plunge the entire world economy into a recession. The pessimists are concerned. The worse the American economy fares, the more radical will be the measures taken by President Trump. In the first week of his presidency, Trump began putting together his team, charged with transforming his course campaign rhetoric into clear plans for financial and tax policy and for the Fed, for industry and for trade. To do so, he has not surrounded himself with the country's best economists as his predecessor did. That too is a clear signal. Instead, Trump is relying almost exclusively on "businessmen:" men who have made billions, or at least millions, on the free market. They are not all committed to the same ideological course. On the contrary. Some are in favor of protectionism while others are considered to be adherents of globalization. Some want an enormous state-sponsored infrastructure program while others want to see radical spending cuts. Some want to unleash the markets while others are in favor of state regulation of key industries. Some are arch-conservatives while others are liberal. It is -- intentionally -- unclear who will emerge victorious. The president has divided the influence of his advisers across several power centers. In the end, only one person will decide how to proceed, likely on an ad hoc basis, largely dependent on his mood. Unpredictability is one of the tenants of Trumpism. Contradictions and conflicts are intentionally fostered. Basically, though, Trump's team, regardless of ideological proclivities, can be divided into two camps. On the one side is a random collection of speculators and crisis profiteers, provocateurs and extremists. The chair of the Council of Economic Advisors will likely be a television host. On questions of monetary policy, he relies on an arch-conservative lobbyist who wants to reintroduce the gold standard. An oil industry billionaire advises him on energy policy. On the other side, Wall Street is celebrating its political resurrection. Steven Mnuchin is to become Secretary of the Treasury, a man who was long a partner and board member at Goldman Sachs. Head of the National Economic Council is Gary Cohn, who was chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs until a short time ago. His chief political strategist Stephen Bannon was once a Goldman Sachs executive. During the campaign, Trump constantly attacked Hillary Clinton for her close ties to the financial industry. And many of his followers see Wall Street as the core of the conspiracy against American citizens and as the driving force behind the hated establishment. Such crass contradictions show how deeply dissatisfied Americans are with the slow economic growth that characterized the Obama years. They long for an economic boom and for the growth rates seen in decades past -- and are willing to accept any means necessary. An Historic High Stock markets and consumers seem unconcerned that many of the key elements of Trump's economic plan don't fit together, or even cancel each other out. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones climbed to an historic high. Consumer confidence is higher than it has been since before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Their enthusiasm is driven by expectations of trillions of dollars in tax cuts, particularly for corporations. The cuts are supposed to encourage both companies and individuals to invest and consume, with the hope that the resulting economic growth will produce sufficient tax revenues to pay for the cuts. SPIEGEL ONLINE Larry Kudlow, designated head of the Council of Economic Advisors, promises that the tax cuts will "really put a booster rocket underneath this economy" and produce growth rates of up to 5 percent. Growth, he says, solves all problems, including the budget deficit. Such concepts are not new. Ronald Reagan made "supply side economics" popular in the early 1980s. But they didn't work quite as planned. To be sure, the massive tax cuts produced economic growth rates of over 3 percent. But at the same time, the U.S. developed sovereign debt higher than anywhere else in the world along with an enormous budget deficit. Later, one of the architects of Reaganomics, a domestic policy advisor to the president in the 1980s, wrote a book pillorying the supply side approach, saying that the strategy had been a "failure." Reagan's successor, George H. W. Bush, even referred to Reagan's policies as "voodoo economics." Bush felt impelled to significantly increase taxes. As such, economists are extremely concerned, regardless of their political affiliations, that Trumponomics could end just as disastrously as Reaganomics in the long term -- with enormous budget deficits, an even more rapidly shrinking middle class and a deeply wounded economy. Perhaps even with a stock market crash. Nikolaus von Bomhard, chairman of the board at the reinsurance giant Munich Re, believes the recent stock market upturn to be excessive. He finds it particularly regrettable that "a part of the price movements will prove expensive, coming at the cost of engagement against climate change and its consequences." He says that if Trump expands infrastructure investments and reduces taxes while pursuing protectionism at the same time, it will drive sovereign debt and inflation in addition to the desired economic growth. "There will be huge disappointment," says Edmund Phelps, a Nobel laureate for economics and director of the Center on Capitalism and Society at Columbia University. He warns that a "deep recession," could result. The worse the U.S. economy, the more likely Trump will be to target his putative enemies from abroad. His policies are likely to become more aggressive, including punitive measures against foreign "dumping" and attacks on all those companies who build their new factories in Mexico instead of Milwaukee. Peter Navarro, a professor at the University of California in Irvine, is responsible for developing these policies. He is head of the newly created National Trade Council. Navarro is an outsider in several different ways. He is the only economist on the president's team. And he is almost the only economist in the U.S. who fundamentally believes that free trade is a bad idea and who favors tough punitive tariffs. China is a danger, says Navarro, a country that doesn't play by the rules. He even produced a documentary film called "Death by China." 1 | 2 Next Part 1: Trump's Attack on Germany and the Global Economy Part 2: German Automakers at Risk Article...

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) and its largest union said on Friday they had agreed on a February date for a union vote at Boeing's jetliner factory in South Carolina, setting up what is likely to be a fresh battle between the union and the world's biggest plane maker. International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers spokesman Mike Evans said in a statement that about 2,850 workers at the factory that builds 787 Dreamliners would be eligible to vote on union representation in the Feb. 15 ballot. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said the company is "strongly encouraging all eligible teammates, roughly 3,000, to be sure to vote." The machinists canceled an earlier vote set for April 2015 citing a "a toxic environment" and violations of workers' rights to organize, in the strongly anti-union state. At the time, union organizers described the decision as a tactical move, allowing time to build union support. Boeing called the union's allegations of intimidation "frivolous." South Carolina is a state where employees are not required to join unions or pay dues. It has among the lowest rates of union membership in the United States. Evans, in the statement, cited fresh "intimidation tactics" against organizing by Boeing. Boeing said it has hired a lawyer it used when workers tried to unionize in 2015. "Boeing is applying the appropriate resources to protect the competitive advantage created by the Boeing South Carolina (BSC) team," the company said in a statement.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:10 AM, January 28, 2017 WASHINGTON - Boeing Co <BA.N> has been awarded a $2.1 billion U.S. defense contract for 15 KC-46 aerial refueling aircraft, the Pentagon said on Friday. The new agreement is in addition to the initial $4.2 billion contract awarded by the Air Force to develop and test the aircraft, and an earlier $2.8 billion award for 19 planes. Boeing expects to build a substantial business from the tanker, which is based on its twin-aisle 767 commercial jet. Boeing plans to deliver 179 tankers to the U.S. Air Force and expects to sell about 400 in total worldwide. The fixed-cost contract has incurred about $2.4 billion in cost over runs, including a $201 million after-tax charge Boeing announced on Wednesday. Boeing said it expects to deliver the first tankers to the Air Force in late 2017. On Wednesday, Boeing posted fourth quarter profits and operating cash that beat analysts' estimates and said it expected to generate a record $10.75 billion in operating cash this year.

Image: AP By Brett Williams2017-01-27 23:28:04 UTC Over the past few days, some of the biggest questions about our national cybersecurity have centered on one device: President Donald Trump's phone.  Shortly after he reportedly traded in his main Twitter machine, an old-model, unsecured Android phone, for a "secure, encrypted device approved by the Secret Service," the famously tech averse executive appeared to still be using the unsecured device. This made waves in intelligence and security circles, as the risks of the president of the United States using a potentially vulnerable device are extensive.     We know about Trump's Android fixation — but what about the specialized presidential handset he might be stiffing? SEE ALSO: Trump's cyber advisor didn't know about Signal According to an exclusive report from Defense One, that device is a modified Boeing Black, a super secure Android device for Top Secret data designed to self-destruct at the first sign of tampering. The presidential model was developed by Boeing and the Defense Department Information Systems Agency (DISA) and “goes with the office,” per DISA officials speaking to Defense One on background. The phone has limited functionality, opting instead for a locked-down, heavily encrypted user experience. When Boeing filed plans for the Black with the FCC in 2014, the device supported two SIM cards and functionality on GSM, WCDMA and LTE networks, along with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.  According to statements made by DISA chief Lt. General Alan Lynn, the presidential version of the Black "has a large amount of encryption tied to it" and is “close to a VDI,” or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure. This means the phone acts more like an extended viewer of another device, displaying the data kept there rather than storing any potentially vulnerable information itself.  Defense One's sources claim that two of the secure devices were in the hands of high-level personnel, then-President Obama and Cyber Command head Admiral Mike Rogers. It's not a stretch to imagine its the device that Obama described as a toy phone in an interview with Jimmy Fallon (jump to the 2:30 mark in the clip). If President Trump is in fact still tweeting from a personal device (as evidence from his timeline and reports seem to corroborate), it's unlikely he has adopted the Boeing Black full time. After all, that type of secure system won't run Twitter — and the president has made it clear he will continue using the platform no matter what, even if he destroys it.   Maybe that's the only way to get Trump on a secure network: If you can find a way to support Twitter, he might just pick it up.

5 Menu Close Data TribTalk Directory Projects Newsletters Events Legislature Donate Pentagon launches review of costs of F-35, largely built in Texas Secretary of Defense James Mattis on Thursday reportedly ordered a review of costs associated with the F-35 fighter plane, a key economic driver in the state of Texas. by Abby LivingstonJan. 27, 2017 12:51 PM   Fort Worth residents posed for photos on Dec. 21, 2016, with a model of the F-35 fighter plane, which is manufactured at a Lockheed Martin plant in the city. Abby Livingston WASHINGTON — Newly installed Secretary of Defense James Mattis ordered on Thursday a review of costs associated the F-35 fighter plane, a key economic driver in Texas.  In a memorandum to a subordinate, Mattis wrote that the F-35 "warrants a detailed assessment to reduce associated costs," according to a memo obtained by Defense One News. He further ordered a review to compare the F-35 to another aircraft, the Boeing-manufactured Super Hornet.  The F-35 is vital to the economy of Fort Worth, where a massive Lockheed Martin plant assembles the plane. But it has also long been an incredibly controversial military project.  Budget hawks in recent years have painted the plane as an example of government and defense contracting excess, deriding it a boondoggle with cost and schedule overruns.   The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. But F-35 advocates fiercely defend the plane, calling it a modern marvel of military technology. They argue the F-35 is essential to maintaining American air superiority over Russia and China and that current military planes are aging and a danger to personnel. And comparisons to Boeing's Super Hornet make the F-35 backers bristle.  The directive comes after weeks of drama over the plane emerging from then-President-elect Donald Trump's Twitter account. Since December, he's met with the leaders of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.  Mattis praised the plane during his Senate confirmation hearing, but the memorandum is in line with several of Trump's pronouncements of reining in costs.  The F-35 has enormous political support from Texas. U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Clarendon, is the committee chairman charged with congressional oversight of the Pentagon. U.S. Rep. Kay Granger, a Fort Worth Republican who represents the Lockheed plant, is the chairwoman of the House subcommittee that oversees defense spending.   Read more:  Trumps tweets on the F-35 rattle Fort Worth.

Mattis asked Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work to conduct a review of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program to find ways to "significantly reduce" the costs. He said the review should compare the F-35 with the F/A-18 Super Hornet and determine if an upgraded Hornet could be a cost effective alternative that also meets requirements. Mattis also asked for a review of the presidential aircraft program -- known as Air Force One -- to identify cost savings. Boeing is slated to build two new planes to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. The new aircraft would go into service around 2024. Mattis' orders come after Trump's tweets in December revealing that he asked Boeing to "price-out" a comparable Super Hornet became of cost overruns in Lockheed Martin's F-35. The stealthy F-35 has a nearly $400 billion price tag. Three versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy are being built, and other countries, including Israel, are buying the fighter jet. Despite the huge cost, the program has strong bipartisan support in Congress, where lawmakers view the aircraft as essential to U.S. national security. Trump also tweeted last month that the costs of the new Air Force One were "out of control." He demanded: "Cancel order!" Last March, the Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. The Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at about $4 billion, when research and development, construction and future maintenance were included. The Air Force has pressed for a faster replacement schedule, saying the aging current Boeing 747s are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. While Mattis, Trump and the Pentagon can push for deep cuts or even try to cancel the program, Congress controls the government's purse strings and makes final budget decisions. Donald Trump called Park Service in effort to disprove inauguration crowd photos Published: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 5:27 PM Updated: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 5:27 PM By: Theresa Seiger - Cox Media Group National Content Desk WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 20: Attendees line the Mall as they watch ceremonies to swear in Donald Trump on Inauguration Day on January 20, 2017 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Lucas Jackson - Pool/Getty Images) (Pool) President Donald Trump personally contacted the National Park Service on his first full day in office in hopes of putting to rest reports that his inauguration was not as well attended as his predecessor's, according to multiple reports. >> Read more trending stories In a phone call made Saturday, Trump asked acting National Park Service director Michael Reynolds for images of the crowds gathered on the National Mall for his inauguration, The Washington Post reported. He also took the Park Service to task for retweeting a pair of side-by-side photos of the Mall taken before his and before former President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration. The images showed a much larger crowd at Obama's inauguration. >> Related: Trump accuses media of lying about inauguration crowd The request surprised Reynolds, but he sent additional photos of the crowd along as requested, according to the Post. "The photos, however, did not prove Trump's contention that the crowd size was upward of 1 million," the newspaper reported. The Park Service does not release crowd estimates. White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed to CNN that the call took place. She said it was an example of the hands-on style that Trump has brought to the White House. >> Related: Whose inauguration crowd was bigger, Trump or Obama? "If he sees an issue, he is going to take action and do something to fix it," she told CNN. The Park Service declined to comment. Trump has slammed media organizations that reported on inauguration attendance, saying Saturday that reports that his inauguration was less attended than those of previous presidents are outright lies. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer repeated the assertion during a strained news conference later that day. >> Related: 'Alternative facts' like differing weather reports, Sean Spicer claims "Photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, in one particular tweet, to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall," he said. "That was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe." The claim earned a "Pants on Fire" rating from Politifact, the category used by the fact-checking group to denote statements it deems to be the most outrageous lies.

It will set in motion the construction of his proposed border wall, a key promise from his 2016 campaign. (AP Photo/Christian Torres) President Donald Trump’s plan to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall could cost U.S. taxpayers $120 per household, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The per household estimate is based on Congressional Republicans’ estimates that the cost to build the wall without Mexico’s help could add as much as $15 billion to the national debt, and the latest Census data on the number of U.S. households, according to the non-profit, bipartisan public policy organization that addresses federal budget and fiscal issues. >> Read more trending stories >>Trump's wall by the numbers Trump vowed earlier this week to make good on one of his biggest campaign promises to build a wall to seize control of the border to stop illegal crossings and drug smuggling. He continues to insist that Mexico will pay for the wall, but Mexico opposes the wall and has said repeatedly that it won’t pay for it. Still, Trump said construction would begin as soon as possible using government funds, and has proposed a 20 percent tax on all imported goods from Mexico to pay for the border wall. Ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev: 'Looks like the world is preparing for war' Published: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 1:04 PM Updated: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 1:04 PM By: Theresa Seiger - Cox Media Group National Content Desk BERLIN, GERMANY - NOVEMBER 09: Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev attends celebrations for the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate on November 9, 2014 in Berlin, Germany. The city of Berlin is commemorating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall from November 7-9 with an installation of 6,800 lamps coupled with illuminated balloons along a 15km route where the Wall once ran and divided the city into capitalist West and communist East. The fall of the Wall on November 9, 1989, was among the most powerful symbols of the revolutions that swept through the communist countries of Eastern Europe and heralded the end of the Cold War. Built by the communist authorities of East Germany in 1961, the Wall prevented East Germans from fleeing west and was equipped with guard towers and deadly traps. (Photo by Adam Berry/Getty Images) (Adam Berry) Mikhail Gorbachev, the former leader of the Soviet Union, on Thursday urged nations to denounce nuclear weapons and warned that it "looks as if the world is preparing for war" in an opinion piece in Time magazine. >> Read more trending stories The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner, who served as the Soviet Union's leader from 1988 until the country's dissolution in 1991, urged the United Nations – and U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladmir Putin, in particular – to denounce nuclear war. "Politicians and military leaders sound increasingly belligerent and defense doctrines more dangerous," Gorbachev wrote. "Commentators and TV personalities are joining the bellicose chorus. It all looks as if the world is preparing for war." Thousands of troops and dozens of tanks have been deployed to eastern Europe in recent weeks, the largest such deployment since the Cold War, BBC News reported. Gorbachev said Russian and NATO soldiers are being deployed closer to one another "as if to shoot point-blank." "Today … the nuclear threat once again seems real," he wrote. "Relations between the great powers have been going from bad to worse for several years now. The advocates for arms build-up and the military-industrial complex are rubbing their hands." Trump took to Twitter in December to throw his support behind expanding the United States' nuclear arsenal. The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump later told MSNBC that he was unconcerned by worries about a possible global arms race. "Let it be an arms race," he said. "We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all." Gorbachev said Trump and Putin have a special responsibility to condemn nuclear war because the U.S. and Russia control more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear arsenals. "In (the) modern world, wars must be outlawed, because none of the global problems we are facing can be resolved by war — not poverty, nor the environment, migration, population growth or shortages of resources," Gorbachev wrote. Philadelphia mayor: Donald Trump lied about increasing murder rate Published: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 11:41 AM Updated: Friday, January 27, 2017 @ 11:41 AM By: Theresa Seiger - Cox Media Group National Content Desk PHILADELPHIA, PA - JANUARY 26: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a luncheon at the Congress of Tomorrow Republican Member Retreat January 26, 2017 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Republican Congressional members gathered in Philadelphia to participate in the retreat. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) (Alex Wong) Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney took President Donald Trump to task on Thursday after the president claimed that the city's murder rate has been "terribly increasing," an assertion that the mayor called a "false claim." >> Read more trending stories Trump's statement came as he addressed congressional Republicans Thursday in Philadelphia for their annual retreat. "Here in Philadelphia, the murder rate has been steady -- I mean, just terribly increasing," Trump said. "And then you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago? I said the other day, what the hell is going on?" Kenney, a Democrat, challenged Trump's allegation, saying that the city's crime rate has reached its lowest point in 40 years. "President Trump's false statements today were an insult to the men and women of the Philadelphia police force – the very same men and women who are working long hours today to ensure his safety," Kenney said. "Our homicides are, in fact, slowly declining." The city's violent crime rate is at its lowest level since 1979, The Hill reported. The number of reported murders or homicides has significantly decreased over the last decade, according to records from the Philadelphia Police Department. In 2007, the department worked 391 murder reports. Preliminary numbers compiled by police showed that the number had fallen to 271 by 2016. Still, that figure was slightly higher than the number of homicides reported the year before, when 267 homicides were reported. Kenney said police "have worked tirelessly and with great personal sacrifice to get Philadelphia's crime rate down," but said their efforts were hampered by politics, including Trump's recent emphasis on immigration. "We are handicapped by Republican refusal to enact any kind of common-sense gun control and by their obsession with turning our police officers into ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents – which will prevent immigrants from coming forward to report crimes or provide critical witness statements that can put dangerous criminals behind bars," he said. Preliminary data from police shows that despite the recent trend, police have seen a slight increase in the number of homicides reported so far this year. Between Jan. 1 and Jan. 22, police dealt with 18 reported homicides. Over the same period in 2016, police had 15 homicide reports.

But that tone was in stark contrast to his messaging on Twitter and at a pre-presidential news conference, where he targeted some businesses for attack and embraced others. Trump assailed the pharmaceutical industry at his Jan 11 news conference, saying drug companies “are getting away with murder.” Key drug stocks immediately plummeted. The following day, Trump tweeted that Americans should “Buy L.L. Bean,” after thanking an L.L. Bean board and family member for her political support. With his tweet, he put an iconic Yankee company in the crosshairs of a polarized national discourse. Whether Trump has been testing messages to use as president or launching a regular practice, he has used his own “bully pulpit” to put some businesses on notice and to commend others. This approach is raising questions about what some economists call “crony capitalism” and also about quid-pro-quo politics, and it’s shaking up company executives who might otherwise be optimistic about pledges of economic growth. Seven years ago, the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision freed companies to engage in political spending. The cost of elections keeps surging with the 2016 presidential cycle nearing $7 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2012. Today, how will U.S. companies respond to rising concerns about bullying or favoritism in federal government intervention, and will Trump’s L.L. Bean endorsement provide a greater incentive to engage politically? U.S. corporate leaders from Carrier (HVAC manufacturing) to Boeing (aircraft manufacturing) and Ford (auto manufacturing) have been among those targeted by Trump as he presses his job-growth agenda. On Jan. 11, the nine top pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 by market cap lost a staggering $24.6 billion in 20 minutes during Trump’s press conference, according to one analysis. Trump said the drug companies charge the government too much for medicines. On Jan 12, Trump tweeted about L.L. Bean, which an anti-Trump group called Grab Your Wallet had added to its list of companies targeted for boycotting. An L.L. Bean official quickly reminded inquiring news media that the company makes “no political endorsements or contributions,” despite the fact that board member Linda Bean donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported Trump. A dynamic, growth-oriented capitalist system requires a level playing field in which companies focus on how best to compete in the marketplace, not in the political arena or with political money. A number of economists believe crony capitalism brings harmful uncertainty to U.S. companies. And there is academic research suggesting an association between government-induced risk and companies’ increased political donations. How, then, would U.S. companies respond to a new president’s bully pulpit? When he urges millions of Twitter followers to buy a company’s products in the wake of its board member’s political contributions, will business leaders see it as a quid-pro-quo endorsement? Or will they listen instead to the skeptical Trump who boasted on the campaign trail of giving money to politicians to get them to “do whatever the hell you want them to do,” while calling the existing campaign finance system “broken”? These aren’t idle questions, given what we’re seeing in company contributions to the Trump inauguration. According to news reports, Trump-target Boeing pledged $1 million. Chevron, which has a deep stake in the incoming administration’s energy and regulatory policies, gave $500,000. And AT&T, which is seeking to merge with Time Warner, has acknowledged that it contributed. It’s too early to tell what factors the new president and new Congress will take into account in making decisions about businesses. In the meantime, in the interest of promoting economic growth along with their own protection, businesses can take concrete steps to protect themselves, shareholders and our democracy. Being transparent about when they give political money and adopting clear policies for this spending are two of the most significant safeguards companies can adopt at a time when one of Citizens United’s central promises has not been fulfilled. In his Citizens United opinion for the court’s majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy unshackled companies to engage in almost unfettered political spending while asserting that modern technology has the potential to make “disclosures rapid and informative.” The latter promise has not been met. In large part due to Citizens United and other court rulings, the U.S. election cycle in 2016 broke spending records. Driving much of the record costs were outside groups not formally connected to either political party, including organizations not required under U.S. law to disclose their donors. These latter groups’ secretive political funds often are called “dark money.” Because these organizations may keep their donors anonymous, they are particularly attractive to like-thinking corporations and others who want to keep their donations under the radar. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, a powerful business trade association, is allowed under U.S. law to keep the sources of its political spending hidden. It spent almost $30 million on influencing 2016 House and Senate races. So-called “social welfare” groups run ads about hot issues, sometimes attacking candidates, and they are also permitted to hide donor identities. All told, political dark money was projected to add up to at least $132 million in 2016. Unfortunately, the promise of broad, effective disclosure that the Supreme Court embraced in Citizens United still seems remote. It is impossible to measure the total largesse of rivers of corporate political giving intended to influence elections. It is possible, however, by looking at disclosed spending, to get a sense of scale of corporate political engagement at another level: in the states, where more and more companies are turning for action. In the 2014 election cycle, business interests spent $1.1 billion on state candidates and committees. By comparison, in the same period labor groups spent $215 million and ideological or single-issue groups spent $137 million. When companies are transparent about their political contributions, they can protect against payments that might cause a backlash in our fiercely divided political climate, or an ill-considered payment that can damage their reputation. A clear policy on political spending can protect them against public or private pressure from a political candidate, allowing them to cite company policy in order to say “no.” These steps are getting mainstream traction from companies acting on their own. According to a recent nonpartisan report examining the S&P 500, 305 of these companies were disclosing some or all of their political payments. One hundred and eleven had policies requiring board oversight of political spending. And 143 had placed some level of restriction on their political spending. It looks like Trump will continue to use his bully pulpit to shame and blame companies, and concerns about crony capitalism will keep growing. If this happens, companies can protect themselves and their integrity by following guidance from Business Roundtable, which encourages company boards to oversee political spending and consider adopting a policy on disclosure.

January 2017 Norwegian will consolidate its position as one of the world’s fastest growing airlines when they use their new Boeing 737 Max. The company told CNN that they will receive the planes in May, 2017. ‘Norwegian will be the first airline to receive delivery of the Boeing (BA) 737 Max, and we will be the first airline to put this brand new aircraft type to use’, said the company in a statement. Norwegian has a total of 100 call options for this aircraft type, referred to as the next generation of short and medium distance flight aircraft. They say it will take some time before the new type is operational. To be first is not necessarily an advantage, since that would also make Norwegian the first to detect any weaknesses in the new model. Norwegian have already experienced that when they began using the Dreamliner aircraft in 2013. Norwegian plan to put 737 Max aircraft in flights on routes between Europe and smaller cities in the United States.   Source: NTB scanpix / Norway Today Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Related SHARE TWEET PIN SHARE Previous post Next post Related Articles Finance Opportunities for Norwegian oil companies in Iran Finance Norway lacks 1.200 billion pension News The Government will provide the unemployed with more targeted assistance News Afghan asylum seekers are fleeing from Norway Be the first to comment on "Norwegian will be first on the wing with new 737 Max aircraft" Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Why Analysts Are Still Chasing Caterpillar By Paul Ausick January 27, 2017 2:01 pm EST Print Email Tweet Among the 30 DJIA stocks, only The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), up 7.7%) and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM), up 7.27%, are having a better 2017 than Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT). And only by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (NYSE: DD) matches Cat’s 6.31% share price rise. Caterpillar beat quarterly and full-year earnings estimates, but came up a bit short on revenues when it reported results on Thursday. The company also lowered its earlier 2017 forecast to account for a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The company now expects full-year revenues of $36 to $39 billion ($37.5 billion at the midpoint of the range) and profit per share of $2.90, excluding restructuring costs of about $500 million. Analysts had forecast 2017 EPS at $3.04 and revenues of $37.99 billion. The revenue miss and the soft forecast has not slowed the bulls, however. The company’s December retail sales, though still down, are rising and infrastructure spending from the Trump administration is judged to herald better sales for the company’s heavy construction equipment. Analysts at Wells Fargo raised the company’s rating from Market Perform to Outperform and maintained its valuation range. Other analysts made similar moves: Baird raised its price target from $94 to $97 with a Neutral rating Barclays raised its price target from $96 to $100 with a rating of Equal Weight Citigroup raised its price target from $98 to $100 with a Neutral rating Deutsche Bank raised its price target from $104 to $108 with a Buy rating RBC raises price target from $82  to $85 Caterpillar traded at $98.51 early Friday afternoon after posting a new 52-week high of $99.46 earlier in the day. The 52-week low is $59.80 and the consensus analyst target price is $90.07.

Mattis asked Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work to conduct a review of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program to find ways to "significantly reduce" the costs. He said the review should compare the F-35 with the F/A-18 Super Hornet and determine if an upgraded Hornet could be a cost effective alternative that also meets requirements. Mattis also asked for a review of the presidential aircraft program -- known as Air Force One -- to identify cost savings. Boeing is slated to build two new planes to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. The new aircraft would go into service around 2024. Mattis' orders come after Trump's tweets in December revealing that he asked Boeing to "price-out" a comparable Super Hornet became of cost overruns in Lockheed Martin's F-35. The stealthy F-35 has a nearly $400 billion price tag. Three versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy are being built, and other countries, including Israel, are buying the fighter jet. Despite the huge cost, the program has strong bipartisan support in Congress, where lawmakers view the aircraft as essential to U.S. national security. Trump also tweeted last month that the costs of the new Air Force One were "out of control." He demanded: "Cancel order!" Last March, the Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. The Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at about $4 billion, when research and development, construction and future maintenance were included. The Air Force has pressed for a faster replacement schedule, saying the aging current Boeing 747s are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. While Mattis, Trump and the Pentagon can push for deep cuts or even try to cancel the program, Congress controls the government's purse strings and makes final budget decisions.

Mattis Takes Lead on Cost-Containment Effort The review will "determine opportunities" to cut F-35 costs "significantly" while "meeting requirements." While many berate Trump for looking into upgrades of the F/A-18 Super Hornet as a comparable alternative to the fifth-generation F-35, Mattis said that the review will investigate to what extent the Boeing-made Super Hornet can provide certain capabilities at reduced levels of military expenditure. The review will look into potential F/A-18 upgrades as well. © AP Photo/ Paul Beaty Boeing CEO Promises Trump Air Force One Will Be Less Than $4B Lockheed Martin and Boeing shares were both down Friday as of 1:30 p.m., Eastern Time. One official from the General Services Administration, which deals with procurement, told Sputnik News that research and development expenses are always factored into the price of an aircraft. The $100-$135 million price tag generally refers to just the production cost of an F-35, and this is usually what gets reported across media outlets, including here on Sputnik. In 2015, lawmakers authorized approximately $55 billion for research, development, and testing, in addition to $1.1 trillion for operations and maintenance. Lockheed Martin and Trump are "very close to a deal" Sputnik has reported that despite Trump’s claims to personally oversee “beautiful” cost-cutting measures, the price of the F-35 was already slated to drop in 2017. An executive from one of the anti-missile designers, private UK defense firm Chemring Group Plc, remarked that cost reductions were "a given, regardless of Trump," due to economies of scale. Officials leaked that the Pentagon and Lockheed would reach an accord on the tenth order of F-35s by the end of January. In a recent earnings call, Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said "President Trump recognizes the F-35 is a very large program—the largest in the Department of Defense," but promised shareholders and investors that lower F-35 costs would not contribute to "slashing our profit." © Photo: Youtube/arronlee33 China Prepares Secretive H-20 Strategic Stealth Bomber According to Hewson, the Joint Strike Fighter program is a "growth engine" for the defense mammoth. "We continue to see growing international demand for it," she said. Norway Will Ditch Old F-16 Fighting Falcon Fleet For F-35 Arrival Norwegian air squads will decommission a fleet of at least 50 aging F-16 Fighting Falcons to pave way for the arrival of new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Norwegian pilots have been training on F-35s at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona since 2015. This year, the highly-anticipated fifth-generation F-35s will make their debut in Norwegian air space. The Ministry of Defense is hoping that the move to scrap the F-16 squadron will pay off financially and politically. The politics of selling the F-16s to another party may be too complex, and Oslo does not prefer to front expensive maintenance costs to keep the F-16s as a reserve fighting fleet. The F-16 has been touted as the most combat-proven fourth generation fighter by its manufacturers, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. While officials cope with “out of control” costs of the F-35, which Trump hopes to lock-in for less than $100 million per aircraft, it is worth noting that, in the late 1990s, the price of an F-16 hovered between $14-$19 million. Three F-35s will be delivered to Norway this year, prompting the air force to lay the F-16 fleet to rest, Ministry of Defense officials said. Some F-16s will remain in operation until 2021 as more of the 52 F-35As ordered by Oslo make their way across the Atlantic Ocean.  © AP Photo/ Japan Finally Acquires First Beleaguered F-35 Joint Strike Fighter The Kingdom of Norway, instituted in 1905, has engaged in several armed conflicts since World War II. But Oslo has totaled just 10 casualties during these conflicts, all of which occurred during the War in Afghanistan, in which Oslo has supported US and NATO efforts against the Taliban. Oslo also contributed forces when NATO swooped into the Libyan Civil War. ...

(July 8, 2016) - Boeing's KC-46 air refueling tanker resumed testing with assistance from F-16 fighting falcons assigned to the 416th Flight Test Suadron at Edwards Air Force Base. (U.S. Air Force photo by Christopher Okula) Posted By: Oriana Pawlyk January 26, 2017 Boeing’s KC-46 refueling tanker program for the Air Force added a $312 million charge last quarter, bringing the total program cost overrun to $2.3 billion, according to the company’s 2016 final-quarter earnings report. The Chicago-based aerospace giant’s defense unit took a $69 million pre-tax charge for the quarter, while the commercial side retained a $243 million pre-tax charge, the report said.  After deducting the costs in taxes, the additional penalty totals $201 million, Defense News reported.   “We are disappointed with the tanker charge we took in the fourth quarter, but it’s well understood and defined,” CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters during a conference call Wednesday. “I will say that the nature of the risk on the program is clearly changing as expected, and we moved now from the development program into the initial production program,” he said. The Air Force awarded the Boeing a fixed-price $4.9 billion contract in 2011. Boeing is responsible for any cost overruns. The cost stemmed from problems with initial production, Muilenburg said.   “The charge we took in the fourth quarter was around the previously defined configuration changes, the wiring changes that you’ll recall from last year, now implementing those at the detail level in the initial production aircraft,” he said. WATCH: Air Force Looks Back on Six Decades of KC-135 Service “We have some job categories that are just taking longer than planned in terms of hours per job, and that’s what you see in the charge in the quarter. This is not new work,” Muilenburg said.   The program has suffered a handful of setbacks beginning in 2014. Known as the Pegasus, the aircraft experienced wiring issues, developmental and system problems, including a design flaw in the modified 767-based tanker’s refueling boom that came to light in 2016, causing the program to miss a major contract deadline with the Air Force. Still, Muilenburg said he remains hopeful for the program’s future. “We’ve completed all of the boom envelope testing as part of the development program, and we’ve closed out that risk. We’ve got five aircraft in flight test. We’ve completed more than 1,500 hours of flight testing, and we are steadily knocking out test points every day. So while we still have flight testing to go, it’s very clear now that we are not discovering new technical risks. It’s now about getting the first 18 aircrafts delivered,” he said. The Air Force last year awarded a $2.8 billion contract for the first 19 KC-46A. The service announced earlier this month it hopes to move 24 KC-46A tankers to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, and Travis Air Force Base, California, to replace current tanker fleets. Yet without a solid timeline for when the first KC-46 may be delivered, the Pegasus won’t even begin to join the Air Force’s fleet until at least 2019. Boeing plans to build 179 tankers for the service. Previous post About the Author Oriana Pawlyk Oriana Pawlyk is a reporter for Military.com. She can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

Add to My Group(s) View Ratings | Rate It opednews.com Headlined to H2 1/27/17 Senior Editor Become a Fan   (83 fans) - Advertisement - David Swanson (image by David Swanson)   License   DMCA   Details My guest today is blogger, peace activist activist, author, David Swanson. Joan Brunwasser: Welcome back to OpEdNews, David. We last spoke a few weeks before the election. I just read your new piece, Why Impeach Donald Trump? When you posted this, the guy had been in office two days. He clearly isn't widely liked but aren't you jumping the gun a bit? David Swanson: Speaking for myself and not for colleagues or organizations, much less George Soros from whom I've never received a dime ever (though apparently connecting him to some activist campaign serves some people as a refutation of its demands), I'd say we waited much too long. Some impeachable offenses were guaranteed on Day 1, but we didn't have to wait until Day 1 to know that. Under the Constitution, the president is not allowed financial gains or business favors from the U.S., state, or foreign governments. Trump's lease of the Old Post Office Building violates an explicit clause in the General Services Administration lease contract. Since 1980, Trump and his businesses have brought in $885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies from New York State. China's state-owned bank is the largest tenant in Trump Tower. It is also a major lender to Trump. These are a few examples of many. Now, days later, Trump has discriminated against Muslims in a new way with his ban on immigration from certain countries. And he's carried on the outrages of his predecessors with drone murders, bombing campaigns, and occupations. He's even apparently threatened to send troops into Chicago. So, I think the impeachable offenses are beginning to pile up. Chicago skyline (image by romanboed)   License   DMCA   Details - Advertisement - JB: Send troops into Chicago? I live in suburban Chicago. What did we do to deserve troops? DS: @RealDonaldTrump tweeted and @POTUS retweeted: "If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!" I tried hoping this meant lawyers, but everyone I asked assumed it meant soldiers. In addition Trump has announced an executive order to "target sanctuary cities" with Chicago chief among them. The details are unknown. He gets the corporate news coverage first, then tells you what the hell it actually is after. By the way, in Chicago you should do this peace essay. And sign this petition: Municipal Employees' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago Must Divest from Weapons Dealers. - Advertisement - JB: Thanks for the suggestions and the links. Well, in all fairness, Trump is not wrong that the constant shootings are appalling. It would be nice if he came up with something real and substantial and potentially constructive. Are we going to turn the poor areas into policed camps? Yikes! Back to the impeachment argument. Why Trump? Is he a target because he's so disliked? Is he worse than others before him? JB: I can't speak for all supporters of impeaching Trump. Most of them will have bad reasons, as most people have bad reasons for everything. Personally, I favor impeaching him for many of the same offenses, as noted above, for which I favored impeaching Obama and Bush. But the charges brought at http://ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.orgare unprecedented. His predecessors could not have been impeached for the same thing. Is his offense morally worse than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton taking Saudi government and Boeing funds into her family foundation, and then working to waive legal restrictions on Boeing selling weapons to Saudi Arabia -- weapons now being used to slaughter innocents? I don't think so. But it's in the same league and likely to be at least as deadly. Still, for everyone asking me if Trump's worse than those before him, there are 10,000 shouting at me that he's better than the guy who would come after him -- which, as with Cheney, misses the problem that Pence is already involved and seeing his agenda acted on. But the question of who is worse, Trump or Pence, is a very different question from this one: Who is worse, President Trump in an era of total unchecked power and immunity, or President Pence in an age of popular sovereignty with the threat of impeachment looming behind every high-crime-and-misdemeanor that comes up for consideration by the White House? I believe changing the office of the presidency into one that can be lost for substantive crimes and abuses -- a radical change from its current state -- would be more significant than the personality, ideology, or party of the presidents who come next. I believe part of that significance would derive from the benefits of building the movement that imposes impeachment on a corrupt and partisan and reluctant Congress. Cultural change comes principally from movement building, and very little from the personalities of elected officials. If Chicago, for example, passes a resolution demanding Trump's impeachment, it will be because a lot of people learned what was wrong and how to fix it. They won't forget that the moment Pence or someone else swears to uphold the Constitution as president. Donald Trump's current address (image by ThatMattWade)   License   DMCA   Details JB: Let's talk pragmatically. How does one go about impeaching a president? And, politically speaking, with the Republicans holding both houses of Congress, how likely is it? They're on a power trip of their own. DS: Not too many days ago people told us asking for clemency for Chelsea Manning was pointless. Nothing looks possible until after it's done. But no past impeachment has been strictly partisan, though the nonsense impeachment of Bill Clinton (who should have been impeached for legitimate reasons) came close. And even in today's world of Absolute Partisanship there hasn't been a Republican that the Republicans would be more willing to impeach than Trump. But if they think what follows will be corporate power and a docile public, they'll be as wrong as were all the Democrats and all the television networks who thought promoting Trump as a candidate would be a really clever way to elect a really unpopular former Secretary of State. Activism is not prediction. Making predictions and making demands are at odds with each other. I'm only involved in making demands here. And if we succeed, everyone will say it was inevitable, so having made predictions won't be worth much anyway. our nation's capital (image by szeke)   License   DMCA   Details JB: You make an excellent point. Social change only looks inevitable when we look back in time. Let's say that I agree with you. How to proceed? What's the next step? Sign the petition: http://ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.org Read my FAQ: http://firedonaldtrump.org Share widely. Take flyers to events. Contact your Congress member. Ask your town or city to pass a resolution. Ask your organizations to support. Women's March on Washington DC (image by Mobilus In Mobili)   License   DMCA   Details JB: There were massive marches across the nation and worldwide the day after Inauguration Day. The turnouts everywhere were unprecedented, the largest we've ever seen in this country. What, if anything, does that add to the mix? DS: Well, it shows opposition to Trump and to certain of his policies. It's also full of flaws, failure to support the few good things he does, failure to oppose some of the worst things, and way too much support for the Democratic Party. But on the whole it is a very good sign, as is resistance within the EPA, the National Park Service, and various city governments. We just need to use this opposition wisely, including promoting a positive vision of where we want to be. JB: How would the marches "support the few good things he does, failure to oppose some of the worst things"? How do marches pinpoint like that? And should they? Also, how did the marches demonstrate too much support for the Democratic Party? You lost me there, David. DS: Speakers at the marches called him names, insulted his appearance, threatened violence, cheered for Democrats. Speakers included Debbie Wasserman Schultz who did more than anyone else to nominate the only Democrat who could have lost to Trump. This is a crowd much of which proclaims that ending the TPP had nothing to do with Trump, rather than encouraging him to do the same to NAFTA, but announces that restarting the DAPL and Keystone XL was entirely Trump with zero role by the previous president who left the door open. Many of these people want every anti-Russia/anti-Trump claim produced by the CIA taken on faith even as it undermines the idea of fact-based politics and even as it stirs up dangerous hostility between the US and Russian governments. Torture prisons? The CIA is never wrong. Trump is never right. But they both want 'em. Aaaaarggh! What to think? Better ask the Democrats! No. What we need is principled, policy-based activism that ignores party and personality and insist s on facts and accountability across the board, crediting the worst people when they do right and condemning the best when they do wrong. JB: Got it. By the way, I wasn't referring to the speakers at the marches. For the most part, no one could hear them anyway. I'm talking about the energy of the millions who came out not because they're DNC or Washington apparatchniks. Anything you'd like to add before we wrap this up? Imagine a movement to hold the U.S. government to account in the absence of the impeachment provision in the Constitution. Then imagine that one day we were granted the magical power to insert impeachment into history and into U.S. law. Wouldn't we jump at it? JB: What a tantalizing question! I enjoyed talking with you, David. You always make me stretch. Thank you. *** FireDonaldTrump.org David says: If I've persuaded you, or if you already agreed, please sign this petition .

Common take on the word "impeach" is about removing an official, but it's not. Trump could stay for years unless Removed From Office for cause...multiple causes actually. Linguistically related....not a day goes by without Trump being called "commander in chief" or preposterously even "OUR Commander in Chief". Wrong. A president is only commander in chief of most, not even all, of the military. And, god forbid anyone point out that there is no such country called "America"...except colloquially, as a nickname for The United States OF America.....that "America" referring to the whole continental mass from the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego. Words are important.

The initiative focuses on “how to best promote job growth and get Americans back to work again,” according to the White House statement. On Wednesday’s earning call, Boeing’s Muilenburg said he was encouraged by Trump’s engagement with business executives and that he’s had excellent conversations with the President. “I give a lot of credit here to reaching out and directly engaging,” Muilenburg said. “President Trump has to have business leaders at the table. He is listening. He is engaging and making decisions that will help us grow the economy and ultimately grow U.S. manufacturing jobs. So, I’m encouraged by that dialogue, and I think having direct, open dialogue is productive and very good for the future.” Seattle business leaders are noticeably absent from initiative. Earlier this month, Amazon announced it would create 100,000 new full-time jobs in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the announcement came after Trump met with several tech executives and “urged them to keep their jobs and production in the United States.” Much of Trump’s campaign focused on keeping and jobs in the United States, and, while the council will focus mainly on job growth, the White House said the agendas will likely change session to session.

NASA unveiled a new spacesuit this week. It was designed by Boeing for use on its Starliner spacecraft, which astronauts will use on missions to and from the International Space Station. Here’s a video showing it off: It’s been met with general interest and approval across the internet, though some have raised questions about where Boeing got the inspiration. A classic sci-fi movie perhaps? Looks as if @Boeing tapped ACC (or maybe SK) as design consultants for it’s new spacesuit. #space #nasa #science #exploration #2001 #kubrick pic.twitter.com/Jy7lF9nLzP — Roger (@RTAlderson) January 27, 2017 For those in need of a little culture, the image on the right is a blue version of the spacesuits in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 movie, “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Or maybe they drew their inspiration from something more whimsical? Something about @NASA‘a new spacesuit design … looks kind of familiar. https://t.co/0ue0dTSKxA #SPACESHIP pic.twitter.com/9zZquJ365i — Gray (@gray) January 26, 2017 Topics: All News Boeing FedFeed International Space Station NASA Leave A Comment Home » FedFeed » #FedFeed - NASA unveils… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS Fed Photo of the Day Photos of the amazing, moving, important and amusing things happening in the federal community.

Jan. 27 (UPI) -- South Korea has finished deploying new Apache helicopters. The Boeing AH-64E, which features digital cockpit avionics and powerful engines, would be used to target incoming North Korea military tanks. A South Korean military official said on Friday all 36 new helicopters were acquired in early January, deployed and are ready for combat operations, Yonhap news agency reported on Friday. "These helicopters were organized into two battalions of the Army Air Operations Command," the official said. The helicopters would contribute to defending South Korea in the case of an attack. North Korea is believed to retain more than 1,000 tanks, including the Songun-915 and the Pokpungho, also known as the M-2002. The Apache helicopters can be deployed quickly to critical areas of South Korea, including the Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong Islands on the western coast of the peninsula, near the North Korea maritime border. There are now a total of 84 Apache helicopters operating on the Korean peninsula, including 48 helicopters under the supervision of U.S. Forces Korea. The AH-64E can exercise a powerful blocking effect against North Korea armored units and incoming air-cushion vehicles. The helicopter has a maximum speed of 145 knots and has been rated as the highest-performance attack helicopter. The Apache can carry up to 16 Hellfire laser designated missiles and can be equipped with up to 4 Stinger air-to-air missiles.

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 167.70 -1.42 -0.84% Southwest Airlines Co LUV ▼ 52.70 -1.22 -2.26% Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA NWARF ▲ 33.25 +1.25 +3.89% But Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier across the Atlantic, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA. Norwegian will receive the first Max 8 in May, spokesman Anders Lindstrom said Thursday, with flights starting as early as June. Southwest made its bones as the low-cost carrier that famously flies only one airplane family. As Boeing’s largest customer for the 737, it’s been involved in the redesign, which included outfitting the workhorse with a more powerful engine. In 2011, the Dallas-based airline placed the first order for the 737 Max, followed by Norwegian and Indonesia’s Lion Air. Yesterday, Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said his airline will get the first of its 200 737 Max’s by July—two months earlier than expected, but two months after Norwegian.  The Max’s sprightly release clip has prompted delivery questions for both Southwest and Boeing, given that an aircraft’s launch customer typically gets—and flies—the new plane first. This sort of arrangement has been upended before, when Airbus A320neo, destined first for Qatar Airways Ltd., didn’t arrive as planned. Qatar chief Akbar Al Baker last year balked over glitches in the A320neo’s engine software and refused to take the first plane, which went instead to Lufthansa. There’s more to being a launch customer than bragging rights—although that's a large part of the appeal of being the first to market with a shiny new jet. Aircraft makers also promise that their newest models boast lower fuel and maintenance costs than prior airplanes, providing an immediate bottom-line boost to airlines. “We’re the launch customer, regardless of when we take the first delivery,” Southwest CEO Kelly said of the Max. His chief operating officer, Mike Van De Ven, said Thursday that “we’re the ones that have done the service-ready operational validation for Boeing. We’re the ones working very closely with Boeing to make sure it's operating as everyone intended.” Boeing’s Max development is on-budget and ahead of schedule. All this good news, as far as production is concerned, is a rarity in an industry renowned for being late to everything. Southwest plans to put its first Max into service later this year, once it retires its 87 remaining 737-300 Classics, the oldest planes in the fleet. And this is the sticking point: Southwest must first retire those old planes before it can accommodate new ones, a conundrum that traces back to pilot training issues. About 10 of Southwest’s 737 Max planes will be finished by the time the carrier is ready to begin flights in October, Van de Ven has said. The carrier is in talks with Boeing about what to do with those planes between July and October, because several are now parked at the periphery of Boeing’s 737 factory in Renton, Wash. Norwegian, meanwhile, plans to take delivery of a half-dozen new 737 Max this year and then deploy them for trans-Atlantic service, though it hasn’t revealed which routes or a time frame. The European carrier has been focused on smaller airports in the Northeast U.S., bypassing the large metropolitan hubs. —With Julie Johnsson in Chicago.

While the stock looks constructive through an intermediate-term lens, it now has to prove whether the recent multi-month gains are here to stay. This week on Jan. 25, Boeing reported its latest financial results; the company came in with earnings-per-share of $2.47, beating analyst estimates of $2.34. Investors liked the news and outlook, and BA stock followed with a technically sound move higher. But the warnings signs I am starting to see in Boeing stock, at least for the near-term, have to do with the rate of change of the stock’s incline, which looks unsustainable through a multi-week/month lens. In discussions with institutional investors this week, much focus was around the ‘honeymoon’ phase that the stock market still seems to be in with the new Trump administration. While I do think there is much hope from a growth perspective around the plans from President Trump, as always, it comes back to a question on timing, or time frame. The first two weeks of the new President have been filled with signing bills and putting plenty of changes in motion. Soon, however, the focus could begin to shift to a focus on ‘execution’ of these changes, which is where stocks may see a hiccup, i.e., a cause for a pause in the rally. BA Stock Charts Looking at BA stock through a multi-year lens we see that the longer-term up-trend remains well intact and that the yellow-50 week and blue-100 week moving averages over the past couple of months have once again begun to curl higher after a 12-month hiatus. Click to Enlarge This simply mirrors a renewed leg higher in price, but it also gives investors better technical parameters to risk manage their positions by. This week’s rally in Boeing stock has pushed it cleanly past its previous all-time highs from 2015, causing the weekly MACD momentum oscillator at the bottom of the chart to reach overbought readings last seen at the 2015 highs.

Most professional investors are skeptical the Dow at 20,000 will have much effect. They more often look to the S&P 500 index as a benchmark, because they consider it better representation of the broad market. THE QUOTE: “In and of itself, it is just a number,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But what it does is it lifts market expectations, in essence, to continue moving higher.” FLYING HIGH: Boeing rose 4.1 percent after the aircraft manufacturer beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow, rising $6.63 to $167.18. REMEMBER THIS: Seagate jumped 20.8 percent after the data storage company posted fiscal second-quarter revenue that exceeded financial analysts' forecasts. The stock was up the most among companies in the S&P 500, adding $7.78 to $45.22. STRONG RESULTS: Rockwell Automation climbed 7.5 percent after the company reported strong quarterly earnings. The stock picked up $10.60 to $152.63. SOLID QUARTER: Logitech vaulted 15.1 percent after the computer gaming and accessories maker's latest earnings beat Wall Street's expectations. Its shares added $3.80 to $28.90. ROUGH ROAD: Textron slumped 9.9 percent after the defense contractor's fourth-quarter revenue missed financial analysts' estimates. The company also announced it is buying snowmobile maker Arctic Cat in a deal valued at about $247 million. Textron was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $4.89 to $44.50. FALLING SHORT: Mining company Freeport-McMoRan fell 4.3 percent after it served up quarterly results that missed analysts' forecasts. The stock slid 74 cents to $16.28. MARKETS OVERSEAS: In Europe, Germany's DAX was up 1.8 percent, while the CAC-40 in France was 1.2 percent higher. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 0.4 percent. Earlier in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surged 1.4 percent after Japan's government said that the nation had a trade surplus in 2016, its first in six years. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.1 percent. ENERGY: Oil prices were little changed. Benchmark U.S. crude was essentially unchanged from the day before at $53.20 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 9 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $55.33 a barrel in London. TREASURY YIELDS: Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.50 percent from 2.47 percent late Tuesday. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 113.62 yen from 113.89 on Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0736 from $1.0723.

Scoot Pte., a unit of Singapore Airlines Ltd. that flies medium-haul routes, has had to pull some of its Dreamliners from flying while it carries out additional checks on engines. Scoot didn't specify the exact nature of the engine problem or how many of its dozen jets were affected. In the meantime, Singapore Airlines will operate a daily return flight to Sydney for Scoot from Feb. 1 to Feb. 13 using a Boeing 777-200 as Scoot faces "tighter than usual" aircraft utilization during the Lunar New Year holiday period, according to a Scoot spokeswoman. Scoot said it has informed its customers about the change. "Scoot has an ongoing engine maintenance and check program in place with Rolls-Royce to proactively monitor the condition and technical reliability of our fleet," the company spokeswoman said. Boeing said it was aware of the engine issues but would refer queries to the airline. Rolls-Royce declined to comment on an "individual customer's operations and engine maintenance programs." Dreamliners started commercial flights at the end of 2011. The planes have been plagued by problems such as battery fires in 2013. All Nippon Airways discovered problems with turbine blades in its Dreamliner Rolls-Royce engines last year. ANA said blades in the engines were cracking because of what Rolls-Royce determined was premature corrosion. Rolls-Royce vies with General Electric Co. GE, -1.02% for engine orders on Dreamliner planes.

Boeing expects more plane deliveries, less defense revenue in 2017 Jan 26, 2017 Updated Jan 26, 2017 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2016, file photo, an engine and part of a wing from the 100th 787 Dreamliner to be built at Boeing's North Charleston, South Carolina, facility are seen outside the plant. Wednesday, Boeing Co. on Wednesday reported a fourth-quarter net income of $1.63 billion. DALLAS (AP) — Boeing Co. beat Wall Street expectations for fourth-quarter profit despite a slump in revenue from its defense business, and it forecasts that deliveries of commercial jets will rise in 2017 after slipping last year. Boeing said Wednesday that it expects full-year earnings in 2017 to be roughly in line with analysts’ forecasts, although its revenue prediction fell short of Wall Street targets. On a call with analysts and reporters, Boeing executives spoke positively about the potential for higher defense spending, lower taxes and less regulation under the new administration. They even downplayed the sting of President Donald Trump’s tweets and comments last month about the high price of new Air Force One planes. Boeing and European rival Airbus have boomed in recent years from global economic growth, better profitability among major world airlines, and a rise in travel in developing markets, especially Asia, all of which have raised demand for jets. Jet fuel prices spiked twice in the past decade, creating a rush for more fuel-efficient planes. And low interest rates made planes more affordable. Both big plane makers have order backlogs that will last for years. However, they are likely to face more competition in the next few years for sales of their workhorse models, the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Canada’s Bombardier and Russia and China are in various stages of delivering similar-sized, single-aisle jetliners. Boeing will counter by delivering the first of a new, upgraded 737 in a few months. And Boeing’s government business could come under increasing cost pressure. Boeing predicted that 2017 revenue from its defense and space business could fall by up to 5 percent, including a drop in sales of military jets, which the company blamed on the timing of some aircraft deliveries. Boeing took another write-down on a key tanker program that has been plagued by design issues. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Pentagon and congressional support for Boeing’s key defense programs remains solid. Boeing said Wednesday that net income in the fourth quarter was $1.63 billion, up 59 percent from a year earlier.

MONEY The Dow Hits 20,000 for the First Time Ever Strong earnings from Boeing and other big companies bolstered the Dow Wednesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are also on track to set record highs. Alex Veiga, Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time Wednesday, the latest milestone in a record-setting drive for the stock market. Strong earnings from Boeing and other big companies helped push the Dow past the threshold early on. U.S. stocks closed solidly higher, lifting the Standard & Poor's 500 index and Nasdaq composite to record highs of their own for the second day in a row. Banks and other financial companies led the gainers, which included technology and industrials. Real estate, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks lagged the broader market as bond yields rose. "It's a psychological event to get through that big hurdle, that big round number," said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It's really symbolic of what's going on with investor sentiment becoming much more positive, and that's going to drive stock prices higher." The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, gained 155.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 20,068.51. The S&P 500 index rose 18.30 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,298.37. The Nasdaq added 55.38 points, or 1 percent, to 5,656.34. Small-company stocks also rose. The Russell 2000 picked up 13.23 points, or 1 percent, to 1,382.44. The market has been marching steadily higher since bottoming out in March 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The rally continued after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president last fall. The Dow first closed above 10,000 on March 29, 1999. Wednesday's rally came against a backdrop of optimism on Wall Street that executive actions and policy goals announced by the Trump administration this week on trade, manufacturing and business deregulation will be good for corporate America. "Whether it's tax reform or infrastructure spending, any of those tend to be optimistic conversations for the markets currently," said Darrell Cronk, president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "We have to wait and see how they play out, obviously. The danger here, if there is one, is that the market gets ahead of itself a little bit." Most professional investors are skeptical the Dow at 20,000 will have much effect on the market. They more often look to the S&P 500 index as a benchmark, because they consider it better representation of the broad market. "In and of itself, it is just a number," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "But what it does is it lifts market expectations, in essence, to continue moving higher." If the Dow reaching 20,000 has any impact, it will likely be a psychological one. Investors have been leery of the stock market for years, unable to stomach the prospect of losing more than 50 percent of their money for a second time if another financial crisis hits. That trepidation has caused them to pull money out of stock funds -; even as the Dow made its march toward 20,000 -; and depend instead on safer bond investments. Last year, investors pulled a net $27.1 billion out of U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to Morningstar. A year earlier, they yanked $66.5 billion. Over the same time, investors plugged a total of $218.6 billion into taxable bond funds. Anyone who resisted the urge to dump their stock investments through all the tumult of the last decade is now seeing the full benefit of a market with the Dow at 20,000. A $10,000 investment in the largest U.S. stock mutual fund made a decade ago, before the Great Recession began, would have dropped below $5,000 by March 2009. But investors who held on even through the worries of another recession hitting, U.S. debt downgrade, the euro crisis and uncertainties over Britain's departure from the European Union would now be sitting on nearly $20,000. This is expected to be the busiest week for corporate earnings news, with about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 reporting quarterly results. Several companies rose on results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Boeing was the biggest gainer in the Dow. The aircraft manufacturer climbed $6.81, or 4.2 percent, to $167.36. Seagate's latest quarterly snapshot drove its shares 14 percent higher, to lead all other companies in the S&P 500. The stock added $5.23 to $42.67. Investors also bid up shares in Rockwell Automation, which rose $10.98, or 7.7 percent, to $153.01, and Logitech, which vaulted 15.5 percent. The computer gaming and accessories maker's shares added $3.90 to $29. Some companies posted earnings that failed to impress investors. Textron slumped 5.4 percent after the defense contractor's fourth-quarter revenue missed financial analysts' estimates. The company also announced it is buying snowmobile maker Arctic Cat in a deal valued at about $247 million. Textron was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $2.65 to $46.73. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan fell 3.1 percent after it served up quarterly results that missed analysts' forecasts. The stock slid 52 cents to $16.50. Major stock indexes in Europe moved higher. Germany's DAX rose 1.8 percent, while the CAC-40 in France gained 1 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 0.2 percent. Earlier in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surged 1.4 percent after Japan's government said that the nation had a trade surplus in 2016, its first in six years. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.1 percent. Energy prices mostly declined. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 43 cents to $52.75 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid 36 cents at $55.08 a barrel in London. Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.52 percent from 2.47 percent late Tuesday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 113.60 yen from 113.89 on Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0743 from $1.0723. Among metals, the price of gold slid $13, or 1.1 percent, to $1,197.80 an ounce. Silver fell 21 cents to $16.98 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.71 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 5 cents to $1.52 a gallon, while heating oil slid 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.33 per 1,000 cubic feet. --AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed to this report. Published on: Jan 25, 2017 Advertisement

Since cofounding EKOS 20 years ago, I have worked with great companies including Alaska Airlines, Boeing, Coca Cola and REI on helping to develop their first and early Sustainability Reports. The first generation of sustainability metrics was provided mostly by voluntary self-reported data designed primarily for Wall Street Socially Responsible Investors, employees and stakeholders. Now, a second generation of more rigorously defined metrics is being developed by both government-related and non-governmental organizations.  How can we transition our companies towards a disclosure landscape that is less confusing, more consistent, and more empowering? How can we greatly expand the coverage of companies that disclose? Download the Sustainable Brands New Metrics full presentation to learn more. Cynthia Figge is a forerunner and thought leader in the corporate sustainability movement who co-founded EKOS International in 1996, one of the first consultancies integrating sustainability and corporate strategy. Cynthia is COO and Cofounder of CSRHub. Cynthia has worked with major organizations including BNSF, Boeing, Coca-Cola, Dow Jones, and REI to help craft sustainability strategy integrated with business. She was an Officer of LIN Broadcasting/McCaw Cellular leading new services development, and started a new “Greenfield” mill with Weyerhaeuser. She serves as Advisor to media and technology companies, and served as President of the Board of Sustainable Seattle. Cynthia has an MBA from Harvard Business School.

(AP) Comments Share Tweet Share Share After President Donald Trump announced his 20 percent tax on Mexican imports, industry experts started checking whose pocket books are about to feel lighter. Aerospace was one such industry to react to news of the Mexico tax, and Boeing was at the center of the discussion. Related: Trump trade war among top concerns of economists, Washington Aviation reporter Stephen Trimble quickly went to Twitter and noted the Mexican aerospace industry exported $7.6 billion worth of goods last year. About 90 percent of that went to the United States. Trump’s 20 percent tariff would “cost US aero industry about $1.38 billion,” Trimble wrote. CNN’s aviation editor Jon Ostrower soon followed up. According to Ostrower, “Every single wire on a 787 Dreamliner comes from a Mexican factory.” Those wires contribute a lot to the jets. According to Boeing: On an airplane, the electrical system produces, controls and distributes power to all the other systems that need it — flight deck displays, flight controls, in-flight entertainment and more. It’s much like the electrical system in your house, which carries electricity throughout the rooms to power your lights, television and so forth. Beyond that, airplanes produce their own energy, so there’s wiring and electrical systems for that as well. Overall, the Dreamliner is composed of about 2.3 million parts. A majority of parts come from suppliers in the United States, but Boeing sources about 30 percent of parts come from foreign sources. The Mexico tax and Washington Many news reports are noting that the Mexico tax will essentially be paid for by American consumers. But when it comes to countries importing goods locally to Washington state, Mexico is eighth on the list. Side note: Canada is no. 1, and China is no. 2. The total value of imported goods from Mexico has dramatically spiked in recent years. In 2012, Washington state imported about $556 million from south of the border. In 2015, that figure was about $1.3 billion. Concerns over Mexico-Washington trade go beyond what enters the United States. There is a concern that if the US imposes a Mexico tax on imports, Mexico may do the same to American businesses. Washington state exported about $1.9 billion worth of goods to Mexico in 2015.

After weeks of unease across trading floors, investors around the world have refound the optimism that fuelled a surge in the two months after Donald Trump was elected president. The latest lease of life comes after the tycoon signed a series of executive orders pushing his pro-growth agenda, including giving the green light to two huge, controversial oil pipeline deals through the United States. There are hopes he will press on with other promises to ramp up infrastructure spending, cut taxes and do away with various regulations he considers a hindrance to businesses. Added to this were a series of upbeat earnings reports from big-name firms including Boeing and United Technologies. In New York the Dow ended above 20,000 for the first time in its history, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also closed at all-time highs as investors shift back to higher-yielding investments and away from safe bets such as bonds. Asian dealers tracked their counterparts on Thursday, with Tokyo ending 1.8 percent higher. Hong Kong added 1.4 percent and Shanghai gained 0.3 percent on the last day before a week-long Lunar New Year break. Seoul jumped 0.8 percent and Singapore 0.4 percent, while Wellington, Manila and Jakarta also pushed upwards. Sydney was closed for a public holiday. In early European trade London and Paris rose 0.3 percent while Frankfurt put on 0.5 percent. "The US economy is doing well, corporate earnings are good and it looks like Mr Trump´s policies will keep improving the economy," Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo, told Bloomberg News. "With bond yields increasing, we´re seeing gradual moves from bonds to risk assets." The dollar recovered from recent losses against its major peers although it is struggling to break out of tight band as investors mull comments from Trump and his nominee for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that the unit is too strong and could hurt the US economy. "We may have underestimated... investor sentiment towards Mnuchin and Trump´s comments on the dollar," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA, in a note. "Of course, this does not mean it´s open season to sell dollars; it is certainly weighing on sentiment as there is little dollar appeal in the markets." The US unit´s general weakness also saw it tumble more than two percent against the Mexican peso despite news Trump had ordered work to begin on planning and building a wall along the US-Mexico border. The dollar bought a little more than 21 pesos Thursday, well down from the record levels above 22 pesos touched earlier this month.   0 0 Asian markets’ rally extends after Wall Street records was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 27, 2017 and was last updated on January 27, 2017.

Picture: AP; AFP Staff writers, agenciesNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend PRESIDENT Donald Trump has declared the “whole world is angry right now”, as he outlined his plans to screen people coming in to the US, fight terrorism and build a wall on the US border with Mexico. In his second presidential TV interview, he told Fox News anchor Sean Hannity that he was keen to keep as many of his election promises as he can. Some of them are already in motion, including his push for a wall to be built on the US-Mexican border. “The wall is necessary its not just politics,” President Trump said. “People want protection.” President Trump also reiterated his comments he made during his TV interview yesterday with ABC anchor David Muir, where he stressed the need to have better “vetting” of people coming into the US. “We’re going to have extreme vetting for people coming into our country,” he said. .@POTUS: “How can you vet somebody when you don’t know anything about them and you have no papers? … You can’t.” #Hannity pic.twitter.com/xl9UBCqWEO— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 27, 2017 “You look at Nice ... Germany it’s a mess, the crime is incredible ... and we’re just not going to let that happen here.” “The whole world is angry right now. There are such problems in the world and such anger.” President Trump told Hannity that the FBI had 1000 ongoing investigations, involving “people who were let in”. “We don’t need this,” he said. “We take in tens of thousands of people, we know nothing about them.” When asked about terrorism and Islamic State, President Trump described their recruits as “sneaky dirty rats”. “They are bad people,” he said. “They’re sneaky, dirty rats and they blow people up in a shopping centre and they blow people up in a church.” “We are fighting sneaky rats right now that are sick and demented.

When given the nuclear launch codes, he described it as “serious stuff”. “When you see the kind of destruction that explained to you, you realise getting along with people is a good thing,” he added. “If we can get along with Russia that’s a good thing.” President Trump also took Hannity inside the Oval Office, where he showed him a small bust of former US President Abraham Lincoln, before he pointed out the bust of Martin Luther King Jr was still there, despite earlier reports it had been removed.

He said he liked the desk, which he chose from around seven others. ‘Look at my desk. Papers. You don’t see presidents with that on their desk,” he said. “We’ve had a lot of great presidents use this desk,” he said. Hannity even asked him about his desk phone, and he replied: “I have great phones, the technology we have in this country is great.” President Trump’s desk that he chose for the Oval Office.

Two US-based companies, General Dynamics Corp’s Electric Boat division and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding, build the Navy’s nuclear-powered submarines. Trump, who took office on Friday, made increasing military spending a key part of his campaign. President Trump defends himself, saying he will try to keep his election promises on Fox News. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Since winning the November election, he has pressured US defence contractors to reduce the cost of the products they sell to the Pentagon. In December, Trump received a pledge from the chief executive of Lockheed Martin to cut the cost of the controversial F-35 fighter jet after Trump complained in a tweet about the plane’s price tag and said he would ask Boeing to offer a cheaper alternative. President Trump took Sean Hannity from Fox News into the White House. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied President Trump has also railed against Madonna’s controversial comments at last weekend’s women’s march. The singer attracted criticism for using profanities while addressing the marchers and saying she had thought about “blowing up the White House”. “Honestly, she’s disgusting. I think she hurt herself very badly. I think she hurt that whole cause,” he said. He also said it was a “disgrace” for a Saturday Night Live writer to criticise his young son Barron on Twitter. “For NBC to attack my 10-year-old son ... it’s a disgrace,” he said SNL writer Katie Rich was suspended indefinitely for the tweet and has since apologised. TRUMP TO CREATE ‘GREAT WALL’ TARIFF President Trump will ask US Congress to impose a 20 per cent tax on all Mexican goods to pay for the construction of a wall on the border. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters travelling with Trump aboard air force One that the move would be part of the beginning of a process of widespread tax reform. “By doing it we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That’s really going to provide the funding,” he said. But later, Spicer tried to take back his earlier comments by saying the 20 per cent tax is one of several options under consideration and Trump hasn’t settled on it as the way to recoup construction costs for building the wall. Mexico supplies $US21 billion worth of agricultural produce — mostly fruit, vegetables and alcohol — to the US each year. It’s also the third largest source of US goods imports. Such a tax would likely make price rises inevitable. “We are probably the only major country that doesn’t treat imports this way,” Spicer said to justify the move. “This gets us in line frankly with the policies that other countries around the world treat our products.” However, the removal of such tariffs has been a major part of international trade development in recent decades. Trump has previously argued for a 20 per cent tax on all imports to the United States, regardless of their origins. Last year he told the New York Times that he wanted a 45 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports.

Picture: AFPSource:AFP BORDER CHIEF FORCED TO RESIGN The man charged with protecting America’s borders was ousted today, one day after President Donald Trump announced ambitious plans to build a massive wall at the Mexican border and bolster the ranks of the Border Patrol. Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan said he was asked to leave and decided to resign rather than fight the request, according to a US official with knowledge of the brief video conference in which Morgan informed senior agents of the change. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussion was not intended to be made public. The forced resignation leaves Trump with a leadership gap but also gives him a chance to start fresh with a Border Patrol chief of his own choosing. Border security and a “big beautiful wall” paid for by the Mexican government were centrepieces of Trump’s immigration platform during his presidential campaign. Boys play on a border fence between Mexico and the US in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. US President Donald Trump on Thursday told Mexico's president to cancel an upcoming visit to Washington if he is unwilling to foot the bill for a border wall. Picture: AFPSource:AFP MEXICAN STANDOFF OVER WALL Mexico is willing to talk with the United States in order to maintain good relations, but paying for President Trump’s border wall “is not negotiable,” Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said. “There are things that are not negotiable, things that cannot and will not be negotiated. The fact that it is being said that Mexico should pay for the wall is something that is simply not negotiable,” Videgaray said during a press conference at the Mexican embassy in Washington. The news of the proposed tariff hike to pay for the wall came after Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto cancelled a meeting with the US President that had been set for next week. Mr Trump jumped on Twitter overnight to demand that his Mexican counterpart should cancel his upcoming visit to Washington if his country refuses to pay for a wall along the border. “The US has a 60 billion dollar (AU$80 billion) trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers ... of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting,” Mr Trump said on Twitter. The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico.

If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2017 Mr Pena Neito showed that he has also mastered Twitter, sending out a tweet to alert Mr Trump that he is not longer coming. “This morning we have informed the White House that I will not attend the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday with the POTUS,” Mr Pena Nieto tweeted. At a press conference after the Mexican President’s tweet, Mr Trump said that it would’ve been “fruitless” for Mr Nieto to come for talks if Mexico is unwilling to pay for the wall. “The president of Mexico and myself have agreed to cancel our planned meeting scheduled for next week,” Mr Trump told Republican politicians at a retreat in Philadelphia. “Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route. I have no choice.” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell says Congress is moving ahead with plans for the wall which would cost $US12 billion to $US15 billion ($16 billion to $20 billion). Senator McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan did not say how Congress would pay for the wall that Mr Trump has vowed to build. “We anticipate a supplemental (budget) coming from the administration,” Mr Ryan said. “The point is we’re going to finance the Secure Fence Act.” The tweet came after Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said his talks in Washington DC with a key trade adviser to Mr Trump over the future of bilateral commerce had shown the US side was receptive to Mexico’s point of view. Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto, left, and then Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shake hands. Picture: APSource:AP Mr Guajardo told Mexican television he had held long talks with Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro on Wednesday on how the two countries should seek to modernise the NAFTA trade agreement sensibly, and how to avoid obstacles to free trade. The talks had shown the US side was receptive to what Mexico had to say, Mr Guajardo said. STATE DEPARTMENT HEADS ‘ASKED TO LEAVE’ It came as the entire senior management team of the US State department submitted their resignations as new Secretary Rex Tillerson takes up his post. Despite reports of mass resignations, CNN says two of the four top State Department officials who are leaving have told it that they were asked to go. Among the four top-level staff to leave is Patrick Kennedy, who was widely tipped to become Tillerson’s No. 2 at the department. Mr Trump, who nominated the ex oil tycoon to the key cabinet position, is reportedly seeking to ‘clean house’. Former Exxon Mobil Corp chairman Rex Tillerson was granted to take over the Secretary of State role by the Senate foreign relations committee from Democrat John Kerry last week. He still has to receive approval from the full Senate, but this is widely expected. Former ExxonMobil executive Rex Tillerson is set to be Secretary of State. Picture: AFPSource:AFP Senior State Department official Patrick Kennedy has quit now Rex Tillerson is set to be in charge. Picture: GettySource:Supplied Kerry’s former chief of staff David Wade told the Washington Post: “It’s the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember, and that’s incredibly difficult to replicate”. Among those confirmed to be leaving are Gregory Starr, Assistant Secretary for State for Diplomatic Security, Michele Bond, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs and Tom Countryman, the acting undersecretary for arms control and international security. “These retirements are a big loss. They leave a void. These are very difficult people to replace”, Wade told the paper. TRUMP ISSUES AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE Mr Trump has sent an Australia Day message, declaring America has no better friend than Australia. The message was delivered by acting Secretary of State Thomas Shannon Jr and comes just days after Trump killed America’s participation in the trans-Pacific Partnership with Australia and other allies and as he considers whether to make it harder for Australians and Kiwis to travel to the US. “On behalf of President Trump and the American people, it is my honour to congratulate the people of Australia as you celebrate this Australia Day, 229 years after the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Harbour,” Shannon Jr said in a statement. “It has been over 75 years since your commonwealth and the United States established diplomatic relations, but connections between America and Australia reach back to that fleet.” The Los Angeles Times revealed on Wednesday that Trump, in tightening up America’s borders, is considering ending the visa waiver program that allows Australians, New Zealanders and citizens of 36 other nations, including many close allies in Europe, to easily visit the US on 90-day tourist visas.

On Wednesday, the Dow rallied above 20,000 thanks to a strong uptick in financial and healthcare stocks. The Dow's recent ascent to 20,000 was the second-fastest 1,000-point move in market history at 42 days. That is the fastest since the 59-session span between March and July 2007. It is second only to the 1,000-point gain registered in 24 days back in 1999. Let's look at the numbers from Wednesday for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq:  Dow Jones: 20,068.51; 155.80; +0.78%  S&P 500: 2,298.37; 18.30; +0.80%  Nasdaq: 5,656.34; 55.38; +0.99%  Here's a look at today's most important market events and stocks, plus a look at Thursday's economic calendar. What's Ahead for the Dow Jones Industrial Average Today The Dow Jones Industrial Average projected a 46-point gain as global markets continue to push higher in the wake of the index's surge past 20,000. It has been a remarkable run for the markets in recent weeks. The rally has been fueled by three key U.S. blue-chip stocks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) has accounted for 379 points of the Dow's surge since the election. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), which crushed Wall Street earnings expectations Wednesday, has added 172 points to the Dow during that span. Finally, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) has added 158 points. The three stocks have accounted for roughly 40% of the Dow's gains. Trending: These Are 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy in 2017 Thursday will feature a busy round of earnings reports and economic data. Keep an eye on weekly jobless claims and the monthly report on new home sales. Should the latter report surpass economists' expectations, look for shares of KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and Toll Brothers Inc. (NYSE: TOL) to show gains. On the international front, investors are eyeing statements by British Prime Minister Theresa May about global trade and her country's pending exit from the European Union. May will meet with President Trump to discuss bilateral trade and address senior Republicans on a range of global issues. May has pledged to rekindle the special relationship between the UK and the United States with the goal to "lead, together, again." In silver investment news, the price of silver has been sliding since the election. The price is down again Wednesday morning as investors continue to shift capital back toward equities.  However, there are a few factors setting up silver to be one of the top investments of 2017. Money Morning Resource Specialist Peter Krauth has predicted a 30% surge in the silver price this year. Here's what you need to know and how to position your investments. Don't Miss: A Gold Price Prediction for the Coming Bull Run: $5,236 an Ounce Crude oil prices were ticking higher thanks to a weakening U.S. dollar. The downturn in the greenback offset concerns about rising supplies in the United States. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration announced a much larger uptick in domestic crude inventories. The WTI crude oil price today added 0.8%. Brent crude dipped 0.8%. But the big story is President Donald Trump. The president has taken swift action on a number of social and economic issues in the last three days. In addition to paying the way for the construction of a massive border wall and the installation of several major pipeline projects, the president has been speculating on his next major announcement: his nominee for the vacancy on the Supreme Court. On Jan. 24 at the White House, President Trump announced he had "a number of outstanding candidates" for the open Justice of the Supreme Court position. So who will Trump nominate for Supreme Court? According to CNN, these are Trump's top picks for Supreme Court… Stocks to Watch Today, Jan. 26, 2017: In deal news, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) announced it planned to purchase Swiss pharmaceutical giant Actelion Ltd. (OTCMKTS: ALIOF) for $30 billion. In earnings news, shares of Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) hit a 52-week high Wednesday before retreating after the bell. The semiconductor giant easily topped profit and revenue expectations in the second quarter. The uptick in growth came thanks to stabilization of the global PC market and a surge in cloud-services sales. Meanwhile, shares of AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) were ticking slightly higher in pre-market hours after the telecom giant matched Wall Street profit expectations and fell just short of consensus revenue forecasts. Keep an eye out for additional earnings reports from Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT), Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC), Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), Starbucks Corp. (Nasdaq: SBUX), VMware Inc. (NYSE: VMW), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), Paypal Inc.

We do want peace,” Trump said in a ceremony at the Pentagon. Trump predicted that Congress, which sets the expenditures for the government, will “be very happy to see” the White House’s new spending request for the military. He made clear during last year’s presidential campaign and in recent weeks that he wants to enlarge the ranks of the military services and expand its fleets of aircraft and ships. For example, he said he envisions a naval fleet of 350 vessels, up from the navy’s current 274 and more than its 310 vessel target. And Trump excluded the military from a hiring freeze across the rest of the government that he ordered just after being inaugurated on Jan. 20. He is also expected to order his new defense secretary, James Mattis, to intensify operations against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria with more U.S. soldiers and military hardware like artillery and attack helicopters. Another expected move is to review and the strengthen the country’s ability to defend itself against cyberattacks and to conduct offensive cyberattacks itself. The order Trump signed Friday was less specific, calling for a sweeping 30-day readiness review of the U.S. military, with the aim of preparing new budget requests to improve readiness. But he has also pressured the Pentagon to cut costs on some of its most expensive programs. Earlier, Mattis ordered financial reviews of the costs of two major defense programs — the $400 billion F-35 fighter jet project and the $4 billion development of a new Air Force One presidential jet. Trump had complained that both were too costly. The Pentagon needs to find ways “to significantly reduce the cost” of the F-35 program, Mattis said, even weighing the competitiveness of the rival F-18. The F-35 is built by Lockheed Martin, while the F-18 is built by Boeing. At the same time, Mattis ordered a similar review of the $4 billion cost for developing a new aircraft for the U.S. president, Air Force One, the ultra-high-tech and secure 747 built by Boeing. “The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is a critical acquisition program that warrants a detailed assessment to reduce associated program costs,” Mattis said in the order. He said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to find ways “to significantly reduce the cost” while ensuring the new jets, which cost about $100 million each, meet U.S. defense needs. In December, Trump assailed both the F-35 and Air Force One programs as overly costly, and after that met with the chief executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to try to extract savings. “The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases,” Trump said on Twitter at the time. The first 200 F-35s of a program that envisions some 2,450 ultimately being acquired by the different U.S. armed services have been delivered. The aircraft have also been sold to Israel, with the first two delivered in December. The first overseas-based F-35Bs arrived at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture on Jan. 18, according to the U.S. Marine Corps. Proponents tout the F-35’s radar-dodging stealth technology, supersonic speeds, close air-support capabilities, airborne agility and a massive array of sensors giving pilots unparalleled access to information.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print President Trump has selected the chief executive officer of Dana Inc. to join an advisory council that will focus on boosting jobs in the manufacturing sector. Jim Kamsickas, who runs the global automotive parts firm based in Maumee, was one of 28 business and labor leaders the White House named Friday for the newly announced Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. Administration officials said the President would look to the group for insight in the coming months as part of his broader job creation agenda. RELATED CONTENT: White House press release on Manufacturing Jobs Initiative Jim Kamsickas, CEO of Dana Holding Corp., has been named to a business advisory council by President Donald Trump. The Blade/Andy Morrison Enlarge | Buy This Image “President Trump plans to continually seek information and perspectives from a diverse range of business leaders ... on how best to promote job growth and get Americans back to work again,” the White House said. Mr. Kamsickas, who took over as Dana’s president and CEO in mid 2015, will join leaders from some of the United States’ best-known firms. The White House said early efforts have been led by Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow Chemical. The list also included CEOs from Ford, Whirlpool, General Electric, U.S. Steel, and Boeing.  Also joining the initiative are two officials from the AFL-CIO, including President Richard Trumka — a frequent critic of Mr. Trump during the election. Mr. Kamsickas was traveling Friday and was not available for an interview. However, he did provide a statement to The Blade. “I look forward to be working with some of the nation’s most innovative and successful business leaders as we explore opportunities to promote job growth,” he said. “It is a true honor to serve our country as we work together to develop strategic initiatives for expanding American manufacturing.” Bringing back manufacturing jobs was a constant campaign promise for Mr. Trump, and he’s shown no change in focus since winning the election. However, significantly increasing the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs is a tall task. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 at 19.6 million.  While the number remained relatively stable for the next two decades, manufacturing employment has decreased significantly since 2000. The agency’s data show manufacturing employment fell from 17.2 million at the end of 2000 to 12.3 million at the end of last year. That represents a decrease of more than 28 percent. Still, many are hopeful that progress can be made. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing and one of the members of the advisory council, said industry is looking forward to an opportunity to share thoughts on what can be done to strengthen manufacturing. “There’s a lot of policy work that needs to be done,” he told The Blade. “Rebuilding American infrastructure, reforming trade policies, having a made in America-friendly tax code, those are some of the things at the top of my list, along with a workforce training system that recognizes the value of manufacturing.” Mr. Paul noted that these types of blue-ribbon panels aren’t new — most recent administrations have had some manufacturing focus group — though he’s hopeful the new initiative can help shape policy. One of the first things to come up may be U.S. policy on import tariffs.  The Trump Administration has, for example, floated the idea of a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports. “I imagine that each of the companies and labor leaders and myself will be giving candid advice to the administration about what we think will work and what we think may be a challenge,” Mr. Paul said. The White House did not detail how frequently the group may meet.  Officials said they would not seek policy reports from the group, but mostly individual opinions and knowledge.

Here day breaks over the White House Friday on the day that President Donald Trump met his first world leader since taking office, British Prime Minister Theresa May, who hopes to nudge the populist president towards the political mainstream. Pablo Martinez Monsivais AP i By Mimi Whitefield mwhitefield@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story One word can sum up the global economic outlook for 2017: uncertainty. Cybersecurity, an open internet, potential protectionism, a collapse in confidence in institutions and the impact on other countries if Washington under President Donald Trump pursues a more isolationist policy are among the risks and challenges facing world economies this year, panelists said Friday at a conference organized by WorldCity, a Coral Gables media and trade data company. “What makes us most anxious is the uncertainty,” said Donna Hrinak, president of Boeing Latin America and the Caribbean, during the conference at the Coral Gables Country Club. In Latin America, signs point to a potential uptick in the economies in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, said Eric Farnsworth, who heads the Washington Office of the Council of the Americas and the Americas Society. Any recovery from the commodity crash, even if “tepid,” is good, he said. But “what’s going on in Washington will help determine the international policy environment,” Farnsworth said. If Latin American economies are challenged as a result of actions in Washington, it could affect 2018 elections. Among countries where elections are scheduled are Costa Rica, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Paraguay. Already Trump has signed an executive order calling for the construction of a wall on the border with Mexico, withdrawn the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and said he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. But it’s still unclear how the president’s foreign policy will play out. Uncertainty “generates a global paralysis. It’s a wait and see game,” said Magdalena Ramada, a senior economist at Towers Watson, a global risk management, insurance brokerage and advisory company. That waiting game, she said, could dominate most of 2017. If the United States decides to play a lesser role in Latin America, “other countries are going to step into that void,” Farnsworth said. And the most likely candidate, he said, is China. While China may contribute money, investment and political support, it brings “different values and different ways of conducting business” than the United States, he said. A digitally connected world cuts both ways, said Ramada. While information flow improves, “risks are more interconnected today.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story International Business Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:04 Haiti's President-elect Jovenel Moise talks about his love for Les Cayes Pause 0:46 Protesters of all ages, races, faiths decry President Trump 2:15 Kids ask Mayor Gimenez to make Miami-Dade a sanctuary county 1:17 White House: Funding to sanctuary cities a 'taxpayer issue' 0:37 Protestors demand entry to a sealed-off lobby at Miami-Dade's County Hall 1:57 Group fights to preserve Miami's Little Havana section 2:11 Protesters erupt at downtown government center in Miami 1:31 New bodycam shows Miami-Dade police officers at Martin Luther King Day shooting 0:36 Naika Venant's mother: I have to bury my baby 1:57 Did Florida overpay for private prison contract?

The IAM and the Boeing Co. came to an agreement on the date and time of an election today, January 27. “It’s a great day for Boeing South Carolina employees and the entire Charleston community,” said IAM Lead Organizer Mike Evans. “On February 15, they’ll have the opportunity to have a democratic vote on their future. A ‘union yes’ vote will mean a higher standard of living for Boeing South Carolina employees and more money in the local economy. “The workers here have already been up against a flurry of intimidation tactics from the company and an anti-union law firm. We urge Boeing to change course and do what they’ve stated publicly—‘take the high road’—and allow for an election free of threats and the deliberate spread of misinformation. Boeing workers will vote on February 15, and we hope to welcome them to the IAM family then.” The IAM is the U.S.’s largest aerospace union, representing approximately 600,000 members at the likes of Lockheed Martin, General Electric and United Technologies. The IAM represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 locations nationwide. For more information about the campaign visit BoeingWorkers.com.

There are cuts to a red room, which is an homage to Grey’s identically hued sexual dungeon for pain and pleasure. Boeing shows off the spacesuit astronauts will wear on the Starliner The Advanced Crew Escape Suit is the orange suit that astronauts wear during launch and landing of the space shuttle. If they wore complicated suits with a lot of accessories and systems, they would be more likely to break. Fifty Shades Darker is set for release on February 10, 2017, just in time for Valentine’s Day. His debut single “Pillowtalk” and debut album Mind of Mine both reached no. 1 on the Billboard charts and last year he won the American Music Award for New Artist of the Year.Filmed in the very classy St Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London, the dimly-lit video shows Zayn and Taylor are seen walking in the hotel, wrecking the bedrooms and looking awesome while they do it.This is Swift’s first song since 2014’s 1989. Are you glad to see Swift back in a video and recording again? Admissions halted at Woodstock, Ont., care home where Elizabeth Wettlaufer worked Wettlaufer also faces four counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault, in relation to people in her care. Wettlaufer is to make her next court appearance, by video from detention, on February 15. Thankfully, Zayn and his hothothothothothothot voice are there to anchor this song and video. Much like the original Fifty Shades Of Grey, where fans couldn’t stop lamenting about how Beyonce’s fantastic remix of Crazy In Love was not worth the half-baked acting in the erotic romance, this track has a similar effect. And how hot were Taylor and Zayn?What do they do in the video?Swift, seen tussling with a pillow, also seems to be suffering from separation anxiety in the song which tackles emptiness and longing. Madison chancellor responds to campus “alt-right” organizer As a student, Dropik has encouraged his classmates to “fight anti-white racism on campus”, social media posts show. Dropik claimed he also set fire to another MI church, but investigators could not find any record of the fire. Hard dance moves, sexy outfits, catchy songs. While she didn’t show an overabundance of cleavage, that off the shoulder-look that Taylor has going on with her top in the video invited them to use their own imagination. Scroll down for the full video, and just try not to get it stuck in your head all day.

These flights, yet to be finalized, will run through 2024, and marks a second chance for the Nevada-based company, which is developing a mini shuttle called Dream Chaser.  Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser 'shuttle' will join SpaceX and Orbital ATK in launching cargo to the International Space Station. The spacecraft will be able to land back on Earth, like the shuttle, and bring back science experiments and other items from the station. Sierra Nevada competed for NASA's commercial crew contract, but lost out in 2014 to SpaceX and Boeing.  ThisThe other companies use standard-shaped capsules.  Like SpaceX, Sierra Nevada plans to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.  The spacecraft will be able to land back on Earth, like the shuttle, and bring back science experiments and other items from the station.  Now, only SpaceX can return goods.  Other cargo ships are filled with trash and burn up on re-entry. Born with Columbia, the Space Shuttle was Nasa's longest-running space exploration programme Recent launch accidents by SpaceX and Orbital prompted Nasa to pick a third vendor, for increased flexibility. Orbital launched from Wallops Island, Virginia, until a launch explosion in 2014.  SpaceX experienced its own launch failure last summer. NASA awarded its first commercial resupply contracts in 2008.  The first flight was in 2012.  The latest contract calls for a minimum of three flights by each of the three companies.  How the Dream chaser Will work: Each craft can be reused 15 times. HISTORY OF THE NASA SHUTTLE PROGRAMME The Space Shuttle Discovery is launched on Mission STS-29, March 13,1989 Born with Columbia, it was Nasa's longest-running space exploration programme.  Atlantis was launched in 1985.  The next-to-youngest in Nasa's fleet remains at Kennedy Space Center as a museum display. This grand finale came 50 years to the day that Gus Grissom became the second American in space, just half a year ahead of Glenn. Atlantis - the last of Nasa's three surviving shuttles to retire - performed as admirably during descent as it did throughout the 13-day flight.  A full year's worth of food and other supplies were dropped off at the space station, just in case the upcoming commercial deliveries get delayed.  The international partners - Russia, Europe, Japan - will carry the load in the meantime. Not all 1,333 days in space have been a success, however. Two of the shuttles - Challenger and Columbia - were destroyed, one at launch, the other during the ride home.  Fourteen lives were lost.  Yet each time, the shuttle programme persevered. The decision to cease shuttle flight was made seven years ago, barely a year after the Columbia tragedy.  President Barack Obama put paid to President George W. Bush's lunar goals, however, opting instead for astronaut expeditions to an asteroid and Mars. The space shuttle was sold to America as cheap, safe and reliable. It was none of those. It cost $196billion over 40 years, ended the lives of 14 astronauts and managed to make less than half the flights promised. Nasa's first space shuttle flight was in April 1981.  Now Atlantis has landed, it and the other two remaining shuttles are officially museum pieces - more expensive than any paintings. The total price tag for the programme was more than twice the $90billion Nasa originally calculated. Atlantis undocked  from the International Space Station in September 2006. But as a mistake it is one that paid off in wildly unexpected ways that weren't about money and reliability. Former president George Bush Sr said: 'The discoveries it enabled, the international co-operation it fostered and the knowledge it gained - often at great human cost - has also contributed in countless, important ways to humanity and our common progress.' Mr Bush oversaw the programme's early days as vice-president, a job that has traditionally included supervising Nasa. University of Colorado science policy professor Roger Pielke Jr., who studies shuttle costs and policies, said there are probably other ways the U.S. could have spent several billion dollars a year on a human space programme and gained more. When the shuttle succeeded, it did so in a spectacular way. But its failures were also large and tragic.  Seven astronauts died when Challenger exploded about a minute after launch in 1986 and seven more died when Columbia burned up as it returned to Earth in 2003. Last-ditch appeals to keep shuttles flying by such Nasa legends as Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Mission Control founder Christopher Kraft landed flat.  'Few would have imagined back in 2010 when President Barack Obama pledged that NASA would work 'with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable,' that less than six years later we'd be able to say commercial carriers have transported 35,000 pounds of space cargo (and counting!) to the International Space Station -- or that we'd be so firmly on track to return launches of American astronauts to the ISS from American soil on American commercial carriers.  'But that is exactly what is happening,' said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.  'Today's announcement is a big deal that will move the president's vision further into the future.' The contracts, which begin upon award, guarantee a minimum of six cargo resupply missions from each provider.  The contracts also include funding ISS integration, flight support equipment, special tasks and studies, and NASA requirement changes. 'The second generation of commercial cargo services to low-Earth orbit begins today,' said Kirk Shireman, ISS Program manager at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.  'By engaging American companies for cargo transportation, we can focus our attention on using this one-of-a-kind laboratory in the sky to continue advancing scientific knowledge for the benefit of all humanity.' more videos   Share or comment on this article e-mail 12 shares Most watched News videos Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps First ladies first?

By Paul Ausick January 27, 2017 1:45 pm EST Print Email Tweet Sounding a bit like President Donald Trump trying to convince everyone that the crowd at his inauguration was bigger than, well, just about any previous president, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) claims that it is really the launch customer for Boeing Co.’s (NYSE: BA) new 737 MAX passenger jet. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly is not giving up the title just because upstart Norwegian Airlines will actually get its first new 737-8 two months before Southwest. Norwegian, a low-cost carrier that plans to use the new planes to fly transatlantic routes between smaller U.S. and European airports, is scheduled to receive its first new plane in May, while Southwest will wait for its first plane to arrive in July. Kelley told Bloomberg News, “We’re the launch customer, regardless of when we take the first delivery.” Being a launch customer may seem like a big “who cares” to anyone outside the industry, but it’s more than just bragging rights, according to Southwest Chief Operating Officer Mike Van De Ven: [W]e’re the ones that have done the service-ready operational validation for Boeing. We’re the ones working very closely with Boeing to make sure it’s operating as everyone intended. Boeing, intelligently, has not tried (so far) to adjudicate the matter, although the company’s website lists Southwest as the launch customer for the smaller 737-7. Norwegian has ordered 108 of the new 737-8s and expects to receive six this year. Southwest has ordered 200 of the planes, but the airline must retire some of its 737-300s before it can begin taking delivery of the new planes. Norwegian is scheduled to make the first flights of its new 737-8s in June, while Southwest is not scheduled to begin flights until October. Southwest is Boeing’s largest customer with more than 225 737s in the company’s backlog.

(TSU News Service) – The recent Job Outlook 2016 Survey from the National Association of Colleges and Employees says employers expect to employ 11 percent more new graduates from the Class of 2016 than they did in 2015. That’s good news for TSU students like Danielle Haik, a computer science major who is among those walking from the graduation stage into the workforce. Haik is taking an Information Technology Specialist position at Caterpillar Financial Services in Nashville. Last month, the Wall Street Journal listed Tennessee State among its top 10 historically black colleges and universities. In ranking TSU 10th, the WSJ/THE College Rankings took into account the salaries graduates earn. “I am very excited about becoming an employee of Caterpillar,” said Haik, who attributes her success to the training and mentoring she received at TSU. “I had some great faculty and mentors who gave me the right exposure and connected me with professional people and organizations that put me in the right direction.” Justus Jarvis, a member of the fall 2016 graduating class, also has a job offer. He has accepted a position with Boeing. “Tennessee State University preparation gives you the full package,” Jarvis said. “They prepare you to be able to stand out among your peers and in front of employers, and that may be my best asset going into the workforce.” Like all TSU students, Haik and Jarvis have the capabilities that companies are looking for, particularly in the areas of leadership and teamwork. According to NACE, employers are looking for candidates with evidence of leadership skills, strong work ethic, and who are team players. “We instill our students with skills for success in the real world,” said Dr. S. Keith Hargrove, dean of the College of Engineering. “Our curriculum requirements make our students more marketable, as well as reinforces classroom learning to prepare them for industry, government, or entrepreneurship.” Tina Reed, associated director of the TSU Career Development Center, said in addition to workshops and professional development conferences, TSU students receive one-on-one career advising to help them make career choices. “The Career Development Center assists our students with developing and enhancing  21st Century job-readiness skills that are needed in the workforce,” Reed said. “From developing a top-notch resume to attending professional development conferences, our students are constantly encouraged to take advantage of career enrichment opportunities.” Dr. Gloria Johnson, dean of the College of Liberal Arts, agrees. “In the College of Liberal Arts, we continue to encourage our students to seek relevant internships and practical experience,” she said. “I am personally encouraging more students to seek more help from the Career Development Center for resume development and possible placement.” Prominent civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump is expected to inspire students even more when he gives the keynote address at TSU’s Dec. 10 commencement. Crump is the noted Florida lawyer who represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Terence Crutcher in police shooting cases that made headlines around the world. Crump was also an advocate in the Robbie Tolan police brutality U.S. Supreme Court case, as well as the Martin Lee Anderson boot camp death case. In October, Crump was the keynote speaker at the 25th anniversary gala for the National Association of African American Honors Programs held at TSU.

The Pentagon begun cost-cutting reviews of F-35 and Air Force 1 Jan, 27 2017 Author: newsroom Donald Trump considers both programs as “too expensive” Related CIA memo confirms nuclear sub crash U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered cost-cutting reviews of two major aircraft acquisition programs, the F-35 fighter jet and Boeing Co’s (BA.N) next-generation of Air Force One presidential plane. President Donald Trump has derided Lockheed Martin’s (LMT.N) F-35 program as being too expensive. The way Pentagon will go is two step: one looking at how to cut costs, and the other determining whether the F/A-18E/F, with improvements, could be an effective, cheaper alternative. The costs for Lockheed’s F-35 program has escalated to an estimated $379 billion, which accounts for 20 percent of the company’s total revenue of $46.1 billion last year. This makes it the most expensive single military program of the US Armed Forces. The review of the Air Force One replacement, which Trump has also called too expensive, would look at the plane’s requirements and systems and identify courses of action to reduce acquisition and sustainment costs. The target is for the replacement cost not to exceed $4 billion.

The moves comes amid sustained criticism from President Donald Trump that costs for the stealth fighter jet program are “out of control” and repeated promises from Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson that the company is looking to find ways to comply with Trump’s demands. Mattis’ memo directs his deputy, Robert Work, to “determine opportunities” for cost reduction while maintaining the jet’s current requirements and to assess ways that F-18 Super Hornets could be improved to serve as a “cost effective” alternative for the F-35C. The F-35 jets are assembled at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth plant, where the defense contractor supplies thousands of jobs. Hewson recently told Trump the company would be adding 1,800 more Fort Worth jobs. Lockheed Martin said in a prepared statement that the company supports Mattis' review of the program and "welcomes the appropriate focus on affordability and capability." "We are confident such a thorough and objective analysis will show that only the F-35, with its advanced stealth and sensors, can meet the 21st century air superiority requirements of all of our military services," the company said. Lockheed encouraged the Pentagon to consider bulk, multi-year purchases of the jets to help drive down costs. But such proposals have been met with skepticism by critics of the program in the past, such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who chairs the Senate armed services committee. An analysis by Defense One, a publication that covers the military, found that the F-35 costs have already “come down dramatically” since the first series was ordered in 2007. Start-up costs for defense weapons systems typically start high but unit costs tend to decrease over time as production develops. After meeting with the Lockheed and Boeing CEOs in December at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump said he asked Boeing to price out a “comparable F-18 Super Hornet.” Critics noted that F-18s lack the stealth capabilities that distinguish the F-35s, but Mattis’ memorandum directs the review to compare the two planes and consider ways the F-18 can provide competition. Republican Rep. Kay Granger, whose Fort Worth district includes the Lockheed Martin assembly plant, took over as chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the department earlier this month. A longtime supporter of the F-35 program, Granger declined to comment on Mattis’ directive, but she has recently said that she has no problem with Trump’s desire to “watch every penny we’re spending.” The F-35 review could potentially affect current and future Defense Department budgets, a Pentagon spokesman said.  Current unit costs are $94.8 million for the Air Force's F-35A, $102 million for the Marines' F-35B and $115.7 million for the Navy's F-35C. Lockheed announced that the next F-35As, purchased in 2018 and delivered in 2020, will cost $85 million. Mattis offered praise of the F-35 in his Senate confirmation hearings earlier this month, and both Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz said they were encouraged to hear of Mattis' commitment to the program. Hewson told Lockheed shareholders on an earnings call this week that the company is “very close to a deal” with Trump on the F-35 program. "President Trump recognizes that the F-35 is a very large program — the largest program in the Department of Defense," Hewson said. "He wants to make the sure that the American taxpayer is getting the lowest possible cost on the program." Shares for Lockheed Martin fell by more than half a percent in the wake of the news of the review, following a recurring pattern after each time the F-35 has made headlines in recent months. The F-35 has been a major source of profit for the company, despite the recent disputes with Trump, as Hewson described the program as a “growth engine” for Lockheed.

Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (8) Washington • Defense Secretary James Mattis on Friday ordered reviews of two key Air Force aircraft programs that have been criticized by President Donald Trump as too expensive. Mattis asked Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work to conduct a review of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program to find ways to "significantly reduce" the costs. He said the review should compare the F-35 with the F/A-18 Super Hornet and determine if an upgraded Hornet could be a cost effective alternative that also meets requirements. Mattis also asked for a review of the presidential aircraft program -- known as Air Force One -- to identify cost savings. Boeing is slated to build two new planes to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. The new aircraft would go into service around 2024. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Mattis' orders come after Trump's tweets in December revealing that he asked Boeing to "price-out" a comparable Super Hornet became of cost overruns in Lockheed Martin's F-35. The stealthy F-35 has a nearly $400 billion price tag. Three versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy are being built, and other countries, including Israel, are buying the fighter jet. Despite the huge cost, the program has strong bipartisan support in Congress, where lawmakers view the aircraft as essential to U.S. national security. Trump also tweeted last month that the costs of the new Air Force One were "out of control." He demanded: "Cancel order!" Last March, the Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. The Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at about $4 billion, when research and development, construction and future maintenance were included. The Air Force has pressed for a faster replacement schedule, saying the aging current Boeing 747s are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. While Mattis, Trump and the Pentagon can push for deep cuts or even try to cancel the program, Congress controls the government's purse strings and makes final budget decisions.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 8 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES The battle over MormonLeaks -- two websites with one name and one goal: target the LDS Church ROTC may move from BYU to UVU after colonel bristles at Honor Code Garrison Keillor: Help us, GOP, you're our only hope SLC shirks Trump, refuses to enforce his immigration edict Utah's Mia Love tears up at anti-abortion rally talking of her parents' choice for life ELEVATE H&R Block Announces Two New Offers: Refund Advance of Up to $1,250 and Free Federal 1040EZ   Professional-in-Residence Jim Mortensen Prepares Students to Become Top Advisors   3 Unforgettable Date Night Ideas   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Shares of Lockheed Martin and Boeing dipped Friday after Secretary of Defense James Mattis directed cost-cutting reviews on the F-35 and presidential aircraft acquisition programs. The Pentagon said in a memo on Friday that the reviews were to "inform programmatic and budgetary decisions, recognizing the critical importance of each of these acquisition programs." "The Deputy Secretary of Defense shall oversee a review of the F-35 program to determine opportunities to significantly reduce the cost of the F-35 program while meeting requirements," the Pentagon said in a statement. In a statement on Friday, Lockheed Martin said it "stands ready to support Secretary Mattis' review of the F-35 program and welcomes the appropriate focus on affordability and capability. " "We also believe there are opportunities to continue to drive down program costs by using sound buying practices such as multi-year procurement that enable the Government to purchase thousands of critical components at an economic scale," The company added. Since his Nov. 8 election victory, President Donald Trump has been critical of both companies. Last year, Trump took a shot at Boeing, threatening to cancel the order for a new 747 Air Force One program, and he criticized the Lockheed program's delays and costs. Earlier this month, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson said the defensive contractor is "close to a deal" to bring down the cost of its F-35 fighter program following repeated criticisms from Trump. The reviews should begin immediately, according to the memo. Shares of Lockheed Martin ended the day about 0.6 percent lower, while Boeing shares fell 0.8 percent.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:40 AM, January 28, 2017 Updated: 4:10 AM, January 28, 2017 WASHINGTON - U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered cost-cutting reviews of two major aircraft acquisition programs, the F-35 fighter jet and Boeing Co's <BA.N> next generation of Air Force One presidential aircraft, according to Pentagon memos released on Friday. The review of Lockheed Martin's <LMT.N> F-35 program, which President Donald Trump has derided as being too expensive, would have two parts: one looking at how to lower costs, while the other would determine whether the F/A-18E/F could be an effective, lower cost alternative to the F-35C aircraft if improvements were made, the memo said. Costs for Lockheed's F-35 program had escalated to an estimated $379 billion. The program accounted for 20 percent of the company's total revenue of $46.1 billion last year.

 Mattis makes it official: The F-35 and the F-18 will face off Alex Lockie and Jonathan Garber Jan. 27, 2017, 1:37 PM 12,022 facebook linkedin twitter email print An F-35A Lightning II team parking the aircraft for the first time at Mountain Home Air Force Base, in Idaho on February 8.US Air Force photo On Friday, Secretary of Defense James Mattis called for a review of the F-35 program to "determine opportunities to significantly reduce the cost," sending Lockheed Martin's stock down 3% from its preannouncement levels. Lockheed's stock managed to hold support at the $250 level, and it has since worked its way back up to about $254 a share, down by about 0.4% on the day. A release from Mattis said the deputy secretary of defense would "oversee a review that compares the F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assess the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements (an advanced Super Hornet) can be made in order to provide competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative." Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, initiated in 2001, has been plagued by cost and schedule overruns as well as perceived deficiencies in the program. As of this year, many experts contacted by Business Insider agree that the jet's problems are mostly behind it, but some serious problems persist within the program. Specifically, the F-35C naval variant has struggled to achieve operational capability aboard the US's aircraft carriers. A recent report indicated that serious issues with the jet's takeoff process could derail the program until 2019. At about $130 million a plane, the F-35C is the most expensive variant of the three under production. The F/A-18 has been operational on US aircraft carriers for decades, and Boeing already demonstrated an ability to upgrade the plane on cost and on time in 2001 with the introduction of the Super Hornet. US Navy Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Tabert, an F-35C instructor pilot of Strike Fighter Squadron 101 (VFA-101), flying in formation with a Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet of VFA-122 before landing at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida in 2013.USAF Dan Gillian, Boeing's vice president of F/A-18 and EA-18 programs, told Business Insider this month that even with the coming F-35C naval variant, the US Navy still planned to field versions of the F/A-18 into the 2040s alongside F-35s. Gillian said advanced updates of the Super Hornet would not cost much more than current Super Hornets at about $70 million. While an updated Boeing F/A-18 could provide a significant portion of the F-35's avionics and networking capabilities, the F/A-18 simply cannot hope to achieve the all-aspect stealth built into the F-35. When the Defense Department compares the planes, it'll have to evaluate how to prioritize stealth in the threat environment of the future. The F-35's stealth makes it ideal for operating in heavily contested airspace, such as that defended by Russia or China, but emerging counterstealth technologies threaten the efficacy of the F-35. Lt. Col. David Berke, a former F-35 squadron commander, told Business Insider that because the F-35 program still ran initial versions of its software, "we don’t even know 50-80% of what this airplane can do." Boeing Both the Air Force's F-35A and the Marine Corps' F-35B have achieved initial operational capability, and Lockheed Martin has projected the cost for the Air Force's variant to reach $85 million a plane by the time full production picks up. Shares of Lockheed Martin have been treading water between $250 and $260 after a December 12 tweet by then-President-elect Donald Trump saying the F-35's costs were "out of control" sent the stock into a tailspin. Its all-time high of $269.90 was put in on December 5.

In two memorandums signed and effective immediately, Mattis said Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work will “oversee a review that compares the F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assess the extent that the F/A-18E/F [Super Hornet] improvements can be made in order to provide a competitive, cost effective fighter aircraft alternative,” according to a statement from Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis. For the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, known as Air Force One, Mattis said Work’s review should “identify specific areas where costs can be lowered,” such as “autonomous operations, aircraft power generation, environmental conditioning [cooling], survivability, and military [and] civilian communication capabilities,” the memo said. The memos didn’t specify if the review will reduce the planned number of aircraft. Davis said of the effort, “This is a prudent step to incorporate additional information into the budget preparation process and to inform the secretary’s recommendations to the president regarding critical military capabilities.” He added, “This action is also consistent with the president’s guidance to provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation’s defense, and it aligns with the secretary’s priority to increase military readiness while gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense.” The total C requirement is a 260-unit buy for the Navy, Lockheed spokesman Michael J. Rein told Military.com There have been 26 carrier variants delivered to the Navy as of December 2016, he said. Both the F-35 stealth fighter and Air Force One presidential aircraft acquisition programs have been in President Donald Trump’s crosshairs in recent weeks. Trump has criticized the high cost of the $4 billion Air Force One being developed by Boeing and the nearly $400 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter being manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp. On Dec. 6, Trump tweeted “cancel order!” in reference to the Air Force One program. He brought up the issue again during a Dec. 16 speech in Pennsylvania, and also called the F-35 program a “disaster” with its cost overruns. “You’re way early in the Air Force One program to be doing that kind of review, and frankly, there’s not a lot to review,” Richard Aboulafia, vice president and analyst at the Teal Group, told Military.com. “The program [right now] is a review. What do we need to recapitalize?” Trump later tweeted on Dec. 22, “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” However, for the F-35, “the C model is kind of an irrelevance to the broader program context,” Aboulafia said. “Even if they cancel the last [few] aircraft, I can’t imagine it would make a big difference,” he said. RELATED: General: Older Fighters Can’t Match F-35 “Now that we know [he meant] just the C [version] … that’s been reality for years now. The Navy hasn’t bought more than a tiny token … of Cs, and four times as many Super Hornets and Growlers. You do the math … It’s a single digit percentage of the total program at best,” Aboulafia said. Lockheed’s production run of the F-35C is slated through 2036, Rein said, but the planes will likely be delivered at a much faster rate. “Even in that context, all those planes would have come much later when they matter less when the program’s secure, costs reduced, and whatever else,” Aboulafia said. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is expected to cost nearly $400 billion in development and procurement costs to field a fleet of 2,457 single-engine fighters — and some $1.5 trillion in lifetime sustainment costs, according to Pentagon figures. It’s the Pentagon’s single most expensive acquisition effort. Capital Alpha Partners LLC, an independent financial policy research firm in Washington, D.C., on Friday responded, “Bottom line for us is that we don’t expect this to result in major programmatic changes.” It added in a statement, “DoD with the backing of Trump could simply push for a lower unit price in future production lots resulting in the primes on the program eating this or more likely pushing harder on subcontractors for lower costs. “If Lockheed Martin lost the F-35C, the overall price on the F-35 might increase on lower total production, but international demand and DoD requirements should still keep the program ramping up to [around] 130 annual deliveries by the early 2020s — down from [around] 150 or so,” the firm said. Trump has met with Lockheed Martin Corp.’s CEO Marillyn Hewson on multiple occasions and last week with Boeing’s CEO Dennis Muilenburg. The company heads have vowed — in what they said were productive conversations with the president — to drive down costs on both programs. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Muilenburg said just days after Trump met with Hewson. “All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I’m pleased with the progress there,” he said. “And similarly on fighters, we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our warfighters most affordably.” Previous post About the Author Oriana Pawlyk Oriana Pawlyk is a reporter at Military.com.

General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is a bit of a bore, and that’s putting it mildly. In fact, of the thousands of investments available, GE stock is the one I dread analyzing. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has the sexy industry, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has the sexy CEO — or so I’ve been told — and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) basically owns sex. General Electric? It has a 3.23% dividend yield — I think you’re getting my drift. Source: Shutterstock That’s not to say that GE stock is irrelevant in the current markets. This week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 20,000 points for the first time in history. Not only is General Electric a component of the Dow 30, it was a strong contributor to the record. GE stock turned in a 1.23% performance against its prior session. The average gains for the Dow-listed companies on the record-breaking day was only 0.6%, which is surprisingly low. In fact, there were only six companies that posted better numbers than GE, and these were the usual suspects. In increasing order, they were International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and standout Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), which ringed up an impressive 4% move. Besides the obvious point that these companies are proudly red, white and blue, it’s easy to see why they performed so well over the others. President Donald Trump has promised fewer regulations stymieing business, more support for the military industrial complex and keeping jobs stateside. General Electric belongs among the titans of American industry; hence, yesterday’s robust gains. But is the recent surge of GE stock based on optimism for President Trump, or a reaction from pronounced volatility? The answer to that question is critical for investors. GE Stock Is Exciting, and That’s Bad! GE has shed its boring image, but for all the wrong reasons. Click to Enlarge While it’s very early into the new year, nevertheless, it’s worth pointing out that shares are down 4%. I should also mention that at this price point, GE stock is firmly below its 50-day moving average, and only a hair above its 200-DMA. I don’t think the volatility should be ignored as a bunch of technical mumbo jumbo. Just a few days ago, General Electric shares were down 6%. More worryingly, traders haven’t pushed the needle that far since GE faltered under the weight of an uninspiring and anemic fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 earnings results. Rightfully, people are concerned. True, GE stock is a reliable investment, making steady gains through all sorts of economic cycles. At the same time, its stable nature can work against the investor if there’s a sharp downfall. It may take an inordinate amount of time for General Electric to gain 10%, but it could be gone in a flash. As an example, GE returned 6% last year — and we’ve basically burned through two-thirds of that profit. I don’t care how high the dividend yields are for General Electric. No one can afford to lose that much capital and justify the losses due to the passive income. Unless GE stock was offering double digits, it’s a bad deal. Of course, the question would then become, why are they offering double digits?

In a report released on Friday, the National Audit Office said the possibility of running out of available funds – budgeted money and emergency cash – was greater than at any point since 2012. According to the report, the projected costs of funding the defence plan, which takes Britain from 2016 to 2026, rose by 7% last year to £178bn. This compares with a rise of 1.2% between 2013 and 2015. A large part of the increase was due to the £24.4bn of additional commitments announced in the 2015 strategic defence and security review. This includes costs for Boeing Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft from the US which will be based at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. On Thursday, the defence minister Harriet Baldwin and the US deputy defence secretary, Bob Work, signed an accord to share logistics and support bases. The fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote would pose a significant risk to the plan’s affordability, the auditors warned. The report said: “As of 10 January 2017, the pound was 21.4% below the exchange rate with the US dollar and 4.2% below the exchange rate for the euro used in the department’s planning assumptions. Approximately £18.6bn of the plan is denominated in US dollars and £2.6bn in euros over 10 years.” The NAO has expressed concern that meeting these costs will absorb the £10.7bn “headroom” money set aside for unexpected expenditure, that was built into the MoD’s spending plan. They warned that defence officials would have to find additional savings of £5.8bn over the next decade to ensure affordability. About £1.5bn would come from savings elsewhere in the defence budget, such as military and civilian pay restraint, and reducing the running costs of the defence estate. The head of the NAO, Sir Amyas Morse, said the equipment plan budget was at greater risk than at any time since its inception. “It is worrying to see that the costs of the new commitments arising from the review considerably exceed the net increase in funding for the plan,” he said. “There is little room for unplanned cost growth and the MoD must actively guard against the risk of a return to previous practice, where affordability could only be maintained by delaying or reducing the scope of projects.” In a statement released by the MoD, Baldwin said the government was committed to delivering “the best kit for our armed forces at the best value for the taxpayer”. “We are focused on maintaining an affordable programme and delivering the efficiencies we need to reinvest in cutting-edge ships, planes, versatile strike brigades and greater cyber capabilities, so that our armed forces have the equipment they need to keep the UK safe and secure,” she said.

It’s got planes, it’s got drones, and soon, it looks like Amazon will also have ships. Building upon its ever-expanding arsenal of shipment methods, the online retailer has reportedly taken to the high seas. According to the Wall Street Journal, although Amazon neither owns nor operates ships, it is “openly acting as a global freight forwarder and third-party logistics provider,” which means that it’s booking space on ocean liners and getting inventory between ports and warehouses. It’s the latest move the Seattle-based company has taken to control all aspects of your order gets from Amazon’s warehouses to your front door. Last year, Amazon leased a fleet of Boeing planes “to ensure air cargo capacity to support one and two-day delivery for customers.” Now, it’s taking another method under its wing. Amazon now handles ocean-based shipments from Chinese merchants and the company has already helped move at least 150 containers of merchandise from the country since October. More: A button for every order: Amazon has more than 250 Dash buttons for sale “Amazon has integrated [serveral] services into one basket,” said Steve Ferreira, chief executive of Ocean Audit, a company specializing in ocean freight refund recovery for shippers. These services include sorting, labeling, and tracking shipments — tasks that are generally the responsibility of global freight companies. Amazon’s move, however, bears “a lot of strategic value,” Ferreira added. As Amazon continues to exercise more oversight over the entirety of the shipping process, it will become much more than a retailer. Instead, it could disrupt the entire deliveries industry and also add a brand new revenue stream to Amazon’s business model. As John Haber, CEO of supply-chain consultancy Spend Management Experts told the Journal, Amazon’s latest decision “is a great example of how Amazon’s expanding its logistical footprint, as well as getting deeper into customers’ supply chains. This is just another cog in the supply chain that they are putting under their control.” Also watch: Share

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 27, 2017 at 10:52AM The rise in aerospace has benefited many companies, and Moog (NYSE:MOG-A) (NYSE:MOG-B) has counted on its aircraft and space-systems businesses to help carry the load in a sluggish environment for the broader industrial sector. Coming into Friday's fiscal first-quarter financial report, Moog investors believed that the company would be able to produce growth in revenue and profit, and the company did even better than most expected. Let's look more closely at Moog and what its results say about the coming year. Image source: Moog. Moog climbs back into growth mode Moog's fiscal first-quarter results gave investors everything they were looking for and then some. Revenue was up 4% to $589.7 million, which was better than the consensus forecast among those following the stock of $583 million. Net income produced even stronger growth of 16%, and that resulted in earnings of $0.84 per share, $0.04 better than what investors had expected to see. Taking a closer look at Moog's performance, the maker of precision control components and systems went back to its best-performing areas over the past few years to generate the most growth. The commercial aircraft segment saw a 5% rise in revenue, due largely to a 40% jump in sales of original equipment manufacturer products to Airbus in its A350 program. However, Boeing still accounts for nearly double Moog's revenue compared to Airbus, despite having flat sales for the quarter. The space and defense segment did even better. Segment revenue was up 11%, with space, in particular, rising 13% on sales of space avionics and satellite engines. Ground vehicle, missile, and naval products sent defense revenue up 10%. Moreover, the components segment also saw double-digit percentage growth on the top line, showing gains not just in aerospace and defense components but also in the company's medical market and industrial products niche. Still, the industrial systems segment continued to lag. Weakness in simulation and testing, industrial automation, and energy-related applications sent segment revenue down 10% from year-ago levels. Things looked a little different in terms of segment profitability. Components and aircraft controls led the way higher, with bottom-line gains of 44% and 25% respectively. But the space and defense controls segment suffered a profit drop of nearly two-fifths, and industrial systems operating profit fell by more than 20%. CEO John Scannell was happy with Moog's results. "It was a good start to the year, and it puts us on track for our full year guidance," Scannell said. "Most of our businesses have stabilized since this time last year, and we are seeing positive results from restructuring and our portfolio reviews of the past few years." The CEO also took pride in noting that earnings came in better than Moog had originally forecast. Can Moog keep up the pace? Moog also has plenty of room for further growth. The company reported a backlog of $1.2 billion, which works out to about six months' worth of revenue at Moog's current run rate. If weak areas like energy start bouncing back, then renewed industrial strength could add to the success that the company has seen on the aerospace front. However, Moog did pull back slightly on its guidance for fiscal year 2017. The company cut its revenue expectations by $20 million -- now believing that it will bring in sales of $2.42 billion. Moog did keep its $3.50 per share earnings forecast intact, with an implied range of $3.30 to $3.70 per share based on its estimate. Even with the guidance concerns, Moog investors seemed pleased with the news, sending the stock up 3% in Friday morning trading following the announcement. If aerospace continues to provide such an important boost to its fundamental business, then Moog will be positioned to do even better once the cyclical industrial economy starts to fire on all cylinders again.

Trump’s manufacturing council includes Elon Musk, Michael Dell and Mark Fields Posted 17 hours ago by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Satechi’s $30 Power Meter is designed to weed out bad USB-C cables Donald Trump’s White House administration has revealed the full membership of its manufacturing council (via Steve Kopack), which he assigned Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris to lead in December. The council includes Elon Musk, making this the second Trump administration advisory group that the Tesla CEO belongs to, including his Strategic and Policy Forum, which advises on economic matters. Musk isn’t the only tech executive on the manufacturing council, however. Other members include Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Dell CEO and founder Michael Dell, and Ford CEO Michael Fields. Dennis Muilenburg from Boeing, Wendell Weeks from Corning, Jeff Immelt from General Electric and Marillyn Hewson from Lockheed Martin are also council members. Of the tech industry people on this list, Musk has perhaps been the most vocal and visible in his involvement with Trump administration activities. Musk tweeted his optimism around Trump Secretary of State pick Rex Tillerson earlier this week, and spoke to Gizmodo about his support of the oil industry executive. Though Tillerson supported a carbon tax on record at ExxonMobil, a measure Musk also supports for encouraging development of renewables, a report this week revealed that the Secretary of State pick’s former company also actively lobbied against a carbon tax in Massachusetts. Musk also met with Trump on Monday, in a meeting where Ford’s Mark Fields was also present. Fields has been among the most enthusiastic and vocal with regards to Trump on the auto industry side. Following a meeting earlier this week which also included GM CEO Mary Barra and FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne, Fields said he was “excited” about working with Trump and his administration.

Close share panel Image copyright PA Image caption The UK is to speed up the purchase of new F35B jets for the Royal Navy and RAF The Ministry of Defence will struggle to afford plans to buy new jets, ships and armoured vehicles, the government spending watchdog has warned. A 10-year spending plan, published in 2015, added £24.4bn for new maritime patrol aircraft, infantry vehicles, and to speed up the purchase of F35B jets. However, a National Audit Office report warned it must first find £5.8bn in new savings to meet the extra commitments. Defence minister Harriett Baldwin said it was delivering an affordable plan. What was included in the 2015 defence review? The government set out its Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in November 2015, announcing £12bn in extra defence spending. The review included plans for nine Boeing P8 maritime patrol aircraft - to replace the RAF's scrapped Nimrod jets - and that the purchase of 24 new F35 fighter aircraft would be accelerated. 'Greater risk' The NAO report said additional planned expenditure amounted to £24.4bn of new commitments to the MoD budget. The projected cost of funding the plan increased to £178bn - a rise of 7% - it said. Boeing P8 4,500 miles (7,200 km) maximum range without refuelling 490 knots (910km/h; 560mph) maximum speed 28 P-8A Poseidon aircraft in use by the United States 2 other countries, India and Australia, have variants of the aircraft in use or on order Source: Boeing Boeing The review said the MoD was already having to use a £10bn contingency fund set aside for emergencies and will have to find another £5.8bn in savings over the next 10 years. The report warned the MoD had yet to generate £2.5bn of the £7.1bn savings already factored into the plan. However, head of the NAO, Sir Amyas Morse, said the affordability of the equipment plan "is at greater risk than at any time since its inception". 'Cutting-edge ships' "It is worrying to see that the costs of the new commitments arising from the review considerably exceed the net increase in funding for the plan. "There is little room for unplanned cost growth and the MoD must actively guard against the risk of a return to previous practice where affordability could only be maintained by delaying or reducing the scope of projects." The spending plans have also been hit by recent currency fluctuations as the MoD looks to buy new equipment from the US. Minister for Defence Procurement Harriett Baldwin said the 10-year plan would deliver "the best kit for our armed forces at the best value for the taxpayer". "We are focused on maintaining an affordable programme and delivering the efficiencies we need to reinvest in cutting-edge ships, planes, versatile strike brigades, and greater cyber capabilities, so that our Armed Forces have the equipment they need to keep the UK safe and secure."

The S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite both posted new record highs before traded slightly in the red less than an hour before the closing bell. WTI crude oil for March delivery settled at $53.78 a barrel, up about 2% on the day. February gold dropped 0.7% on the day to settle at $1,189.80. Equities were headed for a mixed close close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.11% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down 0.10%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded down 0.04%. Stocks traded very near the break even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could differ from these results. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Thursday was The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) which traded up 1.32% at $169.57.

Technicians were happy to have the Dow extend its gains, since to them it was confirmation that the breakout was genuine. However, even though the Dow closed higher, the S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq was basically unchanged. All of the indices were positive until Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was “uninvited” to a meeting by President Donald Trump to discuss paying for “The Wall.” Better-than-expected earnings from Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) helped the Dow achieve gains. BA’s 1.1% advance helped to offset a negative story about Verizon Communications Inc.’s (NYSE:VZ) proposed combination with Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR). VZ lost 1.3% and CHTR rose 7.4%. Crude oil (WTI) gained 1.9%, closing at $53.75 per barrel. However, the energy sector of the 500 closed unchanged. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 32 points at 20,101, the S&P 500 fell 2 points at 2,297, the Nasdaq lost a point to close at 5,655 and the Russell 2000 fell 7 points, closing at 1,376. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded 829 million shares with total volume of 3.5 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 1.8 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners led by a slight margin, and on the Nasdaq, decliners led by 1.6-to-1. Blocks on the NYSE fell slightly from Wednesday’s total of 6,263. Click to Enlarge The S&P 500 broke from resistance at 2,280 on Wednesday on a “Continuation Gap” and headed to slightly over 2,300 before reversing and closing lower by under 2 points. Volume was high enough to cancel out the increase on Wednesday, but MACD issued a new buy signal. Conclusion: Yesterday’s reversal by my CBR (Collins Bollinger Reversal) indicator is signaling that the continuation gap from 2,285 to 2,289 will probably be closed by sellers, perhaps even today. This is normal following a major breakout as traders and computer programs jump in to nail down short-term gains. But the signal has been given by the Dow averages that all is well. Both the Dow industrials (+32) and the Dow transports (+48) rose to a new high at 9,503. The transports’ break confirms that the bull market is intact.

Tags: Saudi Arabia, US, Yemen, Arms Sales, Saudi Arabia showed off its next-generation fighter jets this week, the first batch of military items bought in a $30 billion US arms deal, as the UN warned the kingdom’s military campaign in Yemen may pull the war-torn country into famine. The kingdom unveiled the new Boeing F-15SA jets during an air-show and parade attended by King Salman and his son, Defence Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday, bought as part of a $30 billion US arms deal made during the former Obama administration. The deal – described as the most expensive US arms sale to a foreign country - included orders for upgrades to Saudi Arabia’s 70 older F-15s, HARM AGM-88 Anti-Radiation Missiles, Laser JDAM and Enhanced Paveway munitions and related equipment and services. For two years, Saudi Arabia has led a military campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, in a war that has so far left more than 10,000 people dead and millions more in dire need of assistance. Despite a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute which stated in April that Saudi Arabia was the world’s third-largest defence spender, the kingdom’s state-of-the-art technology has done little to push back Houthis from rebel-held areas, including Sanaa and several cities along the Red Sea coast. “There’s no question that impressive equipment has been a boon to the Saudi-led coalition,” said Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “But ultimately, state of the art weaponry is one thing and the situation on the ground is another.” Saudi Arabia’s air show came as the United Nations aid chief warned on Thursday that Yemen was sliding deeper into humanitarian crisis and could face famine this year. "The conflict in Yemen is now the primary driver of the largest food security emergency in the world," Stephen O'Brien, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, told the Security Council. "If there is no immediate action, famine is now a possible scenario for 2017." About 14 million people – nearly 80 percent of the entire Yemeni population – are in need of food aid, half of whom are severely food insecure, O'Brien said. At least two million people need emergency food assistance to survive, he added. The situation is particularly dire for children with some 2.2 million infants now suffering from acute malnourishment – an increase of 53 percent from late 2015.

The US president said the modified Boeing 747 was a “great plane” following a 20-minute flight from Washington, DC, to a Republican annual retreat in Philadelphia.

Asked how it compared to his other plane, Trump replied: “That’s a good one too, but this is a very special plane for a lot of reasons.” Trump at his desk on Air Force One Credit: AP Trump with the media  Credit: AP America’s 45th president  then pointed to the Air Force One jacket, commenting: “They just gave me that. Pretty cool jacket, right?” Earlier, Trump committed a minor faux pas as he boarded the plane when he forgot to turn around and wave, a longstanding presidential tradition.  White House correspondent Mark Knoller tweeted: “Pres Trump boards Air Force One, but doesn't turn around to wave - as presidents have done for decades.” Another online commentator wrote: “Who cares if @POTUS #Trump didn't give you a fake smile and a wave from Air Force One!

He previously has called for the scrapping of multi-billion dollar plans for Boeing to build a new Air Force One, calling the costs "ridiculous and totally out of control".

The age of US-UK liberal interventionism is over. That was the message Theresa May gave Republican politicians ahead of her meeting with Donald Trump on Friday. She also warned that Mr Trump should “beware” of Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Mrs May will be the first head of state to meet the new US president with whom she disagrees on many fundamental issues, and she faces a delicate balancing act in trying to foster a close relationship with him while trying to convince him of the need to sustain western values. Europe looms large over the talks and the two leaders are expected to take a symbolic step towards a US-UK trade deal. But in prioritising a pact with the UK, the new US president is putting much larger trade talks with the EU launched in 2013 on ice, while Mrs May is seeking leverage for her own negotiations with the EU. Given Mr Trump’s unpredictability the meeting is his first diplomatic test. European and other world leaders will be watching nervously. (FT, WaPo, Politico) In the news Taxing Mexico The White House threatened to impose a 20 per cent tax on all imports from Mexico — and other countries with which the US runs a trade deficit — to finance Donald Trump’s proposed border wall. The news comes after Mexico’s President Enrique Peña Nieto cancelled a summit with Donald Trump. Critics say the tax is more likely to cost American consumers than Mexicans. (NYT, Politico) Brexit’s shrinking labour pool Hospitality, agriculture, construction and manufacturing will have to compete with each other for a smaller pool of low-skilled migrants after Brexit when tighter border controls are imposed, according to a new report. (FT) New supermarket giant The Uk’s biggest supermarket has just got even bigger. Tesco has announced a deal to buy wholesale supplier Booker Group for £3.7bn. Tesco already controls a 28 per cent market share and the acquisition could raise questions about competition. (FT) Madcap military US and South Korean marines have been carrying out unusual military exercises on the ski slopes of South Korea. A US marine spokesman says the shirtless hand-to-hand combat in sub-zero temperatures is part of preparation for possible threats from North Korea in the 2018 Winter Olympics. Pyongyang is not amused and has threatened to retaliate over what it says are “madcap midwinter” drills. (Reuters) Toshiba breaks off chip business The Japanese company said it would split off its operation that makes memory chips for smartphones and computers, and will sell a stake in the new business. It needs to raise funds after revealing a heavy one-off loss at its US nuclear power business. (BBC, NAR) Test your knowledge with the FirstFT news quiz.

(NYT) Food for thought What the world hears from Donald Trump “The lights have been burning late as policymakers around the world deliberate on how to handle a president with so slight a grip on history or strategic realities,” writes the FT’s Philip Stephens. “From France to China, what unites these various friends and foes is a view that the US president will prove a force for dangerous instability. Yes, the crowds on the Washington Mall may have been on the small side but yes, Mr Trump, the world was listening.” (FT) Indonesia: A nation’s tolerance on trial Religious and ethnic tensions are on the rise as Jakarta’s governor fights blasphemy charges during his bid for re-election.

She was born December 11, 1922 in Ethridge, Tennessee to Harvey and Catherine Buzbee. Jo graduated from high school and attended secretarial school in Tennessee. In 1942 Jo and her mother moved to Seattle, Washington where Jo spent a year employed at Boeing Aircraft as a “Rosie the Riveter” working on the B-17 bomber. While in Seattle a friend asked Jo if she would be interested in dating a young man serving in the army as a military policeman. Jo replied that she was interested if he was tall and good looking. Gil Merritt fulfilled the requirements and they were married in March 1944. Jo and Gil were married 52 years. Following a brief residence in Portland, Ore. and the birth of their first daughter, Sylvia in 1945 Jo and Gill moved to Medford, Ore. where their second daughter, Teresa was born in 1947. Busy raising small children, Jo held a series of part-time jobs until 1953 when she began working as a teller for The First National Bank of Oregon where she rose to the position of bank Vice President before retiring in 1984. Jo was active in Zonta, a professional women’s group. Among her other interests, Jo was an excellent cook and masterful seamstress, making clothes for herself and her daughters. She enjoyed gardening and took great interest in the appearance of her home. Her energy and sense of fun led her to try hiking, jogging, sailing, golf, and a hot air balloon ride. For Jo, travel included among other places, the Czech Republic; New Zealand; an Alaskan cruise; multiple visits to New Orleans for Mardi Gras; a trip to Ireland with both daughters; sightseeing adventures along the east coast; a trip to England that included the Chelsea Flower Show and London; and most recently, a trip to Baja, Mexico. Jo was a frequent attendee at music and theater performances in and around the Rogue Valley. At the age of 88 Jo and a group of friends published a calendar featuring the group in “glamour shots.” The calendar was then sold, raising $10,000 as a donation to the Southern Oregon Humane Society. Jo is survived by her daughters, Sylvia Connor and Teresa O’Connor; and nephews, Harvey and Larry Buzbee. She was preceded in death by her parents; her brother, Harry; and her husband, Gilbert (Gil) Merritt. Jo will be greatly missed and remembered with love by family and friends alike. An afternoon gathering in her memory for family and friends is planned for February 4, 2017 at her home. Please call 571-246-3157 for details. In lieu of flowers Jo’s daughters request memorial contributions to the Southern Oregon Humane Society.

BRINGING INNOVATION TO MARKET 5 Ways Entrepreneurship Can Heal A Nation The nation, and world is dealing with a number of divisive issues after a rough 2016. Here's how entrepreneurship can help fix these issues here and abroad. By Dan Maycock Dan Maycock is the chief data officer and co-founder of Equinauts, a customer analytics service focused on helping companies better understand their growth and customer value. Having worked in the startup space for the past several years, in areas including advanced analytics, innovation strategy, and mobile technology, Maycock has an in-depth perspective on using innovation as a meaningful tool to drive measurable growth and success. @DanMaycock Chief data officer and co-founder, Equinauts@DanMaycock WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement I just read an article written by Joan Williams in Harvard Business Review titled "What So Many People Don't Get About the Working Class." She discussed reasons the nation is in the political state it's in, and the reaction the middle class has had after years of job losses and an overarching sense of being left behind. The article resonated with me because I grew up in a conservative farming town of 8,000, attended a university known for its agricultural programs, and then went on to work at The Boeing Company for five years. I now live in liberal Seattle. I left Boeing to start a company, then worked in technology and management consulting in cities across the world, and now have started another company. Having spent half my life on one side of the conversation and half on the other, I see entrepreneurs as the ones standing in the middle. What it takes to start, run, and grow a small business requires a multitude of skills, including but not limited to: Managing teams with empathy and understanding Making strategic hiring decisions Building a compelling story to get buyers in the door Following local policies, demographic shifts, and labor issues Keeping a national perspective when it comes to supply chain issues, taxes, and trend shifts And so many people are impacted by a small business each day, whether as customers, employees, or founders. From an FAQ article written by SBA.gov in Sept, 2012: "Small businesses make up: 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms, 64 percent of net new private-sector jobs, 49.2 percent of private-sector employment, 42.9 percent of private-sector payroll, 46 percent of private-sector output, 43 percent of high-tech employment, 98 percent of firms exporting goods, and 33 percent of exporting value." Although this information is almost five years old, the significance of small business hasn't changed much. From stories of Radiator Springs in the Pixar movie "Cars" to popular books like "Hillbilly Elegy" by J.D. Vance, it's not hard to find insights into the middle class struggle and see how it ties to small business ownership. In Dr. Williams's article, she talks about the dream of owning a business and the scarcity-driven fear of feeling left out as blue-collar workers have found it harder to take care of their families, let alone take risks to get ahead. So what does this mean for you? As a current or future entrepreneur, you have an opportunity (perhaps obligation?) to reach out in your community and help shape our nation in the coming years. The rest of this article contains some suggestions that will go a long way toward undoing the divisive rhetoric and populism facing all of us today. 1. Entrepreneurial viewpoints are contagious, so get to know someone you don't agree with Too often we surround ourselves with perspectives and inputs that support what we already believe. As an entrepreneur, you get even less time to take in what's going on outside of your business, which means it can be harder to invest in a diversity of perspectives. Yet, finding at least one relationship--an actual person, please--that can help balance out bias means you'll be able to see where others are coming from more easily. We all want to be heard and valued. As an entrepreneur, you can reflect that balanced perspective with the business community, employees, and customers you interact with every day. Imagine the impact of treating everyone with respect and common understanding. That can begin with you. 2. Focus on employee ownership Scarcity, fear, and the instinct to survive drive people to make decisions against their own long-term interests. Many people in the U.S. have been feeling increasingly left out of the American dream. They feel left behind and without opportunity. Creating a path for every employee to own a piece of the business is one way to help counter that. Whether it's allotting equity in your company or sponsoring employees to start their own ventures, ownership breeds a sense of purpose and pride that can be matched by few other things in a professional's life. From the pride of owning something, to the additional revenue that can come from the business succeeding, degrees of ownership can help rid individuals of that sense of scarcity. 3. Volunteer for small business workshops and literacy programs Unemployment is historically low, but underemployment can be a bigger issue for people trying to provide a future for themselves and their families. Not only that, but job satisfaction has been shown to impact everything from health and energy, to community participation and healthy family life. I've had the chance to meet with people all over the world, talking about innovation and discussing people's goals to create new things. Of the hundreds of people I've spoken to, many weren't happy in their jobs and wished they had the tools or abilities to do their own thing. Barriers to making a change can include lack of education or skills, inexperience, or lack of knowledge about existing sources of funding. The right mentorship from people who have catapulted over similar obstacles may be part of the answer. Entrepreneurship isn't for everyone, but equipping more people with a path toward becoming one will help them create their own opportunities. Furthermore, children of disadvantaged homes often struggle in school due to issues surrounding basic literacy. Those same children often grow up struggling to compete in everyday work environments. Consider volunteering your time to help kids get caught up. It can have a lasting impact and help each child feel like they have a shot at success. 4. Engage with your local government Local issues lead to national campaigns. This election was won because small-town issues outweighed the opinions of urban populations. Wherever you live, there is a local community where people across many walks of life engage in issues that affect them. As an entrepreneur, you're a part of that conversation each day, possibly without knowing it. Consider then, how you can take a more active role in supporting initiatives that help everyone succeed. These may include: Fundraising for a new school Participating in a business plan competition Getting involved in ballot measures that locally could have a positive impact on economic growth. Ridding your community of opportunity scarcity means we're all better off. It also helps reduce the effectiveness of fear mongering and hate. 5. Stop considering college as the only path to entry Education is a traditional barrier in professional environments. Yet, I've worked with many smart people with only a high school education. Treating college as just one route to success rather than the only one is an important step. You can do this by: Supporting a trade school by volunteering for mentoring, guest speaking, and participating in hiring fairs Advocating for blue collar workers (ex: consider incorporating local fabrication shops into bids for product prototypes vs outsourcing everything). Considering skilled people for employment regardless of their backgrounds People are feeling a divide, where those with formal educations are perceived as the "haves" and those without are the "have nots." As an entrepreneur, you may have insights into how to break down this divide within your own organization. Consider how you might use these approaches in your own community, and leave comments below on other ideas that might help heal our country and world. As an entrepreneur, you're more equipped than you know to encourage change and help fix some of what is broken in our society.

At right, NASA project director Peter Zorba discusses the future removal of concrete and asphalt from the Delta test area. NASA continues to make progress in the cleanup of its portion of the Santa Susana Field Lab, with the second phase of demolition about 70 percent complete. The agency is overseeing the cleanup of all of Area II and part of Area I at the field lab in the hills of Simi Valley. These are the portions that belong to the federal government and comprise 20 percent of the site. The other 80 percent of the field lab belongs to Boeing Co. Since March, NASA has cleared out 11 potable water storage tanks and associated pipelines in the “Skyline area” in the southwest portion of Area II, inactive fuel farms in the historic Coca and Delta rocket test sites, and an old sewage treatment plant. Photos by MICHAEL COONSAcorn Newspapers Dormant power lines, transformers, poles and obsolete pipelines have also been removed, said Peter Zorba, NASA’s field lab project director. The second phase of demolition will continue next month with the removal of remaining concrete surfaces that have been deemed nonhazardous and obsolete structures in the former Delta test site, where large liquid propulsion systems were tested in the 1960s. The Delta rocket test stands were demolished in 1982. Zorba said Delta is the first of the four test areas at the 2,850- acre field lab to be cleaned up. He anticipates phase two of the razing will be completed by the end of this year, but officials still don’t know when the entire cleanup will be completed. “Pulling down service buildings, warehouse structures and steel buildings on flat concrete . . . was not that complex, but now we’re starting to get to the complexity of the demolition that’s a challenge (where) we’ve got to sit here, look at all the unknowns and figure out how we’re going to approach it,” Zorba said. ALL GONE—An area along the north side of the Santa Susana Field Lab, pictured Jan. 13, sits nearly empty after several buildings were demolished, and the asphalt and concrete removed. MICHAEL COONS/Acorn Newspapers “There’s a lot of preparation that goes into getting us where we’re at now because there’s no class or book on how to demolish a test stand. And the stands at SSFL are unlike any at other NASA locations because they are anchored in bedrock instead of concrete.” The field lab, built in 1947, was used as a nuclear test site and for research in the development of ballistic missiles, rockets and space shuttle equipment. In 1959, a partial nuclear meltdown occurred in Area IV, which is in the 80 percent of the field lab owned by Boeing. Toxic cleanup of the field lab began in 2010, with NASA overseeing the federal government’s portion, and the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Toxic Substances Control managing Boeing’s portion. NASA began its first phase of demolition in 2014, which included taking down the service areas and office buildings in the Delta area. That work was completed in December 2015. “I’m very proud of my NASA predecessors who did amazing things here (at SSFL), like developing the rockets that put us into space, put a man on the moon and ended the Cold War,” Zorba said. “I want to continue that work but . . . the work I’m doing, in a sense, is deconstructing a lot of what was constructed to bring the site back to as much of a normal condition as possible.” NASA, Boeing and the DOE are waiting on the DTSC’s final environmental impact report, a state-issued document expected to be released in the next couple of months outlining the remediation responsibilities for all the agencies. “We have to plan (remediation) according to the conditions, which vary from area to area,” Zorba said. “There’s no one silver bullet to fix everything. You have to look at each of these areas uniquely. The demolition is the first step in the cleanup process.” Return to top Copyright © 2003-2017 J.Bee NP Publishing, Ltd., All Rights Reserved.

Investor euphoria was initially ignited by Wednesday's upbeat Earnings reports as well as an across-the-board stock rally around the world, which made the Dow open directly above the milestone of 20,000. Before Wednesday's opening bell, the Dow component Boeing Company announced fourth-quarter revenue of 23.3 billion U.S. dollars, with GAAP earnings per share of 2.59 dollars and core earnings per share (non-GAAP) of 2.47 dollars, reflecting overall solid execution on production programs and services. Shares of the aircraft maker surged 4.24 percent to 167.36 U.S. dollars apiece Wednesday following the release of the company's strong quarterly results. The latest data from Thomson Reuters showed that the S&P 500 companies' blended earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 are expected to rise 6.8 percent year on year, while the revenues are forecast to increase 4.1 percent. Both the fourth-quarter earnings and revenues are much-better-than they are in the second quarter and third quarter. Overseas stock markets also increased broadly Wednesday. European equities ended higher amid bullish sentiment. German benchmark DAX index at Frankfurt Stock Exchange jumped 1.82 percent, while French benchmark index CAC 40 gained 0.99 percent. In Asia, Tokyo shares leapt Wednesday, with the Nikkei index rebounding to above the 19,000 level, on renewed optimism about U.S. President Donald Trump's economic stimulus policies. Investors believed that Trump's new executive orders also boosted bullish sentiment on the Wall Street. "When they see President Oks the pipelines and a variety of other things, there is the assumption that he is step by step going to review every one of his campaign promises," Legendary New York Stock Exchange floor trader Arthur Cashin said Wednesday. That means you get more assured to or certainly a great deal more likelihood that you will get tax reforms and that you will get deregulation and that you will get the other things he spoke of because he's going down the list and trying to put them all together, he added. Most analysts attributed Wednesday's increases to a continuous "Trump Rally". U.S. stocks posted solid gains after Trump won the presidency election On Nov. 8, with the Dow going up over 9 percent till Wednesday, as investors bet that he would pursue massive corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and infrastructure spending. "Dow passing 20,000 Points represents part of the very strong optimism that the market is taking on that the new administration will be able to successfully pursue its policies of tax reform and regulatory relief for the corporations," Humberto Garcia, Head of Global Asset Allocation for Bank Leumi and Chairman of Leumi Investment Services' Investment Committee, told Xinhua. However, facing uncertainties both from the new administration and the U.S. Federal Reserve, analysts became cautious on the outlook of the U.S. equities. "The market is somewhat getting ahead of itself. It is now on a price to earnings basis higher than any time since the dot come bubble. And I' m not sure that it is completely justified being at those levels," said Garcia. There are some countervailing forces to the tax reforms and regulatory relief, and these are in part due to potential trade retaliation from other countries, and also due to potential that U.S. exports are hurt by a strong U.S. dollar, he added. The Fed is also in focus. "The next thing we' ll be looking for is we are going to go into the quiet period for the FOMC. They have got a meeting coming up, and we'll see how aggressive they are in the statement and that will get everybody' s attention," Cashin said. "I believed that the Fed will at least try to stick to its announced or planned slow rate hikes. My concern is that we might return to the pattern of 2004 when there was rapid rate hikes," Garcia said.

Featured Story Brexit dampens predictions of Irish growth DUBLIN, Ireland - The Central Bank has cut down the growth forecast for this year despite the country showing resilience to Brexit. This is due to the fact that risks lie ahead as hard Brexit deal looms large.  Moreover, Irish-owned manufacturing industries had witnessed a slackening of demand even before the sharp slump in the Sterling. According to the Central Bank, it has received 100 inquiries from U.K.-based banks and investment funds that were considering relocation to somewhere else in the EU. It has been revealed that Barclays Bank had decided that Dublin will be its main hub inside the EU after Brexit.  The bank also plans on adding about 150 staff to its operations here, in case U.K.-based finance companies lose easy access to the EU market.  This however, could lead to a rise in house prices, as foreign employees seek homes in Ireland. Chief economist at the Central Bank has noted that an influx of foreign bank personnel could affect house prices because there is a shortage of supply.  Ireland would need more than 25,000 new homes a year to meet demand. The Chief Economist said that the outlook for the Irish economy was a “mixed bag” as more jobs and wage increases would raise domestic demands, despite risks from a hard Brexit deal. The bank cut its GDP forecast to 3.3 percent from 3.6 percent because of the effect of slower global growth on Irish exports.  The bank further predicts growth to slow to 3 percent in 2018. The chief economist noted that it was “implausible” for the Irish economy to fare worse than U.K. under a hard Brexit.  Meanwhile, Barclays is making its contingency plans so it can continue serving EU clients in the case that Theresa May fails to strike a deal preserving London’s access to EU’s markets. Barclays has hired staff for positions of senior managers, derivatives specialists, currency traders, compliance and human resources staff in Dublin. Additionally, Merrion Capital reported that it is more cautious of stocks overall because of the huge rally by stock markets after the election of Donald Trump.  According to the company, U.S. tax cuts could lead to a rise in earnings of U.S. companies, however, Trump’s ‘America First’ policy may lead to higher tariffs.

The airline will not install seat-back video screens on its new Boeing 737 Max aircraft when it takes delivery of the aircraft later this year. According to American Airlines, more than 90 percent of its passengers already bring a device or screen with them when they fly. "So it makes sense for American to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seatback monitors that will be obsolete within a few years," American Airlines said in a message to its employees. Instead, American Airlines will let customers with a phone, tablet or laptop to connect to its on-board Wi-Fi network and watch free movies and, television shows in its on-board library as well as watch free live television channels, all without buying an in-flight connection. Customers who want to pay to get online will be able to access the high speed, satellite-based Internet access that will be installed by the airline on the MAX and other aircraft. They will be able to stream Netflix, Amazon and other video-on-demand as well as text and surf the web. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said that it's free streaming library as well as satellite Internet connections will work from gate-to-gate. However, customers flying on the airline's international flights will continue to have seat-back screens. All the wide-body aircraft as well as some of the narrow-body aircraft used for specific flights will keep their seat-back screens. "We'll keep seatback monitors on Boeing 777s, 787s, Airbus A330s, and our A350s, which begin arriving next year. We're also committed to seat-back screens on our three-class A321s," American Airlines said. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories Trump Signs Order Instituting "Extreme Vetting" Of Immigrants Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary Abercrombie & Fitch Issues 150 Pink Slips Trump Discusses Mexico, Russia, Brexit In News Conference With May Trump To Speak With Putin By Phone On Saturday Feds Claim Breathometer Made False Claims About Accuracy Trump Expresses Support For "Nuclear Option" Over Supreme Court Nominee Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Report: Wet Seal Will Go Extinct Trump Accuses Mexico Of Taking Advantage Of U.S. Study Shows How Jet Lag Affects Baseball Teams McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants U.S. Consumer Sentiment Reaches Thirteen-Year High In January Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico <<Previous        81 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS American Airlines Board Approves $2.0 Bln Share Buyback - Quick Facts American Airlines Group Inc Earnings Drop 63% In Q4 American Airlines Q4 16 Earnings Conference Call At 8:30 AM ET American Airlines Group Q4 16 Earnings Conference Call At 8:30 AM ET American Airlines Introduces Basic Economy Fare Trade AAL now with  Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

After weeks of unease across trading floors, investors around the world have refound the optimism that fuelled a surge in the two months after Donald Trump was elected president. The latest lease of life comes after the tycoon signed a series of executive orders pushing his pro-growth agenda, including giving the green light to two huge, controversial oil pipeline deals through the United States. There are hopes he will press on with other promises to ramp up infrastructure spending, cut taxes and do away with various regulations he considers a hindrance to businesses. Added to this were a series of upbeat earnings reports from big-name firms including Boeing and United Technologies. In New York the Dow ended above 20,000 for the first time in its history, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also closed at all-time highs as investors shift back to higher-yielding investments and away from safe bets such as bonds. Asian dealers tracked their counterparts on Thursday, with Tokyo ending 1.8 per cent higher. Hong Kong added 1.3 per cent in the afternoon and Shanghai gained 0.3 per cent on the last day before a week-long Lunar New Year break. China shares rose for the fifth straight day on Thursday, with blue chips closing at fresh six-week highs, but gains were curbed after profits earned by industrial firms grew at a sharply slower pace last month. Market turnover stayed thin on the last trading day before the Lunar New Year, China’s biggest holiday. Markets will be closed from Jan. 27 to Feb. 2. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.4 per cent, to 3,387.96 points at the close, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.3 per cent, to 3,159.17 points. For the week, the CSI rose 1 per cent and the SSEC 1.2 per cent. For the month, the CSI rose 2.4 per cent and the SSEC 1.8 per cent. The market’s bullish sentiment was countered by data showing profits earned by Chinese industrial firms in December grew more slowly at 2.3 per cent compared with November’s 14.5 per cent. Cao Xuefeng, head of research at Huaxi Securities in Chengdu, said the slower pace was partly due to seasonal factors as many workers had already left the factories for their home towns ahead of the new year. Sector performance was mixed in China. An index tracking the resource stocks were among the best performers, up 1.4 per cent at the close. Seoul jumped 0.8 per cent and Singapore 0.4 per cent, while Wellington, Manila and Jakarta also pushed upwards. Sydney was closed for a public holiday. “The US economy is doing well, corporate earnings are good and it looks like Mr Trump’s policies will keep improving the economy,” Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo, told Bloomberg News. “With bond yields increasing, we’re seeing gradual moves from bonds to risk assets.” The dollar recovered from recent losses against its major peers although it is struggling to break out of tight band as investors mull comments from Trump and his nominee for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that the unit is too strong and could hurt the US economy. “We may have underestimated… investor sentiment towards Mnuchin and Trump’s comments on the dollar,” said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA, in a note. The US unit’s general weakness also saw it tumble more than two per cent against the Mexican peso despite news Trump had ordered work to begin on planning and building a wall along the US-Mexico border. The dollar bought a little more than 21 pesos on Thursday, well down from the record levels above 22 pesos touched earlier this month. — AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Oil prices rise on weakening dollar, but plentiful supplies cap gains Unilever posts 5.5pc increase in profit → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Identity faces challenges Impact from influx of foreign workers World edges closer to doomsday A rendezvous of families Aleppo traders clear debris from war-scarred souq Read More ...

The Dow Jones industrial average reached new highs on Thursday, closing at 20,100 — which, coincidentally, also happens to be a round number. But it still has a mere 899 points remaining before touching its next big milestone. The clock is ticking, as it only took the Dow 64 calendar days to make the 1,000-point jump between 19,000 and 20,000. Meanwhile, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq turned slightly negative on Thursday, with each ending the day down roughly one point from Wednesday’s record-breaking highs. DuPont was the biggest driver for the Dow, ending the day up 1.7 percent, to $77.98. DuPont shares were helped after Dow Chemical Chief Executive Andrew Liveris expressed confidence that the proposed $130 billion merger between the two companies would clear European Union hurdles and close by the end of the first half of 2017. Boeing continued its three-day rally into Thursday, gaining 1 percent and reaching a new all-time high of $169.15. The airplane manufacturer released its fourth-quarter earnings results Wednesday and announced plans to deliver between 760 and 765 planes in 2017, up from 748 in 2016. Tech giant Microsoft was also a strong performer during Thursday’s trading, closing the day up 1 percent, to $64.27. Not all Dow components ended the day in the green. Verizon shares gave up 1.3 percent Thursday, making it the weakest stock in the Dow. Shares fell to $49.12 as the wireless company reportedly considers a merger with Charter Communications. Caterpillar also gave up some of Wednesday’s gains after cutting its 2017 outlook. It ended the day down nearly 1 percent, at $97.22. Although shares of Caterpillar have jumped nearly 15 percent since the presidential election on hopes of increased infrastructure spending, the company said it does not expect to realize any “meaningful effects” until 2018. The company said it expects 2017 sales and revenues to fall between $36 billion to $39 billion, down $500 million from the midpoint of its previous guidance. Shares of the heavy-equipment maker have been hit in recent years by a slowdown in construction and weak commodity prices.

MST January 26, 2017 NASA announced a new suit Jan. 25, 2016, made by Boeing for the Starliner spacecraft. (Photo: NASA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST NASA KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. - Boeing unveiled its new Starliner spacesuit designed to be lighter and more comfortable for astronauts Wednesday. The new suit includes advances to the design such as new joint patterns for more movement, touchscreen-sensitive gloves, and a helmet and visor incorporated into the suit instead of detaching, according to a NASA news release. Steven Siceloff of NASA states the suit’s material allows water vapor to pass out of the suit while keeping the air inside to make it cooler for the astronauts. The full suit weighs about 20 pounds with all its accessories -- approximately 10 pounds lighter than the suits worn by space shuttle astronauts. Astronauts have conducted multiple tests in the suits in spacecraft mock-up, making sure they can still work inside the confines in the suit safely. According to Siceloff,  these cutting-edge innovations arrive as Boeing moves forward with flight tests of its Starliner spacecraft and launch systems, flying astronauts to the International Space Station. Flight tests with astronauts aboard are expected to begin in 2018.

Michael Hiltzik Columnist BUSINESS Michael Hiltzik Column Trump's plan to tax Mexican imports will create a whole new set of winners and losers, including consumers Donald Trump Matt Rourke / Associated Press President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan engage in a not-too-awkward greeting at Thursday's Republican retreat in Philadelphia. President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan engage in a not-too-awkward greeting at Thursday's Republican retreat in Philadelphia. (Matt Rourke / Associated Press) Michael HiltzikContact Reporter President Trump threw trade experts for another loop Thursday by endorsing — or seeming to endorse — a new tax system for imports and exports that he said would “reduce our trade deficits (and) increase American exports.” Not so incidentally, he also said it “will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall.”  The tax would help pay for the wall he intends to build on the Mexican border to keep illegal immigrants out, which is estimated to cost as much as $14 billion.  He appeared to be buying into a proposal by House Republicans for a “border adjustment tax,” though his spokesman later said it was one of several options being considered. Under that plan, exports from the United States would be tax-exempt, but imports would be taxed at the border. This would tend to discourage imports by making them more expensive for American buyers, and make American goods cheaper to sell overseas, with a goal of whittling away at the nation’s annual trade deficit of more than $330 billion. [The border adjustment tax] will be seen by other countries and the World Trade Organization as a protectionist act that violates U.S. treaty obligations. — Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers Trump spokesman Sean Spicer talked about a 20% import levy on Mexico, but he may have been referring to the House Republicans’ goal to cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20%. That would be the residual tax rate on imports, as well as to domestic goods sold in the U.S. Only U.S.-made goods exported abroad would be exempt. And that’s not the only element of the plan that’s unclear. Here are some questions and answers about Trump’s plan specifically and the border adjustment tax in general. How does the border adjustment tax work? In simplest terms, the House proposal would change the basis of the corporate tax from where a company is located or where its goods are produced to where its products are used.   In other words, a gadget produced in the U.S. and exported to, say, the Netherlands would be tax-exempt. But a smartphone produced in China, whether by Apple or China’s Xiaomi, would be taxed when it’s imported into the U.S. Will President Trump run roughshod over business expectations in 2017? Michael Hiltzik Business and the investment markets, it is often said, hate uncertainty. If that’s true, they’re going to absolutely abhor 2017. Almost every new presidential administration that comes into office holds some of its plans and policies close to the vest, generally to maintain some flexibility of... Business and the investment markets, it is often said, hate uncertainty. If that’s true, they’re going to absolutely abhor 2017. Almost every new presidential administration that comes into office holds some of its plans and policies close to the vest, generally to maintain some flexibility of... (Michael Hiltzik) How does this change business behavior? Theoretically, it removes the incentive of American companies to relocate their tax homes overseas, the controversial process known as inversion. The location of the company or its factory wouldn’t matter, just the place it’s selling its goods. “Tax considerations thus would not influence business decisions as much as they do today,” observed tax expert Edward Kleinbard of USC in a recent op-ed in The Times. The change, he added, “would largely eradicate the ‘stateless income’ tax planning games through which U.S. multinationals carry on their books more than $2.5 trillion in very-low-taxed offshore earnings, at the expense of the United States and other countries where those firms are actually doing business.” Who would be the business winners and losers from a border adjustment tax? In general the big winners would be export-oriented U.S. companies. Think Boeing, which exports most of its aircraft overseas, and therefore might be in a better position to compete with foreign plane manufacturers such as Airbus. Retailers, oil companies, automobile manufacturers and consumer goods manufacturers would be losers. They’re all dependent on imports. Department stores sell garments and furniture made overseas, which is why Wal-Mart is prominent among the opponents. Although the U.S. is no longer a net importer of oil, it’s still a major importer. Auto companies build their cars with foreign-sourced parts. Consumer gadgets sold in the U.S., such as computers and smartphones, are made in foreign factories, which would render them taxable at the border Forget the squalling baby; Trump's comments about China on Tuesday were the worse tantrum Michael Hiltzik The big news takeaway from Donald Trump’s rally Tuesday in Ashburn, Va., was that he got irritated by a crying baby and ordered the tot and its mother out of the hall. This was sadly typical of the tendency of the Trump campaign press — and let’s face it, the rest of us — to be distracted by the... The big news takeaway from Donald Trump’s rally Tuesday in Ashburn, Va., was that he got irritated by a crying baby and ordered the tot and its mother out of the hall. This was sadly typical of the tendency of the Trump campaign press — and let’s face it, the rest of us — to be distracted by the... (Michael Hiltzik) How would consumers fare? It’s likely they’ll pay more at the gas pump, more for autos and more for items such as clothing, which are mostly made from imported material and by foreign labor.  Some advocates of the border adjustment tax say that consumers may not pay a noticeable increase. Their theory is that the change would raise the value of the U.S. dollar, which would reduce the cost of imported goods in dollar terms.  Kleinbard isn’t so sure. If the dollar rises, he wrote, “Wal-Mart shoppers will pay the same prices after the ‘border adjustable’ tax as they do today, and exporters will export the same amount of goods and services.” But that assumes that currency rates follow the economic textbooks. If they don’t, the consequences could be dire. “The tax’s burden will fall on consumers through higher prices, rather than on corporate profits,” he wrote. (He adds that if the dollar does rise, U.S. investors holding foreign assets could get hammered. They could “lose trillions of dollars in wealth, because their investments suddenly will be worth less in dollar terms. By voting for this radical reform, politicians may be putting their careers into the hands of the currency markets.”) Would this be good for the U.S. Treasury? Proponents say yes, because imports, which would be taxable, currently exceed exports, which would be tax-exempt. By some reckoning, the gain would be $1.2 trillion over 10 years.  How do liberals and conservatives see this change? Surprisingly, economic thinkers are more in agreement with each other than one might expect. Economists at both ends of the economic spectrum have argued that border adjustment, in principle, might work to the advantage of both shareholders and workers.  The corporate tax is typically seen as a burden on capital — that is, shareholders — so conservatives think that reducing it will be good for the free market. But America’s current tax structure encourages companies to invest in lower-tax countries, which shifts “at least some of the corporate tax burden to domestic U.S. labor,” economist Alan J. Auerbach of UC Berkeley wrote for the liberal Center for American Progress in 2010. The change in tax structure, he argued, could relieve downward pressure on wages and salaries. Does this make Mexico a target of trade policy? Mexico would be a target of this policy only to the extent that it’s a net exporter to the U.S. But that’s a category that includes most of America’s trade partners, not just Mexico.  Mexico’s $59-billion trade surplus with the U.S. — the amount by which its America-bound export exceed its imports — ranked fourth in 2016, after China ($319 billion), Japan ($63 billion) and Germany ($60 billion). Even among trading partners that import more from America than they export, the mismatch is much smaller: The biggest trade deficits among American trading partners were those of Hong Kong ($25 billion) and the Netherlands ($22 billion). Is this even legal? Considerable debate exists about how the House proposal conforms to international trade law. A unilateral attack on the Mexican trade deficit would surely violate NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump says he want to renegotiate. Some trade experts say there are other legal obstacles. “It appears unlikely that such border adjustments would be permissible under current international trade law,” says the Tax Policy Center, citing World Trade Organization Law. Kleinbard observed that conflicts between the new policy and WTO law would “defy any simple fix” and present “a recipe for years of dispute, business uncertainty and potential retaliatory tariffs.” In other words, it’s not a change to be made hastily. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers shares those doubts. Writing in the Financial Times on Jan. 8, he predicted that the change in tax structure “will be seen by other countries and the World Trade Organization as a protectionist act that violates U.S. treaty obligations. Proponents may argue that it should be legal because it is like a value added tax, but the WTO is very clear that income taxes cannot discriminate to favor exports.” While the WTO ponders the legalities, he wrote, “protectionist acts by other nations would be licensed immediately.” How would this pay for Trump’s wall? That’s the $14-billion question. The answer is that it wouldn’t, directly. Trump could say that he’s diverting the money for the wall out of the general gains from the import charges. But House tax-writers have acknowledged that their corporate tax changes will have to be revenue-neutral — that is, the revenue gains would have to be used dollar-for-dollar to pay for corporate tax cuts. Otherwise the change could be vulnerable to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.

Slated for use by the Israeli Air Force, the system was originally tested in 2015 and was designed to neutralize projectiles with a range of 60-125 miles, such as those used by Hezbollah, a militant Shi'a group backed by Iran. After testing, the Jewish News Services quoted US Missile Defense Agency director Vice Admiral Jim Syring saying, "This test campaign is a critical step in ensuring Israel has the capability to defend itself from a very real and growing threat," adding that Washington remains "strongly committed to supporting Israel's development of a missile defense system." US arms-maker Raytheon and Israel's state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems is developing the not-yet-operational system, to fill a gap between the US-funded Arrow ballistic-missile interceptor and the Iron Dome short-range rocket interceptor program, both of which are currently in service. Developed by Boeing and state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, the Iron Dome interceptor network was used with much success against Hamas in the 2014 Gaza War. Moshe Patel of Israel's Missile Defense Organization said that Wednesday's testing included intercepting an air-launched test missile, and noted that "The tests were intended to simulate anticipated future threats and in the coming years our system will deliver to the Israeli air force more capabilities and more confidence." According to the Jerusalem Post, the testing occurred under a media blackout, with the Defense Ministry stating, "The success of the test is part of the development on the future threat deterrence system…During the series of tests, after incoming missile detection, the MMR (multi-missile radar) located the targets and transferred the data to the central firing program, which calculated interception protocols." © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.
