By Mary-Ann Russon October 21, 2016 18:23 BST The US Air Force wants to reuse its old F-16 fighter jets as drones for testing weapons and simulating enemy attacksUS Air Force/Sara Vidoni Aerospace company Boeing is helping the US Air Force reuse old F-16 fighter jets by converting them into drones that simulate enemy aircraft, as well as enabling new tactics, weapons and technologies to be tested in mid-air. The US Air Force decided that it wanted to turn its old fighter jets into unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in 2010, when it awarded Boeing $72m ($59m) to take six F-16 aircraft and turn them into QF-16s, which are full-scare unmanned aerial targets that can be used to simulate enemy actors trying to attack the US. "It's a full scale aerial target, you can imagine the adversaries that our Air Force flies against around the rest of the world, this aircraft is designed to be a threat representative for those adversaries," Tim Bartlett, director of off-Boeing platforms for Boeing Defense, told Avionics Magazine. "It is comparative to what our pilots will fly against, the [Air Force] uses them for two main missions. The first is to qualify and test their munitions and armaments. The second mission is being around threat representatives gives our pilots a better sense of what they're flying against in an adversary and from a training perspective as well." It takes five months to convert an F-16 into a UAV and eventually the US Air Force wants all the F-16s to become dronesUS Air Force/Sara Vidoni Six years later and the US Air Force has declared that the new QF-16s are operationally capable, but how exactly do you turn a manned military aircraft into a drone? "We add a flight control computer to enhance data processing within, which is a vital component to enable the unmanned capabilities," said Bartlett. "What we are doing is inserting hardware that is ultimately designed to replace the pilots. A new autopilot helps with that as well, and there's also some telemetry technology added that helps tell you where the aircraft is within the world, and the speed as well." The process takes five months and requires multiple components of the plane to be removed and 3,000 new wires to be installed, as well as a Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS) with a data link range of 120 nautical miles to enable mission control to stay in command of the UAV at all times. Boeing is contracted to convert another further 97 F-16 fighter jets into drones, and eventually the US Air Force wants all 210 aircraft to become UAVs. It is currently considering whether the QF-16s can be sold to foreign partners who want to test weapons and simulate enemy attacks as well.

Yesterday a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Boeing 757 flew 81 scientific and support personnel and about three tonnes of baggage and equipment that are needed to support the New Zealand and United States Antarctic research programmes. It was the NZDF’s first strategic airlift support flight to the continent for the 2016-17 summer season. Lieutenant Commander Ross Hickey, the NZDF’s Senior National Officer on the continent, said two more RNZAF Boeing flights are scheduled before the end of October to take another 100 people to Scott Base and McMurdo Station. Further flights will be made from late November by the C-130 Hercules, the workhorses of the RNZAF. “For the past 51 years the NZDF has been contributing to the lifeline of support for New Zealand and American scientists working in Antarctica,” Major General Tim Gall, the Commander Joint Forces New Zealand, said. “Every year, our aircraft support the Antarctic research programmes by bringing about 330 scientists and other personnel and almost 40 tonnes of equipment needed to carry out vital research on the continent,” MAJGEN Gall said. Antarctica New Zealand Chief Executive Peter Beggs said the significant contribution of the NZDF demonstrated the collaborative nature of Antarctic research and logistics. “NZDF support is an integral part of New Zealand’s strategic leadership both on the Antarctic continent and in the Southern Ocean and we are grateful for the level of professionalism under which these personnel operate,” Mr Beggs said. The NZDF also provides search and rescue support, air transport, terminal operations at Harewood Terminal in Christchurch and McMurdo, and support for the unloading of the annual container ship. Up to 220 NZDF staff – including air crew and ground support, passenger and cargo facilitation, logistics, fuel specialists, Army engineers and heavy plant operators, cargo handlers and communications specialists – are deployed during the summer to support the Scott Base and McMurdo stations. The 2016-17 research season marks the 60th anniversary of New Zealand’s operational presence in Antarctica and the construction of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition Hut.

Credit Suisse gave clients a list of stocks that are likely to perform best on an election victory by Hillary Clinton. With the presidential vote less than a month away, the probability that Clinton will win has significantly increased, said the firm's chief U.S. equity strategist, Lori Calvasina, citing the latest poll numbers. "Near term, the increased chance of a Clinton victory seems good for stocks with high international exposure and industrials," she said, explaining that both sectors have closely traded in tandem with the direction of Clinton's polling numbers.

The service marks the first U.S. nonstop destination for Xiamen. Today’s announcement marks Sea-Tac Airport’s 15th new international destination in the past 10 years. Today’s celebration included a ribbon cutting and toast to the airline, which features 787-8 service to Sea-Tac Airport. Xiamen has a special connection to the Pacific Northwest since it flies an all-Boeing fleet.  The new service increases the strong business and community ties between Seattle and Shenzhen, one of China’s largest cities. “Sea-Tac Airport is one of the most connected gateways to Asia and it is an honor that Xiamen chose Seattle to launch its U.S. service,” said Port of Seattle Commissioner Fred Felleman. “Shenzhen is known as the ‘Silicon Valley’ of China and this new destination will be a tremendous opportunity for both business and leisure travelers to experience our shared values. We commend Xiamen for using the state-of-the-art Boeing 787, which furthers the Port of Seattle’s goals of being the greenest and most energy efficient port while advancing our region as a business and tourism hub.” The service begins in the city of Xiamen (headquarters to Xiamen Airlines), then shuttle to Shenzhen before making the nonstop flight to Seattle. Xiamen operates the largest all-Boeing fleet in China and will serve the route three times per week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) with 787-8 aircraft. "The launch of the Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is an important reflection of the results of the meeting between Chinese and American leaders,” said Xiamen Airlines chairman and general manager Che Shanglun. “On the heels of these events, a Fuzhou-New York and a Xiamen-LA service will also be initiated, making air travel, and, by consequence, exchanges between the two countries much easier." Sea-Tac Airport has been the fastest growing large hub airport in the U.S. for the past two years. In 2015, passenger traffic set a record for the fifth straight year with over 42.3 million travelers. Through the third quarter of 2016, passenger totals are up nine percent. Earlier this year Sea-Tac Airport welcomed new international service from Volaris Airlines to Guadalajara, Mexico and Condor Airlines announced new service to Munich, Germany starting in 2017. Flight details for Seattle-Xiamen-Shenzhen service (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays): Flight MF845 departs XMN at 9:30a.m. and arrives to SZX at 10:45a.m.; leaves SZX at 12:45p.m. and arrives to SEA at 10:25 a.m. Flight MF546 departs SEA at 1:25p.m. and arrives to SZX 6:15p.m. (next day); leaves SZX ar 8:15p.m. and arrives to XMN 9:25 p.m. About Xiamen Airlines Founded in July 1984, Xiamen Airlines is a unique and premium airline in China.

Service to British Airways’ hub at London Heathrow will begin March 27. The airline will offer four flights a week on its 214-seat Boeing 787-8 “Dreamliner” aircraft. British Airways says New Orleans customers will be able to connect via Heathrow to 130 other cities “throughout Europe and beyond.” BOOKMARK: Bookmark Today in the Sky homepage for your daily fix of aviation news USA TODAY British Airways hints at expanding to US Airways strongholds “We are delighted to be adding New Orleans to the British Airways global network,” Simon Brooks, senior vice president sales for British Airways, said in a statement. Brooks added that BA expects New Orleans to be “a big hit with British visitors,” but said the airline is hoping for corporate traffic as well. For New Orleans, the trans-Atlantic route is a welcome addition. The current flight schedule is primarily domestic, though there are three routes to Central America and the Caribbean. (Panama City; Cancun, Mexico; and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic). New Orleans last regular nonstop link to Europe was back in 1982, according to The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. Until this year, new routes across the Atlantic had been slow to materialize for New Orleans. German leisure carrier Condor Airlines announced this summer it would add seasonal service between New Orleans and Frankfurt, giving New Orleans its long-desired connection to Europe. TWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky USA TODAY List: The world's 10 busiest airports (2015) Technically, British Airways’ London service will be the only nonstop option to Europe when it launches in March. The Condor service isn’t scheduled to begin until May. But bringing a full-service airline like British Airways is more likely resonate with travelers than the lesser-known Condor. Regardless, New Orleans officials lauded the arrival of the new London service. “For years, we have pursued bringing more direct international flights to Armstrong Airport and with the addition of British Airways it’s clear our hard work is paying off,” New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in BA’s statement. “Nonstop flights to London open a gateway to new international markets that will create jobs and new opportunity.  In advance of our city’s tricentennial in 2018 and the opening of new North Terminal project, New Orleans is poised for big things as we welcome more travelers from around the world to our world-class city.” British Airways also flew to New Orleans previously, but not since the early 1980s. The flight was part of one-stop service that continued on to Mexico, British Airways told Today in the Sky. Also of note in Thursday's New Orleans announcement from British Airways is its plan to use the Dreamliner on the route. USA TODAY Boeing Dreamliner puts Austin on the global travel map The carrier has previously used the aircraft to develop "thin" routes to smaller markets that otherwise might not have enough demand to fill a trans-Atlantic widebody jet. The 787 has a long range, but a smaller seating capacity than long-haul widebodies like Boeing's 777 or Airbus' A330. In fact, Boeing's Dreamliners have helped it open up new markets before in the United States. In March 2014, BA used its Dreamliner to open up nonstop service to Austin -- then one of the smallest U.S. markets to get a nonstop connection to Europe. The smaller size of the jet essentially allowed BA to test the market with a smaller aircraft, minimizing its exposure if demand didn't materialize as expected. In Austin's case, the service was a hit and British Airways eventually began flying bigger 777s to the city.

Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced Tuesday the department would conduct a rule-making to “explore” a requirement for all-in-one pricing that includes fees for baggage, seat assignment, change and cancellation of tickets. The goal would be to reduce piecemeal pricing for ancillary fees, which the industry calls unbundling, because it frustrates travelers by making it tougher to compare fares. BOOKMARK: Bookmark Today in the Sky homepage for your daily fix of aviation news USA TODAY Delta unveils new uniforms for 60,000 frontline workers But the department already collected more than 750 comments for a rule-making posted in May 2014 governing ancillary fees. “This will be a step backwards from two earlier rule-makings,” said Charlie Leocha, president of Travelers United, a consumer advocacy group. “If DOT is planning on starting from scratch, it will be an enormous retreat from overall airline pricing transparency.” Airlines contend that Congress deregulated the industry in 1978 and the department should allow competition without dictating how to market fares. For example, Southwest Airlines promotes its lack of bag fees, but other airlines charge a variety of fees depending on loyalty and other factors. “Airlines have different business models and must be allowed to continue offering optional services in a manner that makes sense for both their customers and their business,” said Nicholas Calio, CEO of Airlines for America, a trade group that represents most of the large carriers.

In the 2014 rulemaking, travelers said the growth of fees and proliferation of choices has made buying tickets too difficult. For example, last year airlines collected $3.8 billion in bag fees and $3 billion in change and cancellation fees. “The airlines are difficult enough to navigate with the different boarding, seating, baggage, meals, by nickel-and-diming of the consumers, it will be almost impossible to find a flight and compare the final price,” said Joan Horn of Walkersville, Md. “Displaying all fees as part of the ticket price levels the playing field and makes it much easier for consumers to compare apples to apples,” said Matthew Kirkland of Watkinsville, Ga. In addition, the department was studying in 2014 whether to force airlines to charge the fees at the same time as the airfare, under a policy called “transactability.” The U.S. Travel Association said nearly half (45%) of the 1,031 travelers surveyed found it difficult to budget for travel because of fees and that one-fourth faced a fee at the airport they didn’t anticipate. But airlines argued in the previous rule-making that they distinguish themselves in part by how they market and sell additional services.

Delta Air Lines said travelers “highly value speed and efficiency in the reservations process” and tend to abandon searches after 430 seconds. Making searches more complicated could dampen sales, the carrier said. American Airlines cited department cost estimates that the fee provision would cost airlines $46 million over a decade and yield benefits of $25 million. “The costs at issue are quite real” and “will inevitably be passed along to consumers in this intensely competitive industry,” the carrier said.

2016, 07:30 ET Share this article ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/-- Jeppesen, a Boeing Company, has worked closely with the pilot community and leading experts to enhance its SID (standard instrument departure) and STAR (standard terminal arrival route) charts to increase situational awareness and reduce 'head-down' time while referencing chart information. "Over the past two years, we have teamed with pilots and experts in human factors to create a new industry standard with Jeppesen SID/STAR chart design and interaction," said Mike Abbott, director, Jeppesen Data Solutions Product & Portfolio Management. "This significant change to our charts make them easier to read, reduces the likelihood of violating altitude and speed restrictions and improves the user experience with both mobile and installed electronic flight bag (EFB) platforms." The new worldwide IFR (instrument flight rules) charts will be introduced over time, starting this December for airports in Europe and the U.S. The chart enhancements are designed to help pilots increase safety in flight and raise awareness of both physical obstacles and dangers and the regulatory environment for each procedure. Specifically, key enhancements made to Jeppesen IFR arrival and departure charts include the addition of terrain, distinctive use of color to identify important features at a glance and true to scale depiction of chart elements. The new chart design features blue coding of altitude and magenta coloring of speed restriction details, to simplify recognition of essential arrival and departure elements.  Overall, 10 enhancements will be included in the new Jeppesen charts, including the addition of MSAs (minimum sector altitudes) within the plan view of the chart to provide a minimum clearance of objects near the airport and grid MORAs (minimum off route altitudes), providing obstacle clearance altitude within a certain longitude and latitude grid on the chart. Jeppesen charts are derived from a comprehensive aviation database that contains more than one million records, and employs multiple stages to assure quality. Jeppesen continually takes in "source" data collected from the world's more than 220 Air Navigation Service Providers and refines and synthesizes the widely varying forms of critical data into a singular chart format. Jeppesen flight information analysts edit and verify thousands of database transactions during each International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 28-day revision cycle.

Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Home News Mugabe scouts for new planes News Politics Popular Mugabe scouts for new planes Oct 20, 2016 29 6388 By Shame Makoshori The country’s beleaguered airline, Air Zimbabwe (AirZim), is scouting for modern passenger aircraft and has initiated negotiations for the lease of Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes from a Malaysian airline, the Financial Gazette has learnt. President Robert Mugabe (Picture by (TSVANGIRAYI MUKWAZHI/AP) The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an American long-haul, mid-size wide body, twin-engine jet airliner manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The current search, which comes hard on the heels of top-level appointments at the national airline, will include a determination of lucrative routes to ensure the viability of any new plane acquisitions. But there were indications the airline would avoid European capitals due to outstanding aviation debts that once resulted in the seizure of an AirZim plane in London, forcing the parastatal to terminate flights to the country’s former colonial master, Britain. President Robert Mugabe visited Malaysia, the south-east Asian country, a fortnight ago and was accompanied by the Minister of Transport, Communication and Infrastructure Development, Joram Gumbo, ministry officials, a team of aviation experts and AirZim’s top management. Gumbo confirmed this week that he had accompanied President Mugabe to Malaysia to explore aviation opportunities. He told the Financial Gazette that government, which wholly owns the national flag carrier, was looking for long haul planes. The airline has already started talks with “technical partners”, whom Gumbo declined to name, although he disclosed that they were currently exploring routes to determine those that were likely to be lucrative to fly the new planes. “After the discussions that we are having with technical partners, we will have long haul planes. It does not help us to receive planes and keep them at the Harare International Airport without routes. I am trying to scout for routes for Air Zimbabwe. That is why I went to Malaysia. I went to see Air Malaysia to see how they operate. I will also be visiting China and Singapore to see if Air Zimbabwe can connect through these routes to China. I also want to go to Nigeria to see if we can have direct flights to West Africa,” said Gumbo. The frantic efforts to secure new planes and routes come a month after the airline appointed Ripton Muzenda, son of the late vice president Simon Muzenda, as chief executive officer (CEO), while President Mugabe’s son-in-law, Simbarashe Chikore, was appointed chief operating officer. The two are understood to have been asked to turnaround the loss-making airline and are reportedly at the centre of ongoing moves to secure planes. AirZim, which has gone through turbulent times since dollarisation in 2009, is struggling to match competition from established airlines due to the old aircraft within its fleet. Passenger numbers have plummeted to about 230 000 per annum in the past few years, from a peak of one million in 1996, as travellers opt for other airlines on the four domestic destinations it services. The airline, currently flying into South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania, has been planning to re-launch the cash-spinning Harare-London flights, but airline executives have warned that without modern jetliners, it would be a waste of time because it would most certainly face passenger resistance. AirZim’s aged fleet comprises two Boeing 767s, three 737s, three MA60s and two Airbus A320s. Out of these planes, only four are flying – one airbus, one Boeing 767, one 737 and an MA60. Airline executives have been pushing for the acquisition or lease of a Dreamliner for its long haul flights, whose network will include China, Malaysia, and possibly Singapore. The airline came close to liquidation when it stopped flights in 2011 before its sole shareholder took the decision to resume operation in November 2012. Last month, Gumbo held informal discussions with Ethiopian Airways (ET) executives in Addis Ababa with the hope of entering into a technical partnership. At the ET discussions, Gumbo travelled with most of his senior officials including permanent secretary, Munesu Munodawafa, director of legal affairs, Angela Karonga, his personal assistant, an official from the Ministry of Finance, Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe general manager, David Chaota, AirZim deputy chairman, Pathias Chironga and Muzenda. The Zimbabwean delegation was, however, said to have been unhappy after a low level team led by the ET CEO was assigned to talk to them. In terms of protocol, Gumbo was supposed to meet a ministerial team. Government officials aware of the talks said after some of ET’s proposals turned out to be unfavourable, authorities were no longer keen to pursue the deal. “They (ET) had their conditions,” Gumbo told the Financial Gazette. “Some of them may have been favourable, some of them were not. I am yet to discuss with them officially because I have not been given the authority. There is a vetting process that is going on,” the Minister added. Sources, however, said the unfavourable conditions in Ethiopia may have caused the President to shift to Asia. “The objective was to look at some of the available aircraft, but it would appear they were snubbed in Ethiopia. It was clear that our team was desperate to clinch the deal and the Ethiopians may have wanted to take advantage. “In my own opinion President Mugabe is too proud to play second fiddle to another African nation. “Hence the option being considered now for which a team travelled to Malaysia,” said the well-placed government source. “AirZim needs a Dreamliner. It is cheaper to operate and technologically advanced. Both Kenya Airways and Ethiopian Airways are already operating the equipment. We need it for London for us to be able to compete with the likes of Emirates. Regionally and domestically, we need an aircraft like Embraer (70-100) or Bombardier,” the official said. The 60-seater Embraer, manufactured in Brazil, was briefly operated by AirZim on domestic and regional flights under a lease agreement three years ago. The Financial Gazette understands that during the recent trip to Malaysia, Gumbo and his team discussed several options with Malaysian government officials and the private sector to find how AirZim could be revived. This week, Muzenda said government would be in a better position to comment on the negotiations taking place. “If there are any discussions, they will be taking place at government level. (Government) will be in a better position to tell you. We are just working flat out to sort out the airline, that’s all,” said Muzenda. Government has not been keen to enter a deal in which it ends up relinquishing majority control in the national flag carrier. In 2013, British multi-millionaire, Nicholas van Hoogstraten, proposed a transaction which would have seen him availing an undisclosed sum to the flag carrier for aircraft acquisitions and repayment of debts in Europe. The move was meant to facilitate the re-launch of flights on the Harare-London route. The property magnate, a significant shareholder alongside government in Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed Hwange Colliery Company Limited and listed-hotel chain, Rainbow Tourism Group, had agreed to a proposal by the AirZim board, but had made several conditions, which the board turned down. If the board, and consequently government, had agreed to the deal with van Hoogstraten, the British tycoon would immediately have injected up to US$15 million in working capital for the resumption of the Harare-London flights. AirZim was expected to deploy the cash to settle an overdraft facility estimated at about US$2,5 million then and channel at least US$3 million towards unpaid landing debts in London. Van Hoogstraten had agreed to purchase two new Boeing 777 aircraft for the Harare-London flights and proposed that AirZim reconfigures the route to include Johannesburg. But the AirZim board, then led by Ozias Bvute, was supposed to agree to conditions proposed by van Hoogstraten, which included the formation of a new company in London, fully controlled by the British businessman that would manage the flights.  The transaction was turned down.

They’re no different from a soap manufacturing company seeking trade partnerships – I see now Gumbo is oblivious to this. His involvement in such low level technical meetings is indicative of systemic regressive thinking in his ministry and the airline itself. Send the right people for the job, there was no need for an entourage, something the Ethiopians are fully aware of thus sent only the relevant representation for this meeting.

blog About | Contact News Thinking on these things Business Feature Entertainment Sports Letters Search | Advanced search Home | News | NEW AIRPLANE TEST FLIGHT TODAY NEW AIRPLANE TEST FLIGHT TODAY 20/10/2016 04:00:00 BY SISHO MAGAGULA Font size: MBABANE – Swaziland’s new ‘bird’, the Boeing 737-300, will today have its first test flight. The airplane is expected to start servicing its route in the next three weeks. This is if what government’s wishes are anything to go by. The 149-seater aircraft, which is managed by Swazi Airways, arrived in the country last week Thursday via King Mswati III International Airport (KMIII) and was produced by American manufacturers, Boeing Commercial Airlines. It is currently parked at KMIII. In an interview yesterday, Minister of Public Works and Transport Lindiwe Dlamini said there will be a test flight of the aircraft to Cape Town. The test flight will be undertaken by a trained crew and will be leaving KMIII at 10am. She said government, together with Swazi Airways, are currently in the final stages of the certification of the aircraft before it can embark on its maiden flight. The certification process is being undertaken by the Swaziland Civil Aviation Authority (SWACAA) in line with regulations provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). In terms of international laws, the aircraft cannot take to the skies until it acquires what is known as the Air Operators Certificate (AOC). Minister Dlamini said the process of certification started long before the plane even arrived in the country and she was hopeful that it would be completed very soon.  “Once the certification process has been completed, the aircraft will commence its daily flight routine,” said the minister. However, independent observers seem not to agree with the minister. An informed expert who spoke to this newspaper yesterday said he was not convinced that the aircraft would undertake its maiden flight in the next three weeks as per the minister’s assertions.  He said certification of an aircraft was a long and complicated process. He said in his view, obtaining the Air Operators Certificate (AOC) for the new Swazi Airways plane would not be happening anytime soon. The civil aviation expert said there was still a lot that needed to be done before the certificate could be obtained. : del.icio.us | Digg Comments (0 posted): Post your comment Your name: Your e-mail address: Add your comments:  Please enter the code you see in the image: Image: Code: Most Popular Most E-mailed ‘I AND THOU’ IDS TO HAVE EXPIRY DATES GOVT STARTS PROCESS OF PAYING OWED SUPPLIERS SWAZIMED DIRECTORS CHALLENGE PETER SIMELANE’S APPOINTMENT NGWANE PARK HIGH PUPIL STABBED AT SCHOOL GATE ‘I AND THOU’ IDS TO HAVE EXPIRY DATES GOVT STARTS PROCESS OF PAYING OWED SUPPLIERS SWAZIMED DIRECTORS CHALLENGE PETER SIMELANE’S APPOINTMENT NGWANE PARK HIGH PUPIL STABBED AT SCHOOL GATE Most Commented Latest comments COLANI VILAKATI on 19/05/2016 07:25:09 GUYS TANKS FOR THE LATEST UPDATES ON OUR SOCCER LIFE.

He also served as a contracts manager for Boeing Defense & Space and as regional manager for a telecommunications company. But, the high-rolling lifestyle came to a crashing halt — quite literally — when David staged a small aircraft accident in an attempt to fraudulently obtain insurance money. David pleaded guilty and was sentenced to serve one year plus a day at Eglin Federal Prison Camp, a minimum-security facility near Pensacola, Florida. That certainly didn’t seem so bad. After all, Eglin is still to this day known among the corporate world as Club Fed, with a notorious reputation for being soft on the white-collar criminals who routinely request it as their prison of choice. Mr. Novak finished paying his debt to the US federal government years and since his release has authored a book based on the journals he kept during his prison experience: “Down Time — A Guide to Federal Prison Incarceration.” When you arrive at Eglin, your first view is a beautiful, wide-open space devoted to recreation — basketball courts and soccer and softball fields. It almost seems like being at a country club. There are old oak trees with Spanish moss. Aesthetically, it’s gorgeous. There are no fences, barbed wire or guard towers. And, it’s Florida! You work a 40-hour week in Eglin, but other than that you’re free to do anything else within reason. In fact, that’s one of the biggest challenges for most white-collar types — suddenly having more time than they know what to do with. There’s free access to newspapers and TV. Lots of inmates work out diligently and actually leave prison looking better than when they went in. But, with all the perks there is one constant reminder that Eglin is not just another southern resort. It’s a yellow line painted around the border of the compound, which every inmate has to stay behind. Of course, if you wanted, you could simply leave — they call it a “walk away.” But, the consequences are swift and severe. You will get caught and then will have to serve and additional 18 months or more in a higher security facility. That’s a pretty strong deterrent. Strange, isn’t it, how accustomed people can get to their prisons? Even David Novak says that there are times when he misses the from all responsibility, the recreational facilities and the huge blocks of time to read that he had in Eglin. But, ask him today, now that he has had a taste of real freedom, if he would be willing to go back. The answer? Absolutely not. Many people spend their lives hiding behind the lie that they free, when actually they are bound! One of the hardest things to do when you love someone is to watch them be bound in a prison that has no walls, but they can’t seem to find a way out. Trust God enough to make a way when there seems to be no way! In North Africa, trappers have a clever method of capturing monkeys. A gourd is filled with nuts and firmly fastened to a branch of a tree. It has a hole just large enough for the unwary monkey to stick his paw into it. When the hungry animal discovers the scent of food, he will quickly put his hand in the gourd and grasp a handful of nuts, but the hole is too small for him to withdraw his clenched fist. The monkey doesn’t have enough sense to open up his hand and let go in order to escape, so he is easily taken captive. He doesn’t realize that his “liberty” to make a choice has actually stolen his freedom! As much as you want to help the ones you love get out of their prison, we have to remember it starts with their choice. Sometimes life isn’t fair, but other times we need to let go of what is in our hand. We cannot allow our desires and feelings to keep us captive when God has something bigger for us. Let go and let God. Tony Bohrer More like this story Faith Column: Avoiding temptation, letting go of sins F.

But yes it is right we cannot let our desires and feelings to keep us captive. Let God.

They include air and ground crew, army engineers, cargo handlers and communications specialists. On Thursday, a Royal New Zealand Air Force Boeing 757 flew 81 scientific and support personnel and about three tonnes of baggage and equipment to support the New Zealand and US Antarctic research programmes at the Scott Base and McMurdo stations. It was the NZDF's first support flight to the continent for the 2016-17 summer season. Two more RNZAF Boeing flights are scheduled before the end of October, and from late November the C-130 Hercules, the workhorses of the RNZAF, swing into action. "Every year, our aircraft support the Antarctic research programmes by bringing about 330 scientists and other personnel and almost 40 tonnes of equipment needed to carry out vital research on the continent," says Major General Tim Gall, the Commander Joint Forces New Zealand. This season is the 60th of New Zealand's operations in Antarctica and the NZDF has been involved for 51 years. The NZDF also provides search and rescue support, air transport, terminal operations at Harewood Terminal in Christchurch and McMurdo, and support for the unloading of the annual container ship.

Fiji Time: 12:21 PM on Wednesday 16 November Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / News Airline reforms Matilda Simmons Saturday, October 22, 2016 THE Fiji Airways was leasing Boeing 747s and 767s for $US500,000 ($F1 million) and $US800,000 ($F1.6m) a month before the Government stepped in to carry out reforms, it was revealed yesterday. Acting Prime Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said it required the absence of unions or unionists whom, he said, "did not understand finance or commerce when Government carried out a restructure in 2011 after the Civil Aviation decree was put in place. "You had people in Fiji Airways who made $96 million in losses because they went and hedged on fuel with absolutely no experience of hedging," Mr Sayed-Khaiyum said during a press conference at the Fiji Electricity Authority office in Suva. "These are the things that we don't talk about publicly, but these were the shennigans that went on inside the organisation. "Maybe I can find a lot of that too that happened in the past in FEA." The national carrier had retired the 747 in 2013 after purchasing three brand new Fiji Airways A330s. Fiji Airways is the largest airline group in the South Pacific, serving 10 domestic and 13 international destinations. Mr Sayed-Khaiyum had made the comments after he was asked about the restructure carried out at Fiji Airways and whether a similar one would take place for FEA. He said FEA was doing well and the organisation was looking at new ways of reducing its operational costs. Back to top Fiji Times & Kaila Frontpage PDF Downloads Use the free Acrobat Reader to view.

Heyamoto has worked alongside Rondeau for thirty years. (Johnny Andrews/The Seattle Times) Craig Heyamoto is an anonymous but invaluable fixture in the Seattle sports scene, or more accurately, behind it, a mathematical wizard who has spent nearly four decades heading up local stats crews – and sometimes writing the programs that run the software. Share story If there is a number to be crunched, a scoring rule to be interpreted, or a Husky broadcast to be enhanced, chances are, Craig Heyamoto has his hand in it. Heyamoto is an anonymous but invaluable fixture in the Seattle sports scene, or more accurately, behind it, a mathematical wizard who has spent nearly four decades heading up local stats crews — and sometimes writing the programs that run the software. “He’s a computer, an absolute computer,” said Husky voice Bob Rondeau, who can barely imagine calling a game without Heyamoto nearby, serving as what he calls “my security blanket.” Husky Hall of Fame These are the inductees in the 2016 Husky Hall of Fame class. The ceremony will be Sunday. • Olin Kreutz (football, 1995-97) • Sara Pickering (softball, 1994-97) • Nate Robinson (basketball, 2003-05; football 2002) • Bob Rondeau (radio announcer, 1978-present) • Sanja Tomasevic (volleyball, 2002-05) • Brad Walker (track & field, 2002-05) • Mary Whipple (rowing, 1999-2002) • 1984 Washington football team Longtime football stats crew chief Craig Heyamoto will be presented with the Don H. Palmer Award. If it involves the Seahawks, the Sounders, the Storm, or, especially, his beloved Huskies, the 63-year-old Heyamoto is right in the middle of the action — and has been since his days at Washington’s law school in the mid-1970s.

Oh, did I mention that Heyamoto is also an attorney — a senior counsel for Boeing since 1983, specializing in commercial contracts and antitrust counseling. He’s UW’s most interesting man in the world, having appeared on both “Jeopardy” and “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” in the midst of the hundreds — probably bordering on thousands — of games he’s worked. You can call him Seattle’s stats guru, but Storm play-by-play man Dick Fain, one of a legion of broadcasters whose work has been aided by Heyamoto’s efforts, realizes that’s not quite strong enough. “He’s really Seattle’s stats legend,” Fain said. Rondeau will be among those inducted into the Huskies’ Hall of Fame on Sunday, a fitting reward for his work as the school’s radio announcer since 1978. But it’s also fitting that at the same ceremony, Heyamoto will receive the Don H. Palmer Award, established in 1994 to recognize those who have “exemplified a special commitment to the UW Athletic Department.” You want to talk special commitment? Heyamoto donates all the money he gets for his various sporting ventures into an endowment for a scholarship in his name that goes to a University of Washington student who works in the Sports Information Department. “It’s just a small repayment for what the university has done for me,” Heyamoto said. Heyamoto has been the stats crew chief for Husky football since 1977. He’s done stats for Husky basketball even longer — since 1975. That’s when Heyamoto, a math major as a UW undergraduate, was taking a business computing class where the project was to design a business-oriented piece of software. “I convinced the professor that keeping track of baskets and steals and fouls was similar to an inventory system,” Heyamoto said. “So he let me write a basketball stat-keeping program.” The Huskies promptly used Heyamoto’s program, believed to be the first of its kind in college athletics. Washington director of communications Jeff Bechtold still has an old, curled-up printout of Heyamoto’s stats from John Wooden’s last loss, which occurred at Hec Edmundson Pavilion in ’75. Heyamoto has been the Seahawks’ stats crew chief since 1982, after starting out as a crew sub in their inaugural season of 1976. He did stats for the Sonics’ visiting television crews from 1995 until their departure. He’s done the Storm since 2000, and the Sounders since 2009. But he’s most identified with the Huskies, having also worked on stats for their women’s basketball team since 1986. Heyamoto and Rondeau are neighbors in Normandy Park, where they grow tomatoes together, and close partners on Husky broadcasts since 1980. For home football games, Heyamoto and his crew — which includes his brother, Gary, a dentist and UW grad; (another brother, Brian, also a UW grad and recently retired from Boeing, is on the Seahawks crew) — compile the official stats. Heyamoto also attends most Husky road games — on his own dime — to sit in the booth as Rondeau’s stat man. Although the home team provides the official stats, Rondeau prefers to use Heyamoto’s while on the road. “He’s more valuable and more accurate than whatever stat system is in whatever stadium we’re in,” Rondeau said. “Sometimes, those systems break down. Craig never breaks down.” And the two have developed such a rapport over the years that Heyamoto knows just what sort of trends Rondeau is looking for, and constantly slips him notes with that information. “The game moves faster than ever before with all the no-huddle offenses,” Rondeau said. “You don’t have a lot of time to explain what you need, nor he what he has. That symbiotic relationship is invaluable.” Heyamoto is legendary for his preparation, which includes studying press notes and media coverage. “He’s come up with probably anywhere from two to a half dozen notes that are nowhere else to be found, and germane to the game,” Rondeau said. “He has them on sticky notes on the ready for when the need arises.” Heyamoto will even watch video of the upcoming opponent for pertinent information. For instance, in advance of Saturday’s game against Oregon State, Heyamoto noticed on film that on their fly sweep, the Beavers sometimes flip the ball forward rather than a straight handoff. That can be the difference between a run and a pass, with obvious statistical ramifications, so he’ll put his crew on alert. Another Heyamoto hallmark is his encyclopedic knowledge of the stat rules, which can be arcane — and vary from college to pro. For instance, sacks in college count as a minus rush for the quarterback, while in pro, they are negative against the team passing yards. He moves seamlessly between the two sets of rules, due in large part to the study he puts in. Heyamoto’s devotion to the Huskies was planted at the age of 7, in 1960, when his father, Hiromu, sat him in front of the television to watch the Rose Bowl between Washington and Wisconsin. He told his son, “We’re going to root for Washington.” Said Heyamoto: “I kind of fell in love with Washington that day.” Hiromu Heyamoto, who died in 2010, grew up in Oregon and played baseball at UW in 1949-50, but not before he was rounded up after World War II broke out, along with other Japanese-Americans, and placed in the Minidoka internment camp in Idaho. That’s where he met his future wife, Masue. As a means to get out of the camp, Heyamoto volunteered to join the army, serving in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, comprised almost exclusively of Japanese-Americans and the most decorated regiment in the U.S. Army in World War II. Shipped off to Italy, Heyamoto earned a bronze star and a purple heart. Asked if his father expressed any bitterness over his internment, Heyamoto replied: “He never said. He didn’t really talk much about the war. I’ve always assumed if he was bitter, he wouldn’t have volunteered to fight. I think that was true of all Japanese-Americans who fought.” A graduate of Highline High School in Burien, Heyamoto wasn’t much of an athlete, but he cut his teeth on stats working the scorebook for his dad’s Little League teams. Stats have been in his blood ever since — even when he’s watching a game on television in his leisure time. “This will sound really nerdy, but I generally have my laptop set up to watch the stat crew that’s working,” he said. “Part of being a good statistician is knowing different plays that could come up.” Heyamoto calculates that he’s attended, watched, listened to or followed online all but two Husky football games since that Rose Bowl in 1960. On both occasions, he was tied up doing stats for national television broadcasts, which he also does as a fill-in on occasion. Heyamoto’s Washington stats crew — which includes Gary Heyamoto calling the defensive stats, Theresa Ripp calling the offensive stats, Bryan Thorn handling the computer input, Lisa Krikava writing down the stats manually as a backup, plus a revolving group of student helpers that Heyamoto patiently mentors — has worked the Rose Bowl since 2009. They also have done the national championship game for several years and will again this year. If Washington’s in it, Heyamoto will keep his professional decorum, which he prides himself on — “but in our hearts, you can kind of guess which way we would be going,” he said with a smile. In the stat booth, Heyamoto is the conductor of the whole operation, calling out the yardage, decisively interpreting the rules, and making sure it all flows smoothly. “He’s completely dedicated to his craft, and he’s a perfectionist,” said Dan Lepse, the assistant athletic director and SID at Seattle Pacific, who has worked extensively on Heyamoto’s stat crew. Heyamoto even sparked an NCAA rule change in basketball. He felt it was wrong for players to get charged with a shot attempt on desperation heaves at the end of a half, so he lobbied the NCAA. They agreed, and such heaves no longer count as a shot, unless they go in. “That’s the Heyamoto rule,” said Lepse. Heyamoto says he models his craft on Don James, the Husky coach when he started working on the UW stats crew. “I really admired Coach James and the way he did things,’’ he said. “Thorough preparation, coach the coaches; in other words, help my teammates understand what they need to do. And then let them do what they do, and I do what I do.” Heyamoto’s predecessor as chief of the Husky stats crew held the job for 40 years, and Heyamoto is closing fast on 40 years. He doesn’t see an end in sight, jokingly pointing to a member of Virginia’s stat crew, Dr. John Risher, still working at 106. “I tell myself I’m going to keep doing it as long as I can keep doing it at the level the teams deserve, and that I feel is up to my standards,” he said. The benefits, he says, are a sense of camaraderie with his crew, being part of the sports scene, and the mental challenge of unraveling the fast-moving and often complex stats matrix. And all the while being unfailingly polite, cordial and helpful. “It’s a way to measure your own ability to do things,” Heyamoto said. “In other words, the team might not be playing very well, but at least you can do your job. And when the team is playing well, all the better.” Larry Stone: 206-464-3146 or lstone@seattletimes.com; on Twitter: @StoneLarry.

Business Airlines add bigger aircraft to Cairns routes Nick Dalton, The Cairns PostOctober 21, 2016 6:00am AIRLINES are operating larger aircraft to and from Cairns to handle the growth in passenger numbers. They have been moving up to wider bodied jets with more seats to bring extra travellers from overseas with international growth last month up 9.1 per cent. Cairns Airport executive chairman Ross Rolfe said both international and domestic passenger numbers growth continued during September. “Domestic passenger numbers climbed by 4.9 per cent to 370,970,” he said. Overall, growth of 6.6 per cent last month resulted in an extra 28,230 passengers through both terminals. An airport report said nearly 96,000 seats were added over the past year, the equivalent of 550 additional Boeing 737 flights. Mr Rolfe said Qantas added six more seats on their Boeing 737s and Virgin Australia moved from Embraer 190s to 737s. “Hong Kong Airlines are operating their service using the wide bodied A330 aircraft while Air New Zealand have moved from a mix of 767s and Airbus 320s with approximately 250 and 168 seats respectively to the significantly larger B777s offering 304 seats.” “The Air New Zealand upgauge, combined with the introduction of the Philippine Airlines Manila-Cairns-Auckland route, is helping to meet the ongoing demand to and from New Zealand as Australia’s largest overseas visitor source market. “With the increased capacity and flight options we are seeing more passengers travelling direct to New Zealand from Cairns rather than via a domestic connection.” Philippine Airlines Australia and New Zealand regional manager Ian Robinson said that the carrier was pleased with the growth on its Manila-Cairns-Auckland return flights. “We may replace the A320 aircraft (152 seat capacity) with the A321 aircraft (195 seat capacity) on selected dates during the coming peak festive season,” he said. SilkAir Cairns manager Ravi L said passenger growth last month was 20 per cent up on last year. He said the airline was “very pleased” with bookings on the fourth weekly flight starting next month, “... filled to above 80 per cent.” Comments nav_small_down nav_small_upPost CommentHide Comments nav_small_down nav_small_up Most viewed Fisherman’s classic reponse to croc sighting premium_iconFisherman’s classic reponse to croc sighting Disgraced ex-cop now a model premium_iconDisgraced ex-cop now a model FNQ’s Top 50 Influential people premium_iconFNQ’s Top 50 Influential people Cams target risky areaCams target risky area Youths racking up the chargesYouths racking up the charges Probe launched into jail protest premium_iconProbe launched into jail protest FNQ’s Top 50 Influential people premium_iconFNQ’s Top 50 Influential people Famous wallaby died suddenlyFamous wallaby died suddenly Tributes to former Cairns manTributes to former Cairns man Gas leak at hospitalGas leak at hospital Party pony rescued after mishapParty pony rescued after mishap Butterfly inquiry ruled outButterfly inquiry ruled out Work finally starts on FNQ bridgeWork finally starts on FNQ bridge Berry drug trials lift hope for cancer fightBerry drug trials lift hope for cancer fight Films take focus off heterosexual worldFilms take focus off heterosexual world Supermoon dazzles CairnsSupermoon dazzles Cairns Council may cull dumped horsesCouncil may cull dumped horses Pic Taylor didn’t want the world to seePic Taylor didn’t want the world to see Execution caught on cameraExecution caught on camera Our world of newsOur world of news More Business Stalled lockout call may backfire premium_iconStalled lockout call may backfire Talks fail to lock in deal premium_iconTalks fail to lock in deal ‘Cairns’ ship’ ties up port deal for 2018‘Cairns’ ship’ ties up port deal for 2018 Skills focus pays off in jobsSkills focus pays off in jobs Dealer drives revamp for more customersDealer drives revamp for more customers Cape in frame for sun projectCape in frame for sun project Nova the brightest star in cityNova the brightest star in city Hope old mill site sale will help BabindaHope old mill site sale will help Babinda Hotel revamp nearly finishedHotel revamp nearly finished Car expense shock blamed on ‘error’Car expense shock blamed on ‘error’ Businesses soak up latest ideas for growthBusinesses soak up latest ideas for growth Excitement building for NovaExcitement building for Nova Security jobs go beggingSecurity jobs go begging Burger franchise has taste for CairnsBurger franchise has taste for Cairns Boom in air passengersBoom in air passengers Red carpet out for $4 trillionRed carpet out for $4 trillion Hotel chains race for rightsHotel chains race for rights Projects build optimismProjects build optimism Cartel turns heads with all-new vibeCartel turns heads with all-new vibe Local wins contract for five-star upgradeLocal wins contract for five-star upgrade Historic pub takes on restored lease of lifeHistoric pub takes on restored lease of life Manning up for art hubManning up for art hub Council votes to acquire CBD pubCouncil votes to acquire CBD pub Chinese in $418m deal for bauxiteChinese in $418m deal for bauxite Tourists flowing to PortTourists flowing to Port Featured stories Talks fail to lock in deal premium_iconTalks fail to lock in deal ‘Cairns’ ship’ ties up port deal for 2018‘Cairns’ ship’ ties up port deal for 2018 Cairns Tropical Zoo to closeCairns Tropical Zoo to close Construction boom pushes up pay premium_iconConstruction boom pushes up pay Visitors numbers in Cairns revitalisedVisitors numbers in Cairns revitalised Woman blows cash on partying, wants us to payWoman blows cash on partying, wants us to pay Stalled lockout call may backfire premium_iconStalled lockout call may backfire $550 million revamp for Cairns golf resort$550 million revamp for Cairns golf resort Jarver back in pictureJarver back in picture Cairns Myer store threatCairns Myer store threat ‘Where’s the chicken?’: KFC sued‘Where’s the chicken?’: KFC sued Sou set to steer $640m ventureSou set to steer $640m venture Search for solution leads to businessSearch for solution leads to business Cane growers call for clarityCane growers call for clarity Boom in air passengersBoom in air passengers Freight firm deliversFreight firm delivers Hotel chains race for rightsHotel chains race for rights Visa crackdown will put Aussies first premium_iconVisa crackdown will put Aussies first A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

Will F-16s be made in India? October 20, 2016 10:45 IST Lockheed Martin's offer involves transferring the world's only F-16 production line from Fort Worth, Texas, to India. Thereafter, every F-16 built, and a large share of the spare parts and sub-systems for every F-16 flying across the globe would come from India. Ajai Shukla reports. On Monday, US defence giant Lockheed Martin became the first international vendor to respond to an Indian Air Force letter, soliciting interest in building a single-engine, medium fighter aircraft in India, with full transfer of technology. "We sent our acceptance (to the IAF) earlier this week," Lockheed Martin's Randy Howard, who markets the F-16 worldwide, told Business Standard. Meanwhile, Swedish defence corporation, Saab, which was sent a similar invitation, is learnt to be finalising its acceptance. "We will definitely say 'yes'; most likely by the end of this month," says a Saab official. As Business Standard reported on October 8, the IAF sent out letters last week to top global aerospace vendors, inviting them to build a single-engine fighter in India. Defence ministry sources confirm the Boeing company has also been approached. Unlike Lockheed Martin and Saab, which are actively marketing single-engine fighters -- the F-16 Block 70 and the Gripen E respectively -- Boeing has no single-engine fighter to offer. Instead, it has been offering its twin-engine F/A-18 E/F. Nor does Eurofighter, the European consortium that builds the twin-engine Typhoon, whose member firms also reportedly received the IAF inquiry. The contours of the 'single-engine fighter' contest are therefore emerging --- Lockheed Martin and Saab seem poised to be the only contenders. As this newspaper reported on August 16, both companies had earlier submitted what IAF boss, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha, described as 'unsolicited offers' for building single-engine fighters in India. Now, with Lockheed Martin having responded positively to the IAF's inquiry, Saab's acceptance, when received, will formally kick off a multi-vendor acquisition process. The F-16 is amongst the older fighters still in frontline service, but Lockheed Martin describes to Business Standard an attractive offer that would make India the F-16 global hub, galvanising aerospace component fabrication in the country. The offer involves transferring the world's only F-16 production line from Fort Worth, Texas, to India. Thereafter, every F-16 built, and a large share of the spare parts and sub-systems for every F-16 flying across the globe would come from India. "Our offer is not for just building a hundred F-16s in India; or even another hundred F-16s for the export market. The real value would come from the tens of thousands of spare parts, components, sub-systems and systems that would sustain the 3,200-plus F-16s still flying in the US, and in 24 other countries," says Howard. Intriguingly, that could mean spares and expendables for Pakistan's F-16 fleet would be sourced largely from India. Lockheed Martin points out that bringing the production line to India would be "a strategic opportunity." In truth, India would have little control over the F-16 components it builds for the global F-16 fleet, including Pakistan's. Governed by a 'global F-16 sustainment programme,' the components would go into a chain of US-controlled warehouses across the globe, from where user air forces would draw their requirements. In discussions with Lockheed Martin officials, it is evident that they are concerned by the negativity in India caused by Pakistan's long association with the F-16. Yet the company is banking on an attractive business case to tamp down Indian reservations. For Lockheed Martin, shifting the F-16 line to India would be a double benefit. With the F-16 ending its prodigious production run (of 4,588 F-16s ordered over the years, just 15 remain to be delivered), Lockheed Martin now wants to build the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter at Fort Worth. Yet, an F-16 line is essential, since the US Air Force plans to operate its late-model F-16s (Block 40 and Block 50 versions) for another 30 years, till 2045. Transferring the production line to India would assure Washington that its F-16s would be reliably sustained. Howard argues that F-16 production is not yet closed. Bahrain and other West Asian countries are negotiating purchases and there are potential buyers in former Soviet countries in NATO, Indonesia and Columbia. He holds out the possibility of building these orders in India. It remains unclear how much weightage cost would have in selecting a light fighter for the IAF. Lockheed Martin is confident of offering the cheapest fighter in its class, having more than amortised its production line while building over 4,500 fighters. "Transferring the line to India will make the F-16 even cheaper. And that will bring in even more export orders," predicts Howard, optimistically. There is little clarity, however, on whether Washington or New Delhi would have the casting vote on foreign sales of F-16s built in India. It seems likely that both governments would have to concur on third-party, export sales. Lockheed Martin strongly rejects the notion that the F-16, first built in the 1970s, is obsolescent. Howard points to the Block 70's battle-proven Northrop Grumman APG-83 airborne electronically scanned array radar, a key fighter combat system. That leverages technologies developed for the F-35's fifth-generation AESA radar. "Nothing in the world compares with the experience in AESA radars that Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman bring to the table," argues Howard. To be sure, the F-16 Block 70 is a versatile combat platform. It flies faster, climbs quicker and carries more armament than most fighters in its class. The 'conformal fuel tanks' in late-version F-16s allow long-range operations. With two additional 370-gallon drop tanks and predominantly air-to-air armament, the F-16 has a combat radius of 1,500 kilometres --- comparable to the much bigger Rafale. With the heavier air-to-ground weaponry that the F-16 carries for strike missions, the radius of action is still an impressive 700 kilometres. Alongside an aggressive marketing pitch to the IAF, Lockheed Martin is also moving ahead strongly with developing vendors in India, and a supply chain that would feed into an Indian F-16 line. On November 7 and 8, a vendors' conference is planned in Bengaluru.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images Advertisement On October 13, 2016, the “Southern California Manufacturing Summit" was held at the Wedgewood Center in Aliso Viejo. The summit was hosted by the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA), with SDG&E/Sempra Utilities as the major sponsor, along with a long list of non-profit organizations, regional businesses and associations as sponsors and partners. The purpose of the summit was to learn and discuss how we can use Southern California's advantages to re-grow manufacturing and create good paying jobs through smarter policies on trade, taxes, and the economy. CPA is a unique alliance of manufacturing, agriculture, and labor working for smart trade policies and represents over three million households through our member associations and companies. Since nearly all of our sponsors provide services that benefit manufacturers, we modified our format from previous summits to provide opportunities for our sponsors to tell about their services to promote networking among attendees. Our first speaker was Greg Autry, adjunct professor of Entrepreneurship, Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, who discussed “National Security Concerns with the Current U.S. Trade Regime.” Among the highlights of his presentation was his statement, “There are national security concerns with trade agreements. An economy that builds only F-35s is unsustainable – productive capacity is what wins real wars. Sophisticated systems require complex supply chains of supporting industries. They require experienced production engineers, machinists, and more.” He recently prepared a report analyzing the competition and found that we are now outsourcing most of our space-related technology. He said, "NASA awards contracts for launch vehicles to Boeing and Space X, but chose to buy Russian lower stage engines. We have to choose if we are going to have a supply chain for the space industry. We cannot rely on China to produce what we need for our military and defense systems. He added, "The International Space Station was funded by the U. S. to the tune of $100 billion of the $120 billion that it cost. We should not be relying on Russia’s Mr. Putin to launch our satellites and space vehicles and provide us a seat to get to the International Space Station.” Autry stated, "If you own stock in Alibaba, you actually own stock in a holding company in the set up in an offshore tax haven of the Cayman Islands, and the real owner behind Alibaba is the Chinese government. In contrast, he said, “It was the wealth he created at Amazon that enabled founder Jeff Bezos to now lead Blue Origin, which was selected by the United Launch Alliance to finish development of a new engine to replace the Russian made RD-180 rocket engine used by ULA’s Atlas 5 rocket.” Popular Now More 'Must Have' Metrics to Drive Continuous Improvement Trump is Right on Trade, But He Doesn’t Know Why The Internet of Things Will Make Manufacturing Smarter He pointed out that the Germans had the best technology in WWII, but didn't win because we outproduced them. Productive capacity is what wins wars. We wouldn’t be able to do the same for a future war as China has become the shop floor for too many American manufacturers. Take the U.S. F-22 airplane vs. the Chinese J20 airplane. We have 187 F-22s, and we stopped producing them because they were too expensive. China has several hundred J-20s, and they are still producing them. He warned, "China has been an aggressive nation for thousands of years – it's how the country grew from a small nation state. China has expanded their claim to territorial waters to include territory claimed by all of its immediate neighbors -- Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines, Japan and even New Zealand and Australia. China's threat to these countries could eliminate getting supplies from Vietnam, Taiwan, and Korea, where companies are located that are now part of our supply chain for the military and space industry. We are going to lose our supply chain for the military and defense industry because the people in the State and Commerce Departments don't talk to the Defense Department."  After his presentation, July Lawton, president of The Lawton Group/TLC Staffing, explained that her company provides temporary to permanent staffing solutions for engineering, manufacturing, information technology, as well as the more traditional human resources, accounting, administrative, marketing, and healthcare positions. Nicholas Testa, Jr. is founder and CEO of Acuity Consulting, Inc. a firm specializing in supply chain and operations management and systems consulting and training. He is president-elect of the APICS Orange County and described the types of supply chain education and training that APICS provides to its manufacturing industry members. Economist Ian Fletcher, author of Free Trade Doesn't Work, was the next speaker. A few highlights of his presentation were: "Free trade is trade without restrictions. Economic rivalry is taking place every day. There is rivalry for wealth and power. We live in America, and it does matter where you live. America's trade deficit is averaging $500 B/year. Free trade is part of the cause of poverty, as well as family breakdowns. Free trade mostly destroys jobs. We are looking in a decline of quality rather than quantity of jobs. De-industrialization is occurring. Many major American companies are not American any longer; they are owned by foreign corporations. Boeing is losing manufacture of airplane wings to Mitsubishi. There is not a single airplane that doesn't rely on parts from other countries." He stated, "Free trade simplified means there must be something good for both parties. Free trade is only one sided by the United States because many countries practice mercantilism. Trade is being manipulated to benefit our trading partners. The Euro currency has been manipulated to reduce the value of the currency of Germany to be lower by balancing it out with the economies of France, Italy, Spain, and Greece. The U.S. is being forced to compete with the state capitalism of Europe and Asia." He added, "Free traders say that trade deficit doesn't a matter, but trade deficits mean that we consume more than we produce. David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage did not work when it was created and doesn't work now. A nation needs some protection. Protectionism is really the American way. Alexander Hamilton was the founder of American protectionism. The U.S. had a protectionist policy until after WWII. Every country has done protectionism to succeed. He showed the following chart showing the history of tariffs in the U. S. He concluded, "After WWII, free trade became a policy because of the politics to win the Cold War. It is crumbling now because of politics. There are dangers in protectionism, but there are dangers in doing nothing. Treaties or trade agreements are basically about protecting property rights. The World Trade Organization has failed to enforce terms of current trade agreements and will not do any better with the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement."  After the morning break, I provided a brief overview of California manufacturing prior to moderating our panel of manufacturers. California is the 8th largest economy in the world, and if it were a country, it would be equal to France. California lost 33.3% of manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2009 compared to 29.8% nationwide, and lost 25% of its manufacturing firms. I pointed out that even with its unfavorable overall business climate, California still ranks first in manufacturing for both jobs and output. However, since the Great Recession, California lags in manufacturing job growth at a 3.6% rate compared to the national 7.2% rate and a GDP growth rate in manufacturing of 11.2% in California compared to a 22.6% GDP growth in the U.S. as a whole. On the positive side, California leads the nation in R&D and number of patents issued, and California companies received $78.4 billion of VC dollars in 2015 (57% of U.S. total - up from 51% in 2010). Mexico, Canada, China, and Japan are the top four export markets for California, and California represents 11% of total U. S. exports. California ranks second behind Texas in all exports, but California ranks first among all 50 states in agricultural exports estimated at $13.6 billion per year. California is the biggest U. S. producer of nuts, dairy, ice cream, and wine. The top high tech export is computers and electronic products, which equals 26.1 % of all the state’s exports. Transportation goods are the second top export, consisting of airplanes, ships, unmanned vehicles, and underwater vehicles. Besides the good weather, Southern California's advantages are: Gateway to Pacific – two major ports – Long Beach and San Diego Major hub in western U.S. for air, rail roads & waterway transportation Skilled, educated workforce for ALL occupations Research Institutions and Universities Large inventor/entrepreneur pool Hundreds of business Incubators and Accelerators Angel investor networks Venture capital networks 18 Foreign Trade Zones Employment Training Panel funds for employee training Workforce Investment Boards There is also an abundance of business resources in Southern California, such as the California Manufacturing Technology Consulting (designated California MEP), two Centers for Applied Competitive Technologies, several Small Business Development Centers and Economic Development Agencies, as well as many Chambers of Commerce and Business Councils. I concluded with mentioning the opportunities we have to improve the California business climate, change our national tax and trade policies, return manufacturing to U.S. through reshoring, connect regional manufacturers with other U. S. suppliers, increase collaboration between manufacturers and community college to address workforce and skills gaps, and educate community/youth about career opportunities in manufacturing. After my presentation, the following three panelists shared their stories: James Hedgecock, founder and president of Bounce Composites, which designs, engineers, and manufactures high-quality, durable composite goods for multiple industries, including wind energy, automotive, aerospace, and sporting goods. He shared that the company started out producing their own patented design of stand up paddleboards, but it has been tough to compete with offshore companies because of unfair trade practice. He said it was especially difficult to export to Mexico and Europe because Value Added Taxes (VATs) are added to the price of their products, making their product more expensive. Robert Lane and Dave Mock, principals of Lane OPX, shared how they help companies optimize excellence through blending Lean Six Sigma principles, strategic business initiatives and participative management philosophies to grow organizations, and inspire high performing, motivated teams. By leveraging their deep experience in manufacturing, team dynamics, leadership development and organizational design, they have been able to power the turnaround of small to large companies.  More recently, they have been able to help manufacturers return manufacturing to America from overseas. Wei-Yung Lee, CEO of Carlsbad Technology Inc. was our final panelist. Based in Carlsbad, Calif., Lee said that Carlsbad Tech was founded 1990 and is a subsidiary of Taiwan’s leading YungShin Pharmaceutical Co. The company began as a contract manufacturer of generic pharmaceuticals and has become an industry leader in manufacturing and distribution of generics, supplements, and medical devices. He said, "We have 150 employees and 15 are well-trained chemists. We have the capacity to produce 60 million capsules and 400 million tablets per year. Last year, we launched our Comfort Vision contact lenses in the USA and have sold over 1 billion units in Asia. We are striving to become a global health bridge, bringing a world of innovative health products to the markets that need them. " After the panel, Jill Berg, president of Advanced Test Equipment Rentals, told about the products and services of her company.  They rent, lease, and sell a large selection of test and measurement equipment and other types of lab equipment to companies all over the world.  She announced that her company was hosting a San Diego Test Equipment Showcase on October 18th. Then, Chris Marocchi, field operations manager of California Manufacturing Technology Consulting (CMTC), explained that his organization is a non-profit consulting organization that just won the competition to provide Manufacturing Extension Program services for all of California. These services provide innovation and growth strategies along with operational enhancements to foster profitable growth for California companies. MEP services include:  innovate new products, open new markets, improve workforce skills, increase product quality and reduce costs through Lean training, increase energy efficiency and green production, and optimize supply chain performance. After our lunch break, I presented information on Lean Six Sigma Institute (LSSI). LSSI is a boutique-style training and consulting company that uses training and coaching model to guide companies to manage Lean Six Sigma change, develop internal leaders, and sustain the results. LSSI is headquartered in Chula Vista Calif., but has satellite offices in nine countries and employs over 60 expert consultants worldwide. Lean and six sigma principles and tools apply to virtually any process, and LSSI has successfully helped clients implement Lean Six Sigma in a variety of industries, such as manufacturing, retail, and healthcare. Our key note speaker for the summit was Michael Stumo, CEO of the Coalition for a Prosperous America, speaking on "Growing SoCal Manufacturing."  Stumo stated, "CPA is a true coalition of manufacturing, agriculture, labor, Republicans, Democrats, Progressives, Conservatives, and Independents. Our members are: Trade associations, companies, farm organizations, labor unions, and individuals from all walks of life. Our non-agriculture industries are: manufacturers, steel, tooling and machining, electronics, textiles, copper, aluminum, etc. Our mission is to balance trade and produce more in America to reclaim American prosperity." Stumo explained that there is a difference between service jobs and manufacturing jobs. According to Investopedia, "Examples of service sector jobs include housekeeping, psychotherapy, tax preparation, legal services, guided tours, nursing and teaching. There are very few "tradable" service jobs. By contrast, individuals employed in the industrial/manufacturing sector might produce goods such as cars, clothing and toys.” He said, "There is also a difference in income and purchasing power between manufacturing and service jobs. When considering what industry sectors to prioritize for workforce and economic development efforts, it is important to look beyond basic employment numbers. This is because, while a sector might have a lot of jobs, it might not actually be producing a lot of income for the region, which is also very important for overall economic health and vitality." Stumo stated, "The problem is that as more manufacturing jobs leave, more productivity leaves as well. Unlike manufacturing, service-sector jobs have strict limits in terms of productivity. For example, a live performance of Beethoven’s 5th requires the same amount of performers/employees as when it was performed early in the 19th century. Compare that with the production of almost anything manufactured — the number of workers now required to produce a bolt of fabric, for example." He added, "There is a regional ripple effect of service vs. manufacturing jobs. At $4.4 trillion in total sales, manufacturing is by far the biggest income generator in our nation, despite a fairly rapid decline in employment. Yet, manufacturing still manages to far outperform all other industries in terms of pure income creation. Manufacturing generates more income per worker and has much bigger ripple effects, creating much more impact in a region while helping to raise wages in lower-productivity service sectors." He asked the rhetorical question, "What's wrong with a service economy? He answered, "It shrinks manufacturing employment as well as the manufacturing sector’s ability to prop up wages. A labor market that loses wage pressures of high-productivity manufacturing industries will settle at wage rates lower than markets where this wage-boosting effect is present. Economic development policy makers should be careful about shunning manufacturing or other production sectors in favor of service sectors. This is a problem because 66% of U. S. workforce is without a four-year college degree." He concluded stating, "America is at a crossroads. We are losing an economic competition against other nations whose mercantilist strategies are destroying our manufacturing jobs, critical industries, and our standard of living, our national security, the security of our food supply, and our children's futures. For the U. S. to become prosperous again, our future strategy must include the following: National Priority of Balanced Trade Strong enforcement Stop new trade agreements to force a re-think. Neutralize currency manipulation Tax reform with VAT/consumption taxes Consider tariffs to neutralize imbalances We have a choice. We can continue our current trade and tax policies or we can develop and implement a comprehensive strategy that retains and reinforces our leadership in innovation, locates investment and production in the U. S. and raises employment by creating good paying jobs." As chair of the California chapter of CPA, I hope you will join our efforts to make America prosperous again.

Log In or Register to post comments Lone Star on Oct 25, 2016 Great summit, great article. The summary of items needed are spot on. In addition, I believe our nation needs to think like a business and act like a business. We must consider the importance of our national key competencies and define them.

Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Singapore gets 10,000th Airbus Singapore Airlines has taken delivery of its sixth Airbus A350-900 – the 10,000th aircraft that Airbus has delivered. The airline is the largest A350-900 customer with commitments for 67 firm orders, including seven of the ultra-long-range A350-900ULR (ultra long range) variant. This aircraft, for which deliveries will begin in 2018, will be used to re-launch non-stop flights from Singapore to New York and Los Angeles. The just delivered A350-900 (pictured) will be used to launch non-stop flights between Singapore and San Francisco later this month. China Southern buys bigger 787s Boeing and China Southern Airlines have sealed a $US3.2 billion deal for 12 787-9 Dreamliners. China Southern was the launch customer of the 787 in China and has 10 787-8s in its fleet. They have enabled the Guangzhou-based carrier to launch six new non-stop global routes, connecting Guangzhou to London and Rome in Europe, Vancouver in North America, as well as Perth, Auckland and Christchurch. Qantas opens Brisbane lounge The new Qantas Brisbane International Lounge is the first of several new facilities it will open there as part of a multi-million dollar upgrade. The airline’s A330 fleet is being refurbished at the Brisbane Maintenance Facility and the domestic terminal lounges are set for a complete redesign. The Brisbane International Lounge is based on Qantas’ Hong Kong and Singapore lounge concept, with the food and interior design taking inspiration from the local region. The lounge – split across two levels – offers nearly 30% more space. The furniture is inspired by a relaxed approach to living in the tropical north with timber café seating and low slung lounges. Inset rugs bring colour and texture reminiscent of the reef, sandbars and waterways of Queensland’s coast and inlets. Best and worst airports for sleeping Singapore's Changi Airport has topped Canadian travel site Sleeping in Airports’ latest annual survey. It was followed by Seoul Incheon in Korea in second place followed by Tallinn in Estonia, Tokyo Haneda and Helsinki-Vantaa in Finland. The three worst are Jeddah King Abdulaziz in Saudi Arabia, London’s Luton and Reykjavik-Keflavik in Iceland. Wellington Airport was 33rd on the list with Auckland at 48. More airlines cut Nigeria services Emirates and Kenya Airways have both announced they will be pulling out of services to the Nigerian capital, Abuja, citing the country's worsening foreign currency shortage.   Emirates’ last flight is on October 22, while Kenya Airways will exit from November 15. Other foreign operators that have withdrawn from the Nigerian market in past six months include Iberia and United Airlines. Route news of the week Sichuan Airlines, the newest Chinese airline planning a service to Auckland, has just launched its Chengdu-Hangzhou-Los Angeles route. It runs twice a week using Airbus A330 aircraft. Hainan Airlines will increase its Beijing-Tel Aviv service to four times weekly from November 6. Vietnam-based Jetstar Pacific plans to add four new international routes in coming weeks. They are: Ho Chi Minh City-Hong Kong four times weekly from November 18; Hanoi-Guangzhou daily from December 1; Da Nang-Taipei Taoyuan three times weekly from December 2 (the airline’s predecessor Pacific Airlines served Ho Chi Minh-Taipei until May 2007);   and Ho Chi Minh City-Guangzhou five times weekly  from December 2.

And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That’s what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift at the hospital was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It’s being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. “I put it on my phone yesterday,” said DeMont’s wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. “He would not be here as we see him today.” Seattle officials hope DeMont’s story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city’s 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. Some 34,000 off-duty professional and citizen responders around the country have downloaded it, Price said Wednesday, and they’ve been alerted to more than 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. “The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,” Price said. “The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.” It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It’s not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient’s outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she’d ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. “I hadn’t responded to a cardiac arrest before,” Forcade said. “I thought, ‘Did he just fall?’ ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, ‘Oh, man, who’s going to step up?’ ” He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — “You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected” — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. “There’s hope,” DeMont said. He’s due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe.

Bombardier is eliminating 7,500 jobs, its second round of steep job cuts this year. The cuts at the Canadian jet and train manufacturer, which represent more than 10% of its global workforce, come on top of 7,000 cuts announced in February. Those earlier cuts are "nearly complete," a spokesman said. The company had 67,200 employees as of Sept. 30. Bombardier said 2,000 of the job cuts will be in Canada and the rest spread around the globe. It has U.S. operations in Pittsburgh; Wichita, Kansas; and Plattsburgh, New York. The cuts will come in both its jet and train businesses. Related: Airbus CEO vows to retake jet production crown from Boeing Job cuts have become common across the aerospace industry this year. Boeing (BA) announced in March it would cut 4,000 jobs, though it said it hoped to accomplish the reduction through voluntary buyouts. Airbus chief Tom Enders was quoted last month saying he couldn't rule out job cuts. And Brazil's Embraer is reportedly also using buyouts to cut jobs. Related: Airbus offers a peek at its flying taxi But the cuts at Bombardier (BDRAF) are much deeper than those of rivals because the regional jet business, in which it is a major player, has been particularly hard hit. Airlines are shifting away from using those smaller jets.

(Elaine Thompson/Associated Press) By GENE JOHNSON, Associated Press Published: October 20, 2016, 9:55 PM A   A SEATTLE — If your heart is going to stop, right outside a hospital is not a bad place for it. And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That’s what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift at the hospital was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. Seattle officials said the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It’s being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. Seattle officials hope DeMont’s story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in California, Richard Price, the app works through a city’s 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. “The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,” Price said. “The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.” It’s not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient’s outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago. Last Friday was the first time she’d ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found medical student Zach Forcade, 27, performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. He told a passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said.

BUSINESS REAL ESTATE Hot Property Neighborhood Spotlight: Canoga Park rocketing on fewer engines (Los Angeles Times) Scott Garner If there’s one part of the San Fernando Valley that most expressed the go-go spirit of Space Age America, it’s Canoga Park. The neighborhood is where aerospace giant Rocketdyne designed the massive rockets that would take us to the moon and back, and where each sprawling new ranch home contained a nuclear family in which at least one parent was a bona fide pocket protector-sporting rocket scientist. The national craze for all things aerospace extended even to the finned cars thronging Sherman Way, cruising through the warm Valley nights under a wall of neon signs. At a certain time in the last century, it must have seemed to the Tang-swilling citizens of Canoga Park that a Jetsons-like future was just around the corner. Less than 50 years before the U.S. and USSR began lobbing men into space, Canoga Park had been a treeless, windswept corner of the Valley where sheep far outnumbered people. That didn’t stop the Los Angeles Suburban Home Co. from marketing the area as a desirable locale to put down roots. In one of the boldest bits of chicanery in Valley real estate history, the syndicate named the town Owensmouth, implying it was near the new mouth of the Owens River (a.k.a. the terminus of the Los Angeles Aqueduct) — never mind that it was 15 miles distant and still a year away from completion. Owensmouth grew fitfully at first, but the aqueduct’s water — and new connections to Los Angeles via a Pacific Electric Railway line that ran down the center of Sherman Way — kept the little town alive long enough for residents to jettison the name in favor of Canoga Park. It wasn’t until the end of World War II, when the Valley became the red-hot center of SoCal’s suburban boom, that Canoga Park and the future would finally meet in the clean rooms and laboratories of Rocketdyne, TRW, Boeing and other aerospace companies that flocked to the area. Unfortunately, the future is fickle. Waves of industry consolidation, the end of the space shuttle program and the general exodus of much of the Valley’s aerospace industry to other parts of the country hit Canoga Park hard. Now, only Aerojet Rocketdyne remains, and Canoga Park has transitioned into a bedroom community better known for Sherman Way’s antique stores than for cutting-edge space flight technology. Neighborhood highlights Suburban living that’s (relatively) affordable: Unlike closer-in Valley nabes like Sherman Oaks and Studio City, Canoga Park prices rarely range into the seven figures, with many homes available right around the $500K mark. A touch of the past: The remnants of Owensmouth can still be seen along Sherman Way, in Canoga Park’s Antique Row. These brick buildings from the 1920s and 1930s took a beating in the Northridge quake but lived to tell the tale. Indoors / Outdoors: If nature is your thing, there are plenty of state parks and open spaces a short drive away; shoppers and mall walkers will appreciate the proximity to Warner Center’s retail offerings. Neighborhood challenges A long road to recovery: The loss of the aerospace industry is a blow that Canoga Park has yet to fully bounce back from, with weed shops and payday loan outlets lining many formerly thriving business corridors. Expert insight Ashish Trivedi, licensed partner and president of Engel & Volkers, a Valley real estate firm, said there’s been a push to revitalize Canoga Park. Single-family homes that neighbor mall behemoth Westfield Topanga in particular have seen increases in value and demand, he said. Canoga Park is “a little more community-based” than other parts of Los Angeles, he said. “The price affordability factor is also huge.” Market snapshot Portions of the 91303, 91304, and 91307 ZIP Codes overlap the Canoga Park area. In the 91303 ZIP, the median price for single-family homes in August was $571,000, based on six sales, according to CoreLogic. The median price in the 91304 ZIP, based on 28 sales, was $578,000, and in the 91307 ZIP, 36 sales produced a median price of $641,000. Report card Canoga Park schools include N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park, which scored 812 out of 1,000 in the 2013 Academic Performance Index. Canoga Park Elementary had a score of 750 and Hart Street Elementary scored 703. Christopher Columbus Middle and Canoga Park Senior High scored 698 and 693, respectively. hotproperty@latimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Los Angeles Times Housing Market Real Estate Why Trump — or any other politician — can't do much to bring back manual labor jobs The LAPD police watchdog has taken the unusual step of dedicating today's entire meeting to one issue Clippers push record to NBA-best 10-1 with thumping of Nets Most Popular Local Sports Entertainment Politics Orange County Opinion Place An Ad 69°

The Single Source Regulations Office (SSRO) was established in 2014 as part of an effort to ensure British taxpayers were getting the best bang for their buck when it comes to defense contracts. With the UK’s Ministry of Defense spending roughly $10.8 billion each year on single-source contracts, a lot of money is at stake. © AP Photo/ Alastair Grant UK Defense Secretary Believes Brexit to Promote Defense Sector Revolution The SSRO has already expressed concern over the purchase of Boeing Apache helicopters and P-8 patrol aircraft. Now the organization has set its sights on the potential purchase of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles from the United States. "Foreign military sales [FMS] (for example, Poseidon P-8A and Apache helicopters) are decisions to award single source contracts which do not fall under the regulations and therefore do not benefit from the transparency brought by the regime," reads a September SSRO report, according to Defense News. "It is vital that there is transparency in all these cases and the reasons are fully justified." Jon Louth, of the Royal United Services Institute, agrees, telling Defense News that being open about G2G contracts will improve efficiency. "The lack of transparency drives uncertainty and cynicism. Some of these deals are really good for the operator and can be good for the taxpayers as well. Having a light shine on these kind of contracts would not necessarily be a bad thing," he said. © Flickr/ Forsvarsdepartementet UK Defense Ministry Signs $237Mln Deal to Purchase Latest Missiles for F-35 "Why are we having these deals unless we can point to them being specific and exceptional? Something like P-8 is a good example. It’s difficult to see why it trumps other potential solutions other than the operators really wanted it, there’s nothing wrong in that, but let’s at least put it to some kind of scrutiny if we are going to have uncontested solutions." In August, the Ministry of Defense announced a number of major purchases, including "dragonfly drones," virtual reality helmets, and a device that can survey enemy tunnels. The MoD plans to spend over $1 billion on this technology. The UK also signed a $237 million contract to purchase air-to-air missiles for its F-35B fighter jets. These, however, will be produced domestically. "Wholly designed and built in the UK, this air-to-air missile on our F-35 aircraft will secure cutting-edge air power for the UK for years to come," Harriet Baldwin, minister for defense procurement, said in a press release, adding that it would "sustain around 400 jobs across the country." ...

Funnily enough, just immediately prior to Pearl Harbour the USA was still selling munitions and kit to both sides (in practice, not in terms of treaties). Under those conditions US sales to the Germans swent along swimmingly as their procurement specialists were happy to share cost data with the Yanks so as to harmonize & smoothen their buying needs with the US manufacturing machine. Following Pearl Harbour, the Royal Navy's Ordnance division liaison office in Warren, Michigan, USA, used the paradigm the Germans developed to coordinate their purchases and to provide useful feedback to the Yanks. As ever and as with all international long-term procurement, the weakest link is always how changes in the in-process supply requirements of the customer impacts the customer's original terms and conditions of product acceptance. Without the feedback mechanism making actual changes to the acceptance criteria, costs go through the roof whilst no one is really sure what is going to arrive during the next supply round. The book "Industrialists in olive drab: the emergency operation of private industries during World War II" by John H. Ohly and edited by Clayton D. Laurie goes into the grisly details of this mind-numbingly boring accountant's topic (boring unless you do it for a living, anyway). Another topical read on how government to government military trade can become massively dysfunctional with little effort whatsoever is "Defense acquisition reform 1960–2009 : an elusive goal " by J. Ronald Fox with contributions by David G. Allen.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

The nation’s manufacturing sector is actually booming, even if many people don’t realize it. “We don’t make our product anymore. It’s very sad,” Donald Trump said during Wednesday’s presidential debate. “We’ve given it up.” In fact, several industries are now producing record output at their U.S. plants. And foreign companies are building or expanding hundreds of plants in the United States. “We produce more today than we ever have,” said Chad Moutray, chief economist with the National Association of Manufacturers. “We made $2.1 trillion worth of products in 2015. There are sectors doing really well.” But it’s true that there are far fewer manufacturing jobs than there used to be. Employment in the sector is down nearly 40% from its 1979 peak of 19.6 million workers, according to the Labor Department. Still, manufacturing has added 800,000 U.S. jobs since 2010. While some of the lost factory jobs are due to outsourcing to foreign plants, others have been lost to automation and improved efficiency. The strength of the sector can be seen in the Federal Reserve’s inflation-adjusted measure of manufacturing, which hit a record high last year. It shows that U.S. factories are producing three to five times more output than in the early 1950s to mid-1960s, when America was the globe’s manufacturing powerhouse. For example, U.S. aircraft production is at a record high and well ahead of the rest of the world. Aerospace giant Boeing, the country’s largest exporter, started delivering 787 Dreamliners from its new plant in South Carolina in 2012. Both that factory and the company’s plants in Washington state are running at record production. Boeing delivered 768 airliners in 2015, up 163% in 10 years. Archrival Airbus delivered its first U.S.-assembled airliner from its new Alabama factory in April, and Brazilian plane maker Embraer recently moved assembly of its smallest private jets to Florida. U.S. auto production and employment has also been growing steadily since bottoming out in 2009 with the bankruptcies at GM and Chrysler. The industry is operating within 7% of record levels, making 12 million cars and trucks a year. Not only have GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler all been hiring and investing in U.S. plants, but foreign automakers are expanding operations here as well. The largest BMW plant in the world is now in South Carolina, and the plant exports most of the cars it builds there. And the boom isn’t just about big-ticket items. Chemical production hit a record $797 billion last year, up 30% in the last 10 years. The chemical boom has been fueled by the record U.S. energy boom, which has made oil and natural gas particularly cheap. Petroleum is a key raw material for many chemicals, most of which are produced using energy from natural gas.

By making some line maintenance packages bigger, “We are using our line-maintenance staff more efficiently” and evening out the peaks and valleys, Sayar said. The Turkish airline also is saving money by not grounding aircraft for routine maintenance, which allows it to fly and maximize revenue, he added. Fergus Wilson, Aer Lingus chief technical officer, said the Irish carrier is following a similar process by moving some maintenance tasks out of C checks to the line environment, but it also is evaluating out-of-phase and B checks to avoid having to move other checks forward. “We are working within bounds of our maintenance planning documents,” but together with Airbus and the regulatory authorities, he hopes to gain approval for escalated intervals in the future, he said.

Stephen DeMont, 60, was getting off his bicycle near Seattle's University of Washington Medical Center last week when he keeled over.  A medical student passing by told someone to call 911 as he rushed to perform CPR. Through a new app called PulsePoint, that call sent an alert to the cell phone of all trained medics in the area - at the time, 41 of them.  One rushed to provide backup.  Five days later, DeMont was walking, smiling, laughing, and talking about how PulsePoint saved his life.   Stephen DeMont (center) embraces cardiac nurse Madeline Dahl next to medical student Zach Forcade - the two medics who saved his life after he fell into cardiac arrest last week Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help.  It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. 'I put it on my phone yesterday,' said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. 'He would not be here as we see him today.' Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing.  The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system.  When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department.  As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant.  'The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,' Price said. 'The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.' It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. DeMont said he has always been skeptical about technology - but this app saved his life It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it.  Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over.  He would not be here as we see him today [without this app] Debi Quirk, DeMont's wife and a former registered nurse 'I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before,' Forcade said. 'I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'' He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky.  A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — 'You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected' — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. 'There's hope,' DeMont said. He's due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 103 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

Bassett, now a security consultant, with a 20-year career with GCHQ, spoke about US attempts to employ thousands of robots in a matter of years as it tries to stay ahead of the curve, the Express reported. In March, DARPA beefed up the US underwater warfare capabilities with an autonomous state-of-the-art drone ship designed for things like hunting down enemy submarines. Read more US prepares to hunt enemy submarines with giant sea drone (VIDEO) In the same vein, Boeing in May launched an unmanned submarine that would engage in both exploratory missions and warfare. And the trend of a crewless ship isn’t even strictly a military one anymore: Rolls Royce in June announced plans for “ghost ships” that would carry cargo and be implemented specifically in trade. “Intelligent robotic weapons – they’re a reality, and they will be much more of a reality by 2030,” Bassett said. “At some point around 2025 or thereabouts the US Army will actually have more combat robots than it will have human soldiers,” he added, mentioning upcoming robot trucks that would drive themselves and be more effective on the road than an ordinary manned vehicle. “But some of them are rather more exciting than trucks. So we will see in the West combat robots outnumbering human soldiers,” Basset continued. It remains to be seen, but if the current submarine-hunting ship is indeed as good at tracking down enemy vessels, some major money could be saved and loss of life avoided. READ MORE: Rolls Royce plans crewless ‘ghost ships’ for maritime trade (VIDEO) Basset also recounted progress made in the sphere of AI, professing that “artificial intelligence, robotics in general, those will begin to mesh together.” Transhumanists have been particularly vocal about the benefits of employing robot help, among them US presidential hopeful Zoltan Istvan – also a journalist and transhumanist philosopher and futurist. He believes they’ll be fit for combat duties in the next 10 years, and bets “there won’t be any deaths of US soldiers in war zones” by then. “There will still probably be special forces, but even they are going to have to be replaced at some point,” he told the Express earlier in October. However, Istvan is wary of fusing combat robots with AI, as are many of today’s thinkers. He believes “machines controlling machines” opens up the potential for an uprising. This is not too unlike what Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has been saying. Along with Tesla and SpaceX’s Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and other luminaries, they also believe a global AI arms race is underway. All claim that technology has become too advanced for humans to control – particularly the robots’ ability to learn.

Jaime Green File photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Seven months after Emerald Aerospace announced its opening, it has pulled back its local operations, including leaving 200,000 square feet of hangar and other space at Air Capital Flight Line. Larry Pope, Emerald senior adviser, wouldn’t provide many details on what exactly has happened at the company but said it has scaled back its operations in Wichita. “We do have a core group remaining in Wichita,” Pope said Thursday. Pope declined to say how many people remain with the company or whether any employees were let go. “We’re not going to comment on personnel matters,” he said. “At this time we have scaled back operations in Wichita.” In April, Emerald announced its opening at Air Capital Flight Line in part of the former Boeing Wichita Modification Center. It said it had 26 employees, many of whom were former Boeing Wichita modification workers. The company aimed at using the former Boeing aircraft hangars at 4174 S. Oliver to do completions and modifications of special mission and VIP aircraft, aircraft acquisitions management and program management. The modifications would include aircraft up to the size of Boeing 747 jumbo jets. Pope said Emerald remains in business and is “in the process of establishing other operations,” but he wouldn’t say where those other operations would be. The space Emerald occupied on South Oliver included two hangars large enough to house four Boeing 747s.

By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio October 20, 2016 Topics The Global Business Brief Air Force Industry AA Font size + Print Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio October 20, 2016 Uncertain times lie ahead for American fighter jet manufacturing. As three…let’s call them heritage…aircraft enter the final years of production, factory jobs are at stake — but more fundamentally, so is the know-how to design and construct such sophisticated machines. Recent events have given Boeing and Lockheed Martin assembly lines a bit more life, such as the U.S. decision to allow Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar to buy new F-16 Falcons, F/A-18 Super Hornets, and F-15E Strike Eagles, respectively. And new planes aside, there’s still money to be made from the large fleets that will fly for the U.S. military and others for decades to come. Then there are the opportunities created when countries that fly perfectly good F-16s decide to get rid of them. Some are trading up to the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter; others are shrinking their air operations amid tight budgets. Earlier this month, for example, Romania received six used Falcons from Portugal, a deal that promises new support contracts for Lockheed and related suppliers. I asked a State Department official about the potential for more such sales. Most Eastern European militaries have old Soviet warplanes, like the MiG-21s of Bulgaria and Slovenia, or no fighters at all, like Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. They are barely suited to protect their borders, let alone deploy, say, to strike Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. It’s why the U.S. Air Force and NATO need to fly the air policing missions there, intercepting the Russian jets that approach or even cross over borders.

Now Romania — which happens to be hosting a U.S. military transit hub and a NATO missile defense radar — is getting a half-dozen 4th-gen combat jets and has plans to build that up to an even dozen. As the State official put it, “These countries are joining the elite nations that fly F-16s.” That means Bucharest could help out with air policing in Eastern Europe and deepen its military relations with other NATO members through training and wargames. Across Eastern Europe, where many countries don’t have large or modern air forces, a third-party transfer — like Portugal’s divesting its F-16s to Romania — could help strengthen their militaries, the State official said. (FYI: The State Department must approve the transfer of U.S.-built military aircraft, even between NATO allies.) The Portugal-Romania deal took three years from start to finish. Lockheed and its predecessor General Dynamics have built more than 4,500 F-16s since the 1970s. Iraq is one on the only countries still buying new one, but many even decades-old Falcons are still more than flyable. Plenty of companies, in addition to Lockheed, offer upgrades and modifications to bring the older jets into the modern age. Romanian also flies second-hand American C-130 cargo planes, which it received in similar fashion to the F-16s. In 2005, The Netherlands sold some of its F-16s to to Jordan. Now the Netherlands is looking to divest more F-16s to make room for its new F-35s. For several years now, U.S. officials have been urging Eastern Europeans to swap their Soviet and Russian arms for American equipment. This would help them train with U.S. forces and seamlessly fight alongside the American military in battle. Poland is the poster child, having purchased 48 F-16s. And Polish sources have said they want more. Helping Out in Iraq With Iraqi forces advancing on Mosul, we thought we’d check in on the number of contractors supporting U.S. operations there — and it’s way up. Since the beginning of the year, the number has jumped 48 percent, according to the latest U.S. Central Command data. As of Oct. 1, there were 2,992 contractors involved in the effort, up from 1,403 last October. About one-third of those workers are supporting logistics and maintenance for American troops there. The second-largest grouping (15 percent) of contractors are supporting American bases, while 14 percent are working as interpreters. About 239, 8 percent, are working in security roles. Those 2,992 are supporting more than 4,400 American troops in Iraq, with 500 more are on the way to train and advise Iraqi security forces. And they are just the ones hired by the Pentagon. Overall, the U.S. government has about 7,700 contractors supporting it in Iraq. Welcome! You’ve reached Defense One’s Global Business Brief.

What Turkey-Russia Relations Mean for Defense The recent warming of ties between Russian and Turkish presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan could affect U.S. arms sales to Ankara, which is both a major buyer and supplier of American weapons and their components. In a note to investors, Cowen analyst Roman Schweizer wrote, “Turkey is an important customer of high-end U.S. weapon systems and a closer alignment with Russia could provoke the U.S. to rethink its FMS policy.” It’s part of a continuing story; back in Vol. 1, Issue 1, of the Global Business Brief, we told you how unrest in Turkey could affect the supply chains of major Pentagon projects, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Boeing Opens New Composite Factory Even as Boeing winds down fighter jet production in St. Louis, the company is planning a $300 million composite factory there for its commercial airplanes business. In a statement, Boeing said it’s part of an effort to “diversify and grow its St. Louis-area operations.”  The 424,000-square-foot factory and its 700 workers will build composite parts for the wings and empennage of new 777X jetliner.

Zurbano AIRPORT officials on Thursday urged the public to be wary of bomb pranks and warned that pranksters faced jail. Their appeal came following a bomb scare from a Philippine Airlines aircraft from the United States a few minutes before it landed in Manila early Thursday morning. Someone from PAL flight PR103 had called to say there was a bomb on the plane, a Boeing B777-300 from Los Angeles with 333 passengers and 18 crew on board. The plane landed safely, but the responding policemen found no bomb after escorting its passengers to safety. Airport officials said while the plane was approaching the airport, a flight attendant who was inspecting one of the plane’s lavatories discovered a handwritten note saying there was a bomb on board.  The attendant immediately informed Captain Lawana Nakar about the note. He then called PAL station control in Manila and requested priority to land. It wasn’t clear if one of the passengers put the note on the lavatory. Last month a 34-year-old air cargo employee was arrested for joking he was carrying a bomb in his car. And in 2007 actor John Estrada was briefly held at the airport in General Santos City for joking  he was carrying a bomb in his bag.

X Norwegian Air to accelerate capacity growth in 2017 Airline to expand low-cost flights to US and other long-haul destinations Thu, Oct 20, 2016, 11:13 Norwegian’s third-quarter net profit was a record 992 million Norwegian crowns (€110 million), 19 per cent above last year’s figure. Photograph: Bloomberg         Budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle said its capacity growth will speed up in 2017 as it rapidly expands low-cost flights to the United States and other long-haul destinations. Europe’s third-largest low-cost carrier by revenue after Ryanair and EasyJet reported record third-quarter earnings, beating market expectations with a 20 per cent rise in net profit. The airline said its capacity growth, measured by available seat kilometres (ASK), would be 30 per cent next year, up from 18 per cent in 2016. ASK measures an airline’s passenger-carrying capacity. Norwegian will have 32 new aircraft, including nine fuel-efficient Boeing Dreamliners, entering operation next year, bringing its total fleet to 144 by the end of 2017. “The overall development is good in all markets, and the biggest growth is in Spain, particularly on domestic routes. The routes between London and Paris and the US are in high demand,” chief executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement. Norwegian has launched flights to the Middle East, southeast Asia and the United States, as well as expanding routes in its core European market, taking its low-cost offer into the long-haul market. It has even offered an eye-catching promise of $69 fares to cross the Atlantic. Brexit Unlike many of its European peers, Norwegian has been spared a negative impact from Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union. “We are monitoring the post-Brexit situation in the UK and don’t see any effects in bookings so far,” chief financial officer Frode Foss told a news conference. Germany’s Lufthansa lifted its 2016 profit target late on Wednesday, after business bookings proved stronger than expected in September, sending the share up by some 7.7 per cent by 7.50am Irish time. Earlier this week Ryanair cut its annual profit forecast however due to a weaker pound. EasyJet, which depends on Britain for about half of sales, has already cut its profit forecast by a quarter for the year following the Brexit vote. ADVERTISEMENT Competition remains fierce and Ryanair said it expected to boost its market share in the coming months by selling more tickets at cheaper prices. Shares in Norwegian jumped more than 5 per cent on Thursday but are still down about 8 per cent so far this year, outperforming Ryanair and EasyJet, which are down 16 and 46 per cent respectively. “The report was clearly above expectations, booking remains good and cost performance solid,” SEB analyst Kenneth Sivertsen said in a note to clients, adding that 2017 earnings estimates could rise by 5-10 per cent. SEB has a “buy” rating on the stock. Norwegian’s third-quarter net profit was its best quarterly result ever, and came in at 992 million Norwegian crowns (€110 million), 19 per cent above last year, beating expectations for 943 million crowns in a Reuters poll. Its unit cost is still seen at 0.38 crowns this year, while unit costs next year were targeted at 0.38-0.39 crowns. – (Reuters)       Topics: European Union Norwegian Air Ryanair Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Golf Rory McIlroy focusing on Major improvement in 2017 Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

The plane, a Boeing B777-300, was combed for explosives by the Police Aviation Security Group (Avsegroup) but no bomb was found. A source from PAL at NAIA Terminal 2 said a flight attendant discovered a handwritten bomb threat while inspecting one of the plane’s lavatories. On a paper cup was written, “Bomb was placed in the cargo and at seat 64E.” The flight attendant informed Capt. Lawana Nakar about the note. Nakar called PAL station control in Manila, requesting priority landing. “There is no bomb in the cargo compartment of Flight PR103 and even at seat number 64E,” according to an Avsegroup personnel. Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Ed Monreal appealed to international and domestic passengers to refrain from making bomb jokes because it can cause panic among passengers. Any person cracking a bomb joke or such act that poses grave and positive danger to public safety is a violation of Presidential Decree 1727 or the Anti-Bomb Joke Law. Authorities suspected that a passenger may have made the bomb threat as a joke. Share. Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Email loading...

Downes Jr. Memorial Award. By receiving the 2016 prize, Miller joins the company of Gen. Jimmy Doolittle, for International Aviation and Aircraft Noise Abatement Policy; Sir Frank Whittle, inventor of the jet engine; Elrey Jeppesen, developer of the Jeppesen navigation charts; T. Wilson, chairman of The Boeing Co. for more than 40 years, and Col. Frank Borman, former astronaut and former head of Eastern Airlines. Miller was appointed director of Salt Lake City's airport in 1983 under then-Mayor Ted Wilson. After years overseeing the airport's elevation to a major hub and destination of several direct international flights, Miller moved to Tampa, Fla., as that city's airport director, and later oversaw Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International, the nation's busiest airport. VIDEOS TOP JOBS He is retired and living back in Salt Lake City. — • Operation Give, directed by retired Chief Warrant Officer Paul Holton, also known as "Chief Wiggles," began its 2016 charity drive earlier this month when volunteers met at Flat Rate Doctors in Pleasant Grove to stuff 25,000 stockings with gifts. The stockings will be delivered to deployed military members. This marks the 12th year of delivering a little Christmas joy to those away from their friends and families. Operation Give began when Holton, a member of the Utah Army National Guard, was on active duty in Iraq in 2003. He began to send back emails, detailing his time and activities, to a friend in Salt Lake City, who then created a blog so that others could read Holton's journal. Holton's family and friends started sending him packages with items to make life in the desert summers more bearable. He shared the gifts with other GIs. Upon his return to Utah, he launched the program to send stuffed holiday stockings to soldiers abroad. — • Ray Wheeler has been a tireless advocate for cleaning up the Jordan River on Salt Lake City's west side. He has gone on hundreds of trash-collecting expeditions in his kayak and works with government officials to teach them about cleaning up the river and the adjoining open space for wildlife habitat. He is organizing regular cleanup drives with neighbors — both by foot and kayak — and he has volunteered hundreds of hours to beautifying the waterway. As a result, he recently was awarded a 2016 Good Neighbor Award by "Nextdoor," a private online social network. — • Salt Lake Tribune intern Zoe Woolf McGinn was driving from Orem to Salt Lake City recently when she became worried that a tire was low on air, so she stopped at a 7-Eleven near Orem to fill it up. She was struggling with the hose when Austin Westmoreland, a Utah Valley University police officer who was off-duty but working as a security guard at a nearby Check City, asked if he could help. He hopped into his car and had her follow him to a Discount Tire, where all of her tires were filled with air. He said she should be able to get home, but if she stopped on the way at the Discount Tire in Lindon and told them his name, the shop would fix the leak for free. — » Next page...

(Photo: Elaine Thompson / AP) Seattle — If your heart is going to stop, right outside a hospital is not a bad place for it. And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That’s what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It’s being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. “I put it on my phone yesterday,” said DeMont’s wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. “He would not be here as we see him today.” Seattle officials hope DeMont’s story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city’s 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. “The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,” Price said. “The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.” It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It’s not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient’s outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she’d ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. “I hadn’t responded to a cardiac arrest before,” Forcade said. “I thought, ‘Did he just fall?’ … Even being in the medical field, I thought, ‘Oh, man, who’s going to step up?’” He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — “You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected” — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. “There’s hope,” DeMont said. He’s due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe. CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wall Street is talking up U.S. defense stocks no matter who wins the presidential election in November. “After five years of austerity in the defense budget, we expect defense spending to increase regardless of whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump wins the presidency,” Dan Clifton, a policy strategist at Strategas Research Partners, told clients in a research note Wednesday. But a Trump win would boost defense spending even more, he adds. If Clinton wins, Boeing shares should benefit from the Democrat likely reinstating the Export-Import Bank, which supplies credit to foreign buyers of U.S. goods. If Trump wins, a broad swath of defense companies will gain favor, including Lockheed-Martin, a maker of combat aircraft and missile defense systems, General Dynamics, which makes combat vehicles, and Textron, which makes unmanned aircraft systems and surveillance systems. Joe Quinlan, head of market and thematic strategy for Bank of America Global Wealth & Investment Management and U.S. Trust, is also bullish on defense stocks. “Geopolitical uncertainty will remain the order of the day over the near term,” he wrote in an essay. “Given this environment, and on the expectation that U.S. defense spending is bound to increase under either presidential candidate, we reiterate one of our high-conviction investment themes of being long U.S. defense companies.” Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eUnYwB

X Norwegian Air to accelerate capacity growth in 2017 Airline to expand low-cost flights to US and other long-haul destinations Thu, Oct 20, 2016, 11:13 Norwegian’s third-quarter net profit was a record 992 million Norwegian crowns (€110 million), 19 per cent above last year’s figure. Photograph: Bloomberg         Budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle said its capacity growth will speed up in 2017 as it rapidly expands low-cost flights to the United States and other long-haul destinations. Europe’s third-largest low-cost carrier by revenue after Ryanair and EasyJet reported record third-quarter earnings, beating market expectations with a 20 per cent rise in net profit. The airline said its capacity growth, measured by available seat kilometres (ASK), would be 30 per cent next year, up from 18 per cent in 2016. ASK measures an airline’s passenger-carrying capacity. Norwegian will have 32 new aircraft, including nine fuel-efficient Boeing Dreamliners, entering operation next year, bringing its total fleet to 144 by the end of 2017. “The overall development is good in all markets, and the biggest growth is in Spain, particularly on domestic routes. The routes between London and Paris and the US are in high demand,” chief executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement. Norwegian has launched flights to the Middle East, southeast Asia and the United States, as well as expanding routes in its core European market, taking its low-cost offer into the long-haul market. It has even offered an eye-catching promise of $69 fares to cross the Atlantic. Brexit Unlike many of its European peers, Norwegian has been spared a negative impact from Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union. “We are monitoring the post-Brexit situation in the UK and don’t see any effects in bookings so far,” chief financial officer Frode Foss told a news conference. Germany’s Lufthansa lifted its 2016 profit target late on Wednesday, after business bookings proved stronger than expected in September, sending the share up by some 7.7 per cent by 7.50am Irish time. Earlier this week Ryanair cut its annual profit forecast however due to a weaker pound. EasyJet, which depends on Britain for about half of sales, has already cut its profit forecast by a quarter for the year following the Brexit vote. ADVERTISEMENT Competition remains fierce and Ryanair said it expected to boost its market share in the coming months by selling more tickets at cheaper prices. Shares in Norwegian jumped more than 5 per cent on Thursday but are still down about 8 per cent so far this year, outperforming Ryanair and EasyJet, which are down 16 and 46 per cent respectively. “The report was clearly above expectations, booking remains good and cost performance solid,” SEB analyst Kenneth Sivertsen said in a note to clients, adding that 2017 earnings estimates could rise by 5-10 per cent. SEB has a “buy” rating on the stock. Norwegian’s third-quarter net profit was its best quarterly result ever, and came in at 992 million Norwegian crowns (€110 million), 19 per cent above last year, beating expectations for 943 million crowns in a Reuters poll. Its unit cost is still seen at 0.38 crowns this year, while unit costs next year were targeted at 0.38-0.39 crowns. – (Reuters)       Topics: European Union Norwegian Air Ryanair Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Golf Rory McIlroy focusing on Major improvement in 2017 Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Industrials | Thu Oct 20, 2016 | 5:15am EDT RPT-UPDATE 2-Norwegian Air sees faster 2017 capacity growth after record Q3 earnings (Repeats to add link to story on European airlines) * Q3 is best quarterly result ever * Shares jump more than 5 pct * Sees 30 pct 2017 capacity growth, up from 18 pct in 2016 * No impact on bookings from Brexit vote By Joachim Dagenborg OSLO, Oct 20 Budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle said its capacity growth will speed up in 2017 as it rapidly expands low-cost flights to the United States and other long-haul destinations. Europe's third-largest low-cost carrier by revenue after Ryanair and easyJet reported record third-quarter earnings, beating market expectations with a 20 percent rise in net profit. The airline said its capacity growth, measured by available seat kilometres (ASK), would be 30 percent next year, up from 18 percent in 2016. ASK measures an airline's passenger-carrying capacity. Norwegian will have 32 new aircraft, including nine fuel-efficient Dreamliners, from Boeing Co entering operation next year, bringing its total fleet to 144 by end-2017. "The overall development is good in all markets, and the biggest growth is in Spain, particularly on domestic routes. The routes between London and Paris and the U.S. are in high demand," Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement. Norwegian has launched flights to the Middle East, southeast Asia and the United States, as well as expanding routes in its core European market, taking its low-cost offer into the long-haul market. It has even offered an eye-catching promise of $69 fares to cross the Atlantic. Unlike many of its European peers, Norwegian has been spared a negative impact from Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union. "We are monitoring the post-Brexit situation in the UK and don't see any effects in bookings so far," Chief Financial Officer Frode Foss told a news conference. Germany's Lufthansa lifted its 2016 profit target late on Wednesday, after business bookings proved stronger than expected in September, sending the share up by some 7.7 percent by 0750 GMT. Earlier this week Ryanair cut its annual profit forecast however due to a weaker pound. EasyJet, which depends on Britain for around half of sales, has already cut its profit forecast by a quarter for the year following the Brexit vote. Competition remains fierce and Ryanair said it expected to boost its market share in the coming months by selling more tickets at cheaper prices. Shares in Norwegian jumped more than 5 percent on Thursday but are still down around eight percent so far this year, outperforming Ryanair and easyJet, which are down 16 and 46 percent respectively. "The report was clearly above expectations, booking remains good and cost performance solid," SEB analyst Kenneth Sivertsen said in a note to clients, adding that 2017 earnings estimates could rise by 5-10 percent. SEB has a "buy" rating on the stock. Norwegian's third-quarter net profit was its best quarterly result ever, and came in at 992 million Norwegian crowns ($121.83 million), 19 percent above last year, beating expectations for 943 million crowns in a Reuters poll. Its unit cost (CASK) is still seen at 0.38 crowns this year, while unit costs next year were targeted at 0.38-0.39 crowns.

The shares traded down 19.4 percent at 165 pence ($2.02) as of 9:37 a.m. in London after falling as much as 21 percent. Adjusted pretax profit in the first nine months of the year decreased by 18 percent to 58.5 million pounds, the Rickmansworth, England-based company said Thursday. Senior, which had been relying on its aerospace division to offset the rapid drop-off in sales of trucks to oil and gas companies, said a slower-than-expected ramp-up in production of Airbus A320neo and A350 aircraft as well as Bombardier Inc.’s C Series jet had hurt revenues. The division is also battling “supplier issues” in the U.S. and U.K., which it said it aims to resolve by the end of the year, while price negotiations with customers are still in progress. The profit downgrade is the latest in a string for Senior since the collapse in oil prices in 2014 started eating into sales of heavy trucks in North America, with the outlook for the business deteriorating again in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Senior said it is shifting production to more “cost-competitive countries,” including Mexico and India. “Senior’s end markets remain challenging and expectations for a meaningful improvement in the second half were, in hindsight, optimistic,” Investec analyst Rami Myerson said in a note to clients.

And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That's what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift at the hospital was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. "I put it on my phone yesterday," said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. "He would not be here as we see him today." Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. "The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall," Price said. "The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference." It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. "I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before," Forcade said. "I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'" He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — "You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected" — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. "There's hope," DeMont said. He's due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe. ___ Follow Johnson at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle ___ This story has been corrected to say man was in cardiac arrest instead of having heart attack, and to say that about 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond,       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *     Related Topics   business Seattle The Canadian Press         Business Videos         Most Popular canada.com E-mailed Shared     Sponsored By           FP Business Wire »   FP Business Wire   Royal Gold Increases Common Stock Dividend 4.4% to $0.96 per Share Cintas Recognized as an Aon Best Employer in Canada for the 9th Time SCOREART.COM Launches Exclusive Wall Art to Celebrate the Chicago Cubs Victory           News Business Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Health Travel Technology Don't Miss: Happening Now Video Centre Live chats Blogs on canada.com canada.com on Facebook Most Popular Formats Sitemap / RSS Contests Blogs Photo Galleries Videos Canada.com About Us Contact Us Advertise with Us FAQs Tools Canada.com Search for a Job Buy / Sell a Car Infomart Place a Classified Ad Newsletters and Alerts My Account Flyercity.ca About canada.com | Privacy Statement | Terms | Copyright & Permissions © 2010-2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Industrials | Thu Oct 20, 2016 | 5:00am EDT UPDATE 2-Norwegian Air sees faster 2017 capacity growth after record Q3 earnings * Q3 is best quarterly result ever * Shares jump more than 5 pct * Sees 30 pct 2017 capacity growth, up from 18 pct in 2016 * No impact on bookings from Brexit vote (Adds analyst, CFO, Brexit, shares, background) By Joachim Dagenborg OSLO, Oct 20 Budget airline Norwegian Air Shuttle said its capacity growth will speed up in 2017 as it rapidly expands low-cost flights to the United States and other long-haul destinations. Europe's third-largest low-cost carrier by revenue after Ryanair and easyJet reported record third-quarter earnings, beating market expectations with a 20 percent rise in net profit. The airline said its capacity growth, measured by available seat kilometres (ASK), would be 30 percent next year, up from 18 percent in 2016. ASK measures an airline's passenger-carrying capacity. Norwegian will have 32 new aircraft, including nine fuel-efficient Dreamliners, from Boeing Co entering operation next year, bringing its total fleet to 144 by end-2017. "The overall development is good in all markets, and the biggest growth is in Spain, particularly on domestic routes. The routes between London and Paris and the U.S. are in high demand," Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos said in a statement. Norwegian has launched flights to the Middle East, southeast Asia and the United States, as well as expanding routes in its core European market, taking its low-cost offer into the long-haul market. It has even offered an eye-catching promise of $69 fares to cross the Atlantic. Unlike many of its European peers, Norwegian has been spared a negative impact from Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union. "We are monitoring the post-Brexit situation in the UK and don't see any effects in bookings so far," Chief Financial Officer Frode Foss told a news conference. Germany's Lufthansa lifted its 2016 profit target late on Wednesday, after business bookings proved stronger than expected in September, sending the share up by some 7.7 percent by 0750 GMT. Earlier this week Ryanair cut its annual profit forecast however due to a weaker pound. EasyJet, which depends on Britain for around half of sales, has already cut its profit forecast by a quarter for the year following the Brexit vote. Competition remains fierce and Ryanair said it expected to boost its market share in the coming months by selling more tickets at cheaper prices. Shares in Norwegian jumped more than 5 percent on Thursday but are still down around eight percent so far this year, outperforming Ryanair and easyJet, which are down 16 and 46 percent respectively. "The report was clearly above expectations, booking remains good and cost performance solid," SEB analyst Kenneth Sivertsen said in a note to clients, adding that 2017 earnings estimates could rise by 5-10 percent. SEB has a "buy" rating on the stock. Norwegian's third-quarter net profit was its best quarterly result ever, and came in at 992 million Norwegian crowns ($121.83 million), 19 percent above last year, beating expectations for 943 million crowns in a Reuters poll. Its unit cost (CASK) is still seen at 0.38 crowns this year, while unit costs next year were targeted at 0.38-0.39 crowns.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai Donald Trump sparks storm by vowing Election Day 'suspense' Michael Mathes AFPOctober 20, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share View photos Donald Trump speaks during the final presidential debate, in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 19, 2016 (AFP Photo/Saul Loeb)More Las Vegas (AFP) - Donald Trump sailed into another political tempest Thursday after threatening not to recognize the outcome of the US presidential election in a final debate with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner. With the November 8 elections just 19 days away, the face-off in Las Vegas was seen as the Republican nominee's last best chance to turn around a sinking White House bid. But with millions watching on television, a defiant Trump turned what many thought began as his strongest debate performance yet into a gift to Clinton and another major headache for Republicans. Asked point-blank whether he would accept the results of the elections no matter what, the 70-year-old reality television star said: "I'll tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense, OK?" Clinton declared herself "appalled" by what she said was an attack on 240 years of US democracy. Quoting her former rival Bernie Sanders, she called Trump the "most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America." Trump's shattering of political convention dominated US newspaper headlines and television coverage. - Worried Republicans - Republicans worried about the impact of Trump's remarks on Republicans in down-ballot races. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, offered assurances on MSNBC. "Barring massive voter fraud, of course he is going to accept the results of the elections," he said. But Republican Senator Jeff Flake said Trump was "beyond the pale" and onetime presidential candidate Senator Lindsey Graham said if Trump loses, it will be "because he failed as a candidate". Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, defended the candidate Thursday against charges of undermining US democracy. "If anybody has added to American democracy in the last year and a half it's Donald Trump," she told CNN, while insisting her boss would respect the vote result "absent, widespread fraud or irregularities." Democrats called on Republican leaders to repudiate "Trump's utter contempt for our democracy," as Nevada Senator Harry Reid put it. "What he said tonight is part of his whole effort to blame somebody else for his campaign, and where he stands in this election," Clinton told reporters as she flew home to New York. Trump left Las Vegas immediately after the debate, heading to swing state Ohio for a day of campaigning. He meets up with Clinton again at the end of the day in New York at the Al Smith Dinner, an annual charity event where the candidates traditionally engage in a "friendly roast." But the animosity between them seems almost certain to get in the way. They would not even shake hands at Wednesday night's debate, and at one point Trump interrupted Clinton to call her "a nasty woman". - 'Relieved and very grateful' - Clinton, who is vying to become the first woman president of the United States, told reporters she was "both relieved and very grateful" that the debates were now behind her. Polls show her leading by more than six points and making gains even in states like Arizona, Texas and Georgia that have long been in the Republican column. "Hillary Clinton almost certainly will win the election, but the question is what is going to be the effect on Republican Senate, House and other candidates," said Robert Erikson, a political science professor at Columbia University. On Thursday, Michelle Obama will be stumping for Clinton in Arizona and President Barack Obama will speak at a rally in Miami. Obama earlier in the week told Trump to "stop whining" about a rigged election and go try to get people to vote for him. But the New York billionaire plowed ahead anyway, paying no heed. "The media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pile-on is so amazing," Trump said, referring to reports citing women accusing him of sexual assault, which he said were "fiction" and drummed up by Team Clinton. He alleged that millions of fake voters had been registered and that the 68-year-old Clinton should not even have been allowed to run because she mishandled classified State Department emails. - 'Puppet' talk - The former secretary of state scored an early hit against the Republican real estate mogul, alleging that Russian President Vladimir Putin was backing his run for office. Trump argued that he might have better relations with Moscow than Clinton would, declaring: "Putin, from everything I see, has no respect for this person." Clinton's response was sharp: "Well, that's because he would rather have a puppet as president of the United States." Trump blustered back: "No puppet. You're the puppet."

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (4) Seattle • If you're going to have a heart attack, right outside a hospital is not a bad place to do it. And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That's what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift at the hospital was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. "I put it on my phone yesterday," said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. "He would not be here as we see him today." Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. Some 34,000 off-duty professional and citizen responders around the country have downloaded it, Price said Wednesday, and they've been alerted to more than 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. "The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall," Price said. "The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference." It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. "I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before," Forcade said. "I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'" He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. » Next page...

The Federal Reserve meeting Nov. 1-2 and of course the presidential election the following week are giving investors additional dynamics to consider along with the seasonal gauging of financial performances at some of the world’s largest corporations. Most traders expect no interest rate hike by the Fed in November but are leaning toward a move in December, are attempting to make sense of a chaotic election and trying to figure out how businesses are navigating the current political and economic environments. Many companies have decided to show extreme caution in their guidance to The Street as only 21 S&P 500 corporations issued financial outlooks in September to show a record low for any month since 2000, per the Wall Street Journal. Against that backdrop, third quarter financial season for government contractors including those in our GovCon Index started this week with reports from S&P 500 firms Textron and Honeywell. Textron’s stock spiked 3 percent Thursday after the aircraft maker reported year-over-year earnings and revenue increases for the July-September period, while Honeywell shares added three-quarter a percent Friday as of midday on mixed results with some growth-oriented guidance. Next week is the traditional primetime week for the large GovCon primes as Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and L-3 Communications will all disclose third quarter results and speak with analysts to discuss defense market conditions and outlooks. DigitalGlobe will also detail its financial picture to investors nearly two weeks after the satellite imagery giant announced the $140 million acquisition of The Radiant Group. This season figures to more than just about dollars and cents for GovCon firms and investors as the defense spending and post-election environments all contribute to a very murky picture.

Fuller Photo courtesy of Sikorsky Sikorsky is slated to donate its X2 high-speed demonstrator to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in ceremonies Oct. 27, R&WI has learned. The aircraft is to go on public display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, after the private ceremonies hosted by the Lockheed Martin unit.  Sikorsky began work on the compound, coaxial-rotor helicopter a decade ago with internal research and development funds to demonstrate the design could fly at roughly twice the operational speed of a conventional helicopter. Hence the X2 designator. The X2 first flew on Aug. 27, 2009, with Sikorsky Chief Test Pilot Kevin Bredenbeck at the controls. Sikorsky achieved its main design goal a bit more than two years later, when Bredenbeck took the X2 to 250 kt in level flight on Sept. 15, 2010. The aircraft was retired in July 2011 after 23 flights as the company turned its attention to developing the high-speed S-97 military demonstrator based on X2 technology. Sikorsky’s X2 work contributed to the U.S. Army’s decision to pursue development of a family of high-speed military rotorcraft and the Pentagon’s follow-on Future Vertical Lift program. Sikorsky is teamed with Boeing on the SB>1 Defiant contender for that program; the Defiant also draws on X2 research.  X2 Technology was awarded the National Aeronautic Assn. (NAA) Robert J. Collier Trophy in 2010 on the award’s 100th birthday. It beat out other nominees, like Boeing, with its unmatched speed, its maneuverability and its utility. In addition to its rigid, counter-rotating main rotor blades, the X2 features an integrated auxiliary propulsion, active vibration control and fly-by-wire controls.

(Photo by Leonard Ortiz, Orange County Register/SCNG) By DEEPA BHARATH / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Historical background A victorious Soviet Union succeeded in forcing its political, social and economic system on much of Eastern Europe including Hungary soon after World War II. But the Hungarians never reconciled themselves to Soviet hegemony and rebelled against them and their Hungarian allies in 1956. Initially, the freedom fighters with their small arms and petrol bombs seemed to push the Soviet tanks to withdraw. But, on Nov. 4, 1956, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. The revolution was eventually crushed and brought to power Janos Kadar, who attempted to institute a milder form of communist rule. Communism fell in Hungary in 1989. Source: Orange County Hungarians The date was Oct. 23, 1956. It was close to 9 p.m. Tens of thousands of people – many of them college students – marched upon the Radio Budapest building to broadcast their demands to the communist government dominated by the Soviets. Topping the list was their demand for the Soviets to leave Hungary ... and take their tanks with them. Laguna Beach resident Elizabeth Varo Rozsnyai’s husband, Zoltan, was in that crowd, which was angered and roused to a frenzy by Hungarian Communist Party leader Erno Gero’s cold dismissal of their demands. “The situation escalated and that was when we heard the first machine gun firing ... rat-a-tat-tat,” Rozsnyai, now 89, recalled. “The Hungarian Revolution had begun.” Zoltan Rozsnyai, a young orchestra conductor at the time, made it home. Days later, after the revolution ended, he escaped with his wife and 3-year-old daughter to Vienna to escape capture and imprisonment. There, he formed the Philharmonia Hungaric, an orchestra consisting of Hungarian refugee musicians. The family moved to San Diego in 1967 when Rozsnyai became the music director of the San Diego Symphony. Like Rozsnyai, for many Hungarian families that settled in Orange County and around Southern California, the 60th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution being observed Sunday, brings back memories of the uprising and fleeing their country with little but the clothes on their backs. More than 200,000 Hungarians were forced to risk the dangerous crossing of barbed wire border fences and mines to flee to Austria and what was Yugoslavia. At least 3,000 people, hailed as martyrs by the Hungarians, were killed as they stood up to the Soviet Army. Following the revolution – which is believed to have weakened the position of the Soviets in Europe – thousands of Hungarians were arrested, with 13,000 imprisoned and hundreds executed. The age limit for the death penalty was reduced at the time to 16. For Hungarians, the sacrifices made for the sake of democracy during the revolution are among the most glorious chapters of their national history. The Orange County families that came to the U.S. as refugees are remembering the heroes who stood up for their homeland and fought for what they believed in, said Judith Kastely-Ruzicska, co-director of Orange County Hungarians. “When you talk about expat communities in Orange County, Hungarians are not even mentioned,” she said. “That’s because we look like natives, we learned the language and we assimilated.” But thousands of Hungarians live in the area and many of the older families, like Rozsnyai’s, came here as political asylum seekers soon after the 1956 revolt, Kastely-Ruzicska said. There is no data available for the exact number of Hungarians in Orange County, she said. Louis Boyer, 81, of San Clemente, lived through the 19 days of the revolution as an ambulance driver for a military hospital in Budapest. He drove doctors and nurses and picked up fighters and innocent civilians who had been shot and wounded. “I remember this one particular incident where families had lined up outside a bakery for bread,” he said, adding that food was scarce at the time. “That was when (the Soviets) fired at them. There were women in that line holding little children. That stuck with me for a long time.” Boyer also remembers getting shot at ... a lot. “Bullets whizzed past my shoulders and ears as I was driving,” he said. “I hated it. But I never fired a gun.” Boyer, a retired Boeing engineer, still recoils at the mention of guns. He would drive around mostly at night because there was less shooting after dark. He would be told to leave those who were dead on the street and pick up only those who were “still moving.” Boyer also remembers anguished parents coming to the hospital looking for their children among the wounded. “When you heard that gut-wrenching scream, you knew that a parent had found their child,” he said. “It was heartbreaking to watch.” He saw the bloodied faces and bodies of the wounded in his nightmares for a while. And then, with time, they faded away. Boyer was decorated for bravery during the revolution and for assisting the wounded. He fled a month after the revolt with a couple of his friends to Austria and moved to the U.S. shortly afterward. The Hungarian refugees from the time of the revolution “came here with a thankful heart,” said Tibor Farkas, 76, of Orange, a retired subsystems manager at Boeing, who started the website 56erhungariansinamerica.org to tell the stories of those who came to the U.S. after the revolt. Farkas said he even helped resettle Vietnamese refugees who escaped the communist regime in their homeland after the fall of Saigon. “I understood what they were going through,” he said. “They had been oppressed by communists just as we were.” Zsolt Bor, 67, of San Clemente, was just 7 during the revolution. “I remember collecting empty shells lying on the street and bringing them back home because they were so shiny,” he said. “My father was so angry. I was punished.” The revolution was short, “but its effect was big and was felt around Europe,” Farkas said. “The Soviet Union’s tyranny was not as strong as before and other countries in Europe understood the power of a people’s revolution.” This generation of Hungarians in Orange County seems to view the current refugee crisis differently. “We went through a long process to come to America,” Bor said, adding that they even had to prove that they were not Nazis. “It was a process that ensured that we would become productive citizens.” Also, there were few “cultural differences,” he said. “When you don’t assimilate, it’s not good,” Bor said. “It just creates more tension.” Contact the writer: 714-796-7909 or dbharath@ocregister.com Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Boeing to shift 1,600 Huntington Beach jobs to L.A.

About a third of S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple on Tuesday. Amazon.com and Google's parent Alphabet are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season. "If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards. In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday. Next week, "I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings," said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. "I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy." A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates. Correlation of S&P 500 vs. interest rates and EPS, last five years, in % Source: UBS, as of October 20, 2016. The average year-end S&P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market. "Next year's earnings look too high, and that might mean the market is a tad more expensive than it looks, but it's helpful that the third-quarter earnings [are beating so far]," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Global Asset Management, which has about $915 billion in assets under management. "We're still making our way out of this period where energy earnings look weak compared to where they were one year ago," Nick said. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its December meeting, but will watch data ahead of the central bank's meeting on Nov. 1 and 2. The Markit manufacturing and services PMI are scheduled for release next Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Three Fed speakers are set to speak Monday ahead of the blackout period heading into the Fed's meeting Nov. 1 and 2. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speaks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy Monday morning, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to speak on current economic conditions and monetary policy in the afternoon. Fed Governor Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day on the future of Treasury market settlement. The first read on U.S. gross domestic product is due next Friday, and the consensus estimate from Reuters is 2.5 percent. The final read on second-quarter GDP showed an annual rate of 1.4 percent growth. A print between 1.5 percent and 3 percent is "probably a number consistent with the Fed passing in November but hiking in December," said John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial. Other data scheduled for release next week include the Markit manufacturing and services PMI, the employment cost index, consumer sentiment and pending home sales. Overseas, the preliminary estimate on third-quarter U.K. GDP is due for release Thursday, the first full-quarter GDP data since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union. "Brexit negotiations [are] always on slow boil every week and next week is no different," Canally said. "A very weak number on the U.K.[GDP] may weaken Prime Minister May's hand temporarily." European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak Tuesday in Berlin on "Stability, Equity and Monetary Policy."

Finance Search Wed, Nov 16, 2016, 11:22 AM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 4 hrs 38 mins Bombardier to cut 7,500 more jobsAFP – Fri, Oct 21, 2016 9:17 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Canada's Bombardier said it was cutting around 7,500 jobs by the end of 2018 Canada's plane and train maker Bombardier said Friday it was cutting 7,500 jobs, its second major layoff announcement this year following delays in deliveries of its C-series airplanes. The job cuts, to be completed by the end of 2018, are expected to mostly hit administrative posts, with two-thirds from the transport division, a Bombardier spokesman said. These layoffs come on the heels of a February announcement to eliminate 7,000 manufacturing jobs. The two rounds of job cuts account for about 20 percent of Montreal-based Bombardier's workforce. Bombardier, which has taken on debt to finance its ambitious plane-building program, said the latest downsizing will result in annual savings of about $300 million as part of a five-year plan to turn the firm around. "The actions announced today will ensure we have the right cost structure, workforce and organization to compete and win in the future," said chief executive Alain Bellemare in a statement. Bombardier has been trying to accelerate production of the C Series, as well as to develop the new Global 7000 business jet, scheduled to begin production in 2018. The company announced plans to hire as many as 3,750 employees to speed these initiatives, according to Canadian media reports. Bellemare said the new jobs would be added in low-cost countries and more-established higher cost operations. "It's the only way that we can protect the thousands of jobs in the industry and at Bombardier. It's a very competitive industry and it's important to take the necessary steps to remain competitive in this context," he was quoted as saying Bombardier had touted the C Series, its first completely new aircraft in the 100- to 150-seat category in more than 25 years, as a means to cut into the dominance of US aerospace giant Boeing and European rival Airbus. But the project has been stymied by delays, with Bombardier announcing in September that it cut its 2016 forecast for deliveries of the plane from 15 to seven due to engine delivery delays from Pratt & Whitney. Costs for the C Series program have risen to $5.4 billion, Bombardier has estimated. The government of Quebec came to the rescue of Bombardier last year, investing $1.0 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in its C Series plane program. Bombardier has also sought support from federal officials in Canada, but no deal has been reached. The Canadian government remains interested in supporting the company if certain conditions are met, such as keeping the headquarters and other key operations in Montreal and a large presence in Canada. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Trump links off to good start: TurnbullAAP Malcolm Turnbull says Australia is getting off to a good start with US president-elect Donald Trump's team.

Emblazoned with a special "10,000th Airbus" logo, the plane will be used to launch the airline's new Singapore to San Francisco direct route later this month. The long-haul route's flying time will vary between 14 hours and 35 minutes, and an epic 17 hours and 45 minutes, depending on direction and winds. That will be the airline's longest route until it receives a new variant of the A350-900, the A350-900ULR (Ultra Long Range), which will allow it to resume direct flights from Singapore to New York. Once that occurs, Singapore Airlines will regain the title for the world's longest flight route. Emirates currently flies the world's longest route – Dubai to Auckland direct. The ULR version of the A350 will be able to fly for up to 19 hours non-stop. Singapore Airlines placed its first order with Airbus in 1979 and became the launch customer for the world's largest passenger aircraft, the A380 super jumbo, in 2005. The first route for that plane was from Singapore to Sydney. Despite initial success, demand for the A380 has waned in recent years as airlines move on to new aircraft made of lightweight materials that deliver savings on fuel, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the A350. The A350 uses a combination of materials, including plastic reinforced by carbon fibre, along with titanium and aluminium alloys. More than 70 per cent of the aircraft is made of lightweight materials. The first ever Airbus plane, the A300B2, was delivered to Air France in 1974. In the 1980s the company launched the hugely successful A320, its first single-aisle plane. Airbus is reportedly on track to deliver 650 aircraft this year but has a backlog of 6700 on order – a number it says it will take 10 years to deliver at current production rates.

The in-flight Wi-Fi market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 26.35% during 2015-2021. Asia-Pacific in-flight Wi-Fi market of the region is majorly boosted by the increasing number of air passengers. In the past 20 years, Asia Pacific region has witnessed an increase in the number of air passengers by over 6.5%. This trend of growth is anticipated to continue for the coming 10-12 years. Backed up by this trend, Asia Pacific is expected to account for 40.8% of the global air transport in comparison to that of 28% at present. In addition to that, rising penetration of smartphones and formulation of favorable guidelines by the aviation authorities from countries like India for the use of in-flight Wi-Fi services inside an aircraft would further bid to boost the airborne wireless connectivity market over the next few years. In August 2016. Aviation Ministry of India has given a green signal to launch in-flight wifi services in the country. Hence, a spur a expected by the launch of such services. The two major airline companies of the Asia-Pacific region i.e. Boeing and Airbus further anticipates that in order to satisfy the growing air passenger traffic, the demand for new aircrafts would soar from 12,520 to 15,010 aircrafts in the coming 20 years. This burgeoned increase in the total number of aircrafts would surely lead Asia-Pacific to achieve the fastest growth in the in-flight Wi-Fi market in the coming future. Key Topics Covered: 1.

In the Indian psyche, the F-16 remains strongly linked with Pakistan The contest to supply the Indian Air Force (IAF) a single-engine, medium fighter is currently playing out as a two-horse race. US giant, Lockheed Martin, is the Goliath looking to slay the David that is Swedish firm, Saab. Lockheed Martin, which has offered to shift its F-16 production line to India, is the world's biggest defence firm, with $46.1 billion in sales last year and an order backlog of almost $100 billion. Saab, which has offered its latest fighter, the Gripen E, appears a relative minnow, with $3 billion in sales last year, and an order book of $12.9 billion. Yet, Saab is an extraordinarily accomplished minnow. Visitors to the Swedish Air Force Museum near Saab's aerospace facility at Linkoping, two hours by train from Stockholm, encounter an aerospace tradition that has, since 1926, kept pace with the world's best. The museum displays the J-29 "Flying Barrel", the first "swept-wing" fighter after World War II; the Draken, Europe's first supersonic fighter, which pioneered the "double delta wing", and the Viggen, the first mainstream fighter to feature the canard - now common in high-performance fighters. India came close to buying the Viggen but Washington, which provided the engines, blocked the sale in 1978. The IAF bought the Anglo-French Jaguar instead, which still remains in service. As Saab's marketing team never tires of telling Indians, this excellence in defence production stemmed from Sweden's traditional strategic independence - similar to India's. After remaining neutral through World War II, Sweden declined to join NATO in 1949, choosing to cater for its own defence against Russia. Responsible for its own defence, Sweden leveraged an existing scientific and engineering culture to develop an advanced aerospace and defence industry. In the late 1950s, the Swedish Air Force was the world's fourth largest, fielding over 1,000 frontline aircraft. Anticipating that a Soviet invasion would quickly render its airfields unusable, the Swedish Air Force insisted on light, versatile fighters that could operate from short stretches of highway, refuelling and rearming in minutes before re-joining battle. This is the tradition that shapes the JAS-39 Gripen E, Saab's latest and most advanced fighter that is expected to make its first flight by end-2016. Unlike Dassault's Rafale, which endured tortuous years of wait before Egypt became its first export customer, the Gripen E has been selected by Brazil even before its first flight. In winning the Brazil tender, the Gripen E beat the Rafale, and Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. In sheer aerodynamic performance, the Gripen E will probably be a match for the F-16 Block 70. While the former has still to fly, its predecessor, the Gripen D, was extensively evaluated by the IAF - mainly to its satisfaction - as part of the 2007 medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) tender. The Gripen E, incorporating a new General Electric F-414 engine; is larger, heavier and more powerful than the Gripen D, which had an older F-404 power plant. Even the avionics are comparable. The F-16's Northrop Grumman APG-83 airborne electronically scanned array (AESA) radar is a proven, highly effective combat system. But the Gripen E could score with more sophisticated data networks that bring together inputs from multiple sensors - such as airborne warning and control systems (AWACS), satellites and a fighter's own AESA radar - fusing data to present a comprehensive picture of the air battle in a cockpit arrangement that is amongst the world's most pilot-friendly. With combat performance similar, the choice between the F-16 and Gripen E could boil down, as IAF boss, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha said last month, to two factors - procurement and operating cost, and technology transfer. In procurement cost, Lockheed Martin would score by transferring a fully amortised assembly line from Forth Worth, Texas to India. Further, by creating a vendor and sub-vendor eco-system in India to sustain a global inventory of 3,200 F-16s, spares and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) would be cheaper.

While U.S. military drone spending will continue growing, a recent regulatory breakthrough from the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) sets the stage for commercial drone sales to eclipse military spending and become one of the fastest growing industries in the world in the next five years. A Regulatory Breakthrough The commercial drone industry scored a big win in late August. That was the day the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) opened up the skies to commercial drones. The FAA ruling allows for small commercial drones to operate during daylight and below 400 feet. That alone is a regulatory breakthrough for the commercial drone industry. But the FAA also recently loosened its restriction on commercial drone pilots. Before, a commercial drone pilot needed an actual pilot license. Now, commercial drone pilots will only be required to pass a test that costs $150. These key regulatory adjustments clear the path for the most powerful S&P 500 companies to invest billions of dollars into their commercial drone programs. In fact, it’s already happening. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is testing Amazon Prime Air, its system to use drones to fulfill local deliveries, in Canada, the UK and the Netherlands. Now that the FAA has opened up the U.S. skies to commercial drones, Amazon hopes to fully launch Prime Air in the United States in 2017 or 2018. The cost savings of Amazon’s drone program are astronomical. According to Deutsche Bank (DB), this is how the cost of using drones to deliver a shoebox sized package compares to more traditional methods: • Premium ground like UPS or FedEx: $6 to $6.50 • Mid-tier carriers like OnTrac: $4 to $5 • USPS for last mile alone: about $2 • Robots/drones: less than 5 cents per mile of delivery These cost savings are the reason commercial drones are expected to be one of the fastest growing industries in the world in the next five years. A recent report from consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers predicts that the global market for commercial applications will grow to $127 billion by 2020 from just $2 billion today. One way to profit from the booming drone industry is with large defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) or Boeing Co (BA). However, I see a problem with these global leaders. 7 Stocks to Buy That Will Grow by Double Digits Not only is the military drone market growing slower than the commercial drone market, these companies are so large that even mega growth in their drone divisions isn’t enough to have a material impact on earnings. A better way to invest in drones is with my favorite ‘pick and shovel’ company operating on the commercial side of the drone industry. Ambarella Inc (AMBA) is a leader in HD video chips. Its customers are some of the biggest players in the drone and mobile HD video markets. That includes industry leader GoPro Inc (GRPO). The reason I like Ambarella is because it’s a pick and shovel play on the drone industry, selling components to the companies that build drones as opposed to actually building them in house. That makes the company a broad play on the drone industry, and a direct play on the FAA’s recent regulatory breakthroughs. Ambarella has already had an incredible run. Shares are up 943% in the last five years. Take a look at the chart below. However, this is the best time to invest in the past two years. Ambarella recently fell 50% from its all-time high. More importantly, its forward P/E ratio of 24 is a 45% discount from its all-time high in 2015. Looking forward, Ambarella is on a clear upward trajectory. Analysts are projecting 40% earnings growth to $2.16 per share next year. Risks To Consider: Expectations for the commercial drone industry is running high. That shows up in the high valuation of many of the early industry leaders. Stocks with higher valuation can take a beating if they fall short of lofty short-term expectations. Halliburton Company (HAL) Stock Is Ready for a Comeback Action To Take: Ambarella is a global leader supplying HD video chips to the commercial drone industry. Although Ambarella is far from a value stock, its forward P/E ratio of 24 is more than a 45% discount to its all-time high. I am expecting shares to beat the S&P 500 in the next three to five years. In the short run look to buy under $70. Editor’s Note: Looking for other ways to get in on the ground floor of a booming industry? A life-saving device could soon be rolled out to 5,627 hospitals and medical facilities across the country. It’s already at work in California, where it is on track to save 15,000 lives this year. And only one tiny company produces it. This puts it in control of a $34.5 billion market. How much you stand to gain as an investor is staggering.

Lockheed Martin could build new training jets for the U.S. Air Force more quickly than its competitors — enough to save $1 billion over six years, a top company executive said. And the service ought to take that into account as it evaluates bids for the $15 billion T-X project, he said. “What we’re concerned about, frankly, is that the Air Force in their competition right now is not recognizing the value of early delivery or even on-time delivery,” said Rob Weiss, Lockheed executive vice president and general manager of Advanced Development Programs. Lockheed is running its pursuit of the contract through Weiss’s group, the secretive division better known as the Skunk Works, birthplace of the U-2 spyplane, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117 stealth fighter. Here’s how the firm calculates the $1 billion in savings: The Air Force says it wants the first 16 planes ready to train pilots by 2024, but Lockheed says it could deliver the planes three years early. That would allow the Air Force to start getting rid of its T-38 Talon trainers sooner. Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. That means not as many Talons will need structural and other upgrades. But it also means the Air Force can start shedding a costly two-step training program that puts fighter-pilots-to-be in the 1960s-vintage Talon, then the higher-performance F-16, before they reach the fifth-generation F-22 and F-35 jets. By contrast, the modern T-X will offer the full range of undergraduate pilot training. “Presumably, the Air Force is trying to make this a cost shootout, but they’re not looking at the additional costs that are being incurred by continuing training in an antiquated system,” Weiss said. “You’re really not shattering the cost curve if you’re having to spend potentially another billion dollars on maintaining your legacy training system while you wait on a new system.” Read more Skunk Works Chief: How To Keep America’s Airborne Advantage See also Sikorsky’s New Ace in the Hole: Lockheed’s Skunk Works Lockheed officials say an internal study has validated its decision to enter the T-X bidding not with a clean-sheet design by a modified version of the T-50, a training jet jointly made by Lockheed and KAI in Korea for Seoul’s air force. The T-X version would get an all-new digital cockpit and a port for aerial refueling. “What we did see is that [an all-new plane] was going to take a whole lot longer to develop, to test, to certify and to field, and we’ve never wavered from that position,” Weiss said. This is also the approach taken by one rival in the T-X bidding, a team of Raytheon and Italy’s Leonardo that is offering a version of the M-346, but not Northrop Grumman and Boeing (with help from Saab), which are offering new planes. Weiss says history shows that new-design planes often arrive late. They require certification from the military, the Federal Aviation Administration certification, or both. (While Weiss did not mention it specifically, Lockheed’s own F-35 took far longer than expected to arrive. That said, training jets are considered far less complicated.) Executives in all camps have remained relatively tight-lipped since a list of draft parameters was announced in July. But privately, they have griped that the Air Force is not giving extra credit in the right places. Northrop Grumman and Boeing tout their tailor-made aircraft, built to military specification using more modern manufacturing techniques. These might cost more money up front, they argue, but are a better value in the long term. Lockheed and Raytheon-Leonardo say their planes will meet the Air Force specs faster with much lower risk. Weiss’ comments this week mark the first time a top executive has laid out specific factors a firm would like the Air Force to change when it puts out a finalized list of bidding paraments before Christmas. What does the Air Force think? Service officials say they want to make sure the competition is open to all bidders in an attempt to get the best bang for its buck. Their draft bidding parameters stress the desire to buy a plane that is low risk to build. (Earlier this year, we told you why picking a new training jet is so difficult). “We’re looking for balance. And the balance that we would like to see in the [bidding parameters] would provide recognition of the true value of having early or at least on-time delivery,” Weiss said.

Lots of positive, upbeat noises about intentions, visions, common purposes and long-term objectives drifted into the public realm from day one of the much-touted Springbok Indaba ... would you have expected anything less? But as the two-day venture draws to its scheduled conclusion on Thursday, and SA coach Allister Coetzee begins the tricky task of soaking in abundant advice and theory from a nationwide cast of dozens and then pulling the stuff together for the pot, I suspect there will ultimately be no escape for him from one cold fact: the Bok buck still stops with him. It has been brave, and generous, of him to allow such a forum even as his first year in the post - when at least some reasonable leeway must be granted for familiarisation - awaits completion yet. The word “bizarre”, I admit, is also not terribly far from my thinking on the exercise, whatever good it may bring. Many considerably more ego-driven sports coaches (and that is a characteristic that barely springs to mind with “Toetie”) would not even countenance the idea, let alone so soon into their tenure. Observers of more cynical mind could even be tempted to charge that the Indaba, which he staunchly advocated, signals a worrisome decline - already - in his self-confidence in the unforgiving national post. Coetzee overwhelmingly gave the impression he knew what he was doing during his predominantly successful stint as Stormers coach, making few excuses for a largely pragmatic approach that won him many more matches than he lost … even if his team’s style meant he earned qualified respect rather than rapturous appreciation for his methods. Remember that three times he effectively won the “real Currie Cup” of modern times by steering his charges to supremacy when the South African Super Rugby teams were all housed in a single conference. Even when they slipped up, his sides were not easily broken down. That phenomenon has changed disturbingly for the worse in his maiden year in charge of the Boks thus far, with mostly nerve-jangling wins when they’ve been fortunate enough to present themselves (just four times) and the five reverses including stingingly large ones to the All Blacks. Led a provocative, frankly distracting dance by the Lions’ seemingly futuristic displays in much of Super Rugby 2016, this year’s Boks have all too stubbornly negotiated a dusty, potholed road to nowhere in playing manner, gravely torpedoing time-honoured, core traditions like physical mastery and staunch defence in an airy-fairy, currently rank indecisive quest for a more fluid game. Coetzee has allowed his convictions and principles to stray into a dangerous vacuum; his Bok teams have been ill-fitting jigsaws structurally, sometimes simply featuring wrong horses, full-stop, or the incorrect ones for very particular courses. The coach has ill-advisedly tried to be all things to all people, hammering together a hybrid of Boeing and Airbus parts, if you like, and hoping the darned concoction shudders off the ground. Somehow, and I won’t have been alone, I just knew the Boks were destined to have an evening of great Durban discomfort against New Zealand recently when he kept faith, for instance, in the highly attack-limited Morne Steyn at flyhalf - but then didn’t back the move up by assembling the correct personnel for a conservative strategy around him. He kept a cruiserweight “roamer” at No 8 in the shape of Warren Whiteley, and fielded blindside flanks Oupa Mohoje and Willem Alberts the wrong way around by starting with the athlete and bringing on the bruiser pretty much after the cause was lost. Outside of Steyn, too, Coetzee fielded a back division collectively way too economical in both muscle and inches - including a scrumhalf at wing - to be able to remotely boss All Black counterparts in confrontation. Watch the game again: you will quickly see that the world champions didn’t just revel against the Boks because of their acclaimed, silky hand-to-hand stuff … they also had a veritable field day in physical domination across the park. No amount of debate around the financial limitations of central contracting in South Africa, or fitness levels among Bok Test players increasingly drawn from far and wide on the planet - and yes, I concede these are vexing, impeding matters - disguises elementary, avoidable errors in team selection. Whether the Indaba produces benefits, or no benefits at all, ultimately the current fog the Springboks are floundering in has to be cleared by Allister Coetzee, and no one else who had his name on a table near a writing pad and water jug at a Newlands hotel this week. It’s about the man in the mirror, not the shifting shadows or raised hands, either helpful or confusing, behind him. A much more than competent cricketer in his own sporting heyday, Coetzee is capable of crisper stroke-play in his current job without the need for broader intellectual input. If the Boks go one from three, say, in their fast-looming trio of European Tests, an already disenchanted SA rugby public won’t be lauding lofty, down-the-line ideals from a Capetonian think-tank held a few weeks earlier. Believe me, their focus will be much, much narrower than that. *Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing Read more on:    springboks  |  allister coetzee  |  rugby NEXT ON SPORT24X Boks will improve for Italy 2016-11-15 22:31 Follow Sport24 on Twitter, Facebook, Mobile and on Instagram What To Read Next {{item.title}}   Read News24’s Comments Policy Live Video Streaming Blitz Mon, 24 Nov 2014 @00:00 SuperSport 1 Mon, 24 Nov 2014 @01:00 SuperSport 2 Mon, 24 Nov 2014 @02:00 SuperSport 3 Mon, 24 Nov 2014 @03:00 Show full schedule Video Highlights Australia v SA: 1st Test, Day 4 Tue, 15 Nov 2016 @00:00 Bok forwards want to lay foundation Tue, 15 Nov 2016 @17:34 Italy battered and bruised by All Blacks Tue, 15 Nov 2016 @17:32 Lots to work on before tour conclusion Tue, 15 Nov 2016 @11:34 Show more videos Sport Talk We need to draw a line in the sand As the anger and discontent over the Springbok performance at Twickenham continues to simmer, the...

When DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of the UW Medical Center on his morning commute, Dahl was one of 41 people within a 330-yard radius who happened to have a cell phone app alerting them to the emergency. Forcade, a medical student, witnessed the collapse and rushed over to begin chest compressions, as within moments Dahl, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift in the hospital, was alerted by her phone and sprinted down the sidewalk, assisting until paramedics arrived. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)  (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) If your heart is going to stop, right outside a hospital is not a bad place for it. And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That's what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. More on this... Smartphone app helps man save baby's life Coach administering CPR suffers heart attack after Texas swimmer dies Teen performs life-saving CPR on friend at baseball practice Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. "I put it on my phone yesterday," said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. "He would not be here as we see him today." Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. "The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall," Price said. "The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference." It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. "I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before," Forcade said. "I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'" He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — "You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected" — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. "There's hope," DeMont said. He's due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE A plane flies over a Bombardier plant in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on January 21, 2014. (Reuters Photo) Airplane and train maker Bombardier will cut some 20 percent of its workforce around the world over the next two years as it tries to turn around its business. The Montreal-based company said Friday that the reductions are designed to save about US$300 million a year, part of a plan to restore it to profitability by 2020. Its plans to eliminate 7,500 positions through the end of 2018, are on top of 7,000 positions Bombardier already planned to eliminate by the end of 2017. About 2,000 positions will be cut across Canada, the aerospace giant said Friday. Two-thirds of the job losses throughout Montreal-based Bombardier will come from its transportation division, with the rest from its aerospace operations. The company said the job losses will be partially offset by more than 3,700 strategic hirings as Bombardier ramps up production of its CSeries commercial jet and new Global 7000 business aircraft, along with rail contracts. The manufacturer has been struggling because of heavy spending on new aircraft, a slowdown in business jet demand and production challenges for its railway products. "I know these aren't easy decisions in the short-term," CEO Alain Bellemare said. "But they are the right decisions to ensure the future of the company." In February, Bombardier announced plans to cut 7,000 positions by the end of next year as it struggled to sell its signature CSeries passenger jet in the face of competition from global rivals. Bellemare said the latest measure will enable Bombardier to continue investing in its operations and secure more rail and plane work. He said the new jobs will be created in countries where labor costs are cheaper but also within Bombardier's existing network of global operations. "It's the only way that we can protect the thousands of jobs in the industry and at Bombardier," he said. "It's a very competitive industry and it's important to take the necessary steps to remain competitive in this context." Bombardier said it expects to record between US$225 million and US$275 million in restructuring charges through the end of next year, starting in the fourth quarter. The announcement comes after Bombardier asked Canada's federal government for a US$1-billion investment nearly a year ago. Canada's Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said the question of federal assistance was not a matter of if, but how it would be given. He said Ottawa wants Bombardier to keep its head office and jobs connected to its research and development activities in Canada. Bombardier has been trying to accelerate production of the C Series, as well as to develop the new Global 7000 business jet, scheduled to begin production in 2018. The company announced plans to hire as many as 3,750 employees to speed these initiatives, according to Canadian media reports. Bellemare said the new jobs would be added in low-cost countries and more-established higher cost operations. "It's the only way that we can protect the thousands of jobs in the industry and at Bombardier. It's a very competitive industry and it's important to take the necessary steps to remain competitive in this context," he was quoted as saying. Bombardier had touted the C Series, its first completely new aircraft in the 100- to 150-seat category in more than 25 years, as a means to cut into the dominance of US aerospace giant Boeing and European rival Airbus. But the project has been stymied by delays, with Bombardier announcing in September that it cut its 2016 forecast for deliveries of the plane from 15 to seven due to engine delivery delays from Pratt & Whitney. Costs for the C Series program have risen to $5.4 billion, Bombardier has estimated. The government of Quebec came to the rescue of Bombardier last year, investing $1.0 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in its C Series plane program. On its website, Bombardier said it has 31,200 employees in aerospace and 39,400 in transportation globally.

The number of people flying to, from and within China will almost double to 927 million annually by 2025, from 487 million last year, according to forecasts from IATA made in an e-mailed statement, and reach 1.3 billion by 2035. In comparison, passengers in the U.S. will increase to 904 million by 2025, from 657 million last year, according to the predictions. Global passenger travel is predicted to surge, with most of that growth coming from the Asia-Pacific region as economies expand and more people can afford to fly. India is set to surpass the U.K. as the world’s third-largest aviation market by 2025, according to IATA, with 263 million passengers compared with 256 million, it said in an e-mail. “People want to fly,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and chief executive officer said in a report this week. “Runways, terminals, security and baggage systems, air traffic control, and a whole raft of other elements need to be expanded to be ready for the growing number of flyers.” Boeing Co., the world’s biggest planemaker, expects the Asia-Pacific region will need over 15,000 new planes and more than half a million new pilots and technicians over the next 20 years as economic growth boosts air travel.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation provision, non-recurring items, gains (losses) on sale of assets, if any. These are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined herein, and should be read in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not presented as an alternative to GAAP cash flows from operations, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to reported net income as an indicator of our operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures as used herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe the use of Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP cash flow from operations along with GAAP financial measures enhances the understanding of our operating results and may be useful to investors in comparing our operating performance with that of other companies and estimating our enterprise value.  Adjusted EBITDA is also a useful tool in evaluating the operating results of the Company given the significant variation that can result from, for example, the timing of capital expenditures and the amount of working capital in support of our programs and contracts. We also use Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, to allocate resources and capital, and to evaluate future growth opportunities.

Peter Bellew, the carrier’s chief executive officer, met with Airbus’s senior management in Toulouse, France, on Wednesday to hammer out details of the plan, he said in an interview, adding that the meetings were “very positive.” Establishing a religious-charter operation is attractive because it would offer guaranteed revenues and predictable fares, passenger numbers and plane requirements, according to the CEO, who also looked at selling the A380s to Chinese airlines. The week-long Hajj and year-round Umrah pilgrimage could employ 20 superjumbos within five years and Bellew said the business might also tap further aircraft coming off lease or unwanted by other carriers. Airbus has been seeking to broaden the A380’s appeal as orders from new operators dry up, and is keen to establish the jet’s credentials as a mass-market workhorse rather than a just a fleet flagship. Bellew said the Hajj unit would be established as a standalone business potentially open to investment from manufacturers, while declining to say if Airbus planned to take a stake. “This is a huge, huge global movement of people,” Bellew said. “We’ve done a lot of homework and the figures are adding up.” The operation could be given a name and formally launched before the end of the year, he said. A350 Switch While carriers including Saudi Arabian Airlines, which leases-in dozens of jets to cater to the 2 million people who journey to Islam’s holiest city during the Hajj each year, and PT Garuda Indonesia, the biggest airline in the world’s largest Muslim country, have said they could use the A380 for pilgrimage flights, their plans have yet to come to fruition. Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia, said it may be that the companies decided the A380 wasn’t the right plane for the Hajj, adding that Bellew’s decision not to sell his six planes suggests there is “no secondary market.” Malaysia Air, which has a full-flight simulator for the A380 and a hangar able to accommodate three of the planes at a time, no longer needs the double-decker as it switches to smaller Airbus A350 wide-bodies and focuses more on Asian markets. Planes used for the Hajj would be modified from their current 494-seat layout with Malaysia Air to accommodate 700 people in a single class, giving them the densest configuration of any superjumbo. Indian Ocean carrier Air Austral last year scrapped its order for two planes it had planned to fit with 840 seats apiece and most operators stick to about 500, though Dubai-based Emirates, the biggest customer, has begun flights with a 615-berth version. At least some of the Malaysian planes would be equipped to allow conversion when required to a lower 604-seat setup featuring business berths and better suited to the Umrah, which is not compulsory for Muslims and generally a more relaxed trip for participants, Bellew said, adding that the switch between seating patterns would take no more than a week. Aircraft would also feature prayer rooms and other special features necessary for pilgrimage flights. Airbus said that the A380’s performance, capability and space makes it “a versatile aircraft,” while declining to comment on the Malaysian plans. Wet-Lease Terms The aircraft would operate for other carriers or national governments on a so-called wet-lease basis, with pilots, cabin crew and associated services provided, the executive said. Potential markets range from Malaysia itself, where 60 percent of the population is Muslim, through Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, India, Arab north Africa and even the U.K., he said. The deployment of newer models on pilgrimage flights is likely to become mandatory as Saudi Arabia moves toward banning aircraft that are more than 20 years old for both Hajj and Umrah services, the executive said. Malaysia Air recently carried out heavy maintenance checks on its four-year-old A380s and found them to be in near-perfect condition, Bellew said, speculating that the model could have a lifespan of 50 years, “like the Boeing 707.” Outside of the religious-charter market, the A380s could substitute for other large wide-bodies, such as other superjumbos and Boeing Co. 777s and 747s, when they are undergoing maintenance checks that can take three or four months, he said. The business would most likely be established as a separate entity under Malaysian ownership and with a local air operator’s certificate, the CEO said. Manufacturers have expressed an interest in participating in the new entity on an equity or risk-sharing basis, while other governments could even take an ownership, he said.

One thing Trump and Hillary agree on: More defense Posted on October 20, 2016October 20, 2016 by GS Early Views: 843 86 Shares This is quite an election season. Rarely do two candidates engender so much anger and disgust. But there is one thing that actually unites them: a rebirth in defense spending. In 2013, the U.S. Congress decided the U.S. government needed to slim down, so it enacted the sequester, which essentially meant budgets were slashed across the board. Since defense is the largest item on the U.S. budget, it got hit hardest. That meant no spending on new weapons systems, no significant upgrades of technology or logistics. Whether this is good or bad may be debatable, but the consequences are what we hear in both campaigns: The U.S. needs to rebuild its power and influence in the world again through its military might. Again, I am not here to express my opinion on the wisdom (or stupidity) of this plan but to tell you how you can profit from it, if you choose to do so. Beyond the politics, there is a real fundamental demand that will show we are at the ground floor of a major defense spending mega-trend. Some of it comes out of simple necessity. We beat up, blew up and fired a lot of the aging equipment we had in the arsenal in our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Iraq alone has lasted longer than any conflict the U.S. has been involved in… ever. You go through a lot of equipment regardless of the intensity of the conflict. You always have to be prepared. That means the U.S. is about to go on a massive spending plan to restock our military arsenal. And much of the equipment will be brand spanking new, not just re-orders. All the armed forces are looking to upgrade their systems and retire some equipment that has been around since the Cold War. It’s also about transitioning from a people-heavy force to an increasingly automated force — unmanned vehicles, cybersecurity, telecommunications. And it has already begun. For example, the Air Force has purchased the next generation long-range bomber the B-21 Raider which will not only replace the B-2, but also the B-52s that have been around since the Korean War. Each plane is expected to cost $500 million and the first build is about 100 planes. The second leg will double or triple that number. The Navy is transitioning its projection of power by moving to Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) using unmanned boats to search for mines and unmanned helicopters to stay aware of what’s happening in the theater of operations. There is a massive multiplier effect in all this, across each branch of the services. And both presidential front runners are more than willing to move this along. If you want to take advantage of this mega-trend — because you’re not going to stop it from happening — is to look to the two major defense stocks, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Boeing will also likely benefit, but it is no longer the company it once was. Its commercial airline division and corporate welfare projects by the U.S. government have kept it alive over the years, but it’s more diversified than Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Another good smaller play that will benefit mightily from the increased intelligence and cybersecurity business is a small firm called Mantech. It’s a leveraged play on a particular sector but could mean big profits in coming years. — GS Early This entry was posted in Featured. Bookmark the permalink.

Use this handy guide to increase your chances of a profitable investment in airline stocks. Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Oct 19, 2016 at 7:00PM Image source: Getty Images. Buying airline stocks can be one of the more vexing exercises a stock investor undertakes. Commercial aviation is a complicated industry that rewards investors who use a structured plan when researching portfolio candidates. In this two-part series, we break down a checklist that covers a number of key areas to consider before clicking "buy" on a carrier's symbol in your brokerage account. The full checklist follows; let's begin by diving into the first five areas. Image source: author.  1. Put operating income margin in context This may come as a surprise, but despite drastically different economic models and operating characteristics between low-cost carriers (LCCs), ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs), and network carriers, most airlines tend to have very similar profit profiles.  Why would this be the case? It's simple: The basic economics of running an airline haven't changed in years. For most airlines you'll analyze, labor expense and fuel expense together will equal between 45% and 55% of a carrier's total operating cost. During periods of higher fuel prices and wage inflation, these combined costs can take up an even bigger slice of the total expense pie. Because of these two outsize line items, and because the amount airlines can charge for each seat is governed by competition, there's not a huge amount of operating leverage available to any given airline to improve profitability very much beyond its peers. I've collected recent trailing-12-month operating margins for a wide variety of carriers. When we remove two outliers, Allegiant Travel and United Continental Holdings, we can see that operating income falls in a pretty tight range, from 15% to just over 24%. Data source: YCharts. If you buy into an airline with operating income much below the 10-percentage-point spread in which most airline profits tend to cluster, be sure to understand why the margin is depressed, and ascertain if a plan exists to bring the airline closer to benchmark level. And if you acquire stock in an airline which exceeds the top of the operating margin band above, check on its valuation relative to peers, to make sure you're not paying too dearly for the profit. We'll return to valuation in Part 2. 2. Gauge existing leverage The extent to which an airline is a capital-intensive business is hard to appreciate, unless perhaps you run a rail company. Ample debt is the norm in this industry. In periods of high inflation and low economic growth, many airlines have historically been caught in a cycle of declining passenger miles sold alongside higher financing costs, leading to the serial bankruptcies for which the industry is famous. The past few years of economic recovery and sustained low interest rates have provided airlines with opportunities to clean up their balance sheets. Three U.S. carriers -- Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Alaska Airlines, and Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) -- have even reduced debt enough over the past few years to enjoy "investment grade" status, the highest debt rating granted by major credit rating agencies. Still, seeing substantial borrowings on an airline's balance sheet isn't necessarily bad. Airlines need efficient fleets to serve capacity. But how much is too much debt? Running a standard debt-to-equity ratio might not be very helpful in answering this question. Rather, compare net property and equipment (i.e., a carrier's planes and other fixed assets) to long-term debt. In most cases, net property and equipment should exceed long-term borrowings. If you're looking at a network (also loosely referred to as "legacy") carrier such as American Airlines, I'd also recommend adding pension liabilities to long-term debt in this comparison.  Couple this with a ratio such as "times interest earned" to get a sense of how current cash flow covers debt obligations. This may seem like a lot of work, but it's your best way to protect your investment dollars in an industry that tends to move in boom and bust cycles. 3. Scan the major statistics Aviation is a statistics-driven industry. You should be familiar with the major statistics airlines use to describe their operations, but beware -- it's easy to get into the weeds and focus too heavily on these. Keep them in context of your existing knowledge of a carrier. Nearly every airline publishes its major statistics, which you can find in quarterly and annual reports, as well as news articles that cover airline earnings. Two important metrics that serve as excellent signposts to a carrier's recent health are PRASM, or passenger revenue per available seat mile, and CASM, or operating cost per available seat mile. Both of these figures are expressed in cents. Most airlines also provide a CASM "ex-fuel" statistic, which shows operating costs without the effect of fuel pricing. Checking in on major statistics allows you to see an airline's performance expressed in all-important parameters like passengers and miles. Once you get comfortable reviewing these numbers, it's helpful to compare the stats of your investment with similarly configured airlines. 4. Find the average fleet age  Understanding fleet age and fleet plans is crucial to grasping a carrier's long-term business strategy. You can quickly find fleet age on sites such as planespotters.net, along with detailed descriptions of the types of planes that make up an airline's fleet. Delta's average fleet age, for example, is one of the oldest among both network carriers and LCC/ULCC airlines, at nearly 17 years. Compare this with Southwest Airlines, which has a calculated fleet age of roughly 12 years.  Delta's time-honored strategy has been to focus on repair and maintenance over buying new planes, thus pushing up long-term debt. Recently, however, the airline has turned its attention to fleet modernization.Committed Delta investors should check fleet age every few quarters, looking for an aggregate reduction in line with management's current plans. You can see that the general idea is pretty simple: Find the fleet age and grasp what it tells you about a particular carrier's asset strategy, and then monitor changes on a regular basis. 5. Familiarize yourself with route strategy Like fleet age, an airline's changing routes point to its larger ambitions. While network carriers' routes cover the globe and take time for the average investor to absorb, it can be relatively easy to understand how route additions and deletions affect regional airlines and LCCs. For example, Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ:HA) subsidiary Hawaiian Airlines is currently waiting for fulfillment on an order for six Boeing A320 neo units, which will allow it future route expansion opportunities. Mark Dunkerley, the airline's CEO, recently acknowledged that routes to Europe, and specifically London, are a possibility in the near future. To the investor who pays attention, this type of route enhancement signals revenue opportunity ahead.  Rounding out the checklist Are the skies looking friendlier yet?
