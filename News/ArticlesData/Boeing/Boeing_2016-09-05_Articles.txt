In September 2014, SpaceX and Boeing were awarded contracts under NASA's commercial crew program to help them start flying astronauts on missions to the space station from U.S. soil in the next few years. SpaceX and Boeing are planning to launch a series of tests of their spaceships — capsules called Dragon V2 and the CST-100, respectively — from this year through 2017. The tests will make sure the launch systems are in good shape before the spacecraft make their first official runs to and from the station. Seats aboard Dragon and the CST-100 should also be cheaper than the current cost to launch people to space. NASA has relied on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to deliver astronauts to the orbiting outpost since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011; at the moment, NASA is paying about $70 million for each Soyuz seat. [ The Top 10 Private Spaceships ] The space agency has required that commercial providers like Boeing and SpaceX meet or go below a $58 million average price per seat, according to NASA officials. Both Boeing and SpaceX representatives have said that their per-seat cost is at or below the current price of a Soyuz seat. "The contracts we've signed with our industry partners Boeing and SpaceX are vivid examples of American innovation at work," NASA administrator Charles Bolden said in a news conference Monday. "We've seen the return of an American launch industry and the in-sourcing of work and jobs back to U.S. shores. Our reliance on a commercial space enterprise where we hand off low-Earth orbit transportation to the private sector is critical to our journey to Mars." Budgets and contracts SpaceX is receiving $2.6 billion of the $6.8 billion total contract, with Boeing awarded the other $4.2 billion. Since receiving the funding, the two companies have been steadily working toward meeting various new milestones within the program. Advertise Advertise Advertise Bolden is also optimistic that the forthcoming federal budget proposal from the White House — scheduled to be released next week — will treat the commercial crew program well. "Congress has started to understand the critical importance of commercial crew and cargo," Bolden said. "They've seen, as a result of the performance of our providers, that this is not a hoax, it's not a myth, it's not a dream. It's something that's really happening. I am optimistic that the Congress will accept the President's proposal for commercial crew for 2016." SpaceX getting ready to fly SpaceX's plans under the commercial crew program are expected to heat up this year. The company plans to launch its first abort test for Dragon "in the next month or so," SpaceX COO and president Gwynne Shotwell said during the news conference. The company is then expected to perform a second abort test later in 2015, Shotwell added. After those two tests — which are designed to show how Dragon V2 would respond in the event of a problem during liftoff— SpaceX representatives are hoping to launch an uncrewed test flight using the company's Falcon 9 rocket in late 2016, with its first crewed mission using the launch system coming shortly after that, in early 2017. "We certainly understand the incredible … responsibility that we've been given to build the systems necessary and capable of flying crew," Shotwell said. Boeing getting ready for 2017 Boeing should start launching many of its test flights in 2017, said John Elbon, Vice President and General Manager of Boeing Space Exploration. The CST-100 is designed to fly to space atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Boeing is expected to perform a pad abort test of its CST-100 spacecraft in 2017, with the first uncrewed flight to the space station launching in April 2017. Boeing's first crewed flight to the station should occur in July 2017 with a Boeing pilot and NASA astronaut aboard, according to Elbon. The company's first official mission to the station should happen before the end of 2017, Elbon added. "Lots of great progress," Elbon said. "We're on track, and it's just as exciting as can be to be part of it." Quiz: How Well Do You Know SpaceX's Dragon Spaceship?

He was the chief engineer of the project to build the jet Joe Sutter, 95, was the father of Boeing 747 “Sutter is survived by three children, five grandchildren, three great grandchildren—and 573 jumbo jetliners. His wife, Nancy, died in 1997.” Thus ended the obituary in Wall Street Journal of Joe Sutter. Sutter didn’t own any of those jumbo jets. He created them, doodling on a napkin! Sutter is better known as the father of the world’s first jumbo jet, 747, which aircraft maker Boeing manufactured in hundreds as it became the most sought after airplane in the world. Sutter passed away on August 30 in Seattle, aged 95. The 747 became so popular in the 1970’s and the 1980’s, before the Airbus A320 took away some of the sheen, that it became a generic name to represent aircraft of any type. To a large number of its innumerable fans, 747 was also the most photogenic as its characteristic exterior with the hump at the front became synonymous with commercial aircraft, according to a KLM airline blog. During its time, the aircraft was considered the safest to travel and presidents of several countries including that of India used it as their official carrier. The manufacture of 747 has an interesting history. In 1965, Joseph Frederick Sutter, an engineer with Boeing was asked to create a model for a military cargo aircraft for a defence contract it was bidding for. The contract eventually went to Lockheed but the head of Pan Am wanted something similar for his passengers. Thus was born the 747. The first few models of 747 aircraft was a 231-ft, 10-inch machine, which could easily carry 600 passengers, nearly three times more than the biggest aircraft at that time. Initially, Sutter could not convince his customers that there could be a two-aisle aircraft which could seat 10 passengers in a single row. But Sutter persisted, and several cardboard models later, he prevailed. Ray Conner, the Vice Chairman of Boeing and president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes in a statement recalled that Sutter and his team, along with thousands of other Boeing employees (about 4,500 of them) involved in the project, became known as the Incredibles for producing what was then the world’s largest airplane in record time – 29 months from conception to rollout. “It remains a staggering achievement and a testament to Joe’s “incredible” determination,” Conner said in a tribute. India has some bitter memories of the 747 though its national carrier, AirIndia has 31 of them. The first tragedy which befell Air India involved the Boeing 747 Kanishka, which was blown up by militants in 1985, during a Toronto-Mumbai flight. A year later, flight purser Neerja Bhanot gave up her life to save 360 passengers on board a PanAm flight, hijacked by militants. According to a recent report, Boeing might wind down production of the 747s due to poor sales. Perhaps, it was apt that its creator called it a day before his aircraft became history.

The department developed a 3D printed trim-and-drill tool that has received the title of largest solid 3D printed item by Guinness World Records. The tool took only 30 hours to print using carbon fiber and ABS thermoplastic composite materials. Aerospace giant Boeing will be testing the effectiveness of the tool for its Boeing 777X passenger jet. At 17.5 feet long, 5.5 feet wide and 1.5 feet tall, the 3D printed structure is comparable in length to a large sport utility vehicle and weighs approximately 1,650 pounds. Boeing is currently using other tooling options that are much more expensive and takes approximately the months for suppliers to manufacture with conventional techniques. “Additively manufactured tools, such as the 777X wing trim tool, will save energy, time, labor and production cost and are part of our overall strategy to apply 3D printing technology in key production areas,” explains Leo Christodoulou, Boeing’s director of structures and materials. The new tooling component was printed at DOE’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at ORNL. The lab has a Big Area Additive Manufacturing machine and Guinness World Record judge Michael Empric measured the trim tool, proved it exceeded the required minimum of 0.3 cubic meters, or approximately 10.6 cubic feet, and announced the new record title. “The recognition by Guinness World Records draws attention to the advances we’re making in large-scale additive manufacturing composites research,” said Vlastimil Kunc, leader of ORNL’s polymer materials development team. “Using 3D printing, we could design the tool with less material and without compromising its function.” Boeing is expected to use the additively manufactured trim-and-drill tool in its new production facility in St. Louis. The tool will be used to secure the jet’s composite wing skin for drilling and machining before assembly. The aerospace giant will then provide ORNL feedback on the tool’s performance. www.ornl.gov Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags 3D printing ORNL tooling Related ORNL researchers design and 3D print excavator prototype Airbus partners with Renishaw to explore 3D printing aircraft wings Researchers develop an octopus-inspired 3D printed robot 2 Comments » for Researchers develop the world’s largest solid 3D printed tool for aircraft manufacturing James says: September 8, 2016 at 5:54 pm It’s amazing what people can make these days with a 3d printer, things can only get better bring on 4d printing.

The passenger jet then lifted off again for a “go-around” but within seconds lost altitude and then impacted the runway as the wheels were retracting back into the undercarriage of the fuselage, said the report on the August 3 accident. Despite the plane catching fire as it slid on its belly along Runway 12L at Dubai International Airport, 282 passengers and 18 crew aboard flight EK521 from Thiruvananthapuram, India were evacuated safely. The report dated September 5 by the GCAA (General Civil Aviation Authority) said early investigation revealed there were wind changes in the moments of final approach before the plane impacted the runway. “Approach controller and the WM [watch manager] remarked on these wind conditions as being strange,” the report stated. Flight environment “During the landing and attempted go-around, the aircraft was in a rapidly changing and dynamic flight environment. The initial touchdown and transition of the aircraft from air to ground mode, followed by the lift-off and the changes in the aircraft configuration in the attempted go-around, involved operational modes, logics and inhibits of a number of systems, including the autothrottle, the air/ground system, the weather radar, and the GPWS. The characteristics of these systems, and others, will be examined during the course of the investigation.” According to the report, the 34-year-old commander flying the plane was an experienced pilot with almost 7,500 flying hours in total and more than 5,000 flying hours on the Boeing 777 aircraft type involved in the incident. “Post-accident blood tests did not reveal psychoactive materials that could have degraded the crew performance,” the report said.

Approximately nine minutes after the aircraft came to rest, a firefighter was fatally injured as a result of the explosion of the centre fuel tank.”   Click to read the full report in PDF  The initial report stems from the formation of a team by the GCAA assisted by Emirates, Boeing and engine maker Rolls Royce. In its initial report in a full investigation expected to take from three to five months, the report stated that after the aborted landing, the “aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 85 feet RA at 134 knots IAS, with the landing gear in transit to the retracted position. The aircraft then began to sink back onto the runway. Both crewmembers recalled seeing the IAS decreasing and the Copilot called out ‘Check speed’. At 0837:35, three seconds before impact with the runway, both thrust levers were moved from the idle position to full forward. The autothrottle transitioned from idle to thrust mode. Approximately one second later, a ground proximity warning system (GPWS) aural warning of ‘Don’t sink, don’t sink’ was annunciated,” the report said. “One second before impact, both engines started to respond to the thrust lever movement showing an increase in related parameters. At 0837:38, the aircraft aft fuselage impacted the runway abeam the November 7 intersection at 125 knots, with a nose-up pitch angle of 9.5 degrees, and at a rate of descent of 900 feet per minute. This was followed by the impact of the engines on the runway. The three landing gears were still in transit to the retracted position.” The accident marks the first time in Emirates’ 31-year history that the airline suffered irreparable damage to one of its aircraft. Emirates welcomes report In a statement to Gulf News on Tuesday, Emirates said it “welcomes the publication of the preliminary report by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) General Civil Aviation Authority Air Accident Investigations Sector (GCAA- AAIS) on the accident involving flight EK521 on 3 August 2016. As this is a Preliminary Report based on the facts gathered so far during the on-going investigation, it does not cover causes of the accident nor does it make final safety recommendations. We will review the report carefully.” A spokesperson said: “Emirates is also conducting its own rigorous internal investigation to proactively review what we know about the accident, and consider measures that may enhance our operations or procedures. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the investigating authorities for their continued commitment to the investigation of this accident. Emirates will continue to extend our full co-operation as they work towards the Final Report.” Report highlights * After the aircraft came to rest, fire was emanating from the No. 2 engine, the damaged RH engine-pylon wing attachment area and from under the aircraft fuselage. Approximately one minute after, the commander transmitted a “Mayday” call and informed air traffic control that the aircraft was being evacuated. * Apart from the Commander and the senior cabin crewmember, who both jumped from the L1 door onto the detached slide, crewmembers and passengers evacuated the aircraft using the escape slides. When the aircraft impacted and slid along the runway, passengers started to unfasten their seatbelts and stand up. An announcement was made for the passengers to remain seated. When the Aircraft came to rest, some passengers were screaming, grabbing their belongings, and asking the cabin crewmembers to open the doors. The cabin crewmembers followed the operator’s safety instructions that prohibit passengers taking their carry-on baggage during an evacuation, and they instructed the passengers to leave their bags behind. However, several passengers evacuated the aircraft carrying their baggage.

Monday, December 22, 2014 - 02:24 Qatar Airways takes first delivery of Airbus' new A350 passenger jet. As Joel Flynn reports it's the planemaker's response to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the culmination of eight years of development. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript A big moment for Airbus as it delivers its latest aircraft model to Qatar Airways. The A350-XWB - or extra wide body - is heralded by some as a technological leap forward. Airbus is also hoping it will be an industry gamechanger. Qatar Airways chief, Akbar Al Baker. SOUNDBITE: Qatar Airways Group CEO, Akbar Al Baker, saying (English): "From the inception of the A350 programme until now, we have watched this dynamic aircraft to be truly ahead of the curve and a global phenomenon." The technology in the A350 is one of the biggest attractions. It's made from lighter materials - which means fuel savings of 30 percent - and it offers airlines better and more comfortable cabin design, for economy and first class. As always it's designed to compete with Boeing. Fabrice Bregier is the CEO of Airbus. SOUNDBITE: Airbus CEO, Fabrice Bregier, saying (English): "In fact we have two big members of the family, one - the 900, behind me - and mid-2017 we will also deliver a stretched version, which is called -1000. We will have more passengers, we'll have exactly the size of a 777-ER, which was the reference in this business, and the beauty of the 350-1000 is we will have 25 percent less fuel consumption." This is a market valued at 1.9 trillion dollars over the next two decades. Sales of the A350 have already hit 778, compared to Boeing's 1,055 Dreamliner orders. Not bad for an aircraft that nearly didn't happen. Ten years ago Airbus came within a whisper of burying the model. IG's Chris Beauchamp. SOUNDBITE: IG Market Analyst, Chris Beauchamp, saying (English): "Airbus has really been on the backfoot over the last couple of years against its bigger American rival. It's a good sign I think, and the testing and use of it in Qatar will bear that one out and we'll see if we can boost some more orders and leverage further business off the back of the that." Airbus is now keen to scotch rumours about the future of its flagship A380 superjumbo. But Boeing has its own problems - the 787 Dreamliner brand still bearing reputational scars from a series of technical problems last year. Whether the A350 is the Airbus model to steal the initiative over Boeing will depend on whether other airlines order it next year.

 Russia is squeezing NASA for more than $3.3 billion — and there's little anyone can do about it Dave Mosher Sep. 2, 2016, 12:28 PM 15,195 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Russian Soyuz spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on July 7, 2016. NASA will end up paying $81 million per seat by 2018. Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images NASA is in quite a financial pickle with the Russians. When the agency retired its space shuttle program in 2011, it was banking on commercial carriers — ultimately SpaceX and Boeing — to design, build, and test proven systems to launch its astronauts into space by 2015. But those plans have been waylaid by 3 years, according to a buck-stopping audit by NASA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016. This leaves the agency with one option for sending astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) 220 miles above Earth: a Russian spacecraft called the Soyuz. And Russia is taking full advantage of its temporary monopoly. Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, used to charge NASA as little as $21.8 million per seat in 2008 (when the space shuttle was still around). By 2018, however, it intends to charge NASA $81 million per seat by 2018 — a cost increase of 372% over 10 years: How much NASA is paying Russia for each US astronaut seat aboard a Soyuz spacecraft from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider The latest NASA OIG audit — coincidentally released the morning that SpaceX's uncrewed Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a launch pad during a routine test (no one was harmed, but Facebook's first satellite was destroyed) — follows up on a report it released in November 2013. The new audit finds that the delays by SpaceX and Boeing is going to cost NASA dearly in payments to Roscosmos. "Had the Agency met its original goal of securing commercial crew transportation by calendar year 2015, NASA could have avoided paying Russia close to $1 billion for Soyuz seats in 2017 and 2018, even factoring in the purchase of some seats in 2016 to cover the expected transition period," the OIG report states. The chart below factors in the price of a seat and the number of astronauts that NASA plans to launch (about six per year), to show how much NASA has paid Russia and could end up paying. The total cost over 12 years is more than $3.36 billion. Assuming NASA's budget remains roughly $18.5 billion a year, that means about 3% of the agency's funding could be diverted to Russia in 2018: How much NASA will pay Russia to send US astronauts into space from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider A presentation given by a NASA official in May 2016 estimates the cost of each seat aboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will be $58 million. The audit makes clear that any other hiccups in the NASA's commercial crew program, which could earn Boeing and SpaceX up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion (respectively) for their services, will be costly. A woman steps out of a Dragon capsule model during a 2014 SpaceX event. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images "Given the delays in initiating a U.S. capacity to transport crew to the ISS, NASA has extended its contract with the Russian Space Agency for astronaut transportation through 2018 at an additional cost of $490 million," the report stated. "If the Commercial Crew Program experiences additional delays, NASA may need to buy additional seats from Russia to ensure a continued U.S. presence on the ISS." A response to the OIG findings in the report, penned by William Gerstenmaier — NASA's associate administrator for human exploration — agreed with the report's overall findings. Yet Gerstenmaier emphasized the importance of making sure commercial spacecraft are safe to fly. "Excessive focus on timeliness and schedule can result in reducing the overall safety of the system," Gerstenmaier wrote. "Timeliness must not be over stressed[.]" Business Insider contacted Boeing and SpaceX about the new OIG report. Although SpaceX did not immediately respond, Boeing issued the following statement to Business Insider: "We continue to work toward achieving certification and providing safe crew transportation services to and from the International Space Station with the first launch (orbital flight test) expected in 2017. As in any development program, issues can stress the schedule and we are working shoulder-to-shoulder with NASA to overcome them. Boeing has been a partner with NASA on the Starliner system since 2010 and we’ve made significant progress on the maturity of our design." We also asked representatives at SpaceX if the company's Sept. 1 Falcon 9 explosion could affect the company's rocket launch schedule and human spaceflight plans, and they told us by email: "[O]ur number one priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, as well as to take all the necessary steps to ensure the highest possible levels of safety for future crewed missions with the Falcon 9. We will carefully and thoroughly investigate and address this issue." A NASA spokesperson told Business Insider by email (our emphasis added in bold): "NASA remains confident in our commercial partners and in the goals of the Commercial Crew Program to take astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit. It is too early to know whether Thursday's incident will impact their development schedules. Spacecraft and launch vehicles designed for the Commercial Crew Program must meet NASA's stringent safety criteria before being certified to launch crews into space. Successfully meeting those requirements has always taken precedence over schedule."

In a message to employees last week, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Ray Conner said, “We lost one of the giants of aerospace and a beloved member of the Boeing family.” “Joe lived an amazing life and was an inspiration — not just to those of us at Boeing, but to the entire aerospace industry. He personified the ingenuity and passion for excellence that made Boeing airplanes synonymous with quality the world over,” he added. Sutter died Aug. 30 in Bremeerton. He joined Boeing after World War II. He worked on Boeing’s first jet aircraft, the 707, riding along on demonstration flights with airline officials. Later he did design work on Boeing’s first short-haul jet, the 727. And in development of the 737, Sutter earned a patent for the way the engines were placed tightly under the wings. Then in 1965, Sutter began a study of a new long-distance jet, the 747, with which his name will forever be closely linked. Built to an unprecedented size, the initial model would carry two and a half times as many passengers as the 707. As Conner noted in his message to employees, Sutter’s team “became known as the Incredibles for producing what was then the world’s largest airplane in record time — 29 months from conception to rollout.” “It remains a staggering achievement and a testament to Joe’s ‘incredible’ determination,” he wrote. The 747 established Boeing’s supremacy in international long-haul flying for more than two decades after it entered service in January 1970. To get it into the air, Sutter fought technical and corporate battles within Boeing. He successfully argued against basing his engineering team in California, instead of Everett, where the plane was to be assembled. “The engineers have to be with the production people,” he told executives discussing the move. When development money was tight and Boeing Chairman Bill Allen requested cuts, Sutter insisted to all the top brass in a tense meeting that cutting his team of 4,500 engineers by 1,000 heads would ruin the program. Sutter walked out of that meeting certain he would be fired, he said in an interview. But he kept his job, and so did all his engineers. He also had to win over customers, such as Juan Trippe, the head of 747 launch customer Pan Am. To persuade Trippe to let go of his wish for a double-decker aircraft in favor of Sutter’s alternative concept of a cabin interior wider than anyone had ever seen, Boeing had a plywood mock-up built that suitably impressed the executive. Thus was the widebody jet born. As recently as May, Sutter was going to his office at Boeing Commercial Airplane headquarters in Longacres once a week and was an able salesman for the giant airplane he created. That month, the president of Russian air-cargo company Volga-Dnepr, Alexey Isaikin, visited Boeing during sales negotiations and specifically requested dinner with Sutter. That pilgrimage played a part in Isaikin’s sealing the deal that allowed Boeing to announce that Volga-Dnepr would order sixteen 747-8 freighter jets.

He spoke to Chinedu Eze. Excerpts: Talking about challenges of operating in Nigeria, particularly, the fuel issues, oil marketers are saying that the local carriers are reluctant to pay for fuel they buy, so they prefer selling to foreign airlines that pay promptly. Is that true? I said in one forum that if foreign airlines are faced with the challenges, we as local operators in Nigeria are facing, those foreign airlines would not last 72 hours. So we have to actually give it to owners of these airlines. It takes a lot for somebody to invest in this sector; it is a critical sector of the economy and we deserve our dues. We deserve assistance, we deserve understanding and I am happy government is beginning to appreciate what we are doing. The major challenges the foreign airlines have faced and are all scampering out of the country. These problems are the fuel issue and forex. And the fuel and forex are maybe just 40 or 50 percent of what we go through, yet they couldn’t stand it. These foreign airlines are fair weather friends. If we are going through recession or going through any problem here, they should understand because these foreign airlines have really ripped this country to stupor. The kind of fares foreign airlines charge in this country are outrageous and they have been charging these fares over the years. The fares Nigerians were paying foreign airlines before now were so obscene. So they have gotten their fair share, now it is the time to help the country and they are running out of the country because they couldn’t stand it. Nigeria has been their best route ever, so these foreign airlines are fair whether friends. They should remember that this situation is like force majeure, they should remember that Nigeria didn’t deliberately refuse to give them the dollar equivalent of their money, they should be patient with the country and not the other way round. They should be patient with the country and understand with the country that we are undergoing changes. If not so I call all of them fair weather friends. So because of forex and aviation fuel issue they are all running out of the country. I am not saying that that is right; we are also facing the same problem. But don’t forget that when you to travel to London from Nigeria, somebody from South Africa that will do about eight or nine hours to London pays less and this have been happening. They will give you all manner of reasons that Nigeria is unsafe that they need to pay more allowances to their staff, but it is all a ruse. So the challenges we face as airlines in the country are enormous. One, nobody talks about insurance. They use peanut to insure aircraft abroad, in Nigeria I have to cough out over a million dollars to insure my aircraft for one year. For goodness sake how do I get this money back? And you are supposed to insure it at the London market. They will tell you that the Nigerian operational environment is unsafe; this is what they continuously use to demean this country. There is no country without its own problems. So why are they always running to Nigeria if Nigeria is so unsafe? So they use insurance to rip us off that is one. Two, you have the fuel issue. The aviation fuel price all over the world has tumbled downwards, in Nigeria the cost has spiraled upwards; it has quadrupled. Instead of going down, it is like four times over, so it is cheaper to even buy the aviation fuel in the United States than in Nigeria. So we are facing all these. When we were buying fuel at N97 to N110 to a litre we were complaining that it was too much but now it is up to N250, N240, N230; how do you want to make ends meet? The fourth one is that the aviation fuel itself is even scarce, making you to cancel some of your flights and continuously dwindling your revenue, making you always not to be able to keep on to your on-time departures. Making pilots run out of duty time so easily without flying. Because they will be there waiting for fuel before you know their duty time is gone. Now you have to employ more pilots in order to get over this kind of issue. For example I am going to Owerri, the marketer in Owerri does not have fuel, the only three places you have fuel now is maybe Port Harcourt, Abuja and Lagos. At times they are scarce or they don’t come when you want them. So going to Owerri or Enugu, you have to tanker fuel from here, you have to carry more than you need from here because you won’t get any fuel there. And when you do this you have to look at the weight of the aircraft, you start dropping bags of passengers and this has caused us a lot of name-calling. Because when the passengers land and they don’t see their bags they get angry and they may not understand. Some of my staff has gone home with broken heads but it is not their fault. And this is associated with issues of fuel scarcity. Now we have talked about the cost of procuring the fuel and the scarcity of the product, those two are challenges too. Have you been talking with the federal government on these challenges? Recently the Minster of State for Aviation held a meeting with us and he has been proactive. That is why when you don’t know people you criticise them. Some of our colleagues who are saying the Minister did this or he didn’t do this, how many of them have bordered to go to him and say this is what we are facing. Instead what we do is bad mouthing each other. I am a witness to what he could do. When we needed to get international designation, the Minister acted immediately. He saw reasons that Nigerian airlines should be empowered to have international access and benefit from the Bilateral Air Service agreement (BASA). This is one thing he has done which was not there before and instead we are giving the foreign airlines destinations. But he did it, he gave Air Peace, Azman and I am sure he gave Dana and others routes. So he wants these airlines to do well. How are you dealing with aircraft maintenance? Another challenge is the high cost of aircraft maintenance. We don’t have any maintenance facility in Nigeria. It then means that you must take your aircraft out of the country at any given time. One of my aircraft is with Lufthansa now, it is coming out today from Lufthansa. And when I talk about the amount we pay for our C-check a lot of people say it is a lie, they say C-check cost about $300, 000 or $400, 000. You know C-checks are done according to the work scope; you have to develop a work scope. It is what you tell them to do that they will do. There is what we call C-check work scope, if you limit yourself to that Boeing C-check programme where you have to look at the flaps; no. When the aircraft is opened you discover that more things are to be done and you have to pay for it. If you really want to have an aircraft that you can sit down and be sleeping you have to do pay for it. I used to have phobia for flying, so I make sure that my aircraft continuous airworthiness is number one. They can find that out even from the regulators, I clean out my aircraft whenever they go for C-checks. At this time when most airlines are finding things difficult, we are also finding things difficult but because of the premium we place on safety, we have sent about five aircraft out for C-check this same period and none of them is coming back with less than $2.1 million cost procured at N400 to a dollar. A lot of money is being lost out of this country to maintenance. I will call on the government to place a lot of premium on establishing aircraft maintenance centre in this country. Government will rake in millions of dollars every month from the maintenance of aircraft. Not only airlines from Nigeria but also others from the sub-region and beyond; just like in Ethiopia, they have a maintenance centre there. I have an aircraft that is due for C-check, which is parked at the airport now. It is due for C-check because it has clocked 18 months, so once the 18 months come then it is due, so I grounded it. We are waiting for slot, from the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) Company because they will tell you that they are booked at this time or that time, so we are waiting for or slot. The question everybody was asking was why not put it into service? I said no that the aircraft is due for maintenance. And we have kept this aircraft there for the past three weeks. Even when the engineers advised against parking it there, I said it is due. As at last night, (August 25) one MRO has given us a go ahead to bring it next week, so by next week that aircraft will leave the country for its own C-check. About six aircraft have gone this period because of the premium we place on the safety of our equipment and crew and passengers. We gathered that you have recently acquired more aircraft in your fleet. What is the aircraft type, Boeing B737-500? Yes it is Boeing B737-500 but it is different in sense that this one is a 142 passenger capacity aircraft and this is the second aircraft we are bringing in the last three months, even though we did not announce it. And both of them are the same capacity. The other one is 126-passenger capacity. How many do you have on your fleet now? Right now we have nine Boeing aircraft and one Dornier Jet, so we have 10. Actually this is our 12th aircraft, the one that arrived on Monday is our 12th aircraft. You remember I sold two of our Dornier jets off to British Airways’ Sun Air in Denmark, now we are left with 10 aircraft. Are you going to deploy all of them in the domestic route or are you thinking of doing regional or international? You are aware we have been designated to do the international routes and at the same time sub- regional routes, though they will do domestic for now and later regional routes. So we are going to deploy them, we have been given right to fly to Abidjan, Duala, Accra, Niamey and Dakar. So we are going to soon announce our commencement to those routes. At the same time we have been given international designation to, China, Atlanta, Dubai UAE, Mumbai, India and Johannesburg, South Africa. Everything is on top gear to start the routes. We have visited these countries and we are closing in. We want to give Nigerians the best international experience. We are not afraid to compete with the big airlines of this world; it is a matter of service. We are going to provide Nigerians with the same kind of aircraft they see in Emirates and nothing less Boeing B777; that is what we are going to deploy in our international routes. At the same time one thing we are going to boast of is that we are going to put in our cockpit the best crew ever. As it is happening in Nigeria now you can attest that Air Peace has the best pilots in the land flying for the airline, it is not about marketing Air Peace. Customers will tell you their experiences flying Air Peace even in the worst of weather. We have the Air Peace Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). And I have to give it to our head of training and Chief Pilot, Captain Egonu; the man knows what it takes to produce a pilot. Talking about training and acquisition of your new aircraft, I know a lot must have gone into to it in terms of finance, I will like you to shed more light on how much you have sunk into this and who are your credit partners in the aircraft acquisition? Of course, the airline business is very capital intensive, no doubt about that; no airline can do without borrowing at one time or the other, it is highly capital intensive. It is unlike when I started, when I went for seven aircraft and almost fully financed everything myself. Now I have to rely on my integrity to do the job for me. So what is happening in Air Peace is just the power of God Almighty showing us a lot of favour. Having said that, another thing is the power of integrity, a lot of people are scared of lending money to the aviation industry, a lot of banks especially in Nigeria do not want to deal with airlines in Nigeria. The question is why? Our forerunners will have themselves to blame for not leaving up to expectations and making people scared in investing in aviation. A situation where you take billions and you don’t want to pay back and you are siphoning money out of the country giving the industry a bad name. It is very annoying that I cannot go out of this country to get financing. They will refer you to airline X, Y, Z in Nigeria, airline A, B, Z from Nigeria and airline Q, B, Z from Nigeria that got their reneged on their acquisition agreements. So nobody wants to give a Nigerian airline any help towards funding; meanwhile, all over the world airlines are supported by the financial institutions, which are ready to invest, using their equipment as collateral but here in Nigeria the banks are not ready to deal with you. The banks outside our shores are not ready to deal with you because of the negative pedigree of our predecessors. So we have been battling this and it has not been easy because of the records these airlines have set in the past. You take money from a financial institution and you are not ready to pay. Now Air Peace has come to change all that. The very first time when I was buying my seven planes the money I took from Zenith Bank I paid it back. The ones I took from Fidelity Bank I paid them back. Fidelity is here supporting us all the time. When I came into aviation in 2014 October 24t, I told the world that aviation will never be the same and you are witnesses to that; that Air Peace has changed the status quo in aviation. We have made everybody to sit up; everybody is struggling to do on-time departure now, thanks to Air Peace, because that was what Air Peace brought in. and when we started it was difficult for Nigerians to adjust to our time. For example, in a 1:00 O’clock flight, you see somebody coming to the airport at 1:30pm. And they will come there and be making noise. “I am only 30 minutes late and you people have taken off”. And they will ask him, what did you say? 30 minutes late and he will respond by saying, yes. But you don’t blame him; that was their experience before Air Peace started. Flights were usually delayed. Before now when you get to the airport you can wait for another maybe three hours and nobody tells you sorry. They could waste you time for maybe five hours, and passengers were treated with so much levity. For you to get ticket to even fly you have to know somebody at the airport to help you. It was coming to that. Touts had a field day because of the porous system. So things were being made deliberately difficult and airlines didn’t care. But I promised the world that I was going to change all that and we started doing our online, on-time departure and a lot of people didn’t like it at first but now they are all enjoying it. And others now started playing the catch up. So what I will ask other people in the industry to do is first of all to show integrity so that if anybody wants to come into this business the person can come relying on the resources of the banks to operate, because you cannot really do this business alone without some level of financing from outside. It is done like that all over the world. How about aircraft leasing; are finding any challenge there? If you go to America you will see Delta Air Lines leasing about 200 aircraft. All over the world even Ghana here they could easily lease planes from outside. For a Nigerian company to lease an aircraft, just one single aircraft you might wait some eight to nine months. They will go back and forth with you because they don’t trust you, because they had experiences. In the past when Nigerian airline leased planes from them, to pay the monthly rent is a problem. They would earn revenues but they would not want to pay remittances, the next thing the lessors will be struggling to come and take their planes out of the country. One particular airline in the country, the lessors came and took about two aircraft from them recently. These things should not happen, they are creating image problem for this country. So it is not just criticising the government all the time, the airlines themselves are creating image problems for Nigeria and that should stop. They should leave up to their billings and do things that will continue polishing the image of this country and not the other way round. So leasing is a big problem, and you need to lease to operate long haul flights. I know that the recession has depleted passenger traffic, although many travellers now prefer Air Peace, so how is the recession affecting your load factor? The purchasing power of the people is very low, everybody is affected now, the recession is all over the place not only in Nigeria, it is affecting even traffic. Even some of the foreign airlines also are not having it easy even though they will not tell you, the Nigerian travelling public is no more there for them. It is the same thing in the local scene; it is affecting everyone. Everything about commercial flight operation is in dollars. We buy this dollar at N400 to a dollar, you do your maintenance abroad, you pay for engineering. For example Air Peace, you know we outsourced our maintenance to a British company, VCT Aviation Maintenance Company of Britain. They are here 24 hours maintaining our fleet daily; it costs us a lot of money to do that. So when you put all these together, coupled with the cost of fuel, cost of procuring it and cost of forex, the least ticket fare in this country should be about N40, 000 for economy ticket. I wonder when some people say they have been to America. It is very easy for Nigerian to quote America, Britain; sincerely I don’t know where they are quoting. Atlanta to Miami is one hour, 10 minutes; go there to buy a ticket the same day it will cost about $400. Go to Delta to buy their ticket, if you buy a week plus you will get about $150 or thereabout, if you buy two three weeks ahead. $150 how much is that in Nigeria? That is almost N70, 000 for a ticket. Here we are still having N12, 000 ticket. How much is that in dollars? Nowhere in the world do you use $10 or $20 to fly in an aircraft even if it is 10 minutes journey, but it is happening here. Because the purchasing power of the people is very low, you can’t force it on them. If you want to increase the fare now a lot of people won’t fly. So what we are doing now is to continue keeping our customers and gradually introduce little, little changes upward because you need to maintain these planes. Again, the issue of competition is not helpful. It is not that Nigerian passengers will not be able to pay something a little bit to the amount that may give you breakeven point but rivalry, I have some airlines because they want to take Owerri they were fighting Air Peace on the Owerri-Enugu axis. They reduced their fares to N12, 000 and N11, 000. It is even unsafe for them to do that because there is no way you won’t cut corners at that fare. So when you do things like this because you want to get passengers, you are dealing with yourself. Or you tell yourself you will make up from other places. Other places, are you the only one going to those other places? You still have Air Peace and other people to contend with there. So the earlier the airlines come together to chart a course together the better for them. What you have in the system is devilish rivalry instead of healthy rivalry. And because we have not been able to come together to articulate our position to government, everybody has been trampling on us and it is not helpful. The airlines should be blamed for what is happening in the aviation industry, the airlines should be blamed for it. The owners of these airlines should be blamed because they have failed to come together to articulate a position that would be helpful to the flying public, the government and themselves. Instead they allow unhealthy rivalry to becloud their senses of judgment that is what is happening. If only they can come together and articulate their points and meet the government in good faith and say this is where we are, this is what will help the industry, help the nation, help the government to generate revenue, help the flying public to have seamless traveling experiences, it will become a win, win situation. It is my prayer to have younger people to come into this aviation business, those who could meet together and have a drink and not wallow in the old ways of doing things, trying to be diabolical or looking for ways to demean each other. You know the younger generations are open and that is what I miss about the owner of Discovery Airline, Mr. Babalola. I pray that he should have a rethink and come back some day. This is because we were talking a lot about code-share and other ways of cooperation. Another person is Azman President, he has no problem, he is not fighting anybody, these are the kind of people you need in this industry. Captain Edward Boyo, owner of Overland Airways has nothing against anybody, the younger ones have nothing against anybody. So they should look at themselves and tell themselves the truth about what they have been doing. The older people in this industry should carry us along so that we can help the country and not the other way round. The sky is so big for everybody to operate. Not having maintenance facility in Nigeria is a major challenge we have, would you be willing to partner with some of the domestic carriers to build one? Of course, yes. Not even partner with them, I am ready to go it all alone. I asked for land for me to build a maintenance hangar and I was asked to pay over N650 million to the Federal airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) for a hangar space, for an airline, which wants to do the right thing. Now, all of us are maintaining our planes on the apron; that is untidy. It doesn’t give confidence to the flying public. I don’t need to pay a dime to anybody for a land space.

With a fuselage 225 ft long and a tail as tall as a six-storey building, 747 dwarfed its rivals in both expanse and expense. At the head of it all was Sutter, who had at his disposal a 50,000-strong team of mechanics, engineers and administrators. Their industry nickname was "the Incredibles". Antony Copley, who has died aged 79, made his name as a historian of modern Indian religious and political movements but his interests also extended to changing sexual mores in history, an interest which, as he revealed in later life, was informed by his own experiences as a young gay man living at a time when homosexual acts were illegal. Recently Copley was among those who petitioned the government to issue a general pardon to the 50,000 or so men who had been convicted of gross indecency before homosexuality was decriminalised in 1967.         Harry Fujiwara, the former wrestler known as Mr Fuji. Photo: AP Harry Fujiwara, known to generations of wrestling fans as Mr Fuji, a bruising martial arts master whose signature move, hurling a handful of salt into his opponents' eyes, left them in tears, died on Sunday in Knoxville, Tennessee. He was 82. Mr Fuji was a vigorous villain and a force to be reckoned with, especially when he partnered with Professor Toru Tanaka.

Charles "Champagne Charlie" Cantan, who has died of cancer aged 60, flew Sea Harriers in the Falklands War and later Airbuses for Virgin Atlantic. However, his greatest test came after a distant mission at extreme range west of the Falklands when the aircraft carrier Invincible ran into thick fog. Ordered to hold off while the carrier searched for clear space, Cantan ran low on fuel.With less than a minute's fuel, he lowered his aircraft into the fog bank, and only at 50ft did the ship's shape appear out of the mist. As soon as he landed he started to shake – a condition that continued until Invincible's captain, J.J. Black, met him in the crew room with a whisky.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Home Society Defence Pentagon clears proposal to make F-18, F-16 frontline fighter jets in India However, such technology transfers and license agreements must also be endorsed by the U.S. commerce and state departments to become a reality. Aditya Bhat   September 5, 2016 13:51 IST 10 Shares 10 Shares Boeing and Lockheed Martin have proposed to have production line for F-18 and F-16 fighter aircraft in India. In Picture: A U.S. F-18 aircraft flies during the 'Aero India 2007' air show at the Yelahanka air force station on the outskirts of Bangalore February 10, 2007.Reuters In a goodwill gesture of defence co-operation between India and the U.S., the Pentagon has endorsed a proposal to produce F-18 and F-16s fighter jets in India. The proposal was forwarded by the respective defence giants -- Boeing, which manufactures F-18s, and Lockheed Martin, which manufactures F-16s -- as part of their "Make in India" initiative. Pentagon's endorsement to have a production line in India for F-18 and F-16 frontline fighter jets, along with the requisite transfer of technology and licences, was communicated during the recent meeting between Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and U.S. Defence Secretary Ash Carter in Washington D.C., the Hindustan Times reported. Why advertise with us? Related Boeing is keen to manufacture F-18 fighter jets in India Lockheed Martin manufacturing unit will be a 'huge boost for India's economy', says an aerospace expert In view of India being designated as a major defence partner of the U.S., an India non-paper on broader export controls was reportedly accepted by the U.S. side. "Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar's visit to the US had significant outcomes with Pentagon agreeing to work on the Indian non-paper for easier export controls," the news outlet quoted a senior official as saying. It makes sense for Boeing and Lockheed Martin to open production lines in India as they would have to invest back 50 percent of the total value of the deal. A single piece of the twin engine, twin seater F-18 fighter jets cost about $100 million and the single engine, single seater F-16's cost comes around $70 million. Lockheed Martin is offering India Block 70 F-16, which is the "newest and most advanced F-16" fighter jet. The F-16 is a 4th Generation multi-role fighter with 28 customers, including India's rival Pakistan, which has around 80 F-16 aircraft. These moves gain significance as India looks to fill the fast dwindling fighter squadrons. India needs 45 fighter squadrons to counter combined threats from Pakistan and China. Currently, it has only 33 squadrons, where each squadron has about 18-20 jets. The report noted that having a production line would be a big boost to the nascent private aviation sector in India. However, such technology transfers and license agreements come under the sphere of U.S. commerce and state departments. It cannot see the light of the day until cleared by these departments. Previous reports had revealed India's eagerness to buy the Predator drone manufactured by General Atomics. India is also looking to buy high-altitude long-duration drones for maritime surveillance. The discussions between the two sides covered both these issues. Parrikar visited the Boeing facility at Philadelphia where the company is manufacturing 15 heavy duty transport helicopter Chinook for the Indian Air Force (IAF). Boeing will also be building 22 AH-64D Block III Apache Longbow helicopters. Meanwhile, India has also showed interest in Boeing's KC-46 Pegasus strategic tanker as the country looks to boost its mid-air refuelling tanker fleet. KC-46 Pegasus is a newly developed aircraft that is set to replace U.S. Air Force's older KC-135 Stratotankers. The first set of aircraft are supposed be delivered by August 2017.

 NASA is paying Russia more than $70 million to bring an astronaut home in this spaceship tonight Dave Mosher and Skye Gould Sep. 6, 2016, 3:36 PM 6,222 facebook linkedin twitter email print A three-module Soyuz spacecraft. NASA Tonight three people who have spent 172 days in orbit above the Earth will attempt to return home. But they won't be riding in a US spacecraft. NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011. Meanwhile, commercial carriers like SpaceX and Boeing are still building, testing, and certifying their spaceships, respectively called Dragon and CST-100 Starliner. Today only one spaceship can launch people more than 200 miles above Earth, drop them off at the International Space Station (ISS), and fly them back: a Russian spacecraft called the Soyuz, which first launched in 1966 and means "union" in Russian. Though Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, has upgraded the three-module Soyuz design several times over the decades, it has hardly changed its core layout. What it charges other space agencies per seat, however, has changed dramatically in recent years. Below is a chart that shows what Russia has historically charged NASA per Soyuz spot since 2006, plus what it plans to charge in the near future, according to a new report that NASA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) released on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016: How much NASA is paying Russia for each US astronaut seat aboard a Soyuz spacecraft from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider The cheapest Soyuz seats NASA ever paid for were $21.8 million in 2007 and 2008. As soon as the space agency permanently grounded its space shuttles, though, Russia sharply raised the cost per seat. And it shows no signs of stopping while NASA, JAXA, and the European Space Agency wait for other options. By 2018, NASA and its partners will have to pay roughly $81 million per person to ride a Soyuz to the ISS and back again — a cost increase of 372% in 10 years. (The total cost to NASA over 12 years will be about $3.37 billion.) That contrasts to the $58 million NASA expects to pay per seat aboard SpaceX's and Boeing's ships, or roughly $214 million per space shuttle passenger. (Both numbers account for total lifetime costs of each spacecraft's development.) What will $81 million get you on a Soyuz? One of the safest trips to space, yet cramped between avionics and bags of cargo — for anywhere from 6 hours to 2 days per leg of the journey: Astronauts and a cosmonaut buckled into a cramped Soyuz descent module make for a very tight fit.. ESA/NASA Companies like Space Adventures have also purchased Soyuz seats in the past, sending mega-millionaires like videogame developer Richard Garriott up to the ISS. But the space outfitter's next mission is far more ambitious: It intends to recreate the Apollo 8 mission of 1968 and launch a lucky passenger (and two cosmonaut accomplices) around the moon. At $150 million per seat per lunar trip, it's starting to sound like a bargain.

For their part, Russian experts have said, without any irony, that this may be the smartest move the Pentagon has made in recent years. Speaking to CNN last week, an Air Force representative said that the $12 billion upgrade to the F-15 4th generation air superiority fighters would cover 435 machines, equipping them with new radar, upgraded mission computers, advanced infrared search and track capabilities, electronic warfare defenses, and modernized communications, allowing them to work in coordination with other, more advanced aircraft. Some of the aircraft will also see their missile capacity doubled from 8 to 16, according to Boeing. Originally, the USAF's entire fleet of aging F-15s was meant to be scrapped, replaced by the 5th generation F-22 Raptor, which went into production in 2005. However, production of that aircraft was halted in 2009, with only 188 of the planned 749 F-22s produced. © REUTERS/ Master Sgt. Kevin J. Gruenwald Two US Air Force F-22 Raptor stealth jet fighters fly near Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. File photo © Sputnik/ Maxim Blinov Ready for Takeoff: India's First Helicopter in Years Performs Test FlightAs for the upgraded F-15s, their service life will be extended until 2040. The upgrades will take place between 2024 and 2030. According to Defense News, the US now has a total of 1,971 fighter and attack aircraft (including the A-10, F-15, F-16, F-22 and F-35A), but needs at least 1,900, including training and reserve aircraft. Recently, the Pentagon has also voiced concerns about the reduction in the number of fighters in the Air Force's fleet, with retiring aircraft not finding appropriate replacements, from the F-22, whose production has stopped, to the F-35, which is behind schedule by 6 years. Commenting on the Defense Department's decision to upgrade the new planes, Russian military experts speaking to the independent online newspaper Svobodnaya Pressa admitted that the DoD's decision, while forced, may have actually led them to stumble onto the best possible option. © AP Photo/ Greg Baker U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptors, right, and two F-15 Eagles prepare for take-off at Kadena Air Base on the southern island of Okinawa, in Japan (File) The F-15, the paper recalled, "was the first 4th generation fighter aircraft to enter service in the US Air Force…The aircraft has seen two modernization efforts through the first several decades of its operation, resulting in the modifications F15C and F-15E (the latter carrying tactical nukes). These planes were in turn upgraded in 2007; like today, the decision was motivated at the time by delays in the F-35 program. Since then, as we have seen, not much has changed. USAF Command announced the readiness of the first batch of its fifth gen F-35 Lightening II only last month." Therefore, Svobodnaya Pressa noted, "the question arises: to what degree will the [upgraded] F-15s be able to comply with the requirements of modern air combat between 2024 and 2040? And will they be able to match Russia's air forces?" © REUTERS/ Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation Chances High That Russia Will Resume Its Use of Iranian Military Base, Expert Tells SputnikFor answers to this question, the paper turned to several military experts, including Lieutenant-General Valery Gorbenko, former commander of the Fourth Air Army. Russia's Mig-29, Gorbenko recalled, was initially designed in response to the F-16 Fighting Falcon, while the Su-27 was designed to take on the F-15. "But if we analyze the findings of foreign experts, we can conclude that modernized combat platform of a 3rd generation aircraft has a combat effectiveness that is nearly as good as a non-upgraded 4th generation plane. That is, the radar field of more modern fighters can be easily be broken by fighters from earlier generations equipped with modern radar, electronic warfare systems, etc." © Photo: Sukhoi Company Russia's Su-27, designed as a counterweight to the F-15. Accordingly, Gorbenko noted, since the F-15 has "a good engine and airframe, in the future it can receive upgraded avionics and weapons systems whose production is not even at the planning stages today." Ultimately, the officer emphasized that "an aircraft's airframe can last for a very long time; the problem is always rooted either in the engine or in the internals. But if engine life allows it, the installation of new electronics can make for a relatively modern aircraft. In air combat, the airframe generally plays an indirect role; the main thing is for the aircraft to detect [enemy] planes at long range, to track them and attack." © Photo: Youtube/defenseupdate US Air Force to Acquire 250 Next Generation Air-Launched, Precision Glide BombsFor his part, retired Air Force colonel Vladimir Karyakin, a lecturer at the Military University of the Russian Ministry of Defense, recalled that information has been publicized suggesting that the F-15's modernization will include a new radar with active electronic scanned array (AESA), the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS) early warning system, developed by Bae Systems, a long range infrared search and tracking system, and the Talon HATE communications system, allowing it to communicate securely with the F-22. Furthermore, reports have spread that the upgraded plane will have increased ammunition and fuel capacity. Accordingly, Karyakin noted, making prudent upgrades to existing planes is definitely a better strategy than creating extravagent new ones. "The modernization of time-tested and proven aircraft is an American trend. For example, in 2015, the Pentagon announced the return of the supersonic B-1B Lancer bomber to the USAF's Global Command. And Boeing has received an order to further modernize not just the B-1Bs (which entered service in the USAF in 1985) but also the B-52 strategic bombers (which have been serving since 1955), to bring them into compliance with the 'digital age'." © AFP 2016/ HO/USAF B-2 Spirit (bottom) bomber flying with B-1B (C) and B-52 bombers at an undisclosed location over Afghanistan, file photo. Therefore, the retired Russian colonel explained, "the modernization of the 4th gen fighter is a reasonable approach to operating the USAF's fleet; and it's not just about the price, or problems with 5th gen planes. As practice has shown, it's not so simple to transplant flight crew to new types of aircraft. According to some estimates, doing so results in a 40% loss in combat effectiveness until pilots can get used to their new vehicles." © AP Photo/ Xinhua Beijing Develops New Long Range Bomber as Part of ‘Transformation’ ProcessAccording to Karyakin, particularly in high-intensity conflicts, "the number of aircraft that can be raised into the air plays a crucial role." Therefore, the logic that 'quantity has a quality all its own' definitely holds true, even in modern warfare. "There are even signs that USAF command is interested in equipping its 4th and 5th generation F-15s and F-22s with flights of drones. In this way, the combat capabilities of the machines would increase further." Meanwhile, Andrei Frolov, editor in chief of Russia's Arms Export Magazine, also suggested that upgrading the USAF's fleet of F-15Cs would be a prudent move, since replacing its fleet of these aircraft with 5th gen planes would effectively bankrupt the country's budget. "This is especially so given that in some combat scenarios, F-22s and F-35s are simply overkill – for example, in instances of establishing air superiority in countries which do not have well-developed air and air defense systems." Moreover, according to Frolov, the upgraded F-15s are will be more than capable of fulfilling the duty of defending America's administrative and economic infrastructure inside the country's borders. © Photo: Youtube / Alexander Ermakov Production of the US's F-35, which analysts have criticized for being behind schedule and overpriced. Finally, retired colonel Mikhail Khodarenok, former chief of the 1st Main Operations Directorate of the Russian General Staff, emphasized that he believed the Pentagon's decision on the F-15s was based in part on the fact that Russian radar technology has effectively rendered America's 'stealth' efforts obsolete. © Flickr/ Gonzalo Alonso I See You: Russian-Made Sunflower Radar is Capable of Detecting F-35 Jets"The F-22 and F-35 have proven themselves to be too expensive, with their effectiveness in real combat questionable, because their bets on decreased radar visibility have proven unjustified," Khodarenok explained. "It's true that in the S-band, the reflective surface of the F-117A Nighthawk was very sharply reduced. But it remains well-visible by radars in the VHF band, which is the backbone of the equipment used by Russia's radio-radar troops. Meanwhile, even visibility in the S-band means that the 'stealth' aircraft can be fired at and destroyed." "Therefore, if the airframe and engine allow it, the modernization of the F-15 is probably justified. In modern air combat, the result is decided by the plane's onboard avionics equipment," the officer concluded. ...

Image: Big Imagination Foundation/Facebook Check Your Baggage and Hop On Burning Man's Airplane Art Car Written by Madison Margolin Contributor September 6, 2016 // 02:06 PM EST Copy This URL Aside from being a weird, wild temporary desert community, Burning Man has also come to be a petri dish for some of the most innovative and eclectic pieces of art and tech. Art cars roam the playa as Burners hop on board to dance. This year, one group took their art car to the next level by putting a Boeing 747 jumbo jet on wheels. It took several months for the Big Imagination Foundation, a nonprofit organization that "incubates brave new ideas and talent," to hollow out a 1985 Boeing commercial plane to make space for art and dancing. Burners in the plane. Image: Big Imagination Foundation/Facebook The group calls their airplane art car "the largest moving art experience ever made." The upper deck was transformed into a open-air rooftop, and the plane's tail and side wings were removed altogether. The rows of seats was replaced with couches and lounge chairs. Weighing over 50 tons, the plane was pulled around the playa by an aircraft tug car. At Burning Man, the 747 was set up to feature daily talks from global thought leaders in the "First Class lounge" and special performances at night. When burners entered the plane as passengers, they were asked "What baggage do you need to lose?" and "Where are you going?" "Artistically, the 747 represents our journey through life toward one's future," the Big Imagination Foundation wrote on its website. "Where is it that you want to go? How do you want to make a difference? These are the questions we want people to ponder." Topics: burning man, art, 747, Boeing, Big Imagination Foundation Contact the author by Twitter.

Three types of cryogenic foam are under tests to assess how they insulate the SLS rocket’s core stage and launch vehicle stage adapter that links the core stage to the interim cryogenic propulsion stage, NASA said Saturday. The ICPS will work to thrust the Orion unmanned spacecraft beyond the moon prior to the vehicle’s return to Earth as part of the planned Exploration Mission-1 in 2018. “NASA has developed new, more environmentally friendly insulation materials for future launch vehicles,” said Michael Frazier, chief of the nonmetallic materials branch at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. “The cryoinsulation materials for SLS are not only more environmentally compliant, but they are also just as efficient and lightweight as the previous generation of materials,” added Frazier. The agency noted it uses the three types of foam to cover hundreds of 24-by-24-inch panels for various tests meant to qualify the insulation for the harsh conditions SLS will experience before and during flight. NASA expects to complete qualification testing of all the foam systems in late 2016.

"The Boeing 777-300 aircraft, registered as A6-EMW, was destroyed following the impact with the runway and the subsequent fire," the GCAA said in a press release, adding that the official copy of the preliminary report (AIFN/0008/2016) is available on its website. The preliminary report states that following an attempted go-around, the aircraft descended rapidly from a height of approximately 85 feet back onto the runway, sliding for approximately 800 metres before coming to rest. All of the 300 passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft safely before a fire consumed the cabin, it added. In accordance with international protocols of aircraft accident investigation, the preliminary report contains only factual information related to the accident and contains no analysis, or conclusions. The final report, which will be issued at the conclusion of the investigation, will contain analysis of the facts, and conclusions. The analysis aims to identify the cause(s) and the factors that contributed to the accident, the GCAA said. The investigation team is led by the AAIS investigator-in-charge, IIC, and comprises the accredited representatives of the states of manufacture of the aircraft (United States) and the engines (United Kingdom). In addition, technical representatives of Boeing, Rolls-Royce and Emirates Airline have been assigned roles as advisers to the IIC and the accredited representatives. The Director-General of the GCAA, Saif Mohammed Al Suwaidi, said, "During the course of rescue and firefighting, an explosion occurred which resulted in the tragic death of a firefighter. We extend our deepest sympathy to the family of the deceased, and at the same time we hope that the grief of his family is made more bearable by the knowledge that his courageous behaviour helped to ensure the survival of all the people on board the flight." The Assistant Director-General of the AAIS, Ismaeil Al Hosani, said, "The investigation team is continuing to examine the aircraft and flight data. Analysis of the data extracted from the flight recorders is ongoing to determine the technical performance of the aircraft and systems, and crew control inputs and performance. In-depth analysis will be carried out to examine the operator’s policies and procedures for such flight conditions."

(NYSE: LLL) is well positioned to see a rebound in its below-average sales growth and margins, given the improving defense environment. Gursky initiated coverage of the company with a Buy rating and price target of $174. “Our price target assumes a discount vs. larger peers given the show-me nature of the story, which could create further upside if the strengthened management team is able to deliver on its targets,” the analyst mentioned. Gursky noted that L-3 Communications has been deploying capital to drive earnings growth via repo and M&A. Driving Earnings On the other hand, the stabilizing defense market, which accounts for 70 percent of the company’s sales, as well as the strong commercial aviation demand indicate that sales would bottom in 2016. “All three of the company’s segments should return to growth in 2017E via a combination of new work & easing international comps,” Gursky believes, expecting growth to reach 3.5 percent into 2018. The analyst also believes these improving trends would help L-3 Communications to narrow some of its historical valuation discount to peers, who seem poised to achieve similar growth. “The company is targeting sustainable low-teen margins over time which, if achieved, should go a long way in improving the valuation outlook for the company as peers already perform at those levels,” Gursky pointed out.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto Halt and catch fire: Battery woes go well beyond Samsung 09/06/2016 - 2:00 AM EDT NEW YORK >> Samsung's Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from iPhones to Tesla cars to Boeing jetliners. Blame chemistry and the fact that the batteries we rely on for everyday life are prone to leaking and even bursting into flame if damaged, defective or exposed to excessive heat. That's because lithium-ion batteries store a lot of energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls. If something happens to those separators, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. Samsung hasn't specified exactly what caused the fires that led to the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s Thursday beyond calling it a #x201c;battery cell issue .#x201d; More Headlines Legoland attraction to debut in spring at Plymouth Meeting Mall US retail sales jump 0.8 pct. in sign of consumer health Ho, ho, hold up before you spend this season Region's businesses urged to fight data breaches US stocks finish level as tech losses cancel out bank gains Still, lithium batteries are so ubiquitous that ordinary users of phones and computers shouldn't worry. Research suggests that you're more likely to get hurt by a kitchen grease fire or a drunk driver than the battery powering your iPhone, Kindle or laptop. #x201c;It's not like we live in a world where people's smartphones spontaneously combust,#x201d; said Ramon Llamas, research manager of research firm IDC's mobile phones team. He said owners of Galaxy Note 7s should err on the side of caution and contact Samsung for a replacement that doesn't run the same risk. Here's a look at other notable incidents when lithium batteries by themselves or in electronics have caused problems. ON AIRPLANES There have been dozens of aircraft fires caused by lithium batteries, so many that the batteries are no longer welcome as cargo on passenger flights. In one of the most recent incidents, a Fiji Airways Boeing 737 was preparing for takeoff from Melbourne, Australia, when smoke was discovered coming from the cargo bay. The plane was evacuated and the cargo unloaded. The source of the fire turned out to be lithium-ion batteries in a passenger's checked bags. Hoverboards and e-cigarettes are banned from flights for the same reason. TESLA In August, a Tesla electric car caught fire during a promotional tour in southwest France. Tesla said in a statement that it is #x201c;working with the authorities to establish the facts#x201d; about the fire. The driver was quoted in local newspaper Sud Ouest as saying he answered a Facebook ad offering test drives of the Model S sedan. The driver said he saw smoke, and the three people aboard got out before seeing it catch fire. Tesla hasn't officially found fault with the battery. But in 2013 , it faced questions when several Model S sedans caught fire after road debris damaged their batteries. Tesla wound up strengthening the battery shield on new and existing cars. HOVERBOARDS Hoverboards, or self-balancing scooters, have been linked with at least 99 electrical fires in the U.S., according to the the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Hoverboards might be more susceptible than other products to battery fires because they come under more duress than other electronic devices like computers. Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers dumped the products after videos of burning hoverboards went viral. But they reopened sales this year after passing new fire-safety tests. 1 2 next  last »

From producing a single canvas-and-wood airplane to transforming how we fly over oceans and on to the stars, The Boeing Company has become the world’s largest aerospace company. Over the last 100 years, Boeing has created an inspiring legacy of innovation — one that has defended freedom for millions and propelled people across previously un-traversed skies and even beyond into space. Our relationship with Oman and the Middle East is equally historic and in tune with the region’s vision for an innovative future. For example, our partnership with Oman Air dates back 15 years during which time the airline has been operating the 737 family. The airline’s fleet will be enhanced by an order of 20 737 MAXs, which build on the Next-Generation 737’s reliability, delivering customers unsurpassed fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market. We are also delighted to introduce our industry-leading twin-aisle airplanes into its growing fleet with the delivery of two of the six 787 Dreamliners that Oman Air ordered in 2011. Since 1945, when US President Franklin D Roosevelt presented a DC-3 Dakota to Saudi Arabia, our relationship with the Middle East has continued to deepen and strengthen as we support the region’s burgeoning requirement for commercial airplanes as one of the world’s fastest growing commercial airplane markets. Like the region’s visionary leaders, we look beyond the present and to a future in which the Middle East will create innovations that impact the entire world. There is a desire and hunger for disruptive technology and creativity in the region and Boeing is well placed to support an innovative Middle East. Today, at the start of our second century, it’s on us to imagine what comes next and make it happen. In the next 100 years we may be living off unlimited clean power from solar satellites, making daily commercial trips to space or flying across the globe in less than an hour. It’s not enough to have a great legacy, we are founders of our future. To facilitate this change, Boeing believes that inspiring the region’s next generation of young people who will imagine the future is imperative and we have invested heavily in creating a suite of educational Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) content to share with the region’s future “doers”. One of the centerpieces of our Centennial celebrations is the Above and Beyond exhibition. The exhibit, which has so far toured Dubai and Abu Dhabi and will visit Saudi Arabia, offers hands-on experience with aerospace innovations past, present and future. Our challenge as with many other companies and countries is to create and maintain a fertile environment for new ideas, where people want to do things that haven’t been done before or do things better. Looking to the future, we see space exploration as an important frontier for Boeing and we believe it will be an important frontier for the Middle East. Boeing is a strong supporter of growing the space sector. We see a great opportunity for us to partner with the region on future endeavours that will shape the future of humankind. Boeing has a strong pedigree in space exploration. With the International Space Station (ISS), we have just completed 15 years of continuous human presence in low Earth orbit, and our analysis will enable the extension of a unique micro-gravity laboratory to exist on board the station until at least 2028. Meanwhile, as part of our Commercial Crew programme, Boeing is on track to conduct an un-crewed flight test in late-2017 and a crewed flight test in early-2018 leading to a first crewed mission in mid-2018. Boeing and Nasa are on the path to a 2018 first flight (EM-1), which will take an un-crewed Orion around the moon. The second mission (EM-2) with a larger upper stage will launch in 2021 with a crewed Orion co-manifested with the first element of the habitat that will be placed in the proximity of the moon. Of course, space is only one element of our strategy for innovation. Our research & technology teams ensure that the company is constantly focused on generating innovation and creativity while our technology investments focus on affordability, breakthrough performance, enduring sustainability and environmental responsibility. Research and innovation are a major part of our infrastructure; a framework that we believe can be transferred to the Middle East. 100 years after our founding, technology is advancing at ever-accelerating speeds, but the lesson of our founders still holds true: our company’s future depends on our ability to focus creativity and invention into practical and measurable value for our customers. As stewards of this history, we have a responsibility to build an even more inspiring future, and continue Bill Boeing’s legacy of applying innovation to solve problems and change the world and the Middle East. We enter our next century determined to make a difference and when others say it can’t be done; we will find a way. “It behooves no one to dismiss a novel idea with the statement: It can’t be done” — William E Boeing (The writer is President of Boeing —Middle East, North Africa and Turkey) About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Tencent now China’s most valuable firm Sweden’s Noren beats Hend in play-off → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Saudi visa fees no deterrent to investors Iraq’s oil contracts make joining Opec output cut more painful Euro slips below $1.0620 to lowest level since Dec 3 VW to cut 23,000 jobs in Germany Read More ...

Speaking at the weekend, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Onedot Aviation, Capt. Henry Oludotun Ogunyemi, said the amount covered heavy maintenance checks on  some aircraft type, including Beoing, for which the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), had given its approval. He said Nigeria was losing huge sums to other countries because of the failure of the government and  private organisations to set up such facilities. This is coming at a time it is difficult for airlines owners to source dollars for the maintenance of aircraft abroad due to the Federal Government’s foreign exchange (Forex) policy. Experts said airlines require over $1 million to carry out repairs  known as C and D checks on their  aircraft. In an interview, Chairman of Air Peace Mr Allen Onyema said domestic carriers could save more money if there were maintenance facilities in the country. He said the huge sums spent on overseas maintenance of aircraft could not be readily recovered from ticket sales. The Chief Executive Officer of Aerocontractors of Nigeria, Captain Fola Akinkuotu, said such aircraft maintenance facility would reduce costs for airlines. Akinkuotu said offshore maintenance of aircraft was affecting many carriers, forcing some to abandon their aircraft at such facilities. Vice President of Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN) Comrade Ilitrus Ahmadu said local maintenance of aircraft would save the industry huge sums of money. He said investors should consider   setting up aircraft maintenance facilities to reduce airlines’ operating costs for airlines. Ogunyemi said taking aircraft overseas for maintenance for, say Boeing aircraft, was costly. He said the prevailing economic condition should impress it on airlines to consider patronising  local Maintain, Repair and Overhaul (MROs) operators that have the capacity for their type of aircrtaft. Ogunyemi  said the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) had approved Onedot Aviation to carry out  line and  maintenance checks for Beechcraft, HS-125 and Bombardier, among others. He said  such checks started since 2014, while line and maintenance checks on Boeing 737-200 and Boeing 737-300/400/500 series   kicked off two months ago. Ogunyemi said Onedot Aviation had carried out a B-Check on an Air Stream’s Boeing 737-200 cargo aircraft, which had returned to service. He urged other domestic airlines to patronise Onedot Aviation, noting that the company had qualified engineers to carry out aircraft maintenance with  state-of- the-art facilities. Ogunyemi  said Onedot could also reduce the rush for forex as it would bill the airlines in naira, adding that one of the benefits of carrying out MROs locally was that it would save airlines a lot of funds which, according to him, could lead to business expansion for such airlines. Ogunyemi said: “First, putting all the airlines’maintenance together, Nigeria will be saving $3 billon yearly if we patronise our own local MROs. There will be reduced stress on the dollar currency and this cut across all the airlines. It is cheaper for the airlines to carry out their maintenance in the country. First and foremost, the ferry cost is saved as it takes time to ferry an aircraft to an from wherever it is done overseas. ‘’Even the ground time is saved as sometimes some aircraft stay six months and others stay a year; so, the airline will save in ground time. Saving money and ground time increases the profit of the airline. Airlines are free to check our services out.” He continued: “With increase of profit, there can also be an increase in fleet which means increment of staff, pilots and cabin crew employing more Nigerians, creating more jobs. In fact, the ripple effect is so numerous and cannot be underscored. Assuming they are not expanding or recruiting, they will be able to pay their staff and not owe, eliminating unnecessary hardships.” Ogunyemi also said local MROs would enable the maintenance outfit increase its capacity, train and employ more Nigerians. His words: “We have experienced base engineers in Nigeria already that can take over from the expatriates who are already on ground with the initial know-how and technology. With the MRO there will be jobs for the teeming engineers and retraining of engineers to keep a base of sound technical hands who hitherto flew overseas. that we have now. There will be job opportunities and there will be training.” Do you get a good or bad response from your wife after making love?

Fixing the issue must be a priority for the Legislature in 2017, but local governments can take some important steps in the meantime. The problems stem from a 2015 decision in a case called Boeing vs. Paxton, which made it easier for businesses and governments to keep contracts involving public funds secret from Texans. Governments or vendors can now keep contracts secret by asserting that they could face competitive harm if the public knew of information in the contract. Contract information that has long been available to Texans can now be shielded from public view. That is a recipe for corruption and bad governance. That court ruling led the Attorney General’s Office recently to rule that University Medical Center in El Paso can keep secret its contract with a firm that led the recruiting for the hospital system’s new CEO. The El Paso Times had requested the contract under the Texas Public Information Act. In its ruling allowing UMC to keep the contract secret, the attorney general made it clear that the outcome would have been different if not for the Boeing ruling. The Public Information Act includes a reasonable exception to prevent a potential vendor from obtaining a competitor’s bid during the bid process. But that exception has been twisted beyond recognition to allow the bid details to be kept secret after the contract has been awarded. Joe Larsen, a Houston attorney and board member of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, said previous attorneys general — including now-Gov. Greg Abbott — have been expanding the ability of governments to withhold information by claiming that doing so would create a competitive disadvantage for the government. The Texas Supreme Court cited prior attorney general rulings in its Boeing decision. Solutions to the problem can be found at the local and state levels. At the local level, governments should adopt purchasing policies that require potential vendors to waive the confidentiality loophole created by the Supreme Court ruling. At the statewide level, open government advocates are proposing legislation to restore the original purpose of the bidding exception. “However, governmental bodies will only part with their ‘governmental trade secret’ exception with great reluctance,” Larsen wrote in a column for Texas Tribune. “We must be vigilant that their lobbyists don’t insert language giving governmental bodies the right to claim they are competing in various marketplaces — thus allowing them to withhold basic information from the public.” The courts and the Attorney General’s Office have made it far too easy for governments to keep contracts secret. The Legislature must restore Texans’ ability to see contracts made by their governments, with only the rarest of exceptions. Until then, local governments can show commitment to transparency by changing purchasing rules to ensure third-parties don’t use the Supreme Court ruling to block public access to crucial information. — El Paso Times Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

In South Carolina, multinational manufacturing giants are expanding. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: It's time now for Hanging On. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I think most people hate to think of themselves as middle-class. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: You have what you need but maybe not everything you want. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have a car. But we live in an apartment. That's middle-class. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: If you add a boat, then you're not middle-class anymore. That's what changes it right there. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The middle class are families who are earning six figures. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: $30,000, $35,000, probably. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: That means me. And it means I'm in trouble (laughter). MARTIN: On this Labor Day weekend, we're going to take you to one place in this country where factory jobs are increasing, South Carolina. Their multinational manufacturing giants are opening plants and expanding. South Carolina Public Radio's Alexandra Olgin reports. ALEXANDRA OLGIN, BYLINE: Workers on yellow tricycles with baskets full of tools ride across the shiny concrete floor of a Mercedes-Benz van assembly plant in North Charleston, S.C. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE) OLGIN: This is where engines and transmissions are being put into vans that have been shipped here from Germany. This plant, with 230 workers, is on track to more than double in size by 2020. Ground has already been broken for the expansion. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: Into the dirt - 1, 2, 3. OLGIN: South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, along with Mercedes executives in black hardhats pushed shovels into soil earlier this summer for the half-billion-dollar project. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NIKKI HALEY: Mercedes-Benz vans chose South Carolina to be their only spot in the United States to manufacture these vans of excellence. OLGIN: Mercedes-Benz is just one of several international companies with plants in the state. BMW has a large facility in Spartanburg. And Volvo is building a factory close to Charleston. Large domestic manufacturers like Boeing have also moved to South Carolina. In all, the state has nearly 240,000 workers in the manufacturing sector, a 16-percent increase in just six years. So why is the state with less than 5 million people attracting so much business? One reason - state-backed worker training programs. Consultant Mark Sweeney negotiates with states on behalf of companies looking to relocate. He says South Carolina's network of technical colleges is a big draw. MARK SWEENEY: We interview a lot of companies as we are evaluating locations. And we have yet to hear a single company saying anything negative about that particular program. It's very, very effective. OLGIN: There's another big factor. South Carolina has the lowest union membership in the country, with only 2 percent of its workers organized. Union officials say that for a Boeing machinist, wages are considerably lower than in Washington state, where aircraft workers are largely unionized. And South Carolina has other advantages, the Charleston port, good weather and elected leaders who, in recent years, have stayed away from the polarizing social issues that have hurt North Carolina's reputation with some businesses. And then there are the tax breaks for big employers. For example, Boeing has gotten tax incentives estimated to be worth nearly $1 billion over time. (SOUNDBITE OF AIRCRAFT) OLGIN: But all those tax breaks and fast growth can have a downside. Many people complain about a lack of state spending on roads to keep pace with the increase in commuters. CHRIS JONES: When the plant first opened, it wasn't so bad. At any time now, it's really, really congested. OLGIN: That's 43-year-old Chris Jones. He's an aircraft inspector at Boeing. State lawmakers passed a measure to start funding some road repairs. But critics say it's much less than what is needed. JONES: The infrastructure here wasn't really prepared for what they have to deal with. OLGIN: Jones is referring to the Charleston metro area's growth tied to manufacturing. Wells Fargo economists predict that next year, the Palmetto State's economy will grow at nearly double the national rate. For NPR News, I'm Alexandra Olgin reporting from Charleston.

The case has highlighted the need for airlines to develop an approach where such behaviour patterns among its pilots or even engineers and other employees whose jobs could have an impact on air safety are not overlooked. Dr Harish Shetty , a psychiatrist, revealed that pilots seek help from psychologists and psychiatrists who are not empaneled with their airlines. "They avoid their official doctors. Quite a few are on psychotropic medications without the knowledge of their employers," Dr Shetty said, making a case for mandatory testing. "The DGCA should make urine or blood testing mandatory for psychotropic medications and addictive drugs apart from alcohol screening. Surprise random urine tests should be carried out," he added. "Depression has increased manifold and all groups are affected, every job place is vulnerable. High-risk professionals need to be assessed periodically like those wielding arms, motormen, pilots etc," Dr Shetty said. In the AI case, despite a number of cases which proved that the commander was given to sudden bouts of anger and erratic behaviour, the airline didn't red-flag the matter till the April 28 "willful negligence" incident, when he had the Dreamliner aircraft begin a climb up to the altitude where it could stall. "Even after the co-pilot reported about the incident, the airline didn't handle it seriously ," said an airline official. The matter has once again brought to the fore the air safety issue and pilots with mental health issues. In March 2015, a suicidal co-pilot locked out the commander and flew a Germanwings A320 aircraft into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board.Currently , medical tests for pilots only test them for physical problems and mental health issues go unnoticed or unreported. The committee formed to inquire into the April 28 AI incident had submitted its report a month ago, in which it recommen ded that a psychiatric assessment be carried out by the Indian Airforce doctors and after the relevant training, the commander should fly as a co-pilot for six months during which he should be under observation. Among the past cases considered by the committee was the order given by the then DGCA director, air safety , three years ago, wherein this commander was deemed unfit to become an examiner on Boeing 777 and then on the Boeing 787 because of his hot-headed, unstable nature. Then, a year ago, the AI staff at Birmingham airport refused to handle flights operated by this commander, citing his mercurial nature.The airline however constituted another committee to relook the matter, even as the said commander remained grounded. After TOI carried a report about the case on Friday , the Directorate General of Civil Aviation asked AI to hand over the documents pertaining to this case, said sources. Pilots who spoke to TOI after the report appeared questioned the committee's decision to allow the commander to fly as a copilot. "He will be very disgruntled to carry out a co-pilot's job functions when a pilot who is junior to him operates as the commander. It will add unwanted stress in the cockpit," said a commander, requesting anonymity . Capt D S Mathur, former CMD and former director (operations), Air India, too had said that letting unstable pilots fly even as co-pilots would be detrimental to air safety. "Why is the airline being lenient? They are playing with the lives of passengers," Capt Mathur said. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks closed slightly higher Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq logging a record close as investors digested a weak services-sector report, which might help convince the Federal Reserve to stay its hand as it considers raising interest rates. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.25%  rose 6.50 points, or 0.3%, to close at 2,186.48, led by sharp gains in energy, utilities, and telecom stocks. Earlier, a slide in retail was checked by the dollar’s downturn. The prospect of lower rates for longer tends to be a negative for the currency, but a lower dollar is beneficial to multinational companies, making their exports relatively cheaper. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.21%  finished up 46.16 points, or 0.3%, at 18,538.12. Chevron Corp CVX, +0.24% and Boeing Co. shares led the average higher, closing up more than 1%, while shares of Nike Inc. NKE, -0.06% United Technologies Corp. UTX, -0.13% , Home Depot Inc. HD, -0.73% and General Electric Co. GE, -0.78%  weighed on blue chips. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.25%  rose 26.01 points, or 0.5% to a new closing high of 5,275.91. Also, the Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.12%  briefly touched a 52-week high of 1,254.41 Tuesday, and closed up fractionally just above 1,253. Read: Small-cap stocks aim high thanks to U.S. economy The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index fell to 51.4% last month from 55.5% in July—the slowest pace of growth since 2010. Bond yields and the dollar fell sharply following the report as investors continue to play down the possibility of a rate rise this year. “Pessimism about retailers earlier was due to bad weather on the East Coast impacting back-to-school spending, as well as news over the weekend about the bankruptcy of Korean shipping giant Hanjin Shipping Co. that resulted in chaos in some ports,” said Diane Jaffee, senior portfolio manager at TCW. Analysts said the Tuesday session is likely to see stocks trade in a fairly narrow range as U.S. investors try to shake off the cobwebs after an extended weekend, with the market closed on Monday for Labor Day. “After a number of important data last week, which were all soft, markets are in a slight consolidation mode,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist at Voya Investment Management. “The fact that a ‘soft news is good news’ mentality appears back is not great in the long term. But the lack of alternative investment choices will continue to drive U.S. stocks higher in the short term because of relatively attractive valuations,” Cavanaugh said. The S&P 500 and Dow industrials both edged higher last week after a weaker-than-expected monthly jobs report on Friday bolstered the view that the Fed won’t raise interest rates in September, fueling a rise in stocks and other assets perceived as relatively risky. “Stocks are up about 7% since the start of the year, which is not euphoric and there has been a distinct rotation out of defensive stocks into riskier sectors—all because investors are relying on the Fed and other central banks to absorb any risk,” Cavanaugh said.

MON, +0.32% closed down 1.4%, following an earlier session rise, after German chemicals titan Bayer AG BAYN, -0.30%  raised its bid for the U.S. company to $127.50 a share, up from $125 a share. General Electric Co. GE, -0.78%  shares declined 0.8% after the conglomerate said it would acquire two European 3-D printing companies for a combined $1.4 billion, gobbling up Sweden’s Arcam AB ARCM, +0.00% and Germany’s SLM Solutions Group AG AM3D, -2.51% In the deal’s wake, shares of U.S. 3-D printing companies Stratasys Ltd. SSYS, +0.40%  and 3-D Systems Corp. DDD, +0.85% closed up 3.8% and 5.6%, respectively. The 3-D Printing ETF PRNT, -0.24% which launched in July and hasn’t attracted much investor money, closed up 5.6%. Enbridge Inc. ENB, -0.02% and Spectra Energy Corp. SE, -0.09% announced a stock-for-stock merger transaction, valuing Spectra’s common stock at $28 billion to create North America’s largest energy infrastructure company. Enbridge rallied 5.1%, while Spectra closed up more than 13%. Cepheid US:CPHD  soared 53% to close at $52.53 following news that conglomerate Danaher Corp. DHR, -0.89%  plans to buy the maker of clinical testing gear for $53 a share in cash, or about $4 billion. Danaher shares fell 2.1%. Chip maker Marvell Technology Group Ltd. MRVL, +9.28%  dropped 0.5% after reporting that quarterly revenue fell more than expected and issuing a mixed outlook. Other markets: The U.S. oil benchmark US:CLV6 settled up 0.9% at $44.83 a barrel even as doubts surrounded a Russia-Saudi agreement to monitor the oil market and come up with recommendations to promote stability. European stocks SXXP, -0.41% were slightly higher. Gold futures GCZ6, -0.76%  rallied 2.1% to settle at $1,354 an ounce, their highest level since Aug. 18, and a key dollar index DXY, +0.41% lost ground. Asian stock markets were broadly higher Tuesday, though Australian equities XJO, +0.39% fell after the central bank there kept interest rates unchanged, and the Philippine benchmark PSEI, +0.25%  fell after U.S. President Obama canceled a meeting with the country’s leader.

Around the 25th District with Rep. Steve Knight Uploaded: , Tuesday, Sep 6, 2016 By Press Release Around the District Service Academy Information Day Do you know someone who is interested in applying to a United States military service academy? On September 17 my office is hosting an information gathering event for students considering application for 2017 appointment to the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, U.S. Merchant Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy. More information here.   Supplier Roundtable Last week I sat down with representatives from small businesses around the community that work with Boeing. We discussed their operations and how we can help by reducing the federal government’s regulatory burden on growing businesses and by encouraging students to pursue STEM fields and other skills like materials science, wood working, and metal working. Discussing small business issues with Boeing suppliers Pinning Ceremony Last Tuesday we had another great Medal Pinning Ceremony at Crazy Otto’s Diner in Lancaster. We presented a long-overdue Army Good Conduct Medal and the Army Commendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster to Danny Bazzell, a fellow U.S. Army veteran and fixture in our local veteran community. Congratulations Danny! Kiwanis Breakfast On August 31 I started my morning with at the Kiwanis Club breakfast at the Junkyard in Simi Valley. It was great to catch up with old friends and make new ones over some fantastic food. Breakfast with Kiwanis Club of Simi Valley Dedication Ceremony It was an honor to attend last Wednesday’s dedication ceremony for the Simi Valley Police Officer Michael Clark Memorial Overcrossing. Thank you to the Simi Valley Police Department and everyone else involved in honoring our fallen officer. Veterans Lunch After the Dedication Ceremony I caught up with some local Simi Valley veterans at El Patio Restaurant & Cantina for lunch and some excellent conversations. Thanks for having me! Chatting with local Simi Valley veterans Farmers Insurance Visit Following lunch I had the opportunity to meet and talk with local employees at Farmers Insurance Group. I learned about their program to help veterans as they transition out of the military as well how our office can help them with issues they may have with federal agencies. Giving a legislative update to Farmers Insurance employees Fighting for Flight On Thursday I attended the F-35 Lightning II mobile cockpit demonstrator showcase at Skunk Works in Palmdale. The F-35 helps with two of my top priorities: creating jobs and protecting the American warfighter, and I was proud to “fly” it in the Antelope Valley. “Flying” the F-35 Lightning II mobile cockpit demonstrator  Coffee with a Cop Last week I met with community members at the monthly Coffee with a Cop, hosted by the Palmdale Sheriff’s Station. I appreciate Capt. Kneer and the deputies that were there to answer questions. Coffee with a Cop in Palmdale Ending Veteran Homelessness I was very happy to hear the VA’s announcement last week about the grants they provided to several local organizations working to help homeless and at-risk veterans and families. Veteran homelessness is a horrible issue in our community and across the country, but by supporting these local initiatives we are taking a solid step toward solving this tragic problem.

The Aug. 3 crash, which injured 24 of the 300 people on board and led to the death of a firefighter on the ground, happened after Dubai International Airport issued a windshear warning while clearing the Boeing Co. 777 to land, the report from the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority says. Flight EK521 from India approached the airport in a following wind of 16 knots, with the right-hand wheels hitting the ground three seconds before the left side in an attempted touchdown that was more than a kilometer beyond the runway perimeter, triggering a “long landing” warning in the cockpit, the study says. The jet attempted a go-around maneuver and subsequently encountered a headwind, climbing to a height of only 85 feet before sinking back onto the runway at a descent rate of 900 feet a minute. The 777-300 came down on its tail and engines, with the wheels having been retracted after the aborted landing, the report says. One turbine broke off as the plane slid along the runway, causing “an intense fuel-fed fire,” with the flight’s captain issuing a Mayday call and ordering an evacuation. The firefighter was killed when a fuel tank exploded, sending a 15-meter wing section into the air, about nine minutes after the plane had come to rest and the blaze had appeared to be under control. A flight attendant was hospitalized for five days with smoke inhalation, with all other injuries classified as minor. The aircraft itself was destroyed. The crash was the worst in the 30-year history of Dubai-based Emirates, the world’s biggest airline by international traffic. The preliminary report didn’t say whether the plane should have been allowed to land, or if its pilots behaved correctly during the approach and subsequent go-around attempt. Further findings will be released in due course, with the aircraft’s performance, technical and engineering aspects, the airline’s procedures, air navigation provision, firefighting measures and weather forecasting all under scrutiny, the regulator said.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – A U.S. space probe was cleared for launch on Thursday to collect and return samples from an asteroid in hopes of learning more about the origins of life on Earth and perhaps elsewhere in the solar system, NASA said on Tuesday. A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket was scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to dispatch the robot explorer Osiris-Rex on a seven-year mission. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Osiris-Rex is headed to a 1,640-foot (500-meter) wide asteroid named Bennu, which circles the sun in roughly the same orbit as Earth. Scientists estimate there is a one-in-800 chance that Bennu might actually hit Earth 166 years from now. WATCH: NASA’s Juno spacecraft uncovers new details about Jupiter Story continues below Heating from the sun gently pushes the asteroid, and charting its path is among the goals of the $1 billion mission. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Osiris-Rex is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and begin a two-year study of its physical features and chemical composition. The solar-powered spacecraft will then fly to Bennu’s surface and extend a robot arm to collect at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of what scientists hope will be carbon-rich material. “We’re going to asteroid Bennu because it’s a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation, back when our planetary system was spread across as dust grains in a swirling cloud around our growing protostar,” lead researcher Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona told a prelaunch news conference on Tuesday. READ MORE: NASA completes splashdown test for Mars-bound spacecraft Inside the developing solar system, small rocky bodies were beginning to form, many of them studded with water ice and organic materials, which are key compounds that may have made Earth habitable or even given life its start, Lauretta said. If all goes as planned, the capsule containing samples from Bennu will be jettisoned from the returning Osiris-Rex spacecraft on Sept. 24, 2023, for a parachute descent and landing at the U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. WATCH: NASA conducts successful test of rocket that could carry manned mission to Mars   Osiris-Rex is the latest in a series of missions to asteroids that began with the 1991 flyby of asteroid Gaspra by NASA’s Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft. Japan’s Hayabusa 1 probe managed to return a few tiny grains of asteroid Itokawa to Earth in 2010, the first asteroid sample return mission. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is underway. The Osiris-Rex launch was set for between 7:05 p.m. and 9:05 p.m. on Thursday (2305 to 0105 GMT on Friday). © 2016 Thomson Reuters Report an error Bennu Bennu asteroid Cape Canaveral NASA NASA Space probe OSIRIS-REx Space probe U.S. space probe United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket Editor's Picks Consumer How Trump's immigration crackdown could raise food prices for Canadians Politics Trudeau Liberals ‘trampling’ on women’s rights with new CPP regime: opposition Money Here's how much mortgage payments will go up as banks hike rates Consumer Text message fraud cost Canadians half a million dollars so far in 2016 Investigations Ontario schools are missing ‘perfect opportunity’ to address mental health amid rash of youth suicides Health Drugs aren’t tested on women like they are on men, and it could have deadly consequences Investigations How mental health should be taught in Canadian schools FLYERS More Weekly Flyers Comments Popular Now Jon Stewart slams 'hypocrisy' of labelling all Donald Trump voters racist 10477 Father sentenced to 40 years in jail for killing his daughter’s sexual abuser 9377 Earth on track to heat up to devastating levels by 2100, scientists say 9217 WATCH: Polar bear seen petting sled dog near Churchill, Manitoba 9160 How the ‘mystery shopper’ scam fooled a young mother, a factory worker and a senior 7097 Sponsored content Popular Videos Expert weighs in on 14-year-old girl who wins right to be cryogenically frozen WATCH NOW Mystery shopping texts sent to Canadians turn out to be scam WATCH NOW MPs Michelle Rempel and Elizabeth May argue over the use of the word ‘fart’ in House of Commons WATCH NOW Man dies after falling into acidic hot spring in Yellowstone National Park WATCH NOW Love and loss, a Saskatoon couple shares their NICU story WATCH NOW Jump to a Region BC Calgary Edmonton Halifax Lethbridge Montreal New Brunswick Okanagan Regina Saskatoon Toronto Winnipeg Connect Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest RSS Contact Us Global News About Us Privacy Policy Principles & Practices Terms & Conditions Copyright Corus Entertainment Advertise Branded Content Open Data © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Yet many US platforms bought have turned out to be less than cutting-edge, after New Delhi’s unwillingness to sign what Washington labels a “foundational agreement” — the Communications Interoperability and Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) — has forced the replacement of closely-guarded radio, communications security and navigation kits with lower-grade, commercially-available equipment. One example is the C-130J Super Hercules Special Forces plane, in which the Indian Air Force (IAF) will transport commandos to small landing strips in enemy territory, which would have been pre-secured by a ground team. Such operations need secure communications between the aircraft and the team on the runway, so that the C-130J is not enticed into a trap. America tightly controls the radios used for this, denying it to countries that have not signed CISMOA. So far India has opted for less secure, costlier, commercially available radio kits, rather than signing CISMOA. Similarly, the Indian Navy’s Boeing P-8I maritime aircraft is among the world’s most effective submarine hunters. But, detecting and pinpointing an enemy submarine is only the first step; attacking it requires the P-8I to communicate with naval forces nearby, and with shore-based naval facilities. Since these voice and data channels —called Data Link-11 and Link-16 — are guarded under CISMOA, the P-8I has been equipped with older communication links that could be intercepted. The absence of these links also prevents the P-8I from generating a Common Tactical Picture with friendly regional navies, who operate over CISMOA-protected links.   There are other such cases. In a conflict with China, the absence of Link-16 would prevent IAF fighters from generating a Common Air Picture, even if friendly air forces were eager to inform on the activities of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). Non-signature of CISMOA also denies the military precision Global Positioning System (GPS) gear, and state-of-the-art guidance for the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) that will soon equip IAF fighters. During Business Standard’s visit in June to the Chinook CH-47F helicopter line in Philadelphia, we learnt that India’s 15 Chinooks would not have navigation and radio equipment of the same sophistication as the US Army choppers being built alongside. US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter had in April argued that American weapon systems were capable even without CISMOA-controlled equipment. But he conceded that India was missing out, saying: “I want to emphasise there’s a lot we can do without the foundational agreements; but there’s much more we can do with them.” Carter was part-vindicated on August 29, when Washington and New Delhi signed a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) -- the first of the three foundational agreements. Yet that still leaves two: CISMOA, and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Information and Services Cooperation (BECA), which lays down protocols for digital mapping and survey. CISMOA negotiations have sputtered on sporadically since 2005. On New Delhi’s request, Washington has agreed to rename the agreement COMCASA — or Communications Compatibility And Security Agreement — to allow India a country-specific agreement, different from what the US Department of Defense (DoD, or Pentagon) has signed with dozens of other countries. A similar logic was employed in the LEMOA, which was given an India-specific name to differentiate it from the Logistics Support Agreements (LSAs) that US has signed with many other countries. Even so, merely renaming the agreement would not make it acceptable to Indian public opinion, since the standard CISMOA draft — the basis of COMCASA negotiations — is inherently more intrusive than LEMOA. A senior Pentagon official who participated in CISMOA negotiations with India confessed: “When we sat down with the MoD in Delhi and the CISMOA experts explained the draft, even we were taken aback by the intrusiveness. We looked at each other and rolled our eyes [indicating], ‘this is not going to happen’.” To assess the key hurdles, Business Standard has scrutinised the text of the CISMOA that the Republic of Korea (South Korea, or ROK) Ministry of National Defence (MND) signed with the US DoD on October 27, 2008. That text requires Korea to provide US personnel access to Korean military bases; reserves for US personnel the right to install, maintain and inspect CISMOA-controlled equipment; bans the transfer of CISMOA-controlled equipment to any third party; bans its indigenous production; and stipulates stringent safeguards for securing, storing and accounting for COMSEC (communications security) equipment obtained from the US. Paragraph V of the agreement requires ROK to pay the full cost of reconfiguring its communication systems to be interoperable with US military systems, and for testing the Korean systems, whenever required. Paragraph IX of the agreement stipulates: “DoD-provided COMSEC equipment and materials, including keying materials, will be installed and maintained only by authorized US personnel… When authorized by the US, qualified ROK personnel may remove and/or replace US COMSEC equipment previously installed by US personnel.” Paragraph X mandates that “DoD-provided COMSEC equipment and materials, including keying materials, will not be subject to any cooperative development, co-production, co-assembly or production licensing agreements.” To be sure, New Delhi will be able to arm-twist Washington into framing a less restrictive COMCASA agreement. The Pentagon has repeatedly offered to address Indian concerns, asking New Delhi to identify objectionable clauses in the standard CISMOA draft. However, New Delhi has not conveyed its Red Lines yet, apparently because the defence ministry has little clarity on its own position. US officials point out that New Delhi had no qualms signing highly restrictive safeguard agreements for the protective technologies installed on the prime minister’s Boeing Business Jet, which are similar to the ones that protect the US president’s aircraft, Air Force One. Says one official: “India displayed a clear understanding of the need to protect those technologies; because VVIP lives depend on that. Why is there a different standard for safeguarding technologies critical for protecting soldiers, sailors and airmen? That is the logic of CISMOA and COMCASA.” Ben Schwartz of the US-India Business Council downplays concerns about the increased access to Indian bases that COMCASA requires, terming it “trivial and about as much of a threat to national sovereignty as granting a multinational telecommunications company a license to operate in India.” He argues that both types of activities take place entirely under the laws of the Government of India.” However, Indian public opinion views the foundational agreements as instruments to tie India into America’s regional military alliances. Left Front parties have always opposed ties with an “imperialist” America. Traditionalists argue that close ties with America would offend Russia. Several opposition parties, particularly the Congress, continue to argue for non-alignment. Says Ashley Tellis, one of the most highly regarded experts on US-India ties: “The Indian debate about the foundational agreements is deeply misleading, centered on commentators' prejudices rather than on facts. Individuals are entitled to their own opinions, not to their own facts.” Given the opposition, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar is moving cautiously on COMCASA and BECA. After signing LEMOA in Washington last month, he told the media: “After 12-13 years we have managed to get the logistics agreement in place… So let me get this in the public domain properly; explain to the people; then we will definitely go into the other aspects.” Parrikar has his job cut out for him.

 NASA is paying Russia more than $70 million to bring an astronaut home in this spaceship tonight Dave Mosher and Skye Gould Sep. 6, 2016, 3:36 PM 6,222 facebook linkedin twitter email print A three-module Soyuz spacecraft. NASA Tonight three people who have spent 172 days in orbit above the Earth will attempt to return home. But they won't be riding in a US spacecraft. NASA retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011. Meanwhile, commercial carriers like SpaceX and Boeing are still building, testing, and certifying their spaceships, respectively called Dragon and CST-100 Starliner. Today only one spaceship can launch people more than 200 miles above Earth, drop them off at the International Space Station (ISS), and fly them back: a Russian spacecraft called the Soyuz, which first launched in 1966 and means "union" in Russian. Though Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, has upgraded the three-module Soyuz design several times over the decades, it has hardly changed its core layout. What it charges other space agencies per seat, however, has changed dramatically in recent years. Below is a chart that shows what Russia has historically charged NASA per Soyuz spot since 2006, plus what it plans to charge in the near future, according to a new report that NASA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) released on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016: How much NASA is paying Russia for each US astronaut seat aboard a Soyuz spacecraft from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider The cheapest Soyuz seats NASA ever paid for were $21.8 million in 2007 and 2008. As soon as the space agency permanently grounded its space shuttles, though, Russia sharply raised the cost per seat. And it shows no signs of stopping while NASA, JAXA, and the European Space Agency wait for other options. By 2018, NASA and its partners will have to pay roughly $81 million per person to ride a Soyuz to the ISS and back again — a cost increase of 372% in 10 years. (The total cost to NASA over 12 years will be about $3.37 billion.) That contrasts to the $58 million NASA expects to pay per seat aboard SpaceX's and Boeing's ships, or roughly $214 million per space shuttle passenger. (Both numbers account for total lifetime costs of each spacecraft's development.) What will $81 million get you on a Soyuz? One of the safest trips to space, yet cramped between avionics and bags of cargo — for anywhere from 6 hours to 2 days per leg of the journey: Astronauts and a cosmonaut buckled into a cramped Soyuz descent module make for a very tight fit.. ESA/NASA Companies like Space Adventures have also purchased Soyuz seats in the past, sending mega-millionaires like videogame developer Richard Garriott up to the ISS. But the space outfitter's next mission is far more ambitious: It intends to recreate the Apollo 8 mission of 1968 and launch a lucky passenger (and two cosmonaut accomplices) around the moon. At $150 million per seat per lunar trip, it's starting to sound like a bargain.

Hollande, the third French president to visit Vietnam since independence, said the “very important deals” deepened ties with its former colony where France's legacy is ubiquitous, from the country's colonial-era buildings to French-influenced cuisine. “We agreed to encourage both countries to establish economic partnerships on the basis of technology transfer,” Hollande said after Airbus signed three separate deals. Low-cost private airline VietJet, known for its bikini-clad hostesses, bought 20 planes while national carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Jetstar Pacific bought 10 each in “deals worth 6.5 billion,” Airbus Asia spokesman Sean Lee told AFP. He did not provide a breakdown of each deal's value, but VietJet said later in a statement it was spending US$2.39 billion on its new planes. The VietJet purchase comes after it bought 100 passenger jets from U.S. aircraft maker Boeing for US$11.3 billion in May, during a visit by President Barack Obama. It called the deal the largest single commercial air plane purchase in Vietnam aviation history. Founded in 2007, VietJet has gained notoriety with bikini-wearing air stewardesses and along with Vietnam Airlines and Jetstar is making a major move into the lucrative Southeast Asian aviation sector. Maritime Disputes Hollande, who arrived in Vietnam with around 40 French business leaders, will spend much of Tuesday in Hanoi meeting communist top brass. He will then head south to Vietnam's economic hub Ho Chi Minh City to meet French entrepreneurs, including some from Vietnam's burgeoning tech industry. Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang said the two leaders also discussed maritime freedom, a key issue for Hanoi which has traded barbs with Beijing over competing claims in the South China Sea. “Me and the president committed to respect the rule of law in the seas and oceans, reaffirming the commitment to maintain freedom of maritime and aviation,” he said. “The two sides stressed the importance of solving disputes by peaceful means, not to use or threaten to use violence on the basis of international laws.” Tensions between Hanoi and Beijing soared in 2014 when China moved a controversial oil rig into disputed waters, sparking angry riots in Vietnam. Hollande's official agenda does not include any plans to discuss human rights or freedom of expression in the tightly run communist country, where bloggers and dissidents are routinely jailed for criticizing the regime. Three human rights groups wrote an open letter to Hollande urging him to press Vietnamese leaders on rights issues during his two-day visit. “Activists and human rights defenders have been regularly subjected to physical assault, surveillance, restrictions on their freedom of movement, and arbitrary arrest and detention,” according to the letter by the International Federation for Human Rights, also signed by a Vietnamese and French rights group.

Photographer: STR/EPA Report says 777 had sought to touch down too far down runway Plane rose 85 feet in subsequent go-around bid before plunging Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp An Emirates jet crashed last month after trying to land too far down the runway in a strong tailwind and failing in a bid to take off again when the gusts changed direction, according to a preliminary study into the accident. The Aug. 3 crash, which injured 24 of the 300 people on board and led to the death of a firefighter on the ground, happened after Dubai International Airport issued a windshear warning while clearing the Boeing Co. 777 to land, the report from the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority says. Flight EK521 from India approached the airport in a following wind of 16 knots, with the right-hand wheels hitting the ground three seconds before the left side in an attempted touchdown that was more than a kilometer beyond the runway perimeter, triggering a “long landing” warning in the cockpit, the study says. The jet attempted a go-around maneuver and subsequently encountered a headwind, climbing to a height of only 85 feet before sinking back onto the runway at a descent rate of 900 feet a minute. The 777-300 came down on its tail and engines, with the wheels having been retracted after the aborted landing, the report says. One turbine broke off as the plane slid along the runway, causing “an intense fuel-fed fire,” with the flight’s captain issuing a Mayday call and ordering an evacuation. Explosion The firefighter was killed when a fuel tank exploded, sending a 15-meter (50-foot) wing section into the air, about nine minutes after the plane had come to rest and the blaze had appeared to be under control. A flight attendant was hospitalized for five days with smoke inhalation, with all other injuries classified as minor. The aircraft itself was destroyed. The crash was the worst in the 30-year history of Dubai-based Emirates, the world’s biggest airline by international traffic. The preliminary report didn’t say whether the plane should have been allowed to land, or if its pilots behaved correctly during the approach and subsequent go-around attempt. Further findings will be released in due course, with the aircraft’s performance, technical and engineering aspects, the airline’s procedures, air navigation provision, firefighting measures and weather forecasting all under scrutiny, the regulator said.

NASA OIG said in an audit report published Thursday that it also found delays in the agency’s assessment and approval of requests for variances and hazard reports submitted by Boeing and SpaceX as part of the certification process. NASA has also failed to track the timeliness of its process for safety reviews, according to the report. OIG’s audit report, which is a follow-up to the November 2013 review of the Commercial Review Program, also revealed that NASA has decided to extend its contract with the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, to bring astronauts to the ISS through 2018 at approximately $490 million in additional cost due to delays in the program. The inspector general has asked NASA’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations to enforce methods to monitor the timeliness of its review process. NASA should also collaborate with SpaceX and Boeing to facilitate reviews of hazard reports and variance requests in a timely manner, the IG added. The report also noted that NASA said it will continue to conduct weekly meetings with its two contractors to address such reports.

The Boeing-built land-based nuclear deterrent was test fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California by a team of Air Force Global Strike Command Airmen from the 341st Missile Wing. The testing was aimed at validating the operational credibility of the ICBM system. The re-entry vehicle, comprising of a telemetry package used for operational testing, travelled approximately 4,200 miles to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Air Force Task Force commander lieutenant colonel Ron Clough said: “I’m extremely proud of the 21 maintainers and operators from the 341st Missile Wing Task Force who worked flawlessly alongside the professionals from the 576th Flight Test Squadron to make this mission a success. "An effort on this scale, and the enormous insights it gives to force readiness, continue to showcase the Minuteman III as the world's premier deterrence and assurance capability." “An effort on this scale, and the enormous insights it gives to force readiness, continue to showcase the Minuteman III as the world's premier deterrence and assurance capability.” The test launches verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system, by providing data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent. The data collected from test launches will be used by the ICBM community, including the US Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and US Strategic Command for continuing force development evaluation.

The agreement, witnessed by French President François Hollande, who is visiting Vietnam, provides for the aircraft to be delivered between 2017 and 2020. Airbus Tuesday also said it signed a memorandum of understanding with Vietnam Airlines to acquire 10 more A350-900 long-range jets, doubling the size of it fleet of the widebody planes. The deal carries a list price value of about $3 billion. The order underscores the rapid expansion of the budget carrier since it began operating in 2011. The country's only privately owned carrier, VietJet is also set to become Vietnam's largest carrier, eclipsing state-owned rival Vietnam Airlines, aviation analysts say. In addition to Tuesday's announcement and the previous $11 billion order with Boeing to buy 737 jets, unveiled during U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to the country in May, VietJet agreed last year to buy 30 Airbus A321 planes for $3.6 billion. "VietJet is developing robustly and sustainably with an aim at better serving our passengers and promoting tourism and economic development in Vietnam and other regional countries," said airline President and CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao. Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in Asia, which itself is one of the fastest-growing regions for the industry. VietJet previously has noted that the Vietnam market has grown 20% in each of the past three years, and the airline is adding new international routes to cater to growing demand for outbound travel from the country's growing middle class. Airbus also said it finalized a purchase agreement with Vietnam's Jetstar Pacific Airlines for the sale of 10 A320 single-aisle planes valued at $980 million at list prices. The carrier owned, by Vietnam Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd., is already leasing 12 of the Airbus narrowbodies, the European plane maker said. Robert Wall in London contributed to this article.

Two U.S. astronauts sailed through a seven-hour spacewalk outside the International Space Station on Thursday to pack up a spare cooling radiator and tackle other maintenance, a NASA TV broadcast showed. In their second spacewalk in two weeks, Commander Jeffrey Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins left the station's airlock around 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) as the station orbited 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. "It's good to be out here," said Rubins, 37. On Aug. 19, Rubins and Williams installed a docking system to enable commercial space taxis currently in development to park at the station, breaking Russia's monopoly on crew transport. Test flights of Space Exploration Technology's Crew Dragon capsule are expected to begin next year, followed by the debut of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner in 2018. It was not immediately known what impact, if any, the loss of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during a routine prelaunch test in Florida on Thursday would have on the company's other programs. For Thursday's spacewalk, the astronauts headed to the far end of the station to retract a radiator that was last used in 2012. See Also: A student at Moi University dies during abortion Folding up the panel will protect it from strikes by micrometeors and orbital debris, NASA flight director Zeb Scoville told an Aug. 24 news conference. "We really want to be able to get it retracted and covered up so we can count on it in the future, should the need arise," Scoville said. Williams, making his fifth spacewalk, and Rubins then tackled several maintenance tasks, including installing a high-definition camera on the station's truss so ground controllers can better inspect the Russian Soyuz capsules that ferry crew members to and from the station, a $100 billion project in which 15 countries are participating. Williams, along with Russian cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, are scheduled to climb aboard one of the two Soyuz capsules docked at the station on Tuesday, ending their 172-day mission. Williams, 58, will return home as NASA's most-experienced astronaut. During his four spaceflights, including three stints aboard the space station, Williams surpassed the 520-day cumulative record of former U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly, with 534 days in orbit.

Source: AAP 6 Sep 2016 - 1:24 PM  UPDATED 6 Sep 2016 - 1:24 PM Tweet Australia is poised to benefit from billions of dollars in defence exports to the United States, US Ambassador to Australia John Berry says. Speaking at the Land Forces defence exhibition in Adelaide on Tuesday, Mr Berry said the event had attracted attention from US defence giants Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. "(They) are here today because they know the value of the Australian market and the mutual benefits that accrue from our joint collaboration," he said. "Ours is not just a strategic partnership - it is an economic one as well." Mr Berry said Australia was the third-biggest importer worldwide of defence systems, spending more than $US2 billion ($A2.6 billion) with "a good part of that" on US defence industries. But it was not a one-way street, with the involvement of Australian defence technology companies in the massive Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program to create $US4 billion of exports for Australia. The US also hoped to partner in the development of Australia's $20 billion Land 400 armoured fighting vehicles, which Mr Berry described as the "JSF of the land".

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday November 19, 2016 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Pilot Chris Higgins shares his success story Lisa Tisdell@tisdell_lisa 6 Sep 2016, noon Pilot Chris Higgins and Hastings District Flying Club are inspiring the next generation of pilots. Living the dream: Pilot Chris Higgins at the controls of the RV8 aircraft built by Bob Needham’s son Anson. Mr Higgins is an American-based pilot. BECOMING a pilot was Chris Higgins’ link to freedom from poverty. As a teenager living west of Wauchope, he simply wanted to fly a plane. Support from Hastings District Flying Club members helped make that dream a reality. Mr Higgins, who started learning to fly with Bob Needham in 1984, now flies VIPs around the world. He said being a pilot had allowed him to remain optimistic. “It gave me a lot of pride and was a story of hope for my family and friends,” Mr Higgins said. His career has ranged from being a bush pilot to teaching aerobatics, working as an airline instructor and company oral examiner on the Boeing 75/767, and being a private jet pilot. Mr Higgins said he had tremendous support in the early days from Hastings District Flying Club and others at Port Macquarie Airport. Petrochemical engineer Hans Westphal helped the youngster bridge the gap in maths, physics and chemistry. That set up Mr Higgins to ace his commercial theory licence on the first attempt. “For a child who did not respond well in the formal tutorial world of the school desk and blackboard, the painless learning of a social environment was a much more effective way of teaching me at that point,” he said. “Those kinds of experiences in a social environment are an essential part of the air safety equation in the learning environment of a young aviator.” He advised aspiring pilots to dream as big as possible. “But if you get diverted along the way, you can’t lose heart,” Mr Higgins said. “You have to be prepared to change your goals to suit the circumstances, the times, the economy, your love interests and everything else as you go.” Mr Higgins said Hastings District Flying Club had a wonderful history of taking young men and women through the mentoring and formal instruction process. Two flying scholarships are up for grabs courtesy of the Hastings District Flying Club and Chris Higgins. The scholarships are each valued at $1200. Mr Higgins hopes the scholarships will have the same life changing influence on its recipients as the flying club had on his life. The scholarship applications closed on August 31. Hastings District Flying Club president Rod Davison said learning to fly was very character building. The club members see the young people mature and grow in confidence. Mr Davison said the club appreciated Mr Higgins’ kind sponsorship gesture. The club has a proud history dating back to 1958.

Speaking at the Land Forces defence exhibition in Adelaide on Tuesday, Mr Berry said the event had attracted attention from US defence giants Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. "(They) are here today because they know the value of the Australian market and the mutual benefits that accrue from our joint collaboration," he said. "Ours is not just a strategic partnership - it is an economic one as well." Mr Berry said Australia was the third-biggest importer worldwide of defence systems, spending more than $US2 billion ($A2.6 billion) with "a good part of that" on US defence industries. But it was not a one-way street, with the involvement of Australian defence technology companies in the massive Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program to create $US4 billion of exports for Australia. The US also hoped to partner in the development of Australia's $20 billion Land 400 armoured fighting vehicles, which Mr Berry described as the "JSF of the land". BAE Systems Australia and a partnership between German company Rheinmetall Landsysteme Gmbh and US firm Northrop Grumman have been shortlisted to deliver the vehicles. Mr Berry said the US and Australia had a shared vision to strengthen the "rules-based international order" and a key feature of their partnership was the development of compatible and innovative defence systems. "It is a vision enshrined in Australia's Defence White Paper and one that you can count on the US to uphold its partnership in ," Mr Berry said.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other The Green Run – SLS preparing for milestone static fire tests September 5, 2016 by Philip Sloss The NASA and contractor workforce at Stennis Space Center are nearing completion of structural work on the B-2 test stand that will be used for the Green Run test of the Space Launch System (SLS) Core Stage before its first flight.  In addition to SLS Core Stage testing, planning is now also underway for the stand to support a similar “green run” test of the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS). The Green Run: As structural modifications are finishing, work to activate the test stand is increasing and the test team is beginning work to define Green Run procedures. “We are near completion of what we would call restoration and buildout of the test stand – the removal and replacement of parts and existing structure,” Travis Martin, Lead Systems Engineer for the SLS Green Run Test Project, said in an interview with NASASpaceflight.com.  “That is coming to completion at the end of this fiscal year. “As far as activation is concerned, technically we started activation about six months ago, but that’s at [the] subsystem level. Actual activation of the test stand is not slated to start until later this calendar year.” The B-2 test stand was originally constructed in the 1960s and first supported testing of the Saturn V first stage, the S-IC. It was also used to test the Space Shuttle Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA) in the late 1970s and early 1980s and in more recent times the Delta IV Common Booster Core in the 2000s. Buildout of the stand was required due to the length of the SLS Core Stage, which stretches to almost 212 feet from the top of the forward skirt to the exit plane of the four RS-25 engines at the bottom. In addition, the stand was configured for the off-axis, side-mounted Shuttle MPTA thrust; the MPTA thrust structure was therefore out of position for the inline SLS Core Stage. Rather than demolish the existing structure and build a new one, it was decided that it would be more cost-effective to move the existing MPTA structure about twenty-feet to an inline position and then renovate it.  The move was completed in August, 2014. Activation work: While the structural work continues, Mr. Martin noted some of the subsystem activation work also beginning. “The first item that we’ll focus on when it comes to activation of the test stand is the data acquisition system,” he explained. “Currently, we have completed installation of all the new data acquisition hardware that is specific to B-2 and we’re going to upgrade the rest of the site with the same hardware. “So that’s the actual data acquisition system, recording hardware, all the sensing lines up into the interface boxes before we actually connect to a wire to the Core Stage.  We started activation on the LOX vent system, that’s a shared system between B-1 and B-2. “We also have done some upgrades to the high-pressure industrial water facility, specifically we’ve commissioned the use of a new 25,000-gallon per minute electric pump, which is needed to supply the extra acoustical damping we need for the Core Stage test.” Martin also noted that Stennis has completed renovation and activation of a Shuttle hydraulic skid they received from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) ground operations. Green run schedule: The B-2 test stand work is to get ready for a major development milestone for the SLS Core Stage, the Green Run test, which will essentially fly the Core Stage in place on the test stand through a nominal, eight-minute launch and ascent. See Also SLS Forum Section L2 RS-25 Section L2 SLS Section Click here to Join L2 Green Run test activities will involve several firsts, including the first cold flows, the first full tanking, and the first hot fire of the four RS-25 engines integrated with the Core Stage propulsion system. Given all the firsts, the plan is for the Core Stage to be at Stennis for several months. “We still expect to see the Core Stage for September 2017 arrival and we expect to have the Core Stage anywhere between six to eight months,” Mr. Martin said. One of the first operations that will be done on the stage after arrival is what is called a “modal test.” “A modal test is, let’s say, a vibration test to determine the resonant frequency of a structure or part,” he added. “We’ve already characterized the test stand and we want to insure that the Core Stage resonant frequency is not coupled with the test stand. “There are a number of ways to do it, but we haven’t determined which method [yet] – whether we’re going to do mechanical shakers or a calibrated hammer to actually ping the Core Stage while it’s suspended inches above the test stand.  That work will not be done by Stennis, it will actually be done by Marshall.” In a general overview of the Green Run operations with the first Core Stage, the outline also includes a key element of the Shuttle era, the tanking test, ahead of firing up the engines. “In general, we advertise that we plan to do a modal test – a suspended modal test, a fill and drain test or ‘tanking test’ as we called it back on Shuttle, and then a hot-fire test – a full duration hot-fire test, which is approximately 480 seconds.” “If all goes well with that hot-fire test, then we plan to do the standard refurbishment needed to the Core Stage, defined by an integrated plan between [NASA] and Boeing, and then we’ll put it back on Pegasus and send it on to KSC. “If we deem it needed by analysis there afterward, we would do a second hot-fire test before removing the Core Stage from the test stand. “Between modal test and wet-dress [fill and drain test], there are a number of subsystem checkouts, so we’ll do thrust vector control checkouts [and] we’ll do vehicle power-up checkouts. “Before the tanking test, we’ll go do a full simulated countdown and hot-fire demonstration test – there will be no fluids flowing, but through software simulation we will induce test conditions, induce faults, and practice our recovery [from those].” Work on the detailed operations plan for the Green Test began this month, which will be finalized via simulations of the test procedures. “Starting in September, the Stennis operations team including myself and the Boeing operations team will start developing that integrated plan and procedure and we will in the future walk-through and go do simulations of [the plan],” Mr. Martin noted. “The actual simulations hopefully will coincide with some of the facility activations.” NASA is planning on a month’s worth of refurbishment work on the stage at Stennis after the full-duration hot-fire, including standard engine servicing and making any repairs necessary to the stage’s thermal protection system (TPS). “We’ve added additional personnel access structures to the engine servicing level for the Aerojet Rocketdyne personnel to do what they need to do to the engines – to refurbish, plug them up before we actually put it back on the barge,” Mr. Martin noted. “When it comes to TPS, we actually have additional structures and access platforms for the Boeing personnel.” Pathfinder visit: Prior to the arrival of the flight unit, Stennis will get an opportunity to practice handling a Core Stage when a pathfinder article arrives there on the Pegasus barge. “The expected delivery date of the Pathfinder vehicle is July 2017, a few months before the advertised delivery date for the Core Stage,” Mr. Martin said. “We intend to have the Pathfinder in our possession [for] about two weeks.” Currently under construction, the Core Stage pathfinder will have the same dimensions as the flight units, along with the same handling attachments and umbilical plate locations. “We want to do three major things with the Pathfinder: we want to practice the lifting procedure, which is the lifting and breaking over of the Core Stage, we’ll practice that with the Pathfinder multiple times.  Also, inserting the Pathfinder in and out of the test stand itself, verifying structural clearances, at least three times or more. “We also verify our umbilical carrier mechanisms – we want to check the alignment of those.”  The Core Stage has four umbilical panels where services are supplied to the different subsystems – one on the forward skirt, one on the intertank, and the two on the engine section. A lot of cryos: When it comes time to load the stage for the Green Run “wet” tests, it will take much of the infrastructure at Stennis that supports testing hydrolox engines and stages. “Here on site we have four LOX barges and three [liquid] hydrogen barges; all those barges plus a topping tank – that’s a ground tank for liquid oxygen — will be needed to conduct the Green Run test,” Mr. Martin explained. When asked about supplying the stage with all the different commodities needed for a full-duration firing, Martin noted that the hot-fire is not the limiting case: “The worst-case is not the hot-fire test, the worst-case is the tanking test, and that requires from start to finish about 22 hours of supplying of gases to the Core Stage,” he added. This includes not just the cryogenic propellant, but also things like hydraulics and purge gasses. “We will fill every barge to their capacity or just above that to maintain margin. We will overfill our high-pressure industrial water reservoir, so we’ll have margin there. “And we’ve done modifications for the site-wide gas supply – for [gaseous] hydrogen, helium, nitrogen — to accommodate the increased usage of nitrogen to do purges, to warming the empty compartments — the forward skirt, the engine section, and the intertank – as well as engine drying and tank [inerting].” EUS Green Run in the future: Plans are for the first two Core Stage flight articles to go through Green Run testing at Stennis. With the EUS (Exploration Upper Stage) development beginning to proceed – with the preliminary design review is in December – the current plan is to modify and use the B-2 stand for that stage when the time comes. Since EUS will fly on the second SLS launch, both hydrolox stages will need to be fired at Stennis before heading to KSC for launch processing; however, the timeline and order for that is still to be determined. “It has not been determined if the upper stage will be tested in between Core Stage 1 and Core Stage 2,” Mr. Martin explained. “If so, then the test stand will stay in an active status. “If upper stage testing lags after Core Stage 2 testing, then the test stand will go into what we call an active standby status.” (Images: Via NASA and L2 – including Philip Sloss for NASASpaceFlight.com and SLS renders from L2 artist Nathan Koga – The full gallery of Nathan’s (SpaceX Dragon to MCT, SLS, Commercial Crew and more) L2 images can be *found here*) (To join L2, click here: https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/) No related posts.

The company was very likely preparing a bid for the launch of another GPS III communications satellite just as it was also preparing to launch its first GPS III later this year. The Falcon 9 launch vehicle that blew up last week is the same one that SpaceX will use to launch the U.S. government satellites. Another Falcon 9 exploded shortly after launch in June of last year, but since then the company had successfully completed eight missions this year. The company’s main competitor is United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT), that pulled out of the bidding for the coming launch of the GPS III satellite but which the Air Force hopes will bid on the next launch. ULA pulled out of the earlier bidding because it could not use the Russian-made engines due to a congressional restriction on the number of the engines the company could use. ULA has no U.S. source for rocket engines. In addition to this new setback for SpaceX, ULA has a couple of other things going for it. Breaking Defense has called attention to what is known as “Assured Access to Space,” a federal requirement that the United States must have two launch providers “capable of delivering into space any payload designated by the Secretary of Defense or the Director of National Intelligence as a national security payload; and a robust space launch infrastructure and industrial base.” That would seem to obviate the requirement for non-Russian engines. The other problem for SpaceX is that the company had six more launches scheduled from this pad by the end of 2016. Until the cause of last week’s explosion is isolated and a fix is in place and the pad itself is repaired, those plans are on hold. Depending on the timing for launching the government satellites, another exception may be made for ULA. Another point in ULA’s favor is that it has successfully completed 110 consecutive launches.

Over the weekend Israeli company Space Communication (or Spacecom) threatened to go after SpaceX for $50 million or a free flight after SpaceX blew up the Spacecom satellite that was on board the ill-fated rocket, Reuters reported. Spacecom shares dropped 9 percent after the explosion, and its equity was expected to drop by $30 million, according to the report. And the fiery disaster may have cost Spacecom its planned $285 sale to Chinese company Xinwei Technology Group — a deal that hinged on the successful launch of that Amos-6 communications satellite, The New York Times reported. Facebook was going to use the satellite as part of its plan to bring low-cost internet access to less-developed countries. The explosion comes as space travel is increasingly becoming a commercial venture, and private companies are vying to edge into the field that previously was controlled exclusively by NASA, the military and other government programs. Experts say last Thursday s bust could set back these efforts. NASA ended its shuttle program in 2011 and since then U.S. astronauts and equipment have hitched rides into space on Russian vehicles. NASA had expected to resume launching with U.S.-made boosters and capsules from SpaceX and Boeing in less than two years, The Wall Street Journal reported, but the explosion — coupled with other setbacks — could delay the process and force the U.S. to buy more seats on Russian rockets. SpaceX has said it s investigating the cause of the explosion. The blow-up damaged its launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX s business is robust, with approximately 70 missions on our manifest worth over $10 billion, the company wrote in an online post after the explosion, which it referred to as an anomaly. Meanwhile, a SpaceX explosion conspiracy theory has surfaced. In video of the event, a small object can be seen flying overhead just before the rocket is consumed by a fireball. Some on the internet say the object is a UFO, while others theorize it s a government drone that fired a projectile and blew up the rocket. Or … it may have been a bird.

The airline intends to redeem $700 million of U.S. dollar first- and second-lien bonds maturing in 2019 and 2020, as well as C$300 million ($233 million) of Canadian dollar bonds maturing in 2019, Air Canada said in a statement Tuesday. The arrangement includes plans to refinance its existing senior secured credit facility as well as the notes, the Montreal-based company said. Air Canada is in the midst of a plan to trim its key cost ratio by about 21 percent by 2018. To get there, the carrier is cramming more passengers on long-haul aircraft, expanding the low-cost Rouge leisure unit and adding fuel-efficient jets such as Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner. Airfares are under pressure as U.S. airlines add capacity, with Air Canada’s yields on trans-Atlantic routes falling 9.6 percent in the second quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. Air Canada plans to redeem the U.S. dollar first-lien notes at an average weighted price of 103.34 cents on the dollar and the Canadian dollar notes at 103.73, the company said. The second-lien notes will be redeemed at 100 percent of the principal amount plus interest. The company had C$6.4 billion in long-term debt and finance leases as of June 30, according to second-quarter results. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Vardhan said the government has earmarked ₹500 crore to scale up the start-up eco system, under which seed funding of up to ₹10 lakh will be given to develop a prototype and access fabrication facilities in incubators. He said thereafter the department will also help connect the innovators with angel investors and venture capitalists. The department has already held camps to promote NIDHI in 4,000 colleges, he added. The Minister said the department has partnered with large international corporates, such as Intel, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Texas Instruments, to initiate technology-driven, innovation-based programmes to promote start-ups. “The existing total incubation space in the country of about 7 lakh square feet will soon be expanded to 20 lakh square feet,” he added. Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Science and Technology Ministry said: “As opposed to 100 incubators set up in the past 30 years, the government plans to develop 200 in the next five years.” (This article was published on September 6, 2016) Related TOPICS science and technology | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

Credit: NASA Less than a week after winding up a successful spacewalk, outgoing space station commander Jeff Williams, America’s most experienced astronaut, will join two Russian cosmonauts for a fiery descent to Earth Tuesday evening to close out a 172-day mission covering 2,752 orbits and 72.8 million miles since launch last March. “I will certainly miss this view!” Williams tweeted from the station early Tuesday, sending down a photo of Earth’s limb in brilliant sunlight. “Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family.” In a change-of-command ceremony Monday, Williams, 58, said leaving the station marked a “bitter-sweet” time for the departing crew members, saying all three were “ready to go home and be with our families.” “We’ve enjoyed a great stay up here over the last five-and-a-half months,” he said. “This is a very significant time, in my opinion, in the life of the space station, going into the full utilization mode, being the orbiting laboratory we’ve always said it was going to be.” He thanked his family, friends and space station personnel on the ground, saying “we could not have done this without their sacrifice and their support and encouragement. We look forward to seeing our families very, very soon.” Williams, Soyuz TMA-20M commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka plan to undock from the International Space Station’s upper Poisk module at 5:51 p.m. EDT (GMT-4) Tuesday, backing away to a safe distance while they make final preparations for re-entry. Looking on from inside the station will be Expedition 49 commander Anatoly Ivanishin, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins. Launched to the station July 6 aboard the Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft, Ivanishin and his crewmates will have the space lab to themselves until Sept. 25 when three fresh crew members arrive. “We’ll be missing you here,” Ivanishin said Monday. “Have fun riding though the atmosphere, enjoy seeing plasma in the windows and have a very safe, and exceptionally soft, landing. All the best.” After making sure the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft is ready for its descent, Ovchinin, flanked on the left by Skripochka and on the right by Williams, will oversee a computer controlled de-orbit rocket firing starting at 8:21 p.m. The four-minute 41-second burn will slow the ship by 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit deep into Earth’s atmosphere. After a 25-minute free fall to just above the top of the discernible atmosphere, the three modules making up the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft will separate. A few moments after that, the central crew cabin, the only module protected by a heat shield, will slam into the atmosphere at an altitude of 62 miles and a velocity of some 17,000 mph. Using atmospheric friction to slow down, the descent module’s main parachute will deploy at an altitude of 6.7 miles and the spacecraft will land with a rocket-assisted touchdown on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan around 9:14 p.m. (7:14 a.m. Wednesday local time). Recovery crews stationed nearby will help the returning crew members out of the cramped descent module, carry out brief medical exams and fly all three back to Karaganda where Williams will board a NASA jet for the long flight back home to Houston. Jeff Williams, Alexei Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka line up for final qualification exams in February before their launch to the International Space Station. Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls Asked what he was looking forward to the most, Williams said “obviously, family is the first thing, my wife, she’s the real hero in all this putting up with me being up here that many days.” “I look forward to quiet, just relaxing someplace, enjoying the views, enjoying the smells of Earth, all those things that we normally take for granted,” he told CBS News last month. “You miss that when you’re up here. We have continuous noise up here from fans and pumps, it’s not loud, but it’s continuous.” All in all, he said, “just the simple things in life. Good food, anything my wife wants to cook, I look forward to that, those kinds of things, friends.” Williams and his two crewmates were launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 18 and landing closes out a busy increment highlighted by two spacewalks, the arrival of two Russian Progress cargo ships, a pair of SpaceX Dragon freighters, an Orbital ATK Cygnus supply craft and the Soyuz MS-01 crew. During a spacewalk Aug. 19, Williams and Rubins attached a new docking mechanism to the front of the station that will allow new commercial crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to dock at the lab complex, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russia’s Soyuz for transportation. During a second spacewalk last Thursday, Rubins and Williams, making his fifth EVA overall, retracted a cooling radiator, installed two high-definition cameras and performed other routine maintenance. The two astronauts logged 12 hours and 46 minutes during the two excursions, pushing Williams’ overall total through five EVAs to 31 hours and 55 minutes. Those spacewalks cover much of the history of the International Space Station with his first excursion coming during a shuttle maintenance mission in May 2000. He then ventured outside a second time with a Russian cosmonaut in June 2006 to perform maintenance on the Russian segment of the station. Two months after that, he went back outside with a European Space Agency astronaut to work on the station’s cooling system. Williams served as commander of Expedition 22 during his second long-duration stay aboard the lab and again as commander of Expedition 48 during this most recent mission. With touchdown, Ovchinin, completing his first space flight, will have logged 172 days in space while flight engineer Skripochka’s record over two flights will stand at 331 days. For Williams, the end of the mission marked a personal milestone. On Aug. 20, he surpassed the U.S. record for most cumulative time in space — 520 days — that was set earlier this year by astronaut Scott Kelly at the end of his nearly yearlong mission. With landing Tuesday, Williams’ mark will stand at 534 days aloft over four missions, moving him up to 14th on the list of most experienced spacemen. The overall record is held by Gennady Padalka, who has logged 878 days in space over five missions. “I appreciate, Jeff, your efforts as space station commander,” Ivanishin said during the change-of-command ceremony. “I’ll take care of the crew and the station. And I promise you, when you return to celebrate your first 1,000 days in space, the station will be in better shape!” Williams, Ovchinin and Skripochka will be replaced aboard the station by the Soyuz MS-02 crew, scheduled for launch from Baikonur on Sept. 23. After a two-day rendezvous, vehicle commander Andrey Borisenko, flight engineer Sergey Ryzhikov and NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough will dock at the Poisk module to boost the lab’s crew back to six. Ivanishin, Onishi and Rubins are scheduled to return to Earth Oct. 30.

Low-cost private airline VietJet, known for its bikini-clad hostesses, bought 20 planes while national carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Jetstar Pacific bought 10 each in “deals worth US$6.5 billion,” Airbus Asia spokesman Sean Lee said. It did not provide a breakdown of each deal’s value. It is the first deal between Airbus and Jetstar Pacific, which said in July it was planning to buy 10 single-aisle A320 aircraft. Vietnam Airlines, which owns 70 percent of Jetstar Pacific, will buy 10 Airbus A350 planes, according to officials at a signing ceremony attended by Hollande and Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang in Hanoi. VietJet said it would buy 20 A321 planes to boost its current fleet of 34 Airbus planes. The VietJet deal comes after it purchased 100 passenger jets from US aircraft maker Boeing for US$11.3 billion in May, during a visit by US President Barack Obama. It called the deal the largest single commercial airplane purchase in Vietnam aviation history. VietJet, founded in 2007, is making a major move into the lucrative Southeast Asian aviation sector. Southeast Asia is seen as key growth market for budget air travel, driven by the region’s growing middle class, many of whom are travelling for the first time.

Descending under a billowing orange-and-white parachute, the charred Soyuz crew module completed a jarring rocket-assisted touchdown at 9:13 p.m. EDT (GMT-4; 7:13 a.m. Wednesday local time). The Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft is seen as it lands with Expedition 48 crew members NASA astronaut Jeff Williams, Russian cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin, and Oleg Skripochka of Roscosmos near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan on Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2016(Kazakh time). NASA/Bill Ingalls, (NASA/Bill Ingalls) As sometimes happens, the capsule tipped over on its side after landing, but Russian recovery crews stationed nearby were on the scene in minutes to tilt the spacecraft upright and to help the station fliers, getting their first taste of gravity in five-and-a-half months, out of the cramped compartment. Williams, Soyuz commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka appeared healthy and in good spirits as they were carried out of the descent module and set down in recliners for satellite phone calls home while flight surgeons carried out quick medical checks. Outgoing space station commander Jeff Williams, left, Soyuz TMA-20M commander Alexey Ovchinin, center, and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka relax in recliners on the steppe of Kazakhstan after an on-target landing. Recovery crews planned to fly all three crew members by helicopter to Karaganda later in the day for an official welcome home ceremony. From there, Williams was to board a NASA jet for the long flight back home to Houston. Ovchinin and Skripochka planned to head for Star City near Moscow for debriefing and reunions with family members. “I will certainly miss this view!” Williams tweeted from the station early Tuesday, sending down a photo of Earth’s limb in brilliant sunlight. “Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family.” “We’ve enjoyed a great stay up here over the last five-and-a-half months,” he said earlier. “This is a very significant time, in my opinion, in the life of the space station, going into the full utilization mode, being the orbiting laboratory we’ve always said it was going to be.”   Russian recovery crews presented Ovchinin with a watermelon shortly after landing. NASA/Roscosmos Williams, Ovchinin and Skripochka undocked from the lab’s upper Poisk module at 5:51 p.m., slowly backing away as the two spacecraft passed more than 250 miles above the western Pacific Ocean. Looking on from inside the station were Expedition 49 commander Anatoly Ivanishin, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins. Launched to the station July 6 aboard the Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft, Ivanishin and his crewmates will have the space lab to themselves until Sept. 25 when three fresh crew members arrive. “We’ll be missing you here,” Ivanishin said Monday during a change-of-command ceremony. “Have fun riding though the atmosphere, enjoy seeing plasma in the windows and have a very safe, and exceptionally soft, landing. All the best.” After making sure the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft was ready for its descent, Ovchinin, flanked on the left by Skripochka and on the right by Williams, monitored a computer controlled de-orbit rocket firing starting at 8:21 p.m. The four-minute 41-second burn slowed the ship by 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit deep into Earth’s atmosphere. After a 25-minute free fall to just above the top of the discernible atmosphere, the three modules making up the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft separated. A few moments after that, the central crew cabin, the only module protected by a heat shield, slammed into the atmosphere at an altitude of 62 miles and a velocity of some 17,000 mph. Using atmospheric friction to slow down, the descent module’s main parachute deployed at an altitude of a little less than seven miles and the spacecraft settled to the steppe of Kazakhstan. Jeff Williams, front left, Oleg Skripochka, front center, and Soyuz TMA-20M commander Alexey Ovchinin, front right, hand over the station to their Soyuz MS-01 crewmates during a change-of-command ceremony Monday. Floating behind them are Kate Rubins, back left, Expedition 49 commander Anatoly Ivanishin, back center, and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi. NASA Asked what he was looking forward to the most, Williams said “obviously, family is the first thing, my wife, she’s the real hero in all this putting up with me being up here that many days.” “I look forward to quiet, just relaxing someplace, enjoying the views, enjoying the smells of Earth, all those things that we normally take for granted,” he told CBS News last month. “You miss that when you’re up here. We have continuous noise up here from fans and pumps; it’s not loud, but it’s continuous.” All in all, he said, “just the simple things in life. Good food, anything my wife wants to cook, I look forward to that, those kinds of things, friends.” Williams and his two crewmates were launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 18 and landing closes out a busy increment highlighted by two spacewalks, the arrival of two Russian Progress cargo ships, a pair of SpaceX Dragon freighters, an Orbital ATK Cygnus supply craft and the Soyuz MS-01 crew. During a spacewalk Aug. 19, Williams and Rubins attached a new docking mechanism to the front of the station that will allow new commercial crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to dock at the lab complex, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russia’s Soyuz for transportation. During a second spacewalk last Thursday, Rubins and Williams, making his fifth EVA overall, retracted a cooling radiator, installed two high-definition cameras and performed other routine maintenance. The two astronauts logged 12 hours and 46 minutes during the two excursions, pushing Williams’ overall total through five EVAs to 31 hours and 55 minutes. Those spacewalks cover much of the history of the International Space Station with his first excursion coming during a shuttle maintenance mission in May 2000. He then ventured outside a second time with a Russian cosmonaut in June 2006 to perform maintenance on the Russian segment of the station. Two months after that, he went back outside with a European Space Agency astronaut to work on the station’s cooling system. Williams served as commander of Expedition 22 during his second long-duration stay aboard the lab and again as commander of Expedition 48 during this most recent mission. Astronaut Kate Rubins captured this photo of the Soyuz re-entry. The crew compartment, protected by a heat shield, can be seen at lower left while the upper and lower equipment and propulsion modules can be seen burning up in the atmosphere. NASA With touchdown, Ovchinin, completing his first space flight, will have logged 172 days in space while flight engineer Skripochka’s record over two flights will stand at 331 days. For Williams, the end of the mission marked a personal milestone. On Aug. 20, he surpassed the U.S. record for most cumulative time in space -- 520 days -- that was set earlier this year by astronaut Scott Kelly at the end of his nearly yearlong mission. With landing Tuesday, Williams’ mark will stand at 534 days aloft over four missions, moving him up to 14th on the list of most experienced spacemen. The overall record is held by Gennady Padalka, who has logged 878 days in space over five missions. “I appreciate, Jeff, your efforts as space station commander,” Ivanishin said during the change-of-command ceremony. “I’ll take care of the crew and the station. And I promise you, when you return to celebrate your first 1,000 days in space, the station will be in better shape!” Williams, Ovchinin and Skripochka will be replaced aboard the station by the Soyuz MS-02 crew, scheduled for launch from Baikonur on Sept. 23. After a two-day rendezvous, vehicle commander Andrey Borisenko, flight engineer Sergey Ryzhikov and NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough will dock at the Poisk module to boost the lab’s crew back to six. Ivanishin, Onishi and Rubins are scheduled to return to Earth Oct. 30. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

"Plus, the government will now also act as a facilitator to these start ups apart from giving them any funding. To give start ups a boost, the government has increased funding to these incubators from Rs 40 crore to Rs 180 crore," he said. Apart from setting the ground ready for the prospective start ups, the DST has also partnered with corporates like Intel, Lockheed Martin and Boeing to initiate variety of technology-driven and innovation-based programmes. Further the DST has also partnered with Department of Higher Education of the HRD Ministry to establish research parks and Start Up centres in various academic institutions of national importance.

PKL Services gets $495 million Saudi F-15 support contract by Geoff Ziezulewicz Washington (UPI) Sep 2, 2016 disclaimer: image is for illustration purposes only PKL Services has been awarded a $495 million U.S. Air Force contract for work on the Royal Saudi Air Force's F-15 fleet. The indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract covers maintenance, upgrade and training of the Saudi Strike Eagle S- and SA-type fighters. Work will be performed and has an estimated completion date of August 2021. The contract is 100 percent foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia. The 338th Specialized Contracting Squadron is the contracting activity. The Royal Saudi Air Force has flown the F-15S fighters since the 1990s, Boeing said. The F-15SA was rolled out in 2013 and featured improved performance and increased survivability at a lower life-cycle cost. It also features two additional wing stations for increased payload and capability.

CGCN Group – one of the most prominent GOP lobbying shops in D.C. – is launching the arm to help generate and shape stories for its more than 50 lobbying clients. Story Continued Below “We’ve wanted to add a communications practice for years but needed the right person to head it up. No one knows the media quite like a former reporter,” said Sam Geduldig, a partner in the firm who was a House Republican leadership staffer. “Patrick was always at the top of our list because he’s so respected by his peers and the politicians he covered.” CGCN, which also recently added former top House Republican leadership staffer John Stipicevic to its team, is following in line with a growing trend in D.C. With Congress increasingly stagnant, lobbying firms are not only waging war on Capitol Hill, but also in the press. CGCN has grown exponentially since Republicans took over Congress in 2010. It boasts clients like 21st Century Fox, Microsoft, MasterCard and Boeing. O’Connor has been at the Wall Street Journal since 2010, covering Congress and national politics. He was one of the first reporters hired by POLITICO, and was one of the lead reporters covering Democrats’ battle to pass an overhaul of the nation’s health care laws early in Barack Obama’s first term. He worked at Bloomberg News before joining the Journal. “Patrick is the complete pro,” said Wall Street Journal bureau chief Jerry Seib. “Smart, analytical, well-liked, well-sourced. He has the total package for a political reporter, and we'll really miss him. But I also understand that those very same attributes make him attractive in his new life as well.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Jake Sherman sherman@politico.com @JakeSherman Show Comments Politico Magazine ‘My Language Is My Language, But I’m a Vermonter’ By Erick Trickey The Bitter Feud Behind the Law That Could Keep Jared Kushner Out of the White House By Josh Zeitz America’s First All-Renewable-Energy City By Colin Woodard The Return of ‘Inner Circle’ Frenzy By Jack Shafer More on POLITICO Core Footer - dropdown links U.S. Edition Europe Edition POLITICO Links News POLITICO Home Magazine 2016 Elections Congress Video POLITICO Pro POLITICO Media POLITICO Florida POLITICO New Jersey POLITICO New York Events Blogs, Columns & Cartoons Roger Simon On Media Josh Gerstein Matt Wuerker Rich Lowry Cartoon Carousel Tipsheets The 2016 Blast Playbook Huddle The Friday Cover Influence Morning Agriculture Morning Cybersecurity Morning Defense Morning Education Morning eHealth Morning Energy Morning Money Morning Score Morning Shift Morning Tax Morning Tech Morning Trade Morning Transportation Pulse Prescription Pulse Policy Agriculture Campaigns Cybersecurity Defense Education eHealth Energy & Environment Finance & Tax Health Care Labor & Employment Technology Trade Transportation & Infrastructure More Info About Us Advertising Breaking News Alerts Credit Card Payments Digital Edition Employment FAQ Feedback Headlines Photos POWERJobs Press Register Subscriptions RSS/Widgets Site Map Store © 2016 POLITICO LLC Terms of Service Privacy Policy

Airbus said the planes shipped, including six A350 long-range jets, were an August record. They bring Airbus total deliveries to 400 planes in the first eight months against a target of handing over at least 650 aircraft in 2016. Airbus struggled early this year with plane deliveries amid supplier bottlenecks that caused some models to fall behind schedule, angering airline customers. It also weighed on the company's cash flow. Airbus said it had delivered 21 A350 planes this year through the end of August. It needs to ship at least 24 more in the last four months of the year to stick to plan. Another model that has struggled is the A320neo, an upgraded version of the European plane maker's popular single-aisle plane. Qatar Airways has cancelled some of the A320neo planes it had ordered because of delays with that model. Airbus said in its monthly update that order cancellations this year have now reached 79 planes, up from 50 cancellations in the prior month. Most are for single-aisle models, where its backlog of planes yet to be built is massive after years of strong order bookings. The plane maker also said it had booked 144 new jetliner orders in August. All the deals were for narrowbodies. Airbus and rival Boeing Co. are struggling to secure deals for long-range jets. Earlier Tuesday Airbus announced Vietnam Airlines had agreed to buy 10 more A350 planes on top of 10 it has already agreed to operate. The deal still needs to be finalized and would have a value of $3 billion at list price, though airlines typically get discounts.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version September 6, 2016 - 11:30 AMT SHARE Vietnam airlines buy 40 planes worth $6.5 bn from Airbus Vietnam airlines bought 40 airplanes worth $6.5 billion from France's Airbus on Tuesday, September 6, as President Francois Hollande visited the communist nation to drum up business ties with one of Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economies, AFP says. The deal is the latest move by Vietnamese aviation giants to boost fleets and feed demand from a mushrooming middle class with money to burn on air travel both at home and abroad. Hollande, the third French president to visit Vietnam since independence, said the "very important deals" deepened ties with its former colony where France's legacy is ubiquitous, from the country's colonial-era buildings to French-influenced cuisine. "We agreed to encourage both countries to establish economic partnerships on the basis of technology transfer," Hollande said after Airbus signed three separate deals. Low-cost private airline VietJet, known for its bikini-clad hostesses, bought 20 planes while national carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Jetstar Pacific bought 10 each in "deals worth 6.5 billion", Airbus Asia spokesman Sean Lee told AFP. He did not provide a breakdown of each deal's value, but VietJet said later in a statement it was spending $2.39 billion on its new planes. The VietJet purchase comes after it bought 100 passenger jets from U.S. aircraft maker Boeing for $11.3 billion in May, during a visit by President Barack Obama. It called the deal the largest single commercial air plane purchase in Vietnam aviation history. Founded in 2007, VietJet has gained notoriety with bikini-wearing air stewardesses and along with Vietnam Airlines and Jetstar is making a major move into the lucrative Southeast Asian aviation sector.

GDP BREAKDOWN Romania's national statistics board to release a preliminary breakdown of second-quarter gross domestic producr data at 0600 GMT. DEBT TENDER Romania sold a planned 1 billion lei ($251.22 million) worth of one-year treasury bills on Monday, with the average accepted yield at 0.56 percent, central bank data showed. CEE MARKETS Central European currencies and equities firmed on Monday after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data lowered expectations of an imminent Federal Reserve rate hike, and Poland's central bank was seen keeping its own rates on hold later in the week. EBRD The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Monday it will lend 25 million euros to Universal Alloy Corporation Europe (UACE), which manufactures aluminium parts for aircrafts and is a subsidiary of the Swiss-Austrian Montana Tech Components group. It supplies components to leading aircraft manufacturers such as Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Premium AEROTEC and will continue to train local Romanian staff. BRAAS MONIER Braas Monier said on Monday it will acquire a concrete tile plant in the southern Romanian city of Craiova. The total investment for the acquisition of the assets amounts to roughly 33 million lei ($8.28 million). FISCAL RISKS Romania's Finance Minister Anca Dragu told parliament in a letter that the European Commission could challenge Romania at the European Court of Justice for failing to keep its budget deficit below 1 percent of GDP as agreed in a fiscal treaty. The Commission is expected to release a report about how EU countries that had signed the treaty were sticking to its terms at the end of September, Dragu said.

Low-cost private airline VietJet, known for its bikini-clad hostesses, bought 20 planes while national carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Jetstar Pacific bought 10 each in "deals worth 6.5 billion", Airbus Asia spokesman Sean Lee told AFP. It did not provide a breakdown of each deal's value. It is the first deal between French aviation giant Airbus and Jetstar Pacific, which said in July it was planning to buy the 10 single-aisle A320 aircraft. Vietnam Airlines, which owns a 70 percent stake of Jetstar Pacific, will purchase 10 Airbus A350 planes, according to officials at a signing ceremony attended by Hollande and Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang in Hanoi. French President Francois Hollande (R) meets his Vietnamese counterpart Tran Dai Quang (not pictured) at the Presidential Palace in Hanoi, Vietnam, September 6, 2016. Photo by Reuters/Luong Thai Linh/Pool Vietnam's VietJet said it would buy 20 A321 planes to boost its current fleet of 34 planes, all of which are Airbus. The VietJet deal comes after it purchased 100 passenger jets from U.S. aircraft maker Boeing for $11.3 billion in May, during a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama. It called the deal the largest single commercial air plane purchase in Vietnam aviation history. VietJet, founded in 2007, has gained notoriety with bikini-wearing air stewardesses and is making a major move into the lucrative Southeast Asian aviation sector. Southeast Asia is seen as key growth market for budget air travel, driven by the region's growing middle class, many of whom are traveling for the first time.

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint New Delhi/Mumbai: Vistara, the full-service airline owned by the Tata group and Singapore Airlines Ltd, is conducting an international operations safety audit and exploring tie-ups with foreign airlines as it prepares to fly abroad, two senior company executives said. The airline, which was launched in January 2015, has hired an auditor to secure the International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s IOSA certification, which would let it finalize commercial agreements with international airlines, chief executive officer Phee Teik Yeoh said. IOSA stands for IATA Operational Safety Audit, a global industry standard. “To start up overseas operations—we are working towards it,” Yeoh said, confirming the airline has appointed an IATA-approved auditor. He, however, did not provide further details about the firm’s international plans. Almost all airlines in India, with the exception of one low-cost carrier, are IOSA certified. “Compliance with over a thousand IOSA standards and recommended practices helps an airline improve its operational safety and reduce the number of audits conducted,” IATA spokesperson Albert Tjoeng said in an email. Vistara, which was keen on international operations from the start, was stymied by a rule which mandated that new airlines had to fly locally for five years and have a fleet of 20 aircraft before venturing abroad. In June, the government removed the five-year stipulation. This means Vistara, which has 11 Airbus A320s now and plans to add two more this year, apart from seven A320Neo expected in the next fiscal year, will be eligible to launch its first overseas flight before the end of 2017-18. Vistara is already in talks with parent Singapore Airlines for a code-sharing agreement. “We are in discussions with Singapore for code sharing. They will be the first to do it with us, have initiated discussions with a couple of other airlines and it should come in another couple of months,” said Sanjiv Kapoor, chief commercial and strategy officer at Vistara, adding the airline was also “exploring bilateral relationships with the like-minded parties which are mutually beneficial”, without elaborating further. Vistara has also forged so-called interline agreements with nine airlines, including British Airways, Japan Airlines and Kenya Airways, Kapoor said. Interlining is an agreement between individual airlines to handle passengers travelling on routes that require multiple flights on multiple airlines. These agreements allow passengers to change from one flight on one airline to another flight on another airline without having to gather their bags or check in again. Interlining deals may be followed by code sharing and bilateral relationships. “As part of a long-term plan, we are looking at whether it makes sense for us to have small aircraft; it may not be,” Yeoh said, adding that there was no decision yet on advancing any existing aircraft deliveries. He also said no decision has been taken on international fleet requirements, such as wide-body planes. The fleet plan has to be first approved by the Vistara board. An official at an aircraft manufacturer, who declined to be identified, said Vistara has taken and continues to take presentations for both wide-body planes used for long-haul flights and smaller ones for shorter flights. “But they haven’t decided yet and they are not even giving a sense of where they want to fly. For close-by destinations like Dubai, they already have A320. The question is what will they choose for long-haul operations,” said the official. Vistara has become a more attractive career choice for pilots and cabin crew since the rules for airlines flying abroad were relaxed, a senior pilot with a low-cost airline said. Technical staff see an opportunity to fly international if they work for Vistara, compared with only free tickets for local flying with domestic airlines. Pilots also hope to upgrade themselves from flying medium-haul to long-haul planes like Boeing’s 777 and 787, and Airbus’s A330, 350 and 380. Free seats for employees and their families—based on flight occupancy—is an important perk built into the compensation of airline employees. It is one of the reasons many of them move to airlines in the Gulf with their vast international networks. An official at the civil aviation ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that established airlines are pressuring the government to increase the notice period for pilots from six months to one year. Officials from both established airlines (some of whom want the notice increased to one year) and new airlines (who want it to be retained at six months) have been meeting ministry officials to lobby their case, this official said. The senior pilot cited earlier said that, like the 5/20 rule, the notice period too was a faulty regulation. “Nowhere in the world does the regulator make it mandatory to give a six months’ notice period for pilots,” the ministry official said. “It should go away completely.” Tarun ShuklaShally Seth Mohile Topics: VistaraSingapore Airlinesinternational flightsairfarebusiness class More from this Section Air India to induct two A320 neos in January Karnataka high court orders winding up of Kingfisher Airlines Bharat Forge to buy Walker Forge Tennessee for $14 million Winners of Infosys Prize 2016 announced Snapdeal’s logistics arm COO Vijay Ghadge quits Editor's Picks Demonetisation has achieved 50% of objective: Subramanian Swamy Modi’s demonetisation drive may damage Arvind Kejriwal the most Reliance Jio seeing sharp decline in subscriber growth rate: analysts Donald Trump’s firm signs deal for Kolkata real estate project Consequences of the demonetisation shock First Published: Tue, Sep 06 2016. 12 53 AM IST Latest News Banks to exchange notes only for their own customers tomorrow Narendra Modi meets president as demonetisation chaos continues Note ban may ease food prices as retailers buy less Editor's Picks Demonetisation has achieved 50% of objective: Subramanian Swamy Modi’s demonetisation drive may damage Arvind Kejriwal the most Reliance Jio seeing sharp decline in subscriber growth rate: analysts Latest News Banks to exchange notes only for their own customers tomorrow Narendra Modi meets president as demonetisation chaos continues Note ban may ease food prices as retailers buy less India’s no first use policy on nukes ‘ambiguous’: Pakistan Lounge review: Asia Kitchen & Bar, Mumbai, & Tourist, Delhi Mint On Sunday The priceless legacy of P.L.

Credit Reuters The explosion of a SpaceX rocket last Thursday will have an impact across the space industry, far beyond the losses on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral, Fla. An Israeli satellite operator’s deal to sell itself to a Chinese company is imperiled. Planned launches of communications satellites that support international mobile phone service and digital television are delayed and put in doubt. NASA’s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station will probably be disrupted. All of them are customers of the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, whose rocket exploded in Florida. The private space launch company, led by the entrepreneur Elon Musk, has a generally solid safety record. But last week’s setback and a failed launch last year, when its rocket carrying a NASA cargo fell apart in flight, are raising questions about SpaceX, a company that has risen rapidly by offering lower costs and promising accelerated launch schedules. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story At this stage, there are more questions than answers. The key for SpaceX will be how quickly it can satisfy federal investigators, rebuild the damaged launchpad at Cape Canaveral and resume sending satellites into space. For commercial telecommunications customers, getting a satellite manufactured is time-consuming and expensive, taking two years or more and costing $200 million to $400 million each. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The launch itself is a high-risk step, but once in orbit the satellites are money spinners. The upfront investment is paid back in a few years, and they then generate hefty profits for the remainder of their useful life, which could be as much as a decade. So once a satellite is ready to go, time on the ground — and delay — are financially painful. Among the commercial satellite operators lined up for SpaceX launches later this year are Iridium Communications, SES of Luxembourg, EchoStar and KT Corporation of South Korea. “No doubt SpaceX will fix the problems, but if you’re a customer time is money,” said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a former NASA administrator. “This will get customers looking at alternatives. It may give competitors an opening and slow down SpaceX.” The large communications customers have the most money at stake in space. Revenue for satellite services last year was $127.4 billion, according to a report by the Tauri Group, a research firm, for the Satellite Industry Association. The launch business, though the gateway to space, is small by comparison — $5.4 billion in revenue last year. In the market for launching large, geostationary communications satellites, the main SpaceX rival is Arianespace, a French multinational company. And there are others, notably International Launch Services, an American-Russian joint venture, which launches Russian-designed Proton rockets from Kazakhstan. But Arianespace, which has an excellent safety record, is considerably more expensive than SpaceX. And the safety and performance record of the Proton rockets lags behind that of the SpaceX workhorse, the Falcon 9. If the SpaceX launch timetable is delayed by a few months, industry analysts say, its customers will probably wait. If the delays stretch out further, other launch providers will look increasingly appealing. Recovering from delays to its aggressive launch schedule — without losing momentum — is the challenge for SpaceX, not a financial squeeze. In a statement on Friday, the company said its business was “robust, with approximately 70 missions on our manifest worth over $10 billion.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story The company said it was too early to predict when its launches might resume. In addition to the damaged launchpad, SpaceX has two others under construction. One is in Florida, which the company says should be ready in November. The other is at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, which SpaceX said was in “the final stages of an operational upgrade.” A longer-term issue for SpaceX is whether the rocket explosion and its aftermath raise concerns about its plans to move into the field of manned spaceflights for NASA and for launching military and national security satellites for the Department of Defense. Its competitor for that business is the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The list price for the SpaceX Falcon 9 is $62 million while the larger, more powerful Falcon Heavy is $90 million. There are further costs beyond the rocket itself, but analysts say SpaceX launches cost at least 50 percent less than what its main competitors charge. It has achieved that efficiency by streamlining production techniques, designing a stripped-down launchpad and stepping up the pace of launches. Each innovation adds risk, said Phil Smith, an analyst for the Tauri Group. But SpaceX, he added, has been approved by NASA for cargo missions and certified by the Air Force, both of which have high safety and performance standards. The explosion investigation and launchpad repair seem sure to scuttle SpaceX’s aggressive launch plans this year. The company had hoped for as many as 18 rocket launches this year. It has had eight so far; last week’s would have made nine. Over all, SpaceX has had 27 successful launches of Falcon 9 rockets. The Florida accident is also rippling through the insurance market. Insuring the risk of getting a satellite into space comes in two stages. The preflight insurance is intended to mainly cover the risk of damage to the rocket and satellite on their way to the launchpad. Premiums are a fraction of a percent. Launch policies, which take effect when the rocket is fired up, are costly, ranging from 5 to 15 percent historically. But the Falcon 9 exploded during a prelaunch test. So launch policies did not kick in. And the insurance payout will fall on the roughly two dozen preflight insurers. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Richard Parker, managing director of Assure Space, an underwriting agency, is waiting to see the cause of the explosion. If it is a design or manufacturing flaw or an operational error, launch rates for SpaceX flights may well go up. His firm had underwritten a launch policy on last week’s flight at 6 percent, he said. One business casualty of the explosion is the $285 million sale of Space Communications, an Israeli satellite operator, to a unit of a Chinese company, Xinwei Technology Group. That deal hinged on the launch of Spacecom’s Amos-6 satellite, an Israeli design. The satellite was insured, but because of the explosion, Spacecom’s five-year contract with Facebook and Eutelsat Communications of France to supply internet access to people in sub-Saharan Africa was canceled. Spacecom’s stock price fell 9 percent on Thursday, and another 34 percent on Sunday. In a news conference on Sunday, Spacecom executives said they were trying to renegotiate the deal with Xinwei and exploring other options. Kenneth Chang contributed reporting.

LaCompagnie will cease its four-times weekly operations between Luton, northwest of London, and Newark, New Jersey, on Sept. 25, after beginning the service in April last year, it said Monday in a statement. BA is  reducing its own business-only operation from London City airport to New York John F. Kennedy International to one daily flight from two at the end of next month. The French carrier is responding to a lack of long-term visibility following the Brexit vote, it said, even though the Luton flights had recently been operating with a healthy 77 percent load factor. “Despite the positive returns the airline was getting from British and American customers on the route, the position of LaCompagnie remained fragile,” the airline said. Fleet Ambitions Capacity freed up by quitting the U.K. will be used to add a second daily flight to Newark from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on some days starting Oct. 25, it said. Passengers who had been booked to fly to or from Luton will be reimbursed or can switch their flights to Paris at no extra cost. LaCompagnie was founded in 2013 after raising 34 million euros ($38 million) from investors including A Plus Finance and private-equity funds. The carrier, which operates Boeing Co. 757 aircraft, has said it could seek to renew to the fleet and could even be interested in 787 Dreamliners from the U.S. planemaker, though no purchases have been made. A number of business-only trans-Atlantic carriers have folded in the past decade, among them Silverjet Plc, Eos Airlines and MAXJet Airlines Inc. The failures haven’t dented enthusiasm for the concept, with start-up Odyssey Airlines -- whose executive team includes ex-Silverjet managers -- planning to begin flights from London City next year using Bombardier Inc. C Series jets. A return ticket between City and New York Kennedy with BA costs about 3,650 pounds ($4,850), departing Nov. 7 and returning a week later, according to website figures.

The hard-disk drive was developed by engineers at IBM facilities in Rochester and San Jose, Calif. • Salaries for deputy fire chiefs in Rochester were raised by 6 percent. The assistant fire chief will now make $49,104 and the deputy fire chief will receive $54,015. 1966 – 50 years ago • Very few American teen-agers are backing President Johnson's escalation of the Viet Nam war, calling it "morally wrong." Seventy-nine percent said their parents annoy them; 57 percent declared they would leave home if they could. Almost half of the teens claimed that parents do not set an example to be followed. The Look survey also found that American's teen-agers have few heroes. JFK, Mickey Mantle and Elvis Presley were among those listed. • A new Tastee-Freez Drive-In is now under construction in the 1700 block on South Broadway across the highway and south of the Holiday Inn. 1941 – 75 years ago • Wilbur Schneider, Wykoff, was reported today to have had the grand champion pure-bred ewe lamb of the 4-H club show at the Minnesota State Fair. • Workmen at the Rede Larson gravel pit near Stewartville unearthed a 31-inch tusk that is believed to be that of a prehistoric elephant. It will soon be placed on exhibit at the Olmsted County Historical museum. 1916 – 100 years ago • Skill in selecting accessories is often the major asset of a woman who ranks as the best-dressed individual in her own set. Gloves, shoes, hat and neck dressing must be thought out carefully, and the question of furs is one that comes up for consideration. The summer fur vogue is strong this year. • With the paving of East College Street underway it is strongly recommended by many citizens that an artistic concrete bridge over the west arm of Bear Creek is needed as soon as possible. From news services Ten years ago: A cook was charged with shooting and dismembering the owner of a Maine bed-and-breakfast and three other people in a Labor Day weekend rampage (Christian Nielsen was later sentenced to life in prison). Felipe Calderon was declared Mexico's president-elect after two months of uncertainty over a disputed election. Boeing executive Alan Mulally was named president and CEO of Ford Motor Co., succeeding Bill Ford, the great-grandson of founder Henry Ford. Katie Couric began a five-year run as principal anchor of "The CBS Evening News." Five years ago: President Barack Obama used a boisterous Labor Day rally in Detroit to put congressional Republicans on the spot, challenging them to place the country's interests above all else and vote to create jobs and put the economy back on a path toward growth. The prosecution's first witness in the trial of ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Gen. Hussein Moussa, startled the court by testifying that police had not been ordered to fire on protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, contradicting prosecutors' central claim. One year ago: Germans waving welcome signs in German, English and Arabic gathered at a train station to welcome the first group of a wave of migrants fleeing conflict in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa.

BUSINESS SpaceX updates: Elon Musk calls the sudden ball of fire 'not an explosion' Sept. 1, 2016, 4:52 p.m. What we know: Elon Musk's SpaceX was fueling its unmanned rocket when the blast occurred Thursday morning. The company was preparing for a test firing, considered routine, in advance of a planned Saturday launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The explosion destroyed the rocket and its payload: an Israeli satellite meant to be used in Facebook's effort to provide Internet service to poorly connected areas.

The company also has contracts with NASA to ferry astronauts to the space station in the future.  A nearby launch planned for next week, using a rocket from a different NASA contractor, appears to be unaffected by the explosion.  Sept. 1, 2016 3:02 p.m. Sept. 1, 2016, 3:02 p.m. Elon Musk's bad day: Rocket explosion, stocks drop, Autopilot announcement postponed Russ Mitchell Elon Musk's bad day: Rocket explosion, stocks drop, Autopilot announcement postponed Elon Musk, shown in 2014, is balancing three companies in the news: SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity. (Jae C. Hong / Associated Press) Thursday's explosion of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket isn't the only problem Chief Executive Elon Musk is juggling. He was set to announce Tesla Autopilot improvements in the wake of a fatal crash in Florida in May when the system’s sensors couldn’t distinguish the side of a big-rig truck from an overcast sky. Musk said those details would be delayed until the end of the weekend. Beyond crashes and explosions, Musk is also trying to head off cash-flow problems. He's trying to finance a $2.4-billion deal for Tesla to acquire SolarCity, where he serves as chairman.  The bad news sent Tesla’s shares tumbling $11.24, or 5.3%, to $200.11. Shares of SolarCity fell even further, closing down $1.88, or 9.1%, to $18.78.

Here's why.   Determining the cause of an in-flight explosion probably would take a lengthy investigation, industry analysts said. And when customers are waiting to send their satellites into orbit, time is money. With a failure on the launchpad, the problem has a narrower scope, which cuts down on the time needed to find the issue. And because SpaceX already offers cheaper prices than the competition — the starting price for its Falcon 9 rocket is $62 million — it’s unlikely that companies will flock to other launch providers, said Marco Caceres, senior space analyst for the Teal Group.

It’ll probably slow those plans at least a little, since the Amos 6 satellite that SpaceX’s rocket was supposed to carry into orbit was meant to play a role in the project. Facebook and French satellite provider Eutelsat were paying a reported $95 million a year to lease bandwidth on the satellite for five years. Tim Bajarin, tech-industry analyst with Creative Strategies, said Zuckerberg and Facebook can be expected to work on getting another satellite up as soon as possible. The explosion “won't have any impact on his goal at all,” Bajarin said. “This is an important part of his vision for providing Internet access around the globe, and while this may set back the timing, it will not derail his plans or vision.” Facebook is not relying only on satellites to accomplish its goal. It’s also been experimenting with other technology such as Aquila, an unmanned, solar-powered plane that will be used to beam the Internet into remote areas. Facebook completed its first successful Aquila flight in June. Crum writes for the  East Bay Times/McClatchy.   Sept. 1, 2016 1:02 p.m. Sept. 1, 2016, 1:02 p.m. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson: Spaceflight an 'inherently risky business' Associated Press Florida Sen. Bill Nelson: Spaceflight an 'inherently risky business' A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launchpad in Florida on Thursday morning. (NASA) Sen. Bill Nelson, a former astronaut who represents Florida's Space Coast, said the SpaceX accident “reminds us all that spaceflight is an inherently risky business.” Nelson was a payload specialist on a Columbia space shuttle flight that ended 10 days before the Challenger disaster in 1986. “As we continue to push the frontiers of space, there will be both triumphs and setbacks. But at the end of the day, I'm confident that our commercial space industry will be very successful,” Nelson said in a statement.

(SpaceX) How does SpaceX's success rate stack up with its competitors?  Bill Ostrove, an aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International, said SpaceX's reliability with the Falcon 9 is 93%, which is "right in the ballpark" of the industry average of 95%.  One of its chief competitors, United Launch Alliance, which has the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets, has a perfect launch record. ULA is a joint venture of Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. American and European rockets are largely reliable. But over the last few years, Russian rockets have become less reliable, with industrial issues stemming from the construction side, he said.

This time it happened on the launch pad.” Rubin added that the blast, which destroyed an Israeli-made communications satellite, could have repercussions for that country's commercial interests. Last month, Spacecom, the company that would have operated the Amos 6 satellite SpaceX was preparing to launch, said it had reached a preliminary deal to be purchased by China's Beijing Xinwei Technology Group for $285 million. It’s unclear whether the loss of the satellite will derail the deal.

The loss of the satellite will have a substantial influence on the company. The company will continue to report on the significance of the loss.” The company, known as Spacecom, has had contracts with the Israeli government to use the satellite, which was meant for broadcast and telecommunications, as well as a broadband Internet project with Facebook. The satellite was manufactured by government-owned Israel Aerospace Industries.

After an investigation, SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk said that the company believed its rocket disintegrated after a small steel band purchased from a subcontractor snapped under pressure. He said SpaceX employees may have become somewhat complacent about quality control because of the firm's repeated successes in recent years. Falcon 9 rockets had flown successfully 18 previous times. The Falcon 9 in last year's accident was carrying cargo worth $110 million when it broke up high off Florida's coast. The cargo included equipment, a space suit, experiments, food and other supplies. — L.A.

The one planned for Saturday would have been its ninth. That's up dramatically from six in 2015.  Last year's low launch count is because of a 2015 rocket failure, which delayed the Hawthorne company's launch schedule. In June 2015, a Falcon 9 rocket disintegrated minutes after liftoff while carrying supplies bound for the International Space Station. SpaceX founder Elon Musk later blamed that failure on a faulty strut that was holding down one of many helium bottles on the rocket's second stage, where the explosion occurred.

The $62 million Falcon 9 rocket blew up on its launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Fla., just after 9 a.m. during a test for a planned Saturday blast-off. No one was reported injured in the blast, which occurred near NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Photo: Reuters But the epic fail sent Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg into a funk during his tour of Kenya, where he was touting his plan to use the Israeli-made AMOS-6 satellite to provide Internet service across sub-Saharan Africa. Facebook had planned to partner with the French satellite operator Eutelsat Communications for the project, part of the Zuckerberg-led Internet.org program. “I’m deeply disappointed to hear that SpaceX’s launch failure destroyed our satellite that would have provided connectivity to so many entrepreneurs and everyone else across the continent,” Zuckerberg posted on Facebook. “Fortunately, we have developed other technologies like Aquila that will connect people as well,” he added, referring to a solar-powered drone that Facebook plans to use to beam Internet access into remote areas. “We remain committed to our mission of connecting everyone, and we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided.” The blast dealt a major blow to SpaceX, which was facing a backlog of more than $10 billion worth of launch orders after an accident last year. It’s also a setback for NASA, which depended on the private company for missions to the International Space Station. Photo: EPA Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who founded SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of slashing launch costs to make travel to Mars affordable, said the cause of the accident was not yet known. “Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank,” he tweeted. SpaceX issued a statement citing an “anomaly on the pad” at Launch Complex 40. “Per standard procedure, the pad was clear and there were no injuries,” the statement said. The destruction of the rocket and its payload could not have come at a worse time for Musk, who wants to merge automaker Tesla with energy company SolarCity, where he is chairman, amid a serious cash crunch. SEE ALSO Speeding was not the root cause of fatal Tesla autopilot crash :0 An Autopiloted Tesla that fatally crashed in Florida in May... Speeding was not the root cause of fatal Tesla autopilot crash He lost about $390 million in shares as the stocks of two companies plummeted after the explosion, CNBC reported. Musk also faces a government probe of a fatal crash involving a Tesla Model S in Florida in which the driver used the vehicle’s controversial Autopilot feature. SpaceX had been due to launch its 29th Falcon 9 early Saturday, carrying the satellite owned by Israel’s Space Communication. The rocket exploded as operators were preparing to test fire its nine main engines, with the craft remaining on the pad, the Florida Today news site reported. Falcon 9s are used to ferry supplies to the International Space Station for NASA, so the blast represented a major setback for the agency’s plans for cargo hauls and, ultimately, astronaut flights. SpaceX is one of two companies shipping supplies to the space station 250 miles above Earth and is competing with Boeing to fly the first crew there. It had hoped to launch two astronauts on a test flight within a year. “NASA still is assessing what impacts, if any, the incident will have on future missions,” spokesman Michael Curie said. SpaceX began launching Falcon 9 rockets in June 2010, racking up 27 successful flights. The only in-flight failure occurred in June 2015, when a strut broke in the rocket’s upper stage, causing a tank to rupture. The company plans to fly its first unmanned spacecraft to Mars in 2018 and send people to the Red Planet as early as 2024. Meanwhile, the mishap threatened to derail the sale of Space Communications for $285 million to Beijing Xinwei Technology Group — an agreement the companies said was contingent on a successful launch and the completion of orbital tests. Space Communications said AMOS-6’s loss will have “a significant impact” on the company, whose shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange closed down 8.9 percent.

LeoSat plans to launch a constellation of anywhere between 78 to 108 low-flying communications satellites.  By operating only a few hundred miles above the Earth's surface in low orbit (LEO), LeoSat will be able to deliver faster service than traditional geosynchronous satellites parked at a fixed location 22,500 miles away, with around 20 milliseconds (ms) between ground and a satellite.  Each satellite will use a combination of radio frequency downlinks and laser cross-links to other satellites to provide latency that -- at least on paper – should outperform terrestrial fiber networks  when delivering data from point A to point B around the globe.   The company says it should be able to deliver data between New York to Tokyo at under 130ms while a well-engineered fiber connection between those cities is around 250ms. Along with lower latency than fiber and higher speed than traditional satellite networks, LeoSat's third selling point is a more secure network for moving data, with information encrypted end-to-end and able to travel solely through the satellite network between locations without transiting through a terrestrial station and onto a traditional telecommunications carrier.                    Image via Bigstock Speed will also be a selling point.  LeoSat will offer up to 1.6 Gbps of full-duplex connectivity per link, with 5.2 Gbps "where needed" – most likely available if and when the company launches the top end 108 satellites.   Financial traders are continually looking for any speed edge possible, so the promise of faster-than-fiber service is a no-brainer for hedge funds and other institutions that can gain advantage by processing orders more quickly than competitors.    Other markets the company is pursuing include oil field services and operations, maritime communications, enterprise-enterprise communications, internet and cellular backhaul services, video, and government customers.  LeoSat hopes to start launching the first 84 satellites of its primary network, 78 operational plus 6 on-orbit spares, in 2019 with service availability starting in 2020.  Building the initial satellite network will require up to $3.5 billion. LeoSat is currently talking with various parties to raise $100 million for detailed satellite design and the launch of a pair of pathfinder demonstration satellites that may provide broadband services across Antarctica for National Science Foundation (NSF) researchers at the South Pole. Some might compare LeoSat to other LEO cloud satellite networks, such as OneWeb, but LeoSat is solely focused on the enterprise space.  OneWeb started out in the "broadband for everyone" model, but has more recently shifted to more of a business/cellular carrier focus to get cash flowing in.  OneWeb's network of 648 or so satellites is expected to deliver 50 Mbps per customer with 30ms or so of latency.  The company's backers and partners include Airbus, Bharti, Coca Cola, Qualcomm, and the Virgin Group.  Too little is known about SpaceX and Boeing's LEO plans to provide comparison with OneWeb but both Boeing and SpaceX have filed paperwork with the Federal Communications Commission to reserve radio spectrum and launch pathfinder satellites. Clearly, LeoSat would appear to have an edge in delivering enterprise services.  Now it needs to find the right combination of investors and other financing to start building and launching them.

(NYSE: GE) announced Tuesday morning that it plans to acquire two European 3D printing companies for a total price of $1.4 billion. Both companies will be put under the umbrella of GE’s aviation division. Sweden-based Arcam serves customers in both the aerospace and health care industries with its metal-based additive manufacturing (the technical name for some 3D printing applications) products. Germany-based SLM Solutions supplies laser machines for metal-based additive manufacturing in the aerospace sector. Shares of 3D Systems Corp. (NYSE: DDD) traded up about 5% in Tuesday’s premarket, as did shares of Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ: SSYS). At Friday’s closing prices, both traded down about 80% from their peak share prices of December 2013. Also as of Friday, 3D Systems’s market cap was $1.67 billion and Stratasys’s was $1.15 billion. Shareholders in both companies must be hoping for a dose of acquisition fever now that GE has pulled the trigger on an acquisition in the 3D printing space. While the size of the deal is relatively modest, it validates the application of 3D printing technology in one of the largest industrial sectors of the market. Another major player in 3D printing is HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ). Both 3D Systems and Stratasys offer printing services that includes metals as well as polymers and some ceramics; HP’s 3D printing capabilities remain polymer-based. From an investor’s point of view, GE’s acquisition also signals that 3D printing, at least for giant industrial firms, may best be incorporated by owning the technology rather than buying the equipment and services. That’s better news for 3D Systems and Stratasys than it is for HP. GE talked up its introduction of additive manufacturing in the announcement: In July, GE Aviation introduced into airline service its first additive jet engine component – complex fuel nozzle interiors – with the LEAP jet engine. The LEAP engine is the new, best-selling engine from CFM International, a 50/50 joint company of GE and Safran Aircraft Engines of France. More than 11,000 LEAP engines are on order with up to 20 fuel nozzles in every engine, thus setting the stage for sustainably high and long-term additive production at GE Aviation’s Auburn, Alabama, manufacturing plant. Production will ramp up to more than 40,000 fuel nozzles using additive by 2020. The CFM LEAP engine is available in three variations, one for Boeing Co.’s (NYSE: BA) 737 MAX, another for the Airbus A320neo family and a third for Chinese aircraft maker Comac’s C919. GE’s share price was up about 0.3% in Tuesday’s premarket, at $31.37 in a 52-week range of $24.26 to $33.00. The consensus 12-month price target is $33.71.

(Paul Danzer/The Columbian) By Paul Danzer, Columbian Soccer, hockey and Community Sports Reporter Published: September 5, 2016, 10:01 PM A   A Clay Kind does not plan to slow down. He will still be pedaling his way around Clark County. But come January, he will no longer lead the way. The 77-year-old has been a volunteer ride leader for the Vancouver Bicycle Club since the summer of 1976. He still leads as many as four group rides a week, but at the end of this year he intends to step away from the ride-leader role. To honor his years of service, the club plans a party on Sunday following the regular Two-Bridge Loop Ride led by Kind. The 21-mile ride starts at 10 a.m. at River Maiden Coffee, 602 N. Devine Rd. Cyclists travel east on MacArthur Boulevard, south across the I-205 bridge, west along Marine Drive and north across the I-5 bridge. The pace for Sunday’s ride will be 14 to 16 mph. These days most of the rides led by Kind average 12 to 14 mph, but he was never focused on speed and often kept a 16 mph pace. “I’ve never thought about racing,” he said. “I’m a pleasure rider.” Kind volunteered to lead a ride almost immediately after seeing a VBC newsletter and joining his first group ride. Though he does not recall the exact route of his 1976 introduction to the club, Kind does remember being left behind by the faster ride leaders. The primary role of a ride leader is to make sure everyone is riding safely and obeying the rules of the road and that no one is left behind. “That doesn’t seem to work. People still go off and leave me,” a smiling Kind said. Kind said he has led group rides with as many as 38 riders and as few as three. He has, of course, repaired many a flat tire for fellow cyclists. Legend has it he once repaired a flat with blades of grass, according to friend and VBC board member Jan Verrinder. He has seen much of Clark County, and notes that cyclists see a lot more than those who travel only by car. Kind does not know how many miles he has covered on VBC group rides. He said he has ridden as many as 10,000 miles in a year and averaged 8,500 to 9,000 miles a year for many years. He now averages 6,000 to 6,500 a year and has ridden 4,000 miles so far in 2016. In 2001, Kind cycled from Idaho to his 45th high school class reunion in Moorhead, Minn. Last year Kind was honored with the Vancouver Bicycle Club’s award for outstanding service, the club estimated he had led at least 3,500 rides. He is credited with promoting safe cycling and increasing participation in group rides. In recent years, Kind had consistently led rides on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday mornings. According to Verrinder the Tuesday morning Tour de Friends ride can vary from 15 to 25 miles. “The route mostly takes residential streets so people can do what the saying­ says, Tour de Friends,” Verrinder said. “If you ride ahead of Clay, you risk that he will turn somewhere. He likes a group ride and he likes to bend your ear.” A native of Minnesota, Kind moved his family to Vancouver in 1964 after briefly considering exploring employment at Boeing in Seattle. He worked for almost 32 years at Boise Cascade, and would often make the 7-mile commute to work on his bike. Now he is ready to retire again. He wants to ride at his own pace on his own schedule. So after 40 years of leading the way, Kind will be happy to follow other leaders. He is seeking volunteers to lead the rides he has led year-round for decades — except when the temperature dips below 40 degrees. If nobody is found to replace Kind, his rides will disappear from the club ride calendar. But Kind will still be out there pedaling. His advice for those who want to make cycling a regular activity: “Learn to ride safely and have a lot of fun.”   Paul Danzer Columbian Soccer, hockey and Community Sports Reporter  360-735-4521  @360Danzer  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Madar does not share the previous management team’s philosophy of aggressiveness in the industry and a short-term spike in profits to please the investors. “I don’t have that philosophy, in my case we are going to be very conservative, our business plan will be different.” “Right now we are scheduling two aircraft with a fleet of three, we are keeping one aircraft as spare, this was not done before by the previous team.” Cobalt’s two new A-319 Airbuses will be delivered end of September to join the A-320 which is now based in Larnaca. “The A-319 Airbus are slightly smaller than the A-320… one is now in Ireland getting painted, the other is coming from Brunei.” Unprecedented operational problems and delays since Cobalt took to the skies in early July have not only tainted its image, they’ve also cost the carrier a fortune and made everyone nervous – including the government. A couple of weeks ago, the Ministry of Transport had called for an inspection into the safety operations of the fledgling carrier and asked for additional information on its financial viability. Thankfully, they’ve found no ground for concern. “We have spent so far €20 million this year and we have spent over €4 million on wet leases over these past two months,” said Madar. “We have covered all passengers in terms of compensation and this number is very massive it’s hundreds of thousands of euro, I don’t have it in front me right now but I will.” Madar explained that their dry lease aircraft did not come through due to bad negotiations and so they ended up having to wet lease from other airlines to come and fly at five, six times the cost of its own operations. And to counter bad publicity and harsh criticism on ground handling they have also added a customer support desk at Larnaca airport and then at London’s Stansted and Athens, Greece. In addition, they have changed from stairways to jet way. “Basically we are enhancing our customer support presence at these airports, we have changed our internal processes on how to communicate with these distractions,” he said. Winter plans and China Winter is different from summer so Cobalt will soon announce a new network with the addition of more cities. They are looking at Germany, Odessa, Tel Aviv, Lebanon, Beirut, Tehran and several destinations in Europe. But China seems to be in the heart of Madar and not only because his wife is Chinese, he said laughingly. “China is in our preliminary plan for next year, next September, the Chinese market has a different signature than Europe but it’s a synchronised game plan,” he said. “We will have six aircraft by next year…so winter season we will basically have three aircraft, two scheduled and one spare, and we are going to have the same philosophy with the six aircraft I suppose.” Madar is aware that it’s going to take a lot of logistics and time to go to China and then Africa and the USA for the next phase of Cobalt’s expansion. “But we are going to keep an eye on the China market first. Come Fall 2017 the hotels here will be very happy, the Chinese market is huge.” “In China they don’t know where Cyprus is. But Chinese are flooding Greece, London, Spain. They fly over Cyprus but Cyprus has not really hit the market there.” Cobalt which now has a total of 188 staff plans to expand soon to 210. Flag, dominant carrier Madar could not predict Cobalt’s market share but he was certain they are going to be the flag carrier of Cyprus. “I think the Cyprus market itself can take maybe two carriers here, next year I think the foreign carriers will probably have to step out, the dominant carrier is going to be us, we have the team, the knowledge, no one can compare with our pilots.” “And in terms of financial stability we are very strong. I think strategically we are in a much better position, we are lucky because we are ahead of them now,” he added referring to the imminent launch of operations by Orion and Charlie airlines. Madar also pointed out that Aegean has already pulled one aircraft out of Larnaca which means they are decreasing their flight frequency. And that Etihad is pulling out even though the market is improving considering there were a huge number of tourists this summer. A keen flyer Born in Tehran in 1958, Andrew Madar studied aeronautical engineering at University of Washington in Seattle and also worked at the same time at Boeing whose headquarters are there. “It is sort of a natural transition from University of Washington aerospace graduates to go there,” Madar said. “I always liked flying, I started flying when I was 16, small planes…I could not afford to become a pilot so I became an engineer,” he added laughingly. At Boeing, Madar worked in many technical areas, research development, testing, design of aircraft, and then in 1994 he joined the customer side of the airline business. He first worked in Indonesia and then he was transferred to China as part of a Boeing team in Beijing working to develop Chinese aviation. “We started with focus on safety because they were losing a lot of aircraft and our target was to improve safety and efficiency. China now is one of the safest aviation industries in the world.” Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags CEO change Cobalt Cyprus Madar problems strategy Previous Pope declares Mother Teresa a saint and model of mercy Next Pop-art for the ages Related Articles Cyprus-India sign double taxation agreement November 18, 2016 EC disburses €730,000 to Cyprus for 2016 drought and wildfires November 18, 2016 This is how Limassol’s casino will look (VIDEO) November 18, 2016 Hoteliers attempted to create marinas through the backdoor November 18, 2016 Cyprus will explain 2017 financial targets to Europe November 17, 2016 Tourist arrivals in October continue record streak for 2016 November 17, 2016 International honours for Clerides, Anastassiou, Neophytou LLC November 17, 2016 Christmas allowance for vulnerable groups November 17, 2016 Pafilia announces construction companies for ONE residential tower November 17, 2016 Check Also FinMin diplomatically rejects EC fiscal projections Responding to Wednesday’s warnings from the European Commission that Cyprus, among six member states, risks … EC: Cyprus at risk of missing 2017 budget targets The European Commission announced today that Cyprus, among six member states, risks missing budgetary targets … 2 comments Geoffrey Smith September 4, 2016 at 5:15 pm Plenty of talk, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
