The airline also signed a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices. Today’s announcement builds on Qatar Airways’ current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With this new order, Qatar Airways increases its firm order backlog of Boeing wide-body airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. The announcement was attended by the State of Qatar’s Minister of Finance Ali Shareef Al Emadi, US Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and the Ambassador of Qatar Mohammed Jaham Al-Kuwari. “Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead,” said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker. “Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today’s announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service.” SOURCESaudi Gazette TAGS Boeing 777 Dreamliners SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleTribal incompatibility: Judge grants divorce to couple Next articleThailand on edge as king ‘not stable’ Imran Syed RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Saudia set to receive its first B777-300ER plane New Boeing 777 freighter joins Etihad Cargo fleet British Boeing captain says MH370 can be found soon NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,482,701FansLike 41,038FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Qatari emir, Bahraini king in Riyadh to offer condolences to King Salman Nov 14, 2016 Deputy Crown Prince meets Malaysian counterpart Nov 14, 2016 80 hours per life wasted on streets annually Nov 14, 2016 Run away workers won’t be allowed to enter KSA Nov 14, 2016 Al-Falih: OPEC production cut imperative Nov 14, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

GovCon Index gainers outnumbered laggers at a 6-to-1 ratio but five of its 11 S&P 500 components rose with Boeing the top net performer in both the GCI overall and for co-listed stocks. Services contractors Maximus (NYSE: MMS), Science Applications International Corp. (NYSE: SAIC) and CACI International (NYSE: CACI) helped lift the GCI along with Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC). Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE: HII) and Rockwell Collins (NYSE: COL) both posted gains of at least $1.00 to join the GCI’s top five net performers listed above as advancers by at least one full point. Honeywell International (NYSE: HON) ended fifth-lowest on both net and percentage as the stock posted a second consecutive session with high volatility since the conglomerate on Friday issued revised third quarter earnings guidance below Wall Street forecasts. Shares in Honeywell are down 7.62 percent over two days and the stock traded at a Monday volume three-fold over the three-month average at 8.38 million shares. All of the GCI’s five worst net performers are S&P 500-listed companies with General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) also a decliner. Energy shares led nine out of 11 S&P 500 sectors higher as crude futures in New York settled up 3.1 percent to $51.35 per barrel after Russian President Vladmir Putin said it was ready to join OPEC countries in an output cut, according to Reuters.

 A pilot describes what it was like to fly Hong Kong's flag airline's last Boeing 747 flight Simon Parry, South China Morning Post Oct. 9, 2016, 12:38 PM 22,010 facebook linkedin twitter email print A 747. Cathay Pacific Captain John Graham has good reason to feel a rush of nostalgia as he takes his seat in the cockpit for the last Cathay Pacific Boeing 747 passenger flight. He has flown this iconic aircraft for more than 30 years and this very machine was the setting for a meeting that turned his life upside down. "This is a bittersweet moment for me. I love this aircraft," he tells passengers as he prepares to take off from a rain-swept Haneda Airport, in Tokyo, Japan. "On a personal note, this is the aircraft I met my wife on. She is here with me on the flight deck so we're having quite an emotional time up here." Graham and his wife met 12 years ago, he explains, after we touchdown in Hong Kong. "One day on a flight to LA, the cockpit door opened and this beautiful face said, 'Captain, would you like a cup of tea?'" he recalls. Standing coyly beside him, Patsy seems embarrassed and flattered in equal measure. "I was really quite touched," she smiles. "I didn't think he'd make that announcement on the plane." This love story seems a fitting send-off for the 747 — an aircraft that captured people's hearts and imaginations in a way no other has before or since, with the possible exception of Concorde. The jumbo jet began life in an age when people wore suits to fly, air travel was exclusive and mysterious, half of the passengers lit up cigarettes as soon as the seat belt sign went out and the lives of captains and flight attendants seemed impossibly glamorous. Today, of course, the many of us who regularly take to the skies plop ourselves grumpily into cramped seats beneath overstuffed overhead lockers, yank down the window blind to sleep or endure mediocre service and bad food from harassed flight attendants until it's time to fight our way out of the air­craft to join another tedious immigration queue in another indistinguishable grey airport. Cathay Pacific is under pressure from budget airlines and falling profits, under prolonged assault from its pilots' union over pay and conditions, and under fire from many customers for what they see as falling standards of service in return for premium prices. But although the fanfare surrounding the 747's retirement may invite unfavourable comparison, the sight of the distinctive, magisterial double-decker hump rolls back time to when flying was an adventure to be savoured. An in-flight meal. Cathay Pacific A different era Back then, so it seemed, love was always in the air, at least for the aircrew. The jumbo's arrival meant long-haul flights — which meant long stopovers in exotic faraway destinations. "For the first time, we would spend time together and go out to dinner and sightseeing," says one former 747 flight atten­dant. "The pilots and the cabin crew had time to socialise together. It led to a lot of romance and a lot of marriages — and a lot of divorces, too." Cathay Pacific took delivery of its first 747 — a 200 model — in August 1979, nine years after American airline Pan Am had become the first to use the aircraft, and its first ultra-long-haul 747-400 in 1989. In 1998, the first plane to land at Chek Lap Kok was a Cathay Pacific 747-400 operating the first ever non-stop passenger flight from New York to Hong Kong: an epic 15-hour, 35-minute journey over the North Pole officially called Polar One. Fittingly, the same plane was chosen for the final Boeing 747 passenger flight last weekend (Cathay will continue to use 747s for cargo flights). The 747, of which 1,523 have been built since 1968, was more than just an upgrade. It was transformative and revolution­ary, helping generate a boom in international travel and playing a role in turning Cathay Pacific from a regional to a global airline. It put Hong Kong within easier grasp of millions of tourists and other visitors. At their 1990s peak, there were more than 30 Boeing 747s in the Cathay passenger fleet and it was the workhorse for every major long-haul carrier. For those aged 30 or above, the chances are the plane that carried us on our first flight between Asia and Europe would have been a 747 and for most of us, the closest we got to the top deck was to gaze fleetingly up the stairs as we turned right on entry. Now the plane called the "queen of the skies", although it is more commonly referred to simply as the jumbo jet, is being phased out by major airlines in favour of smaller, quieter and more economic twin-engine planes. Air France has retired its 747 fleet and British Airways is expected to phase out its remaining 747s by 2020. Nevertheless, its place in modern history is such that it wasn't just plane spotters who bought tickets months in advance and headed to Tokyo for Cathay's 747 send-off, on October 1. Everyone wanted to be on board, it seemed. Cathay Pacific Memories "I have so many memories tied to this plane," says man­age­ment consultant Boris Van, who bought a business-class seat for the final flight. "When I was a kid, whenever we went on a holiday we would always go on this plane, whether it was short haul or long haul. So there was always a sense of excitement. "It's not just another plane. The [Airbus] A380 doesn't come close. The new planes don't have the sense of grandeur and majesty. It is the design and the history of it. It was always such an experience being on this plane." Polish-Australian twins Paul and Bogdan Wlodek, 49 — who both work as ground staff for Qantas in Canberra — flew up specially to join the flight. "Our very first flight was on a 747, from Sydney to Bahrain," says Paul. "This aircraft is an icon and it's getting harder and harder to fly on it." One 14-year-old expatriate boy, who studies at an inter­national school in Hong Kong and who I agree not to name, is playing truant to be on board the 747's last passenger flight to Tokyo and back. "I just wanted to be on this flight because it's the last one," he says, as he prepares to board with his flight-attendant father, who helped him skip a day of school. The teenager says his ambition is to work as a flight engineer. When I ask him what makes the 747 so special, he replies instantly, "The hump." "The shape is very distinctive," agrees Tony Britton, a senior Cathay Pacific engineer and aircraft project manager. "The only airplane I see people taking an interest in when it comes into the terminal is the jumbo. It has this presence about it and people are drawn to it like magnets. "Everyone gets out their phones and cameras and suddenly 10 people will be videoing it as it comes in. A [Airbus] 330 or a 777 doesn't quite have the same impact." Britton, who has worked on 747s since he was an apprentice engineer in Britain more than 30 years ago and helped see off the last 747 flight out of Hong Kong's old Kai Tak Airport, in 1998, took his own two sons, aged 13 and 16, on one of the aircraft's last flights to Tokyo and back. "My youngest son got the biggest kick out of it," he says. "We were very lucky and managed to get on the upper deck. He put his bed down flat and he was lying on his tummy up against the window just looking out and he thought it was so cool." Britton would be back at work on the ramp as the last flight took off from Hong Kong. Hong Kong. Shutterstock/cozyta "It's the end of an era," he says. "The 747 opened up a world of travel for so many people. It turned an exclusive club into something accessible to the general public. Suddenly you had 330 seats in one plane and it can go so much further." In the 1980 spoof disaster movie Airplane! — a huge hit in the year Cathay Pacific took delivery of its second Boeing 747 — a kindly old lady sees the passenger beside her gripping the sides of his seat before take-off. "Nervous?" she asks. "Yes," he replies. "First time?" she continues, patting his hand reassuringly. "No," he says. "I've been nervous lots of times." That scene captures one of the essential differences between air travel in the early 747 era and now. "When I was trained, one of the topics we had to cover was to be observant and look out for 'first flighters' because, in the 1980s, a lot of people hadn't had the experience of flying," says Le Le Ng, Cathay Pacific's manager of inflight service standards and safety. "We had to observe and take extra care of them because they might be nervous about flying. They might not know the features of the plane. They might not even know how to press a button to call the flight attendant. "Now, nearly everyone who walks in has flown more than we do. Before, when people walked into a 747, it was a huge plane and flying was rare so everyone was excited and happy and the atmosphere was very different. Now, it's just another flight. It's nothing special." Mark Hoey, Cathay Pacific's general manager operations and a former 747 chief pilot, says, "There's never been this fanfare when we've retired other aircraft but the 747 has touched so many people, so many passengers. "People have come up to us in the past couple of weeks, when they've heard about it. I've heard of it happening at other airlines but I didn't think it would happen here. They come up to you in the terminal and say, 'Is it true; Cathay is getting rid of the 747? Who made this decision? Why are you doing that?' "I don't think anyone involved with the 747 hasn't shed a tear over this, and the passengers feel that, too. From a pilot's perspective, it's just an amazing aircraft and flying it is a little boy's dream. When the weather gets a little bit rough it rides like nothing else." Cathay Pacific had to fight a prolonged and very public campaign to get permission to use its 747s on the London route, long monopolised by British Airways. When in 1979, British Caledonian, Laker Airways and Cathay applied for traffic rights on the route, to the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), only Caledonian was successful. Cathay finally succeeded in June 1980, when the British government over­turned a CAA decision to deny the airline access to the route. "Hong Kong was trying to emerge outside being a colony and here was a regional airline whose mother country at that stage didn't want to let it happen," Hoey says. "It's a fascinating period of time and it was a triumph of the ingenuity of Hong Kong." The plane had to be modified to carry more fuel to fly to London at a time when the airline was unable to cross Chinese or Russian air space. "It was our die-hard spirit that made it possible," Hoey says. "We got the airways and the altitude because no one else was doing it." By a poignant coincidence, the retirement of the Cathay Pacific 747 passenger fleet came just weeks after Joe Sutter — the man who designed the 747 and its distinctive hump — died, at the age of 95. "I was privileged to attend his memorial service in Seattle — there were people there from all around the world," says Hoey. "He was one of the engineering masters of the 20th century and he did it all with a slide rule. When they updated the 747, they couldn't improve the fuselage. The core shape hasn't changed over all these years. There are few other things man has made that have stood the test of time so well." That is a sentiment Graham would agree with as, with his wife at his side, he bids the 747 an emotional farewell at Chek Lap Kok. "Thank you for all the memories," he says. "It's a wonderful aircraft. I've flown through typhoons, storms, dust storms, war zones even, across the highest mountains, and I've never once felt this aircraft would fail me. I'll miss it like hell." Taking off. BY/JIR/FMS/REUTERS 747 pilot Nigel Demery recalls the good old days "The 747-400 and I joined Cathay Pacific at about the same time, in 1988. The jumbo could easily take 363 passengers to London non-stop instead of having to refuel and change crews in Bahrain. Then, Cathay flew three times a week to London. Now it's six times a day. "When you sit in the cockpit you just feel at home. It's a pilot's aircraft: responsive, powerful, slick and solid. If you had to land in typhoon conditions at an airport like Kai Tak, turning low at night over Kowloon City's rooftops with Lion Rock whistling past your side and perhaps a 55km/h bumpy, gusty crosswind, then the 400 was the plane to be in. "It was Cathay's first aircraft with the now-standard six digital TV-style glass displays. All of us were more used to the old dials and round indicators that even the Wright brothers would have had. It was also Cathay's first aircraft that could land automatically in fog — a common occurrence in London in winter. "The cabin crew managed the first proper inflight entertainment system that was a stack of VHS cassette players about two metres high. We used to kid them that they hadn't turned on the correct switch to put the movie on in the cockpit. Another novelty was the crew had proper bunks — two in the front for the pilots [two working, two resting] and eight in the tail for the 18-strong cabin crew. My longest flight was back from Los Angeles in the winter with a block time of 15 hours and 25 minutes; it used to be the longest scheduled sector in the world. Bunks were an absolute necessity to remain fresh and sharp for the landing. "The 400 has a few tales to its name. Colin 'Burner' Baldwin had an engine fire on take-off at Kai Tak one night and magnificently managed to dump fuel, turn the aircraft around and land safely within 11 minutes. Mike Lowes flew the world's first non-stop transpolar flight in July 1998, from New York to Hong Kong's brand new Chek Lap Kok airport, taking over 16 hours. "Ken Carver's 45-minute flight from Xiamen to Hong Kong in January 2000 should have been a non-event. However, they suffered total instrument failure on take-off and only superb airmanship and skill recovered the aircraft safely through cloud for a successful landing. The 400 — regis­tration B-HOX — had just been painted in the 'Spirit of Hong Kong' livery, adapted from the idea of an SAR teenager, Ho Sin-yee. The Boeing 747-400: 'Spirit of Hong Kong' — apposite indeed." As told to Simon Parry Nigel Demery is a former Boeing 747-400 captain and president of the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association. He retired in 2009 after 20 years with Cathay Pacific. Read the original article on South China Morning Post. Copyright 2016. Follow South China Morning Post on Twitter.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 10, 2016 at 1:10PM In recent years, Boeing (NYSE:BA) has touted its rising cash flow to investors as a key factor that will drive its stock price higher over time. Most Wall Street analysts seem to buy into that story -- at least somewhat. A majority of the analysts following Boeing stock give it a buy rating (or the equivalent), while the average price target is more than 10% ahead of the current stock price. However, a vocal minority of Boeing analysts are skeptical. For example, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and RBC Capital Markets have all theorized that Boeing's cash flow is headed down, not up. Boeing does face significant challenges on the horizon. Nevertheless, these dour forecasts are too pessimistic. Rising production of the stalwart 737 and the improving profitability of the 787 Dreamliner will drive cash flow higher over the next several years. Steady growth for the 737 Boeing has a massive backlog of more than 4,300 orders for its 737 jet. Today, it is building 42 per month -- about 500 per year -- but Boeing plans to accelerate production to 47 per month in 2017, 52 per month in 2018, and 57 per month in 2019. Even at that increased rate, Boeing would have enough orders to support more than six years of production. Boeing is boosting 737 production to meet strong demand. Image source: Boeing. Increasing 737 production should drive steady cash flow growth over the next few years. During this period, Boeing will also transition from building the current-generation 737 to producing the more fuel-efficient 737 MAX. That should also be positive for profitability and cash flow. All told, cash flow from the 737 program (before taxes) could rise by about $2 billion from 2016 to 2020. The 787 will become a cash cow An even bigger source of cash flow growth is the 787. Cash flow for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner program is likely to be slightly better than breakeven for 2016. However, annual Dreamliner program profitability has been rising by nearly $2 billion a year recently. Program profitability will continue increasing, driven by improved pricing, a mix shift toward more profitable models, step-downs in supplier pricing, and Boeing's own cost-cutting efforts. Most of the projected improvements are covered by firm contracts -- they aren't just the product of unrealistic assumptions by Boeing managers. Boeing expects to recover more than $31 billion of deferred costs for the 787 program over the next six years. That means producing more than $31 billion of pre-tax cash flow during that period. Most Boeing bears doubt that that Dreamliner profitability will improve so dramatically. But even if Boeing's targets are too aggressive, the 787 program should be able to churn out at least $5 billion of pre-tax cash flow annually by 2020, up from less than $1 billion in 2016. Looking across the rest of Boeing Aside from the 737 and 787 programs, it's likely that Boeing's cash flow will decline over the next few years. The defense business is relatively stable, particularly now that new orders from the Middle East will allow Boeing to keep producing fighter jets into the 2020s. However, the defense business isn't likely to post meaningful growth in the foreseeable future. As for Boeing's other commercial programs, rising production of the venerable 767 -- largely to supply airframes for the KC-46 Pegasus military tanker -- will offset the financial drag from the 747 jumbo-jet program, which faces plummeting demand. On the other hand, the upcoming 777 model transition does represent a significant cash flow headwind. Falling 777 production represents a major cash flow headwind for Boeing. Image source: Boeing. Right now, the 777 is a huge cash cow, driving a disproportionate amount of Boeing's profit. On a pre-tax basis, the 777 could produce as much as $4 billion in cash flow this year. Boeing will slash 777 production by more than 15% next year. By 2018, actual delivery rates will fall by a third, as Boeing starts building the upgraded 777X on the same assembly line. Those 777Xs aren't scheduled for delivery until 2020 and beyond. Between the slowdown in deliveries and the costs of introducing the 777X, the 777 program's cash flow will fall by more than half by 2018. It will start to recover in 2020, though, with the pace of improvement depending largely on whether Boeing runs into unexpected trouble with building the 777X. Plenty of room for cash flow growth Even though the 777 program's cash flow is going to plummet over the next two years, Boeing is still on pace for significant cash flow growth between now and 2019. Simply put, rising cash flow from the 737 and 787 programs will more than offset the headwind from the 777. Looking to 2020 and beyond, Boeing's cash flow could rise further, as the 737 and 787 will continue to churn out strong cash flow while 777 cash profitability will start to recover. Boeing intends to return virtually all of its free cash flow to its shareholders. As investors reap the reward of Boeing's rising cash flow, Boeing shares are likely to move much higher.

By Ed Adamczyk   |   Oct. 10, 2016 at 12:20 PM Follow @upi Comments SEATTLE, Oct. 10 (UPI) -- Boeing Corp. announced Qatar Airways will purchase up to $18.6 billion of its wide-body aircraft, among the largest orders in the manufacturer's history. In the largest order ever placed by Qatar Airways, it agreed to purchase 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300 ER planes, the long-fuselage version of the 777, with total list prices of $11.7 billion; it also arranged an option to buy 60 737 MAX 8 planes, the long-fuselage variant of the Boeing 737 readied for service in 2017, for $6.9 billion at list prices. The sale comes at a time when orders for wide-body planes have decreased, and Qatar Airways, Qatar's state-owned carrier, has been frustrated by delivery and engine problems of Airbus, Boeing's major competitor. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker has described his company's relationship as "strained." Al Baker said the deal had no connection to the approval of the sale of Boeing-made F-15 fighter planes to Qatar. It was suggested the passenger aircraft deal was delayed until there were assurances Congress would approve the sale of the F-15s, the BBC reported. "We don't relate anything to anything," Al Baker said Friday in reference to the connection. "Nothing is attached to anything."

Brown Spaceman - How direct fusion drive will revolutionize space travel Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) has made lots of headway recently as it’s demonstrated huge benefits for spaceflight and exploration. This is the Princeton Satellite systems work and not the John Slough direct drive fusion work. Princeton satellite system DFD is a fusion reactor that is 2 meter in diameter and a 10 meter long device. It’s heated by a novel radio frequency (RF) plasma-heating system, enabling high plasma temperatures for D-³He fusion reactions². Travel 70 km/s vs. typical spacecraft travels between 20-40 km/s Get to Mars in 3-4 months vs. 9 or Pluto in 4.5 years vs. 9 Help reduce risks for astronauts by less exposure to radiation during as a result of longer time spent in space traveling. Instead of using plutonium-238 as fuel (more risk / controversial) using D-³He or deuterium and helium 3 instead. Much safer. Ability to carry more payload and still fit on existing launch vehicles DFD can transmit data rates of 1 million kbit/s vs. spacecraft like New Horizon’s 1 kbit/s. Power supply is impressive with a 2 million W as a DFD spacecraft arrives to Pluto. 2. Universe Today - What are Cepheid Variables? 3.

Nextbigfuture - The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is a future infrared space observatory. On February 17, 2016, WFIRST was formally designated as a mission by NASA. In fiscal year 2014, Congress provided $56 million for WFIRST, and in 2015 Congress provided $50 million.The fiscal year 2016 spending bill provided $90 million for WFIRST. The WFIRST mission entered the ""formulation phase"" in February 2016. WFIRST is on a plan for a mid-2020s launch. The total cost of WFIRST is expected at more than $2 billion; NASA's latest estimate is around $2.0 billion in 2010 dollars, which corresponds to around $2.7 billion in real year (inflation-adjusted) dollars. WFIRST will use gravitational microlensing to find exoplanets down to a mass ten times less than the Earth 17. Most of the stars and planets in the universe are outside solar systems and in between galaxies. Many galaxies, stars, planets and objects have remained unseen. As many as half of all stars in the universe lie in the vast gulfs of space between galaxies, an unexpected discovery made in a new study using NASA rockets. These stars could help solve mysteries regarding missing light and particles that theory had suggested should exist, scientists say. The stars were ejected from their birthplaces by galaxy collisions or mergers. Some estimations suggest up to 100,000 times more rogue planets than stars in the Milky Way. 18. Boeing fears Spacex Raptor engine - CEO vows to put humans on Mars before Spacex but needs over $60 billion for Space Launch System. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg sees a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travelers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by the Atlantic magazine. 19. Nextbigfuture - Spacex and Elon Musk are developing the Interplanetary Transport System, the Raptor engine and the Falcon Heavy on spec. Spacex is mostly self-funding the initial development of those systems. Elon Musk is spending tens of millions per year on developing his Mars colonization plans and the hardware for it. This will scale up to $200-300 million per year by 2018 or so. Space Launch System received $2 billion in the latest fiscal year 2016 annual budget. Raptor-engined Spacex Heavy will crush the Space Launch System The SLS has gotten US$9.8 billion (2011-16) and will get over $40 billion until 2025) The Block 1 SLS which hopes to have a first mission in 2018 can lift 70 tons to low earth orbit. A Block 1B SLS plans to be able to launch about 100 tons to low earth orbit around 2022. A Falcon Heavy has 27 Merlin 1D engines and lift 54.4 tons into low earth orbit. A Raptor Heavy that used 12 Raptor engines would have three times the lifting capacity of a Falcon Heavy. 20. Nextbigfuture - A star known by the unassuming name of KIC 8462852 in the constellation Cygnus has been raising eyebrows both in and outside of the scientific community for the past year. In 2015 a team of astronomers announced that the star underwent a series of very brief, non-periodic dimming events while it was being monitored by NASA’s Kepler space telescope, and no one could quite figure out what caused them. A new study from Carnegie’s Josh Simon and Caltech’s Ben Montet has deepened the mystery. These observations have gotten intense interest because one possibility is that it could be evidence of a mega-advanced alien civilization 21.

But who will get there first? By Ben Rosen, Staff October 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Mars is seen 54 million miles from Earth as captured in 1999 by the Hubble telescope. Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has vowed to beat SpaceX and Elon Musk to Mars. NASA/Reuters View Caption About video ads View Caption of The space race that first brought humans to the moon was propelled by a tense international rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. A half-century later, Boeing’s chief executive envisions a competition between the aeronautics manufacturer and SpaceX having the same result, minus the cold war. Except, this time, the destination is the Red Planet. “I’m convinced the first person to step on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Dennis Muilenburg said at an event hosted by The Atlantic Magazine in Chicago on Oct. 4. Recommended: How much do you know about the space race? Take our quiz The Boeing Company is already in partnership with NASA to develop the Space Launch System, a heavy-lift rocket for deep space exploration. But Mr. Muilenburg’s comments indicate an increasing rivalry between Boeing and SpaceX to be the first to reach Mars and, perhaps, colonize it. This competition could push progress, as SpaceX founder and chief Elon Musk welcomed challengers when he laid out his plans just a week before for a  Mars colony. Test your knowledge How much do you know about the space race? Take our quiz Infographic Space Race, The Sequel: Who is exploring the cosmos today? Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend “The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system.  It’s like building the Union Pacific railroads,” Mr. Musk told the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Sept. 27. Muilenburg indicated a growing competition between Boeing and SpaceX when he spoke of his vision for a commercial space-travel market, according to Bloomberg. He imagined hotels in orbit, hypersonic jets traveling between continents in two minutes, and a Boeing rocket bringing the first human to Mars. Boeing has been working with NASA to make that a reality. The public-private partners have been developing a Space Launch System rocket, which NASA hopes will  bring the first humans to Mars by 2030. The aerospace company has long partnered with NASA. It built the first stage for the Saturn V, the most powerful US rocket built to date, which took men to the moon. SpaceX’s Mars timeline is a bit more ambitious. Musk has said his company plans to bring the first humans to the Red Planet five years sooner, in 2025, with the eventual goal of human colonization of Mars. The two companies have been in competition ever since SpaceX started developing technology to reach space. In 2012, NASA chose Boeing, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada Corp. to taxi astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting Earth. NASA had the three companies share $1.1 billion in funding, with Boeing receiving the most money at the time. But SpaceX was the first of the three companies to deliver cargo to the ISS. Just like Russia charges NASA a fee to shuttle astronauts to the ISS now, the companies will have NASA pay them per seat. But corporate ventures to Mars and deep space has some scientists, lawyers, philosophers, and science fiction writers worried. “I personally would hate that: turning the cosmos into a kind of billionaires’ playground,” Kim Stanley Robinson, an acclaimed science fiction writer, told The Christian Science Monitor’s Lonnie Shekhtman last month. Others have raised concerns about the reign a corporation or extra-planetary power could hold over resources on the Red Planet.   “If somebody gets control of oxygen, they could very well have control over the whole population and could threaten dire consequences in return for extraordinary levels of power,” Charles Cockell, an astrobiologist at the University of Edinburgh, pointed out to the BBC in 2014. But other countries are also aiming for Mars. The space programs that have already sent uncrewed missions to the fourth planet include the US, Russia, the European Space Agency, and India, with China having plans to follow. With the price of putting an astronaut on Mars in the billions of dollars, Musk envisions funding the project through some type of public-private partnership, writes Ms. Shekhtman. SpaceX, for instance, would generate income from launching satellites and doing work on ISS.  This report contains material from the Associated Press.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search Revolutionizing Manufacturing with Virtual Reality And Augmented Reality   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Manufacturing Excellence * Digital Manufacturing * Manufacturing Technology By Industry: * ManufacturingDUBAI, UAE - Oct. 10, 2016 - PRLog -- The manufacturing sector has undergone dynamic change, with global manufacturers encouraging innovation. In the integration of digitalization and adoption of new technologies lies the future of manufacturing. In this context, Dr. Rab Scott, Head of Virtual Reality and Modelling Group, Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) with Boeing will deliver a case study presentation at the GCC Manufacturing Excellence and Technology Summit 2016 that will be held on 14-15 November 2016 at Sofitel Dubai The Palm Resort & Spa. His presentation will focus on exploring the potential of virtual reality and augmented reality in manufacturing. Before his session at the summit, Dr. Rab Scott discusses the importance of integrating virtual reality and augmented reality in manufacturing processes. 1. Could you please elaborate a bit on your work within AMRC with Boeing? The AMRC with Boeing is a research centre which is part of the University of Sheffield and which has nearly 100 industrial partners ranging from Boeing and Rolls-Royce to local SMEs. It was established in 2001 with 8 people - I was one of those 8! Currently I am Head of Virtual Reality and Simulation and also Digital Theme Lead. As such, I work with companies on projects using Virtual and Augments Reality and incorporating the "digital thread". By this I mean the integration of cyber-physical systems into what is known as a "digital twin"002E. 2. According to you, what would be the key advantage of incorporating virtual reality in manufacturing processes? The advantage of using virtual reality in manufacturing is the ability to firstly "try before you buy" - the ability to test scenarios, designs and factory or facility layouts before implementing them physically means that you can "fail faster" but fail virtually - therefore reducing risk, cost and time. 3. Modeling, Simulation, and Visualization are critical technologies. Please share briefly about a project where visualization tools/ technologies has provided increased value An example of where the use of advanced visualization has increased value has been in the area of new facility design and layout. One company with whom we have worked, wanted to build a new facility for manufacturing. By using a combination of simulation linked to virtual reality, the company was able to engage multiple stakeholder groups in the same audience. By doing this, it created discussion which identified a number of design issues that were resolved in the virtual world before the construction had started. Another example is where a company had designed a product but wanted to evaluate the design for manufacturability. They were able to get immersed in the digital mockup of the product, identify areas which would have been very challenging to manufacture and change the assembly process to aid access. 4. What will you be presenting at the GCC Manufacturing Excellence & Technology Summit 2016 I will be presenting an overview of the history and culture behind one of the UK's leading manufacturing research centres and a few case studies on how VR and AR have provided value for our partners. 5. What will be the key takeaway for attendees from your presentation? The key takeaway will be that the digital world can provide value throughout a product's lifecycle and that failure *is* an option, as long as it is done virtually! Hear Dr. Rab Scott speak at length at the GCC Manufacturing Excellence and Technology Summit 2016. The summit is scheduled to take place on 14-15 November 2016 at Sofitel Dubai The Palm Resort & Spa.

Transistor. Ever. For more than a decade, engineers have been eyeing the finish line in the race to shrink the size of components in integrated circuits. They knew that the laws of physics had set a 5-nanometer threshold on the size of transistor gates among conventional semiconductors, about one-quarter the size of high-end 20-nanometer-gate transistors now on the market. A research team led by faculty scientist Ali Javey at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has done just that by creating a transistor with a working 1-nanometer gate. Berkeley Lab Boeing CEO vows to beat Musk to Mars Boeing Co. once helped the U.S. beat the Soviet Union in the race to the moon. Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference Tuesday, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travelers between continents in two hours or less. Bloomberg Sam Altman's manifest destiny One balmy May evening, thirty of Silicon Valley’s top entrepreneurs gathered in a private room at the Berlinetta Lounge, in San Francisco. Paul Graham considered the founders of Instacart, DoorDash, Docker, and Stripe, in their hoodies and black jeans, and said, "This is Silicon Valley, right here." All the founders were graduates of Y Combinator, the startup "accelerator" that Graham co-founded: a three-month boot camp, run twice a year, in how to become a "unicorn" -- Valleyspeak for a billion-dollar company. The New Yorker Comcast's 1TB data caps start to roll out nationwide Comcast's data restrictions are going from testing to reality for most of its customers. Its 'Xfinity Terabyte Internet Data Usage Plan' is already in place in a number of places, and will roll out to 18 new markets (including California, Michigan, Florida and others listed on its FAQ) beginning November 1st. For its part, the ISP claims 99 percent of customers use less than 1TB of data per month, and that median use is just 75GB. Engadget Samsung knew a third replacement Note 7 caught fire on Tuesday and said nothing Another replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has caught fire, bringing the total to three this week alone. This one was owned by Michael Klering of Nicholasville, Kentucky. He told WKYT that he woke up at 4AM to find his bedroom filled with smoke and his phone on fire. Later in the day, he went to the hospital with acute bronchitis caused by smoke inhalation. The Verge Linus Torvalds admits 'buggy crap' made it into Linux 4.8 Linus Torvalds gave the world Linux 4.8 earlier this week, but now appears to wish he didn't after spotting some code he says can "kill the kernel." When Torvalds announced Linux 4.8 on Sunday he said the final version added “a few stragging fixes since rc8." But by Tuesday he was back on the Linux Kernel Mailing list apologizing for a bug fix gone bad. The Register 53% of DDoS attacks result in additional compromise DDoS attack volume has remained consistently high and these attacks cause real damage to organizations, according to Neustar. The global response also affirms the prevalent use of DDoS attacks to distract as “smokescreens” in concert with other malicious activities that result in additional compromise, such as viruses and ransomware. Help Net Security A fascinating film about the last day of hot metal typesetting at the New York Times On July 2, 1978 the New York Times made a significant technological leap when they scuttled the last of 60 manually-operated linotype machines to usher in the era of digital and photographic typesetting. When working at 100% efficiency with an experienced operator the Linotype machines could produce 14 lines per minute cast on the spot from hot lead. That number would increase to 1,000 lines per minute the very next day using an array of computers and digital storage. This Is Colossal Designing the Elusive Targets system in 2016's Hitman One of our mandates for the first season was to present Agent 47 as the apex predator, traveling the world, meeting interesting people, and killing them. Part of this mandate was a challenge to the design team: create a moment in time, "a snipe where your one shot matters" -- the purest possible experience of being the assassin. Another objective was to create an ongoing pulse of experiences throughout the first season of Hitman, with tense assassination missions at the heart of those experiences. Gamasutra USA Freedom Act requires government to declassify any order to Yahoo In the wake of reports this week that the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)ordered Yahoo to scan all of its users’ email in 2015, there are many unanswered legal and technical questions about the mass surveillance. But before we can even begin to answer them, there is a more fundamental question: what does the court order say? EFF It came from Redmond: Windows Server 2016 could rattle the competition A couple of decades ago, Microsoft was the kaiju of network computing. First came MS-DOS, and Windows soon followed. Each simply took over business desktops. Before Novell knew what hit it, Windows was then infused with the DNA of OS/2 and became Windows NT and in turn NT Server. Novell had dominated the early PC networking market, but by the end of the 1990s the company was a shadow of its former self. Ars Technica The cost of forsaking C The C programming language is not trendy. The most recent edition of the canonical C text (the excitingly named The C Programming Language) was published in 1988; C is so unfashionable that the authors have neglected to update it in light of 30 years of progress in software engineering. Everyone “has been meaning to” learn Rust or Go or Clojure over a weekend, not C. There isn’t even a cute C animal in C’s non-logo on a C decal not stuck to your laptop.

The effort is seen as an evolution in computing that allows users to interact with machines in natural conversation style, telling devices to tend to tasks such as ordering goods, checking traffic, making restaurant reservations or searching for information. Phys.org (also, MIT AI lectures) 'Nano-machines' win European trio chemistry Nobel prize A European trio of chemists have won the Nobel prize in chemistry for developing “nano-machines”, an advance that paved the way for the world’s first smart materials. Sir Fraser Stoddart, from Scotland, Bernard Feringa, from the Netherlands, and Jean-Pierre Sauvage, from France, will share the 8m Swedish kronor (£718,000) prize announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm today.

ABC We made a Doom level and got id designers to critique it I've played, and reviewed, a lot of first-person shooters.

PC Gamer What SMART stats tell us about hard drives What if a hard drive could tell you it was going to fail before it actually did? Is that possible? Each day Backblaze records the SMART stats that are reported by the 67,814 hard drives we have spinning in our Sacramento data center. SMART stands for Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology and is a monitoring system included in hard drives that reports on various attributes of the state of a given drive. Backblaze Netflix CEO: Movie theaters are "strangling the movie business" It's no surprise that Netflix would disagree with the traditional release schedule movie theaters stick to -- premiering new movies in theaters and delaying their release to TV or on-demand services months later -- and today the company’s CEO Reed Hastings took that a step further, saying theater chains are discouraging innovation in the industry. The Consumerist We need to save the internet from the internet of things Brian Krebs is a popular reporter on the cybersecurity beat.

Vice Why AI makes it hard to prove that self-driving cars are safe Car manufacturers will have difficulty demonstrating just how safe self-driving vehicles are because of what's at the core of their smarts: machine learning.

Pictured here is the Boeing 737 MAX 8 in Qatar Airways' livery. Pic: Courtesy of BoeingKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 10 (Bernama) -- Boeing and Qatar Airways announced last Friday, Oct 7 an order for 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, valued at US11.7 billion at list prices, validating the value, reliability and performance of Boeing's twin-aisle airplanes. The airline also signed a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at US$6.9 billion at list prices. This announcement builds on Qatar Airways' current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With this new order, Qatar Airways increases its firm order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. The announcement was attended by the State of Qatar's Minister of Finance, His Excellency Ali Shareef Al Emadi, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and the Ambassador of Qatar, His Excellency Mohammed Jaham Al-Kuwari. "Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead," said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker in a statement today. "Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today's announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service." Qatar Airways' relationship with Boeing was renewed in 2006. Since then, there have been many milestones in the partnership. The airline was the first to operate the 787 in the Middle East and is a launch customer for the 777X. With the commitment for the 737 MAX 8, it would be the first Boeing single-aisle airplane model to join Qatar Airways' fleet in more than 15 years. "Congratulations to The Boeing Company and Qatar Airways on the remarkable milestone they've reached, which will significantly grow the number of Boeing aircraft in the Qatar Airways fleet," said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. "Beyond its importance for these two companies, this agreement demonstrates the importance of global commercial partnerships in strengthening our bilateral ties. This deal will strengthen economic opportunity and job creation, and highlights the importance of strong global trading relationships." "We are so very proud that a discerning and market-leading customer like Qatar Airways not only continues to endorse our current products, but also has confidence in Boeing's new technology that will soon be evident on the 777X and 737 MAX," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes." The 777-300ER is the most reliable twin-aisle airplane flying today and is considered to be the flagship of the world's elite airlines. It has the highest schedule reliability of any twin-aisle airplane at 99.5 percent - the airplane is on time, nearly all the time. The 787-9 Dreamliner is the second member of the super-efficient, passenger-pleasing 787 family. The 787-9, a stretch of the 787-8, can fly 290 passengers 7,635 nautical miles (14,140 km) in addition to more cargo, allowing airlines the ability to grow routes first opened by the 787-8. Boeing's newest family of single-aisle airplanes - 737 MAX 7, 737 MAX 8, 737 MAX 9 and 737 MAX 200 - builds on the Next-Generation 737's popularity and reliability while delivering customers unsurpassed fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2017. --BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Earthquake: Stay Vigilant, Najib Advises Malaysians In New Zealand BNM Tightens NDF Trading Rules Country's Future Cannot Depend On Hypocritical Political Pact - Najib Other News Headlines PPBM-Pakatan Harapan Collaboration Will Not Work - Ismail Sabri- politic Labuan To Agressively Promote Itself As An Attractive Tourism Destination- business Annuar Musa Stays Put With Decision To Resign From Kafa- sports The Best And Freshest Produce At Maha 2016- features Flash Flood Hits Five Villages In East Java's Tulungagung District- world Most Read News Earthquake: Stay Vigilant, Najib Advises Malaysians In New Zealand Agong, Permaisuri Attend Wedding Reception Of MSU President's Daughter Seven Districts In Perak At Risk Of High Tide Flooding Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

It’s all about “carrying out what the client envisions,” says Deryl McKissack, who was in Chicago last week for meetings around town. McKissack & McKissack is based in D.C. and has had a Chicago office for nearly 20 years. Chicago Public Schools has been a longtime client. More recently, the firm helped oversee construction of the $251 million new Malcolm X College and is managing some of the $500 million McCormick Place expansion, including for the new event center and the Marriott Marquis hotel. The firm also oversaw the Ferris Wheel re-do at Navy Pier. McKissack has a home in Chicago. She is friends with health care executive Eric Whitaker, a golfing buddy of President Barack Obama, and she counts Whitaker’s wife, Cheryl Whitaker, CEO NextLevel Health Partners, as a close friend along with Seaway Bank Chairman Veranda Dickens and Midway Broadcasting Chairman Melody Spann-Cooper. In Washington, McKissack’s firm worked on the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial and on upgrades for the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials. McKissack is a descendant of slaves, so work on the African-American history museum was especially personal. “I saw the museum in several different stages of construction, but it didn’t come to life for me until I saw the exhibits,” she says. “You start out with this lonely feeling and when you leave, you feel inspired.” Boeing hopes to beat Elon Musk to be first on Mars Dennis Muilenburg | AP file photo Move over Elon Musk. Boeing plans to be the first to land on Mars. CEO Dennis Muilenburg revealed plans for a mission to the red planet last week during the “What’s Next” conference in Chicago. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at the event sponsored by The Atlantic and underwritten by Boeing. His comments came on the heels of Musk laying out his own plans to ferry passengers to Mars. Musk is the billionaire co-founder of PayPal and SpaceX, a private space cargo company. Muilenburg’s vision also includes hyper-sonic aircraft shuttling travelers and cargo to different continents in two hours or less, he says. He even foresees space hotels. Muilenburg recalled as a child building planes out of Legos and idolizing the late Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon. He went on to study aerospace engineering in college and his first job was interning at Boeing. Now in his 31st year at the company, Muilenburg sees the future in space. Boeing certainly has the track record to accomplish a Mars landing. The rocketmaker helped send U.S. astronauts to the moon in 1969. It built the first stage for Saturn V, which took astronauts to the moon and back. And Boeing has worked with NASA to develop a rocket for deep space exploration. According to the tech blog Engadget, Musks’ SpaceX is aiming for a 2024 manned mission to Mars, while NASA and Boeing hope to launch in the 2030s. Given likely delays and other factors, the blog says, it’s going to be a close fight to be first. Valerie Jarrett’s hipster mom Barbara T. Bowman, co-founder of the Erikson Institute | Courtesy of Robert Knapp Photography Barbara T. Bowman headlined The Moth, the very hip storytelling program that airs on WBEZ. The Chicago educator co-founded the Erikson Institute graduate school in child development and is mom to White House aide Valerie Jarrett. Bowman’s talk won’t be featured on the air, as she took the stage at a private event in front of 140 education wonks and Erikson supporters. Her story focused on growing up in a conservative Christian family and how she came to appreciate religious differences. It began when she ended up in the infirmary one day at boarding school. Her roommate was Jewish. “Why we began to talk about religion instead of boys, I can’t tell you,” she said, prompting a roar from the crowd. “She had beliefs that I thought were strange, and I had beliefs that she didn’t understand at all.” Bowman, 87, said she joked about the pain of eating fish on Fridays and her friend talked about her own Friday traditions. The two became “lifelong friends.” She then deftly transitioned to talking about education, a move that would have boosted her rating had she been judged in a regular Moth performance. “To be effective while working with young children and families, you must have self-awareness and pay deep attention to relationships,” she said. “That’s why we ask our students at Erikson to do what we did tonight — think about their past experiences and try to understand them from different perspectives.” The event at Architectural Artifacts was part of Erikson’s 50th anniversary celebration. Cubs Corner: Keeping mom’s passion alive Vincent Anzalone and his 18-month-old son, Luca. | Provided photo Brothers Vincent Anzalone and Dan Stelzer are among the throngs who scored post-season tickets to Cubs games. It’s thanks to their late mom. Patricia Stelzer, a lifelong Cubs fan who died of cancer in 2006 and left jewelry to her sons. After a long time on the waiting list for Cubs season tickets, Dan Stelzer, a mortgage broker, had a chance to buy. He and Anzalone decided they’d sell mom’s jewelry to purchase the season tickets knowing she’d be thrilled at their being able to fulfill a Cubs dream. Last year, Anzalone took his 18-month-old son, Luca, to his first Cubs game. “It was with tickets essentially paid for by my mother,” said the real estate broker, who also appeared on Bravo’s “100 Days of Summer.” “I don’t know if that’s a full circle moment but it’s pretty close.” Read more Taking Names at shiakapos.com.

The low-cost airline is locked in talks with major stakeholder Greybull Capital and Boeing, and expects to unveil a massive funding overhaul to satisfy the Civil Aviation Authority’s financial health check-list and clinch a new Air Travel Operators’ Licence (Atol). Monarch was granted a stay of execution by the aviation authority just four hours before its Atol was due to expire at the end of last month, and now faces another looming deadline on Wednesday when the twelve day extension expires. Monarch boss Andrew Swaffield has assured staff that the deal will go through but warned that it will not conclude before the day of the crunch deadline. In a letter sent to Monarch Airlines staff on Friday, Mr Swaffield said that the legal and finance teams are still working to “dot the i’s and cross the t’s on the largest investment in our history”. “As soon as we are able to give details of our investment and confirm the renewal I will. But to manage your expectations, this will be on the 12th (Wednesday),” he said. Credit: Oramstock / Alamy The aviation authority was initially reluctant to renew Monarch’s licence due to concerns over its available cash, but the airline is preparing to bounce back with a major new financing deal with Boeing and a fresh cash injection from Greybull Capital which owns a 90pc stake in the company. Monarch is expected to adapt an existing order with Boeing for as many as 45 new aircraft to release significant cashflow back into the business. The deal will enable the airline to enter into a “sale-and-leaseback agreement” which could see Boeing buy Monarch's order on the condition that the airline agrees to lease the planes for a set period. It is not known whether the deal spans the entire order, which includes 30 aircraft and the potential for 15 more, but the total deal for 45 Boeing 737 airliners is understood to be worth around $2bn (£1.54bn) with each plane costing about $50m. Monarch is hoping that this week’s financial injection will draw a line under a difficult two year overhaul for the airline under new owners Greybull. The fund snapped up a majority share after agreeing to pump £125m of capital into Monarch in 2014 in the airline’s third bailout in as many years. Earlier this summer Monarch warned that more funding would be needed, sounding a warning in its annual report that it was looking to secure facilities totalling £35m either from owner Greybull Capital or an outside lender. At the same time Monarch has attracted the interest of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, which also owns ground-handling services business Swissport, reigniting speculation that a stake in the privately-held carrier may be up for sale.

Qatar has not ordered 737s previously.   Airline Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker took the opportunity of the announcement in Washington to further press Boeing to build a new jet slightly larger than the 737 to fill a gap in Boeing’s product line.   Asked in an interview when he expected to hear more about that proposed plane, Al Baker said: “Yesterday!”   Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the same interview, said Boeing continues to evaluate such a plane and talk with customers.   “I think we have a pretty good idea today as to what our customers would like to see with respect to seat count, range capabilities,” Conner said, adding that Boeing understands how quickly customers want the plane.   “Now it’s a matter of us going back and doing our homework and figuring out how do we put all of that together,” he said. “I can’t give you a real time frame on that, but we’re certainly working the heck out of it right now.”   BIG ORDER The deal for 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft is significantly larger than an order for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain’s Farnborough Airshow in July.   That announcement was postponed by Qatar in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said.   The orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional list value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX jets are purchased. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders.   Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   Qatar Airways’ order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive.   Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the United States at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer.   The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but “they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined,” Bastian said at an event in New York.   “That doesn’t sound fair, that doesn’t sound free,” he said.   The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.

The airline also signed a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices. Today’s announcement builds on Qatar Airways’ current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With this new order, Qatar Airways increases its firm order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. The announcement was attended by the State of Qatar’s Minister of Finance, His Excellency Ali Shareef Al Emadi, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and the Ambassador of Qatar, His Excellency Mohammed Jaham Al-Kuwari. "Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead,” said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker. “Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today's announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service." Qatar Airways’ relationship with Boeing was renewed in 2006. Since then, there have been many milestones in the partnership. The airline was the first to operate the 787 in the Middle East and is a launch customer for the 777X. With the commitment for the 737 MAX 8, it would be the first Boeing single-aisle airplane model to join Qatar Airways’ fleet in more than 15 years. "Congratulations to The Boeing Company and Qatar Airways on the remarkable milestone they’ve reached, which will significantly grow the number of Boeing aircraft in the Qatar Airways fleet,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. “Beyond its importance for these two companies, this agreement demonstrates the importance of global commercial partnerships in strengthening our bilateral ties. This deal will strengthen economic opportunity and job creation, and highlights the importance of strong global trading relationships." “We are so very proud that a discerning and market-leading customer like Qatar Airways not only continues to endorse our current products, but  also has confidence in Boeing’s new technology that will soon be evident on the 777X and 737 MAX,” said  Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes.” The 777-300ER is the most reliable twin aisle airplane flying today and is considered to be the flagship of the world’s elite airlines. It has the highest schedule reliability of any twin-aisle airplane at 99.5 per cent – the airplane is on time, nearly all the time. The 787-9 Dreamliner is the second member of the super-efficient, passenger-pleasing 787 family. The 787-9, a stretch of the 787-8, can fly 290 passengers 7,635 nautical miles (14,140 km) in addition to more cargo, allowing airlines the ability to grow routes first opened by the 787-8. Boeing’s newest family of single-aisle airplanes – 737 MAX 7, 737 MAX 8, 737 MAX 9 and 737 MAX 200 – builds on the Next-Generation 737’s popularity and reliability while delivering customers unsurpassed fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2017. -Ends- © Press Release 2016 © Copyright Zawya.

The order for up to 100 jetliners helps fill out Boeing’s order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus. The deal includes 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliners, 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft plus the 737 MAX 8 options. It is significantly larger than a deal for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain’s Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up US approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The firm orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX options are exercised. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Qatari order is likely to further intensify concern among US airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive.

The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the US state of Ohio, but “they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and US airlines combined,” Bastian said at an event in New York. “That doesn’t sound fair, that doesn’t sound free,” he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful US businesses, including FedEx Corp and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.—Agencies Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articlePeace vital to prosperity of Pakistan: APBF Next articleUNISAME urges to strengthen micro, medium sized sector Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Economy Watch Bahria Town, Hyatt Hotels sign agreement for 4 signature resort properties in Pakistan Economy Watch Dar urges SECP to create cell of experts to provide guidance on Companies Ordinance Economy Watch Dream of game-changer CPEC materialised Digital Newspaper Social Diary Oil & Gas Leap Forward Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: .....

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ MUMBAI: The prime minister’s office (PMO) has made a rare outreach to top global consultancy McKinsey and several MNCs operating in India to discuss ways to unshackle India’s burdensome regulations to enhance the ease of doing business in India, three people who attended the meeting told ET. Senior-most bureaucrats from the PMO met representatives of McKinsey and top executives of the Indian subsidiaries of Boeing, Unilever, Coca Cola, ABB and Vodafone on September 24. Modi’s trusted bureaucrat Nripendra Misra, principal secretary at the PMO, with other bureaucrats sat through a detailed presentation by McKinsey’s senior partner Alok Kshirsagar and his team on ideas to improve the way business is done in India, the sources said. Kshirsagar’s presentation also had CEOs including Vodafone’s Sunil Sood, Boeing India’s Pratyush Kumar. Hindustan Unilever’s Sanjiv Mehta, Venkatesh Kini of Coca Cola, Sanjeev Sharma of ABB, Ranjit Shahani of Novartis among others. Misra chaired the meeting with a phalanx of bureaucrats from the PMO including Amitabh Kant, CEO, Niti Aayog and joint secretaries TV Somanathan and Anurag Jain. Digitisation of labour law compliance and extending Modi’s `self-certification’ initiative for individuals and companies, with sufficient deterrence for misrepresentation, was among the issues that were on top of the agenda of the meeting Misra chaired, they said. Ways to streamline onerous compliance processes, eliminating paperwork and obsolete processes and resolve inconsistencies across ministries was also discussed as also the need to iron out differences in Indian and global standards. One of the senior bureaucrats present at the meeting was reluctant to elaborate on what transpired saying it is “early days yet.” Two CEOs who were present at the meeting corroborated this, but declined further comment saying the discussions were confidential. An email sent to McKinsey & Co’s Indian operations sought time but later said their officials were travelling. Misra is said to have assigned tasks to his bureaucrat colleagues for a time-bound plan and directed them to take “rapid action” on the prioritised items. One point that engaged all was a plan to rationalise central and state procedures by simplifying and digitising labour law compliance. Eliminating the use of physical registers at factories and service enterprises and developing clear guidelines at service enterprises and factories by expanding the use of Shram Suvidha portal for all central labour laws to as a single online window was a suggestion that found favour. It is learnt that the PMO will be closely monitoring the progress on this front. The principal secretary will conduct a review in 30 days. Increasing the use of self-certification by companies and clear norms for penalties and resolution of disputes was also discussed. The movement towards a trust-based compliance regime will be bolstered with heavy penalties for violations, as is prevalent in the western economies, was a solution suggested. Increase the use of accredited 3rd party certification agencies for accredited labs for food that may have raised concerns was also discussed, presumably prompted by the recent fallout from the Nestle Maggi fiasco. Another important topic that the top brass of corporate India discussed was the need to harmonise reporting requirements and formats including MCA 21 and accelerate use of Udyog Adhar and integrate it with e-biz portal. One of the problems identified was that once the inspectors checked the compliance of government norms, a follow-up was not strictly carried out. The meeting arrived at a consensus on need to make inspectors vigorously follow up on post-compliance outcomes, and draft standardised metrics for them to use in major sectors. It is important to see how many trees have survived and not how many trees have been planted, it was pointed out at the meeting. Another issue was to have MNCs expand the use of micro, small and medium enterprises by letting vendor financing solutions as a negotiable instrument to meet the 45-day payment requirement. One of the submissions made at the meeting was to have uniform guidelines for cell towers and right of way to be deployed across municipalities and states. Currently, the industry needs at least 10 approvals per tower and each has differing interpretations The government is also looking at digitising aerospace and defence outset compliance processes which currently involved 1000 plus pages of paperwork. The group also argued for a predictable time period of 6-8 weeks from notification of price changes and execution and move to a prospective mandate. For instance, price changes for pharma products should be only for those manufactured on or after the date of notification rather than requiring the recall and waste of existing stock to re-label each one. However, legal circles are not very enthused. They believe only legislative actions can change things in a more lasting way and brainstorming in itself means little in way of government setting policy. “This is not easy. There are legislative provisions that need to be changed. Unless that is changed, there is no point of window dressing,” Suhas Tuljapurkar, managing partner, Legasis Partners. Saying that what the government hope to do is systematically move away from the current regime which is “comply or perish” to the next level of “comply or explain,” which is prevalent in U.K and other European nations. “The mindsets of regulators and inspectors have to move towards that,” Tulzapurkar added. Otherwise, whatever the government does will be “merely a whitewash.” The meeting also discussed increased accountability of self-regulatory bodies like Advertising Standards Council of India. After the deliberations, Misra apparently expressed enthusiasm for a similar meeting on enhancing trade and investments with the group of CEOs with a focus on easing domestic and international processes to facilitate rapid growth. ET View Centre & states must push reforms The Prime Minister’s initiative is welcome, given the commendable goals he has set to improve India’s position in the ease of doing business. Hopefully, big ideas will emanate. But there are many obvious things for both the Centre and states to do in areas such as enforcing contracts and improving courts to resolve disputes. India also needs swiftly operationalize the bankruptcy code to resolve insolvency. Doing business here is tardy due to the opaqueness in political funding. Reform to make poll funding transparent will bring about a sea change. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

"You have more clarity from the U.S. election, with the uncertainty from that heading lower; you've got less uncertainty from OPEC, and that's bullish for stocks," said Adam Sarhan, CEO of Sarhan Capital. Quotes in the article TD Ameritrade Holding Corp AMTD ▲ 36.68 +0.77 +2.14% The Dow Jones industrial average rose 150 points, with Apple and Boeing contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 gained more than 0.7 percent, with energy rising about 1.8 percent to lead all sectors higher. "A breakout appears likely from a short-term momentum standpoint, and we highlight shifts on the macro front that are indicative of risk-on positioning," said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG. "Consecutive daily closes above the 50-day moving average near 2158 would mark a breakout and set the stage for new all-time highs, with only minor resistance at the August high near 2194." The Nasdaq composite advanced approximately 0.9 percent, with Apple and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) gaining more than 1 percent. U.S. crude rose more than 3.4 percent to $51.54 per barrel while Brent futures hit a one-year high after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia is ready to join a proposed cap on oil output by OPEC members. Putin, speaking at an energy congress in the Turkish city of Istanbul, said he hoped that OPEC members would confirm the decision to adopt quotas for output when the organization meets in November. "This has removed the uncertainty and now we are in clear," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, in a morning note. "However, it is important to keep in mind that unless we see the planned action complete, caution may the best practice. If history tells us anything, it is this that these major oil players also have habit to not to respect the agreed agreement." Investors were also keeping an eye on the U.S. presidential election. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton squared off in a town hall-style debate Sunday night in St. Louis. Trump, in particular, largely stuck to personal attacks, threatening at one point that he would "get a special prosecutor" to look into Clinton's handling of classified information if he were elected president. "I would have to agree that the market is taking at [a tie]," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "If the market had thought that Trump had gotten a positive gain, we wouldn't be higher." U.S. futures traded higher before the opening bell, with Dow futures rising more than 100 points, while S&P and Nasdaq futures gained 11.75 points and 24.25 points, respectively. Still, Cardillo said trading volume was likely to be light on Monday, given the Columbus Day holiday during which U.S. banks were closed. The Mexican peso shot more than 2 percent higher against the dollar on Monday. The dollar-Mexican peso trade has been a proxy trade during the election, given Trump's desire to build a wall along the Mexican border and call to go as far as withdrawing the U.S. from NAFTA if he were elected. Trump "had a better evening compared to his previous showdown with the former Secretary of State, yet all polls currently suggest that the Democrat will be the one to pack her bags for the White House," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. Trump's campaign has been under fire recently, after a leaked 2005 video of the GOP standard bearer's vulgar remarks about women caused uproar. In economic news, there are no major data due Monday. The U.S. bonds market was also closed due to the Columbus Day holiday. The dollar rose 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.116 and the yen around 103.5. Currency traders also kept an eye on the British pound, following its "flash crash" against the dollar last week. The pound traded 0.5 percent lower against the dollar, near $1.237. Overseas, European equities rose after receiving a boost from crude prices. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index gained 0.59 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mixed. In corporate news, Mylan agreed to pay $465 million to settle charges that it overcharged the government for its EpiPen products. Meanwhile, Twitter shares fell more than 14 percent after Bloomberg reported the company was unlikely to be bought out by another company. —Reuters contributed to this report.

Economy 2016-10-10T16:40+02:00 16:40 10.10.2016 Progresstech-Ukraine: Share of Ukrainians involved in Boeing projects grows in last three years The share of Ukrainian professionals involved in Boeing projects has increased significantly over the past three years - from 0.1% to 2%. According to the press service of the Progresstech-Ukraine engineering company, its director Andriy Fialkovsky said this at the international aviation forum Aerocongress 2016. According to him, three years ago the share of Ukrainians involved in modeling next generation Boeing aircraft did not exceed 0.1%, and Ukrainian engineers working outside the country were involved in this work. "We returned them to Ukraine, offering highly intellectual jobs, and invited new talented engineers," he said. Fialkovsky expressed hope that in the coming years this figure will increase by 1.5-2 times. He also noted a gradual increase in the demand for engineering services from Ukrainian aviation market entities. Given the apparent revival of air traffic, managers of Ukrainian airports, who think several moves ahead, are already preparing for the arrival of new airlines and accepting new types of aircraft. Many of them need to upgrade infrastructure, prepare for the increase in passenger traffic.

Source: RoKAF South Korea is to acquire a further two Boeing E-737 airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft to add to the four fielded since 2012, national media reported on 9 October. An unidentified source within the Republic of Korea Air Force (RoKAF) was quoted by the Yonhap news agency confirming plans to buy two further E-737 AEW&C platforms, dubbed Peace Eye in national service. The Peace Eye programme was launched by South Korea in 2006 to provide airborne early warning coverage throughout the entire Korean peninsula, as well as some parts of China and Japan. Deliveries of the first four aircraft to Gimhae Air Base in South Gyeongsang Province were completed in October 2012. The E-737 AEW&C aircraft is built around the Northrop Grumman multirole electronically scanned array (MESA) surveillance radar that is mounted in a dorsal fairing above the rear fuselage. This MESA radar provides 360° coverage at ranges in excess of 174 n miles (322 km; 200 miles) for aerial targets and 130 n miles (241 km; 150 miles) for patrol boat-sized surface contacts. These ranges can be significantly increased if the radar's power is focused in a particular direction, rather than applied in a general sweep. The aircraft's patrol endurance of nine hours at 300 n miles from base can be extended by aerial refuelling using either the standard boom-and-receptacle method, or via a hose-and-drogue conversion. The aircraft carries a flight crew of two and a mission crew of six to 10. South Korea procured the E-737 AEW&C as part of a wider effort to expand its airborne surveillance and early warning infrastructure. The country already has four Hawker 800SIG Paekdu (also known as Baekdu)/Peace Pioneer signals intelligence (SIGINT) aircraft and four Peace Krypton Hawker 800RA radar surveillance aircraft, and has also announced plans to buy four Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

The carrier is delaying deliveries of 39 of the upgraded single-aisle planes originally scheduled for 2018 to 2020, the company said in a filing at the weekend to Borsa Istanbul. Turkish is raising its 2022 deliveries for the workhorse jets to 30 from the six it had previously planned. The company did not elaborate on the models that will be deferred, but it has ordered 92 Airbus A321neo, 65 of Boeing’s 737 Max 8 and 10 of the US plane maker’s Max 9 models. Turkish, based in Istanbul, said it was reducing flight frequencies and shifting to smaller planes on "demand-challenged routes" after posting a second-quarter loss of US$215 million in August. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related New A320s for biggest Thai budget airline as profits go stratospheric Airbus hits downdraught with passenger jet profits nosediving by a quarter Etihad service to Texas to go daily in February Boeing wins $18.6 billion deal as Qatar Airways takes first 737 Max jetliner More Aviation Air Arabia third-quarter profit lifted by passenger gains Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Honda plans to increase business jet production Jet Airways income edges up MOST VIEWED Business | All Abu Dhabi’s Royal Jet offers VIP alternative to travelling first class Renault faces criminal inquiry over emissions cheating suspicions Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Dubai Parks operator aims to lift revenue as costs rise A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first Head of GE Oil & Gas says oil industry cuts not done yet Trump looms large over World Economic Forum event in Dubai India’s currency move will hit property and gold Chinese interest in Dubai Green Fund More Most Viewed American-Iranian political tensions will only escalate UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi Girl, 16, trafficked to Dubai and forced into prostitution, court hears Louvre Abu Dhabi announces first contemporary art installations Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Having trouble saving money in the UAE?

Home News Science, Space & Robotics Mysterious Mars has a flag and Yemen wannabe owners We decided to take a look at some interesting facts about the place that could become our home someday By: Lana Jelic | Science, Space & Robotics News | Posted: Oct 10, 2016 5:26 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA We've learned a lof about Mars in the past decades thanks to probes and rovers that are studying the closest planet to Earth. If everything goes as planned, Mars could become our second home someday. Elon Musk has ambitious plans in colonizing Mars, and he isn't the only one who wants to send people to the Red Planet. Just last week Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of The Boeing Company, stated that he is convinced that the first humans to set foot on Mars will get there by a Boeing rocket.     Whoever sends the first people to Mars will set a huge milestone in the history of humankind. It will mark the first time a human being has set foot on another planet, and it could happen during our lifetime. Can you just imagine how exciting it must have been for people around the world sitting in front of TVs and watching the first Moon landing? We could experience the same, but this time the space exploration will get us much further.   If and when the first people reach Mars, it will also mark the first time a person walked on any other space body other than Earth since 1972 when Eugene Cernan was the last person to walk on the Moon.   We decided to take a look at some interesting facts about the place that could become our home someday.   • Over 200,000 people have applied for a one-way trip to colonize Mars.   • A year on Mars has 687 earth days, and the days last for 24 hours and 37 minutes.   • Sunsets on Mars do not look like the ones on Earth. The sun sets on Mars with a bluish glow, due to the rare (thin) atmosphere and small dust particles.   via GIPHY   • Mars has the tallest known mountain on a planet of our Solar System - Olympus Mons, with a height of 22 km (13.7 miles) or 72,000 feet, more than double Mt. Everest.     • Mars is populated entirely by robots, two of them are still operational - the Opportunity and the Curiosity rovers.   • The movie Gravity was more expensive than India's Mars mission. At the cost of $100 million, the movie Gravity is $26 million more expensive than the cost of India's space agency putting the satellite into Mars' orbit.   • India is also the first country to reach the Red Planet on its first attempt successfully.   • Mars is red because the surface material contains lots of iron oxide, the same compound that gives blood and rust their hue.   • On its one-year anniversary, the NASA's Curiosity Rover sang the "Happy Birthday" tune to itself on Mars.     • The average temperature on Mars is -63°C.   • In 1997, three men from Yemen tried to sue NASA for invading Mars, claiming they had inherited it from their ancestors 3,000 years ago.   • If you have a weight problem, it might come as a consolation that you weight 60% less on Mars than on Earth.   • Mars is about half the size of the Earth.     • Jupiter has 67 moons, Saturn has 62, Uranus 27, Neptune 14, Mars 2 and Earth just one.   • Mars had an oxygen-rich atmosphere around 4 billion years ago.   • Mars has a flag. It was designed by a NASA engineer. The flag of Mars is a tricolor (red, green and blue) used to represent the planet Mars, its exploration, and its eventual transformation into a more Earth-like world.     • There are five planets you can see with the naked eye, not using a telescope: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.   • According to NASA, it would cost about $18,000 to send a letter to Mars.   • Mars' craters larger than 60 km are named for deceased scientists, writers and others who have contributed to the study of Mars.   • Mars has the largest dust storms in the Solar System. They can last for months and can cover the entire planet.   • In 1840, Johann Heinrich Mädler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of Mars.   • Mars is the second smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury.   • In 1610, Mars was viewed by Galileo Galilei, who was first to see it via telescope.   • NASA research suggests Mars once had more water than Earth's Arctic Ocean.

In this context, Dr. Rab Scott, Head of Virtual Reality and Modelling Group, Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) with Boeing will deliver a case study presentation at the GCC Manufacturing Excellence and Technology Summit 2016 that will be held on 14-15 November 2016 at Sofitel Dubai The Palm Resort & Spa. His presentation will focus on exploring the potential of virtual reality and augmented reality in manufacturing. Before his session at the summit, Dr. Rab Scott discusses the importance of integrating virtual reality and augmented reality in manufacturing processes. 1.    Could you please elaborate a bit on your work within AMRC with Boeing? The AMRC with Boeing is a research centre which is part of the University of Sheffield and which has nearly 100 industrial partners ranging from Boeing and Rolls-Royce to local SMEs. It was established in 2001 with 8 people - I was one of those 8! Currently I am Head of Virtual Reality and Simulation and also Digital Theme Lead. As such, I work with companies on projects using Virtual and Augments Reality and incorporating the "digital thread". By this I mean the integration of cyber-physical systems into what is known as a "digital twin"002E. 2.    According to you, what would be the key advantage of incorporating virtual reality in manufacturing processes? Advertisement The advantage of using virtual reality in manufacturing is the ability to firstly "try before you buy" - the ability to test scenarios, designs and factory or facility layouts before implementing them physically means that you can "fail faster" but fail virtually - therefore reducing risk, cost and time. 3.    Modeling, Simulation, and Visualization are critical technologies. Please share briefly about a project where visualization tools/ technologies has provided increased value An example of where the use of advanced visualization has increased value has been in the area of new facility design and layout. One company with whom we have worked, wanted to build a new facility for manufacturing. By using a combination of simulation linked to virtual reality, the company was able to engage multiple stakeholder groups in the same audience. By doing this, it created discussion which identified a number of design issues that were resolved in the virtual world before the construction had started. Another example is where a company had designed a product but wanted to evaluate the design for manufacturability. They were able to get immersed in the digital mockup of the product, identify areas which would have been very challenging to manufacture and change the assembly process to aid access. 4.    What will you be presenting at the GCC Manufacturing Excellence & Technology Summit 2016 I will be presenting an overview of the history and culture behind one of the UK's leading manufacturing research centres and a few case studies on how VR and AR have provided value for our partners. 5.    What will be the key takeaway for attendees from your presentation? The key takeaway will be that the digital world can provide value throughout a product's lifecycle and that failure *is* an option, as long as it is done virtually! Hear Dr. Rab Scott speak at length at the GCC Manufacturing Excellence and Technology Summit 2016. The summit is scheduled to take place on 14-15 November 2016 at Sofitel Dubai The Palm Resort & Spa.

This company said the agreement represents a sector-based, global market mechanism to address climate change and is complementary to the CO2 standard for airplane emissions that ICAO adopted earlier this year. These two agreements result from several years of collaboration by international experts from ICAO member states, the aviation industry and non-governmental organizations. The market-based carbon-offset system and CO2 standard aim to stop the growth of emissions by 2020 and cut them in half by 2050 relative to 2005 levels. These efforts also include: investing in new, more efficient aircraft; improving operational performance of the in-service fleet; improving the efficiency of air traffic management and other infrastructure; and scaling up the use of sustainable alternative fuels. Boeing is a large aerospace company and manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems. The company supports airlines and US and allied government customers in 150 countries.

Scientists are working on an artificial Martian garden to determine which crops would grow best on the Red Planet.   ( Dimitri Gerondidakis | NASA ) Advertisement Researchers from NASA's Kennedy Space Center and the Florida Tech Buzz Aldrin Space Institute are working on an artificial Martian garden that emulates the soil characteristics and climate conditions in Mars. The objective of the project is to determine the best vegetables that can be grown on the Red Planet. NASA has been aiming to send humans to Mars in the near future. Private companies Boeing and SpaceX also expressed their interest to transport humans to the red planet, but among the major concerns of building a human colony in the extraterrestrial world would be feeding the people. The ability to grow vegetables and other crops in the Martian surface would help solve this issue. On Earth, plants are typically grown on soil, which contains organics. Mars, however, does not really have the soil as we know it. It is covered with regolith, crushed volcanic rock that contains nothing organic. It also contains some toxic chemicals and all these conditions require studies that would investigate the plausibility of farming on Mars. Researchers used 100 pounds of Martian soil simulant from Hawaii that were chosen based on data from Mars orbiters. Using this simulant, researchers will conduct experiments to determine which nutrients and how much of these have to be added to the simulant to optimize the growth of various crops. In a pilot study, researchers grew lettuce plants on simulant-only tubes, simulant with added nutrients and potting soil. They will also attempt to grow other plants such as Swiss chard, kale, Chinese cabbage, snow peas, dwarf peppers and tomatoes. All these plants are considered nutritious and have been included in the menu items for astronauts. Researchers plan to release the final report of the test results on March 2017. "[R]esearch studying the performance of crop species grown in a simulated 'Martian garden' - a proving ground for a potential future farm on the Red Planet," wrote Anna Heiney of NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Scientists have been conducting studies to investigate the feasibility of food gardening on Mars. In an experiment being conducted in the Atacama Desert in Peru, scientists are testing 100 potato varieties, which include 60 varieties that were genetically modified to survive with little water and salt, to see if potatoes can be grown on Mars. In another experiment, researchers were able to harvest 10 crops, which include pea, tomato, radish, chives, leek, quinoa, spinach, cress, rye and garden rocket from plants planted on moon and Mars soil simulants.

The planes could come from Airbus or Boeing Co., Juneyao Chairman Wang Junjin said Monday. The Chinese carrier hasn’t placed any orders, Wang said at a briefing in Shanghai on its plans to join a partnership under the Star Alliance network. Asian airlines have placed aircraft orders worth tens of billions of dollars as the region is expected to become the world’s leading travel market, driven by economic growth, according to a Boeing prediction. Shanghai-based Juneyao reached a deal Monday to take part in the Star Alliance’s Connecting Partner Model, an arrangement that expands the alliance’s reach through low-cost airlines while increasing the Chinese carrier’s access to destinations outside its home market. Juneyao is interested in models such as Boeing’s 787 and the A350 from Airbus and will make a decision as early as this year, Wang said. The carrier won’t consider Airbus’s double-decker A380, given its cost and lower fuel efficiency, he said. Juneyao, which started out as a budget carrier in 2006, has expanded its services beyond low fares to include free baggage allowances. The airline will begin as a Connecting Partner in the second quarter of 2017, Wang said. Route Connectivity The Star Alliance, whose biggest members include United Continental Holdings Inc., Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Singapore Airlines Ltd., announced the Connecting Partner Model in December and named South African budget carrier Mango as its first participant. Carriers joining the partnership won’t become a member of the Star Alliance itself. The tie-up allows those traveling on a flight of a Star Alliance member to connect to a route on a partner airline and enjoy the same alliance benefits. Asian budget airlines are grouping in the face of increased competition after numerous low-cost carriers were established in the past five years as rising incomes and discounted fares lured first-time travelers in the region. Singapore Airlines’ Tigerair and Scoot are part of the Value Alliance announced in May, after four Chinese airlines affiliated with HNA Group formed the U-FLY Alliance in January and subsequently added South Korean budget airline Eastar Jet. The Asian budget-carrier alliances have so far excluded the region’s biggest low-cost airlines including Malaysia’s AirAsia Bhd., India’s IndiGo and China’s Spring Airlines Co. — With assistance by Feng Cai Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Miller Published: Oct 10, 2016 1:47 a.m. ET Share By JohnW. Miller When Alcoa Inc. presents its last quarterly earnings report as a single company on Tuesday, investors will still be wondering how the iconic aluminum maker's bet to split in two will pay off. Klaus Kleinfeld, who has led the company since 2008, is separating the company's beleaguered raw aluminum operation on Nov. 1 in a bid to increase the combined value of the spinoff, which will keep the Alcoa name, and the parent firm, which will become Arconic. The latter will house the company's fast-growing businesses supplying the aerospace and automotive markets. Alcoa's raw aluminum enterprise, which it pioneered in 19th century Pittsburgh, has been rocked this decade by an aluminum glut generated largely by China. That oversupply has caused prices on the London Metal Exchange to fall to around $1,600 a ton, down from around $2,500 a ton five years ago. In 2015, the company reported a net loss of $121 million, compared with a net profit of $268 million in 2014. After a reverse stock split, Alcoa's stock price is now just above $30 per share, less than a third of its adjusted value at the start of 2008, the year Mr. Kleinfeld took over as chief executive. In a news release touting the split, Mr. Kleinfeld, who will be CEO of Arconic, said he and his colleagues were "launching two leading-edge companies, each with distinct and compelling opportunities, and each ready to seize the future." Analysts say they'll be studying the third quarter release for more detail about how the companies will be carved up. The company is putting out its release on a Tuesday morning, instead of the customary Monday afternoon, because of Columbus Day. The split should force the mining and smelting divisions to run more efficient operations because they will no longer be allowed to hide behind profits in other units, say analysts. However, the spinoff also creates extra work that will eat away at time and money. "For example, you might need more people to manage procurement across two companies," says Andrew Lane, an analyst with Morningstar, Inc. So far, says Mr. Lane, "we see the split as value neutral." The case made for Arconic is based on the massive boom in global aerospace, driven by the rapid growth of low-cost airlines and the emergence of more efficient aircraft. Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. together have a $1.6 trillion backlog of more than 12,500 jet orders, with many models sold out for several years. These planes will require a steady stream of fasteners, screws and other parts, made out of high-tech alloys that do things like repel lightning. The engineering to make these high-tech widgets will be the cornerstone of Arconic's game. Already, Alcoa has invested billions in research and in buying companies like U.K. jet-engine parts maker Firth Rixson Ltd. and Pittsburgh-based RTI International Metals Inc. Those investments are paying off. In the second quarter, sales in Alcoa's engineered products and solutions business increased to $1.5 billion from $1.3 billion in the same quarter a year ago. By comparison, sales in the smelting division fell to $1.6 billion from $2.1 billion. In total, the aerospace-related businesses have signed around $15 billion worth of supply deals with companies including Boeing, Airbus, and Lockheed Martin Corp. Arconic will also take over a lucrative business selling sheet aluminum to Ford Motor Co. for its F-150 pickup truck. However, other auto makers have yet to make similar high-profile announcements of converting their vehicles full-bore to the lighter aluminum. Meanwhile, to cope with weak prices, Alcoa has been closing high-cost smelters in the U.S. The new Alcoa will be a global company reliant on smelting aluminum in places where energy is cheap, like Canada, Iceland and Saudi Arabia. Global markets, however, still face years of headwinds, mainly because of China's supply glut. At a trade hearing in Washington last month, a senior Chinese aluminum official said China would "certainly build more" aluminum factories to keep pace with its own demand. Chinese aluminum exports, which Mr. Kleinfeld has called a "major driver" of lower prices, last year increased 5.3% to $23.8 billion. Write to John W.

    Home About Antiwar.com Donate Blog US Casualties Contact Latest News The Saudis, Hillary, and the Destruction of Yemen US support enables mass murder by Justin Raimondo, October 10, 2016 Print This | Share This The Saudi bombing of a funeral in Saana, Yemen, killed about 200 – we don’t yet know the exact number – and wounded over 500. No one believes the denials of the Saudis: clearly this event was targeted for special treatment. They didn’t just bomb it once: they came back again to rain death and destruction on the mourners. And these weren’t just any mourners: it was the funeral of the father of the Houthi Interior Minister, Jalal al-Rowaishan, with many government officials present. The dead included the Mayor of Sanaa: we don’t yet know if the Interior Minister survived. No one wants to talk about this war. Up until now, the US has kept an embarrassed silence, for the most part: in response to this latest atrocity, the National Security Council issued a terse statement with all the requisite buzzwords – “deeply concerned,” “troubling,” “not a blank check,” even while reiterating the indefensible US rationale for funding, assisting, and enabling what is quite simply mass murder of civilians: “Even as we assist Saudi Arabia regarding the defense of their territorial integrity …” The very idea that Yemen – what is arguably the poorest country on the face of the earth – is a threat to the Kingdom’s “territorial integrity” is a grotesque joke. I’ve covered the historical roots of the ongoing rebellion in Yemen – see here, here and here – but in brief: the Saudi invasion of Yemen is quite simply a proxy war on behalf of the US that has devolved into Saudi expansionism. Indeed, one could make the case that it is much more so than the Russian re-annexation of Crimea – which, after all, has been a Russian domain since the days of Catherine the Great. Yemen has never been a part of the Saudi kingdom: it is an ancient land, whose roots as an independent entity precede the birth of Christ. While the Syrian civil war has been the subject of much debate, the war in Yemen has received almost no attention. Donald Trump has mentioned it only in passing, and Hillary Clinton hasn’t said a single word about it – with good reason. The reason is because, during her reign at the State Department, she and her staff collaborated with the Saudis to create a military machine that is now mowing down Yemeni civilians by the thousands. It was Christmas eve, 2011, and the employees at Hillary’s Foggy Bottom were celebrating. Were they celebrating the Christian holiday? Hell no! They were overjoyed by the “good news” – as Jake Sullivan, Hillary’s deputy chief of staff put it in the heading of an email – that the Saudis’ Prince Salman (now the Saudi king, then the chief negotiator for the Saudi side) had signed on to a $29.4 billion arms deal with Boeing. Included in the sale: more than 80 F-15 fighter jets, which are now slaughtering ambulance drivers, children, and any others in war-torn Yemen who happen to be within range. “Not a bad Christmas present” remarked one top official in an email chain made public by a Freedom of Information Act request. Hillary was on the receiving end of all of this. The gift-giving was hardly one-sided, however. The Saudis had already given an estimated minimum of $10 million to the Clinton Foundation. And, as David Sirota and Andrew Perez pointed out in the International Business Times, “Just two months before the deal was finalized, Boeing – the defense contractor that manufactures one of the fighter jets the Saudis were especially keen to acquire, the F-15 –  contributed $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to a company press release.” As the Saudis prepared their campaign of aggression, the Clinton State Department made arming the regime a “top priority.” And as Hillary prepared her presidential run, a Boeing lobbyist, Tim Keating – a former aide to husband Bill – hosted a “Ready for Hillary” fundraising gala. Wheels within wheels within wheels, all turning and churning to produce death and destruction for those on the bottom, and enormous wealth and power for those on the top. As the great songwriter and singer Buffy Saint-Marie put it in some of her most haunting lyrics: “Merry Christmas Jingle Bells Christ is born and the devil’s in hell hearts they shrink Pockets swell Everybody know and nobody tell Little Wheels spin and spin Big wheels turn around and around.” The big wheels – the Clintons and their friends – send the little wheels spinning into oblivion, and the people of Yemen are just one part of the larger story. The Clinton State Department’s obscene “Christmas present” is just one chapter in the continuing saga of how our corrupt elites lord it over not only us but the whole world, grinding all underfoot while they celebrate their wealth and vaunted wisdom. The game is not only rigged, as Trump points out – it’s murderous. NOTES IN THE MARGIN You can check out my Twitter feed by going here.

But WTF…. WHY NOT THE SAUDIS.. Seems they like how we bombed multiple weddings I guess to add to he genocidal flavor of their action and intent… Unlike the mayhem in Phillipeans where its the locals doing the killing with ???… In Yemen its the Ssudis killing nen, women.and children with OUR BOMBS…. IN OUR PLANES… The best part ??????? We are also “giving them targeting information”. So I guess that this is a great opportunity for Hillary and Obama to bomb more weddings with the co-ordinates WE supply to the Saudis… Hard to make this stuff up…. Maybe yhere is something in Washington water that is.far more toxic than the lead in Flint water… Look how the “0” .went from an ostensibly peace candidate to a genocidal madman… Put him up with the other black genocidal maniaks CondoLIsa Rice and Colon Bowell… Why would anyone believe a single utterance they belched out…. Ricardo Cabeza Hillary never lost one minute of sleepin’ Worryin’ ’bout the way things might have been Big wheel keep on turnin’ Proud Military keep on bombin’ Rollin’, rollin’, rollin’ on to Armageddon Mikhailovich Syrian war is a proxy war against Russia and therefore it is, of course, much more important. After five years of “Assad must go”, America just can’t go away with the tail between the legs; it would not be helpful for the prestige of the only superpower. Kremlin knows it and prepare for the fight. And Yemen is just a sad story for the time being. musings2 Given the lucrative nature of the deals with entities like the Saudis, I find it hard to believe the other candidate would pass them up , should he ever take office. It would have seemed a slam dunk had Trump zeroed in on the corruption of the Clinton Foundation rather than sought to deflect questions about his own admission of sexual assault by reminding us of Bill Clinton’s history. Tit for tat is ultimately so petty. I cannot vote for him at this point, and one of the reasons is that he lacks both self-control and the ability to home in on the present problems that really do need correction. He wastes his energy on matters which his base endlessly blogs about, while overlooking real problems about which even Democrats would sit up and be at pains to defend, if they even knew these things were out there. Old and tired and cliched was the theme of the second debate. It served the candidates but hardly those they are pretending to want to serve. survivor I agree. This man Donald is very ignorant and not too bright. What a choice we have. andrewp111 Saudi airstrikes kill a lot of people, but the facts on the ground have not changed. Stalemate is wasting time the Saudis do not have. The Saudis need to step it up and win the war, before the Iranians get serious enough to bring in Russian firepower on their side, as the Russians did in Syria. richardvajs I wish that Justin would go more into just why the Saudis are bombing Yemen – do they feel threatened? We never hear of any Yemeni attack upon Saudi Arabia. They must have a reason — even if it is as lame as, “we have to fight them because they hate our freedoms”. And I would guess that we keep the UN from asking any embarrassing questions too. Lastly, has our country become so craven as to allow civilian slaughter for another buck in the Clinton’s pocketbook? No wonder that all the talk is on pee-pees – it is the Clintonian level of discourse that they are comfortable with. bob balkas Are we a subrace of the shemitic race or is it the other way around? Whatever, the shemitic race in arabia is quite darker than the white race. This is, i suggest, one factor in white race’s disinterest in what happens to the very dark and even less dark shemites; such as palestinians in todays palestein, syrians, lebanese….. Fear not, no war against russia or russians in syria. And of course not, because chicken hawks do not want to wage war against russia or russians, but because they are chicken hawks. They are nothing like the real hawks; such as mccain, kerry, clintonova, geronimo…. But a war between russia and america might thin down white pop from one billion, to say, just 50mn; so, lets go and wage it finally! Thomas L. Knapp Since there’s no such thing as “the white race,” pretty much any statement you can make about this or that race being lighter, darker, heavier, lighter, etc. is incontestable. bob balkas Ok, let’s avoid saying that say, italians, danes are of white race. Let’s just call them italians and danes; which i think care a lot more about belgians than yemenis. Thomas L. Knapp “Italian” and “Dane” are descriptions of political nationality. There are a number of races. “White” isn’t one of them. Neither is “black.” That particular terminology was drummed up in the 17th century, covering a number of European racial groups (e.g. Slavic and Nordic), to justify chattel enslavement of members of “black” African racial groups (e.g. Bantu and Khoisan). comrade hermit Geronimo was a freedom fighter. I hardly feel he deserves to be lumped in with the likes of Kerry and Clintonova. Just saying. bob balkas True, geronimo defended his people. He was a different kind of warrior than kerry, but he was a fighter/soldier just like kerry, mccain,,, But i can see now that i should not have put geronimo in the category of american fighters. longlance USA is the Evil Empire. How long can the world endure its rapacity & aggression? Pingback: The Saudis, Hillary, and the Destruction of Yemen() Pingback: Saúdové, Hillary a zničení Jemenu – Messin() survivor Unfortunately, Trump is too stupid to bring these points up against Clinton where last night he had the golden opportunity to do so and just went off tangent as always because again Trump isn’t so bright. TellTheTruth-2 Exactly .. I was screaming at the TV .. just tell them the US is in Syria illegally and we’re committing war crimes there. Thane_Eichenauer I don’t think that 95% of Americans would find that US war involvement in Syria would be illegal. I also imagine that 99.99% of US judges would find some way to OK that activity. TellTheTruth-2 Sad; but, true … the average American is so dumbed down by the MSM they don’t have a chance. Most people no longer realize a FREE PRESS is supposed to protect us from corrupt Government, not to assist the corruption like they do today. RMS145 Trump isn’t ment to win, he is just a straw opposition candidate to make it easier to install H. Clinton. Nothing will stop her from being president, it’s a done deal – the Media wants her, Wall Street wants her, and the Defence Industry want her. richardvajs RMS145, You’ve named only half of the Clinton team ….there are the Zionists, the WAL-MARTS, Big Pharma, etc. It is just like in high school when some nerd ran against a cheerleader for Class President and all of the “popular” kids attacked him. She will win – but, OH what a disaster she will be. RMS145 That she will be a danger to the world, goes without saying, but at the moment I do not see a indication that the other candidates will be able to beat her. Thane_Eichenauer Can Raimondo’s points be effectively argued on TV? I rather think that would be difficult. ThorsteinVeblen2012 I would like to ask Hillary Clinton what lesson was learned from Vietnam. It would be her Aleppo moment. comrade hermit Their is one thin silver lining to this cloud of death over the Arabian Peninsula. The Saudis cant win. The mountains of Northern Yemen might as well be the jungles of Vietnam. Just like the US in that Indochinese bloodbath, the Saudis cant take on their own Vietcong, the Houthis, nose to nose so they’re putting their focus on slaughtering civilians instead. This tactic is heart-wrenchingly grotesque but it failed for a reason. You can’t kill an entire nation and you cant win hearts and minds by blowing them to bits. The Saudis have no place to go but down and we’re following them into that rabbit hole. TellTheTruth-2 Hillary and her ilk belong in prison for live .. murdering bastards. Anna I am not a Saudi apologist by any stretch. However, Justin avoids some very pertinent details. The Houthis, who are backed by Iran, started this. They pulled a coup d’état against the elected leader of Yemen back in February 2015, and proceeded to take over key cities (Aden), with the goal of controlling the entire northern tier of the country, right at Saudi’s door. There have been ongoing UN negotiations, from which the Houthis have walked away each and every time. They want a separate state. Saudi’s fear is two fold: the reach of Iran (which Sec of St John Kerry acknowledged in this war) and the fact that AQAP (Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) is very much alive and kicking there. Saudi is many things we don’t like, but they are under attack or proxy-attack from all sides. (ISIS has targeted them as well). Again–just some additional perspective comrade hermit Wrong, wrong,wrong. Lets see if I can make this as simple as possible to understand. 1. The Houthis are not backed by Iran. There isn’t a single solitary shred of proof to support this theory. 2. There was no coup d’etat. It was a popular rebellion lead by the Houthis against an American and Saudi backed dictator who was “elected” in a sick joke with only one candidate to choose from. 3. The Houthis already have control of the northern tier of Yemen and have for decades. This region has never been governable by any of the Saudi/US proxies. 4. The Houthis want a democratic republic and the Saudis have refused any peace deals where the Houthis retain any position of power. 5. Mr. Kerry is a notorious liar and war criminal who blames Iran and Russia for everything including his bad breath and basset hound eyes. 6. If the Saudis were really so concerned with AQAP and ISIS then they wouldn’t be arming them. Perspective is swell but only when it’s supported by facts not MSM/Pentagon propaganda. Anna I am afraid you are “wrong wrong wrong” 1. There are more than “shreds” of evidence that the Houthis are backed by Iran. John Kerry has said so publicly, and the State Department has also confirmed the same in its reports. Kerry might be a “notorious liar” as it is convenient for you to assert in order to established your (inaccurate) point, but that cannot hold as an argument. In addition, Jane’s (UK) has confirmed the Iranian backing of the Houthis as has…Iran itself. 2. There was a coup, plain and simple, and there was a house arrest. 3. The Houthis have not had control of the northern tier “for decades”. They have been dispersed. They did try to infiltrate Saudi in 2009, from where they had established bases in the north. 4. The Houthis do not want a “democratic republic” they want power. 5. The Saudis are not arming AQAP and they are not arming ISIS. Tossing out accusations like this is meaningless unless you have verifiable proof. No way would a country that is getting so pounded by ISIS and, in past years, AQ, bring that upon themselves. comrade hermit “Tossing out accusations like this is meaningless unless you have verifiable proof.” Good point. You first. Appleseed “They pulled a coup d’état against the elected leader of Yemen back in February 2015” That’s exactly what happened in Ukraine…and the neocons/US government didn’t have a problem with that. In fact, they raced to embrace the illegal coup there. geo1671 pure gibberish perspectives! Rhs Per The Saudi government & army are clearing committing evil. They have learnt well from their masters. The masters must be pleased. SEAN THOMAS OMG! This is priceless. https://audioboom.com/boos/5141596-redeemer-nation-bows-to-russia-china-michael-vlahos-johns-hopkins-jhuworldcrisis?t=0 One of the imperial city’s professional bloviators is apoplectic that the American people aren’t willing to kill and die in large enough numbers to keep him gainfully employed tossing around adjectives in between his martinis.

We are usually slow to take to the barricades, far too measured for all the fuss. That was until June this year, when we voted to leave the European Union; to go it alone and set off without a clear plan. But what next? People have had their say through the referendum; quite rightly, they now expect their voice to be heard as we shape the nation’s economic future. The vote to leave highlighted a disengagement, disenchantment and disconnection that had been ignored for too long. As we look to the future, reconnection will be critical: giving people a greater level of ownership over the places where they live and work. To do this, we have to act locally – from Yorkshire to Westminster. Cities will be the drivers of future prosperity, but they cannot thrive as merely functional centres. They must be vibrant communities, ones where people’s needs and ambitions come to the fore. If we want to build the “strong and vibrant economy” Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke about, we need to work at a city level and to start with the places that are getting it right. Take Sheffield. Whereas Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds voted Remain, Sheffield voted Out in almost exactly the same proportions as the whole nation, so can be seen as a bellwether of the wider national mood. It might not be widely known, but Sheffield has led the world to growth before and is doing so again. The site of the ‘Battle of Orgreave’ is now home to the Advanced Manufacturing Park, where Boeing and Rolls-Royce are developing pioneering technologies with global impact. If you’re looking for solid symbols of the potential for Britain to be resurgent – this one’s hard to beat. The coming together of universities, industry, local authorities and entrepreneurs is now seeing a steady and intelligent development of all kinds of physical and cultural assets that Sheffield owns. Look at Lady Canning’s plantation, the first ever crowd funded mountain bike trail in England where local people led and local authorities followed. Look then at the Grade II Head Post office where an empty piece of Victorian architecture has been restored to life, not just to house Hallam University’s Institute of Fine Arts, but also with fine public spaces and with porters drawn from the ranks of retired postal workers to maintain a real sense of continuity. Look at Sheffield’s micro breweries, which emerged a decade and more before the craft beer revival across the rest of the country and have become – as Professor Vanessa Toulmin at the University of Sheffield, says – the “cultural glue that holds the city together”. In one collaboration after another, the city is getting lots of things right. And critically, it all fits with Sheffield’s spirit of craft and making, the virtues of its location and the physical assets of its history – that makes the city more distinctive. So what does this amount to? Neil Burchenall, who co-founded Sheffield Digital, points to his recent personal experience of a Damascene moment – a buzz in the city centre on a Thursday night that hadn’t been there in the two decades before. A buzz? Is that all we get for all that effort, energy and money? But ‘a buzz’ is no trivial return, if you know that vibrancy is your goal. Another key aspect of a successful city and vibrant economy is inclusion; closing the gap between the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’. Bringing together the incredible diversity of economic, social and artistic talent that exists is central to the goal of making Sheffield a truly vibrant place. And if a city is an ecosystem, then the gravity within that system is trust. Trust enables everything. It drives collaboration and it speeds progress. Right now, Sheffield is looking at where to site the HS2 station, to redevelop a key city quarter, build a new tramlink, win the right to host the Great Exhibition of the North and maybe become one of three cities in the world, where Elon Musk builds his revolutionary Hyperloop transportation system. It cannot do any of those things quickly or effectively unless people trust each other. Trust is the key to growth. Trust requires consensus, not domination or the silencing of alternative views. Sheffield understands this better than most cities. So here we are at a moment where there are a variety of routes forward. We need to find a British way that is practical, true to itself, a bit modest but genuinely innovative – a bit like Sheffield. Sheffield was once globally admired as a hub for innovation – and it could be again, with the right collective endeavour. As part of Grant Thornton’s Vibrant Economy agenda, we recently brought together over 200 of the city’s public and private sector leaders to discuss how Sheffield can forge a future as a capital for innovation. The engagement that has followed from that event showed that there is a desire from people to be involved in shaping their city’s future. We will be repeating the exercise in cities across the country. There is a debate beginning, not just about how we manage the realities of Brexit, but how we maximise the potential of our cities and communities. History will record that it was the latter that really mattered. Norman Pickavance is Partner at Grant Thornton, championing the Vibrant Economy agenda and former policy adviser.

Blue/Bloomberg Norwegian Air Aims to Extend Long-Haul Model to Buenos Aires Pablo Rosendo Gonzalez Pablo_Rosendo Richard Weiss @rweiss5 October 9, 2016 — 5:00 PM EDT Updated on October 10, 2016 — 6:38 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp CEO Kjos also weighing Cordoba as a domestic Argentinian hub Chilean flights also under evaluation; Brazil less likely Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA is evaluating plans for a base in Buenos Aires with flights from cities including Oslo, London, Paris, Madrid and Barcelona as the next phase of its long-haul, low-cost expansion strategy. Services to the Argentinian capital could start in 12 months if government permissions are granted, Bjorn Kjos, the airline’s chief executive officer, said in an interview in Cordoba, adding that the Latin American country’s second-biggest city also has the potential to become a domestic hub. Norwegian Air has ambitious plans for extending the low-cost travel model to inter-continental flights using a fleet of Boeing Co. 787s that will swell to 42 by 2020. It’s also adding 30 extended-range Airbus Group SE A321neo aircraft that could be used on shorter long-haul routes by 2022, and has even said that smaller 737 Max jets, of which it has 100 on order, might operate some trans-Atlantic services. South American flights would begin with two 787s and create at least 200 jobs, Kjos said. That would be welcome in Argentina, where a recession deepened in the second quarter as President Mauricio Macri’s efforts to implement free-market reform acted as a brake on an already flagging economy and foreign direct investment has been scarce in recent years. Argentina is “a hidden jewel,” Kjos said, with “the largest potential I have ever seen” for increasing visits. “But to attract tourists you need to have cheaper flights.” Fares could fall to one-quarter of what airlines now charge, selling from about $300 for a round-trip to Europe, he reckoned. For domestic services a Cordoba-Buenos Aires return would need to be priced at about $50. Kjos said he’s also speaking with authorities in Chilean capital Santiago about possible routes there, though is less keen on entering the Brazilian market. Low-cost operations on short-haul routes, in which Norwegian specializes, require intensive timetables to make money and the CEO said planes would need to be in the air 18 or 19 hours a day for the long-haul model to work. That might mean the introduction of connecting or multi-leg fights such as India and South Africa to the Americas via Europe. Qatar, HNA Moves South America is attracting outside operators as an economic downturn, weaker local currencies and increased dollar-linked costs squeeze local players. Qatar Airways said in July it would pay $613 million for up to 10 percent of Latam Airlines Group SA, the region’s biggest carrier, while China’s HNA Group Co. last year acquired a 24 percent stake in Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras SA for $450 million. Colombia’s Avianca Holdings SA and Avianca Brasil are seeking separate partners while planning to merge in the longer term. Norwegian Air is still awaiting permission from the U.S. Department of Transportation to use its Irish subsidiary for trans-Atlantic U.S. flights and has also applied for such rights for its U.K. unit. Connecting cities on Europe’s Atlantic coast, including Edinburgh, with smaller airports in the eastern U.S., such as New York’s White Plains airfield or Stewart airport, will mean customers paying less than $150 for a round trip starting next year, Kjos said. The Fornebu, Norway-based carrier also plans to establish a base of American pilots in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, initially hiring as many as 100 cockpit crew if it can expand U.S. operations as planned.

At more than US$5 billion (Bt174 billion), Kuka represents the largest Chinese takeover of a German company and highlights the direction China is taking.  Kuka developed one of the world’s first industrial robots and continues to be a global leader in the industry, with shares of 35 per cent in the North American robotics and automation market, 46 per cent in Europe and 19 per cent in Asia.  Kuka robots are used by leading global manufacturers in high-end industries such  as Audi and BMW cars,  Boeing aircraft and  Northrop Grumman  military equipment.  Kuka is also the inventor of the Iiwa, or intelligent industrial work assistant, which can pour a beer or brew a cup of coffee, among other tasks. Midea, Kuka’s new parent, is one of China’s largest home-appliance makers with a sizeable global presence, as it exports around one-third of its production.  Like many other Chinese companies, Midea faces rising labour costs and needs to manage this through increasing automation.  Already Midea employs around 100 Kuka robots in its factories. As well as automating its plants, the acquisition of Kuka will help Midea improve its facilities and produce its own robots, automation equipment and smart-home devices. This strategy fits well with China’s goal of becoming a more advanced industrial society using innovation and smart technology.  China is the largest and fastest-growing market for industrial robotics, accounting for around 30 per cent of the global market for industrial robots.  And by 2020, it plans to reach 150 robot units per 10,000 workers.  Midea is not the only Chinese company investing in innovative German companies.  In the first half of this year, Chinese investors acquired 37 German companies worth $10.8 billion.  Indeed, nearly 40 per cent of all inbound investment in Germany in that period came from China.  Other top investments were in EEW Energy from Waste; Hanwha Q Cells, a technology company; KrausMaffei, a machinery group; and Putzmeister Holding, a construction company. At the recent G20 meeting in Hangzhou, German leader Angela Merkel stood next to Chinese President Xi Jinping in the official photo.  Although this was due to protocol, it nicely seemed to symbolise the importance of this close relationship.  Germany will host the next summit in Hamburg in 2017. We look forward to seeing how things will have developed by then. Tags China Germany made in China Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Trump must not be allowed to trample on climate deal...

The national airline of the UAE has entered a three year deal with ADSC to support sports activities and major sporting events in Abu Dhabi. The strategic initiative replaces an event- by-event approach and contributes to a longer term vision for sports in line with Abu Dhabi Vision 2030.  Hareb Almuhairy, Senior Vice President, Corporate and International Affairs, Etihad Airways, said: “This agreement cements our work together to promote Abu Dhabi as an outstanding destination for major international sporting events. These events bring considerable economic benefits, provide excellent opportunities for resident and visiting sports fans and encourage a healthy and active lifestyle.” At least 15 events will be covered under the new partnership, including headliners such as January’s annual Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and this month’s professional cycling race, the Abu Dhabi Tour. It is expected that eventually, dozens of events will be jointly supported as new sports initiatives are attracted to the emirate. Advertisement “This deal represents a more structured and long-term approach to delivering on our vision of evolving Abu Dhabi into an international destination for sport, competitiveness and international events. Etihad Airways will bring to the table considerable marketing clout which will further build local, regional and global awareness of our headline events,” explained His Excellency Aref Al Awani, General Secretary, ADSC. The new partnership will see Etihad Airways leverage all of its marketing channels to promote major sporting events in the emirate. The agreement also opens the way for special athlete appearances, guest experiences and community engagement activities.  Etihad Cargo will provide support for sports equipment, contributing to what is effectively a bridge to bring the world’s best athletes and action to Abu Dhabi.    An Oxford Business Group study, entitled The Report Abu Dhabi 2016, notes that while Abu Dhabi was largely unknown in the international sporting world just 10 years ago, it has since sprinted onto the global stage by hosting high profile sporting events, such as the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Other events have included the ITU World Triathlon Series, the Volvo Ocean Race and the Fatima Bint Mubarak Ladies Open (Ladies European Tour).     “The positive impact of major sports events on tourism is well documented, with benefits such as airline passenger traffic, hotel stays and visitor spend,” added Mr Almuhairy. “At the same time, we are always looking for ways to connect and inspire our guests. Sport provides a wonderful platform to do this.” Among the other events covered under the new partnership are the FINA 10k Open Water World Championship, the FINA High-Dive World Cup, Emirates Football Forum and the FIBA Basketball 3 x 3 World Championship. -Ends-  About Etihad Aviation Group Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) is a diversified global aviation and travel group comprising four business divisions – Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, Etihad Engineering, Hala Group and Airline Equity Partners.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 9, 2016 at 10:13AM Much about the Navy's new carrier-based stealth drone project still remains shrouded in darkness. Image source: Getty Images. At long last, it's official. The U.S. Navy is building a new war drone for its aircraft carriers -- and in fact, it may be building two of them. Either this, or that Officially named the "MQ-25A Stingray" when announced back in July, the new drone is expected to be a stealthy "flying wing," capable of penetrating enemy air defenses to launch devastating attacks with cruise missiles. Either that...or it will be a bumbling, oblong-shaped fuel tanker, capable of flying in flow circles over its mother ship, and pumping gas into real fighter jets. That's where the debate was left last July, with the Navy unable to decide precisely what it wants from a carrier-launched drone. At the time, I opined that Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) were likely to offer prototypes specializing in stealth. Lockheed Martin is well known as the maker of F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets. Northrop Grumman built the Navy's first carrier-capable jet drone, the batwinged X-47B. Both companies were likely to play to their strengths, and advocate for the Navy choosing a stealthy design that -- even if initially assigned only tanker roles -- could "evolve" over time into a true carrier-capable combat jet. At the same time, rival drone operators Boeing (NYSE:BA), which builds the Navy's popular ScanEagle, and General Atomics, most famous for its Air Force Predators, would probably bid to build an MQ-25A that looked more like a "traditional" aircraft, eschewing stealth in favor of cheapness and fuel-tank capacity. That's where we left the debate four months ago. And that's precisely where we remain stuck today. When in doubt, hedge your bets Late last month, buried in the flurry of end-of-fiscal-year contract awards, the Pentagon announced that it is funding two carrier-based drone concepts -- one each from the two competing camps. On the "stealthy" side, Lockheed Martin was awarded $43.6 million "to conduct risk reduction activities in support of the MQ-25 unmanned carrier aviation air system, including refinement of concepts and development of trade space for requirements generation in advance of the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the program." Simultaneously, the Pentagon hired Boeing to do exactly the same work on a (presumably non-stealthy) Stingray design for $43.4 million. What it means to investors The U.S. Pentagon shoveled $14.5 billion in new contracts out the door in the final week of fiscal year 2016, so it's possible I have missed mention of similar development contracts to General Atomics and/or Northrop Grumman. In fact, given Northrop's successful experience building and flying the X-47B, I admit to some shock at not finding Northrop at the top of the Pentagon's MQ-25 short list. But I've read through the contract announcements twice, and don't think I've missed any official announcements. Even so, if you're an investor in Northrop Grumman stock, don't panic! Just because your company didn't receive money for "risk reduction activities" doesn't mean Northrop Grumman has no chance of winning the MQ-25 contract. Nor do the two awards announced last month guarantee that Boeing or Lockheed Martin will have a "lock" on building the MQ-25 Stingray. To the contrary, no official Navy "Request for Proposals" to build the MQ-25 is even expected before next year, and no production models are expected before 2021. At the same time, investors in Boeing and Lockheed Martin may take some comfort in the fact that they were the Navy's first choices to get the ball rolling on the MQ-25A Stingray. For better or worse, I'd have to say that right now, Boeing and Lockheed occupy the pole positions in this race.

The Saudis took the occasion of a funeral in Sana, the Yemeni capital, of a patriarch of a large, prominent family to carry out a three-wave bombing attack on the hall where the ceremony was being held. One argument that President Barack Obama’s administration uses to sustain America’s policy of continued support for the Saudi-led coalition is that the intelligence the United States provides its air war against Yemen enables its planes to be more precise in hitting military rather than civilian targets. What that line of argument would lead to this time is either that it isn’t an accurate description of what is occurring, or that U.S. intelligence helped the Saudis target the attack on the funeral. Neither “explanation” is acceptable to American principles. What is likely more accurate is to refer to the fact that the United States has sold the Saudis and the other Sunni Persian Gulf Arab states the aircraft and technology that they are using to wage war against the Shiite Houthis in Yemen. The figure for sales to the Saudis is $100 billion during the Obama years. Companies profiting from the sales include Boeing, General Dynamics and United Technologies. The Department of Defense has yet to assure there are no U.S. co-pilots in the Saudi aircraft carrying out attacks in Yemen. The other argument used to justify continued U.S. support of the Saudis in their intra-Islamic war is that America is placating the kingdom, based on its opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement concluded last year. The Shiite Islamic republic exchanged its nuclear program for the immediate and middle future in return for an alleviation of economic and financial international sanctions against it. Unfortunately, at this time, Yemenis — citizens of the poorest country in the Mideast — are paying the price in blood to please the Saudis and their theocratic regime for the Iran deal. Saturday’s slaughter makes it clear that the time is long since past when the United States should stop using U.S. companies’ arms sales and defense of the Iran deal as reasons to continue to help Saudi Sunnis slaughter Yemenis, even if they are supported to a degree by Iran. A lethal attack on a funeral is simply an atrocity that qualifies as a war crime. The United States should disassociate itself from Saudi war-making quickly: Cancel the contracts if that is what is required to end U.S. involvement in this war.

Monday, a reporter with The Island Packet and The Beaufort Gazette was able to visit several of the sites: ▪  Harbour Town Lighthouse: The striped lighthouse, Hilton Head’s best-known landmark, appears unaffected. But it has not yet been assessed for structural damage, according to Community Services Associates, which manages Sea Pines.   ▪  Gregg Russell Harbour Town Playground: A large tree at the center of the popular place for children to play at Harbour Town fell in the storm and is lying across the playground equipment. ▪  Harbour Town shops: There does not seem to be any flooding or major damage to any of the shops. ▪  Harbour Town’s Liberty Oak: The tree that shades the performance space for popular family entertainer Gregg Russell does not appear to have any significant damage. ▪  Harbour Town Golf Links: The course, site of the annual RBC Heritage Presented by Boeing, will need some significant cleanup. There are downed trees and debris along the course. The storm surge during Matthew did not wash onto the course’s iconic oceanside 18th hole, so no saltwater seems to have damaged the area. Most recovery will be tree and debris removal.   ▪  Sea Pines Beach Club: There is no structural damage to the new Sea Pines Beach Club. But the dunes on the beach have been significantly eroded, according to the CSA.   ▪  Salty Dog Cafe: Tree removal crews are still unable to access the popular tourist spot. ▪  Heritage Farm: The site, composed of residents’ garden plots, had extensive flooding during the storm. ▪  Lawton Stables: The stables, known for its pony rides, petting zoo and one giant Clydesdale named Harley, appear undamaged. Harley, the trail horses and other animals were evacuated Oct. 5.   Erin Heffernan: 843-706-8142, @IPBG_Erinh Related content A first look at damage to Harbour Town caused by Hurricane Matthew Reporter provides a look at Sea Pines Beach post-Matthew Some Sea Pines residents can’t go home LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Hurricane Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:23 Taste of Waddell — Mariculture Center's major fundraiser Pause 0:58 Slurpin' 'em down at Hilton Head Oyster Festival 0:38 Vintage Packard pulled from lagoon at Concours 1:28 Flying with the Packet and Gazette: Kite Day on Hilton Head 2:42 What was planned for the new Beaufort County Black Chamber of Commerce building? 1:02 How to shuck an oyster 0:35 Aerial view of Harbour Town's Yacht Basin, 18th green 2:44 Spades strike history in Galilee 1:11 Holy Trinity's Feed the Need effort to help the hurricane victims in Haiti 1:18 Pregnant woman takes 'extra' precautions against Zika Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 3 days ago Come fly a kite with us!

The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 88 points, with Apple and Boeing contributing the most gains, after gaining 159.47 points at session highs. “You have more clarity from the U.S. election, with the uncertainty from that heading lower; you’ve got less uncertainty from OPEC, and that’s bullish for stocks,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO of Sarhan Capital.

Fuller The cyclone named Matthew has been downgraded from a hurricane but remains dangerous as it moves east into the Atlantic. Matthew ravaged territory from the Caribbean to North Carolina last week. At its peak on the first of the month, Matthew reached a Category 5 hurricane level in the Caribbean Sea en route to Haiti. President Barack Obama signed emergency declarations for Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. News outlets report that the death toll in Haiti hit 1,000 on Monday, while over 20 people have died across four states in the U.S. Nine helicopters, including Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallions and Boeing Ch-47 Chinooks, have made their way down to Haiti, carrying members of a U.S. military task force to facilitate aid efforts, according to the Department of Defense. Due to Haiti’s terrain, the Pentagon called helicopters a “critical asset” in these operations. Other agencies agree as news outlets report that the U.S. Coast Guard used at least one MH-60 Jayhawk to transport civilians, while the Louisiana National Guard deployed two Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks and two Airbus Helicopter UH-72 Lakotas to help with efforts in Florida and South Carolina.

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. Avimanyu Basu, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on aerospace components sector, says, "The original equipment manufacturers in the aviation industry are shifting their focus from supplying of components to providing aftermarket services that include parts manufacture approval components as well as maintenance services." Airlines offer maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) operations in the market with an aim to develop more opportunities for airline operators, resulting in high revenue passenger kilometer (RPK). Though APAC holds great potential for MRO facilities, the region is challenged with shortage of skilled labor and wage inflation. The HMV market is globalizing at a fast pace owing to the growing number of MRO facilities in emerging countries like India, South America, and China. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53282 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. The top three emerging trends driving the global aircraft HMV marketaccording to Technavio aerospace and defense research analysts are: Trend toward block maintenance Use of energy harvester modules for maintenance operations Robotized maintenance assistance reducing cost and man hour Trend toward block maintenance "For a wide-body airplane like the B747, the number of scheduled maintenance tasks are extensive, and in particular, for higher C and D checks. These intensive checks require the airplane to be grounded for maintenance for several weeks, which is a loss for the airlines," adds Avimanyu. The block or phase maintenance can be a solution by dividing the higher checks into segmented blocks or phases. A typical phase check provides a thorough visual inspection and operational or functional checks of specified components and systems. Each check includes the requirements of low check A and B, and some part of C and D checks, at required task intervals. Phase checks are carried out at 200-800 flight-hour intervals, which depends upon the packaging plan of work and airline operating variables. Use of energy harvester modules for maintenance operations One of the major challenges of aircraft maintenance operations is the loss of productivity due to inspection of the healthy section of the aircraft. This reflects higher maintenance cost and in turn, a much expensive HMV. Detection of minute cracks as well as visible dents are quite challenging on carbon-based materials unlike aluminum. The use of energy autonomous sensors, free of electrical wiring, which closely monitors the airframe structure can be a possible solution. A team of researchers from Vienna University of Technology, Austria working closely with EADS Germany developed a technology which can detect the mentioned faults. The technology involves effectual energy autonomous sensors placed in close contact with the airframe. The sensors are equipped with a small water tank for thermal energy storage. Once the aircraft is airborne, the system harvests energy through the temperature difference between the sub-zero temperature outside and the ground temperature of the water tank. Robotized maintenance assistance reducing cost and man hour In an aircraft engine, the blades in compressors and turbines experience high stress levels while converting fluid energy into mechanical energy. In the process, the blades are subjected to wear due to vibration, friction, or by erosion from dust and sand particles. Also, sometimes during hard landings large objects collide with the blades. This causes the blade components made of titanium- or nickel-alloy steels to bend or crack, which obstruct the flow of air resulting in higher fuel consumption. Blades are expensive objects and repairing a blade is almost 50% less expensive than acquiring a new one.

But if it wants to secure a share of the US market, there are several problems to solve, Richard Smith reports Although the MRJ finally arrived in the United States for testing last month, after two aborted attempts, not all is rosy. For the moment, the MRJ’s biggest concern is trying to gain appeal in the US regional jet market, says Vinay Bhaskara, a senior business analyst at the Miami-based Airways News. "Mitsubishi needs relaxation of ‘scope clauses’ in the United States on the weight side [the MRJ is currently too heavy for existing scope clauses] as well as on the seat capacity side," he says. Unique to the US, a scope clause is part of a contract between an airline and a pilot union that limits the weight and capacity of regional aircraft. The idea is protectionist – the mainline carriers do not want regional airlines flying larger aircraft. If regionals do not have the weight and seating limits, they can add larger aircraft and undercut mainline aircraft economics, according to Air Insight, a commercial aviation consultancy. The current capacity limit in most US scope clauses is 76 seats. The capacity restriction can be circumvented by re-configuring the MRJ90 to have, say, 10 larger first-class seats to fit the 76-seat limit, Mr Bhaskara says. However, the MRJ is offered as all-economy, meaning a real-world configuration of at least 80 to 82 seats Most scope clauses also contain restrictions on maximum take-off weight (MTOW), which for the MRJ family ranges from 39,600 to 42,800 kilos. The current limit in most US scope clauses is 39,009kg. "But the weight restriction is impossible to game, so Mitsubishi has been banking on a relaxation of scope clauses for a while now," Mr Bhaskara adds, as are its US customers SkyWest and Trans States Holdings. However, Mitsubishi may be looking at taking some weight out of the MRJ90 to get in under the scope clause, he says. "That should be achievable relatively easily with the standard model MRJ90 – Mitsubishi only needs to take out about 500kg of weight." It will probably have to. Winning concessions on scope clauses looks unlikely, he says. "The market dynamics are tilting towards pilots who are emboldened by a unionised labour structure and a looming pilot shortage." In addition, Edward Bourlet, a senior analyst for CLSA Japan, believes the MRJ’s builders have refrained from using much carbon fibre and have generally been conservative with technology. That could also come back to haunt the aircraft maker. "Taking lower risk with technology for the sake of reliability at this stage means the MRJ’s superior efficiency may be short-lived," he says. Mitsubishi Aircraft Company begs to differ. The company has applied composite material on the tail assembly but decided not to do so on the wings or fuselage, Mac spokeswoman Miho Takahashi says. Fuselage damage can occur while the aircraft is on the ground, particularly when loading cargo, so making the MRJ fuselage in composite would necessitate thickening the parts near the doors, Ms Takahashi says. "For an aircraft the size of the MRJ, doing so would cause weight merit loss," she says. Adding to Mitsubishi’s problems, the standard model’s maximum range is only about 2,000 kilometres, which translates into a real-world range of about 1,500km. That might be sufficient in the Japanese market but it will not appeal greatly in the much bigger US, Mr Bhaskara says. "So that pushes Mitsubishi on to the harder problem of pulling nearly two tonnes of weight from the extended range version [to produce a still-anaemic 2,100km to 2,400km of real-world range], or close to four tonnes from the long-range version," he says. By contrast, the standard version of Embraer’s newest regional jet, the E170, with 70 to 78 seats, has a range of just under 4,000km and an MTOW of 38,790kg, it says. A further issue is the fact that, from an investor’s standpoint, the MRJ is, as are all new aircraft projects, capital intensive and risky – and in this case really not necessary, Mr Bourlet says. Mitsubishi’s aerospace division would do just fine by continuing to supply components to Boeing, he says. "But in some ways it’s a national project, involving government financing, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries the vessel." On the plus side, getting into the business of making passenger jets will give MHI increased leverage in the aviation industry, says the Ireland-based expert Eamonn Fingleton, who has published three books on the economies of east Asian countries. "Not all the components by any means will be made in Japan, so Mitsubishi will be courted by suppliers in [South] Korea, Taiwan, China as well in the United States, the UK, France, Germany and, of course, Canada," Mr Fingleton says. Japanese firms such as Mitsubishi and Kawasaki, through their heavy industry units, have been providing products to Boeing for the past two to three decades, developing wings and even fuselage components for the US jet maker, Mr Bhaskara adds. That exposure to sector-leading manufacturing, planning and technologies has given them the ability to quickly spool up and build their own world-class airliner, he says. "And the MRJ, despite its uneven development process, is truly a modern western airliner in all but locale." business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Canada’s biggest airline gains lift as earnings top estimates New $40bn stealth fighter jet built in Japan on the cards Mitsubishi’s jet set for push into Middle East First new jetliner built by Japan in decades may be delayed More Aviation Air Arabia third-quarter profit lifted by passenger gains Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Honda plans to increase business jet production Jet Airways income edges up MOST VIEWED Business | All Renault faces criminal inquiry over emissions cheating suspicions Abu Dhabi’s Royal Jet offers VIP alternative to travelling first class A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Dubai Parks operator aims to lift revenue as costs rise India’s currency move will hit property and gold Basking in the glow of Egypt’s devaluation Head of GE Oil & Gas says oil industry cuts not done yet Trump looms large over World Economic Forum event in Dubai More Most Viewed American-Iranian political tensions will only escalate UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi 2018 Africa World Cup qualifying: Chelsea pair Victor Moses and John Obi Mikel on target for Nigeria Louvre Abu Dhabi announces first contemporary art installations Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Muhammad Surur and the normalisation of extremism Girl, 16, trafficked to Dubai and forced into prostitution, court hears Trump win means ‘more Israeli settlements, fewer rights for Palestinians’ Hate crime and Islamophobia increases after Trump victory More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS India’s currency move will hit property and gold President Trump - What exactly does that mean?

Wallace Woon / EPA Jet-engine maker Pratt the butt of $10bn dollar jokes Bloomberg October 10, 2016 Updated: October 10, 2016 03:54 PM Related New A320s for biggest Thai budget airline as profits go stratospheric Boeing profit beats estimates as Dreamliner becomes cheaper to make Airbus and Boeing jet engine maker forecasts higher profit for the year Boeing wins $18.6 billion deal as Qatar Airways takes first 737 Max jetliner US jet engine maker rebuffs criticism from Qatar Airways Topics: Qatar Airways Airbus Boeing It is rarely a good sign when you become the butt of jokes. But that is what happened to Pratt & Whitney at an industry gathering recently, when John Leahy, the chief salesman of Airbus, was talking about a futuristic airplane – with an engine that "no doubt will be delivered late". While the audience was amused, Pratt surely was not. It has spent US$10 billion and decades developing the quieter, more-efficient and less-polluting engine (see video below). Executives see the product as critical to catching up to its rival General Electric (GE) in the market to power narrow-body planes, the dominant aircraft used by airlines around the world. Instead, the engine’s debut has been marred by production delays, technical issues and supply-chain foul-ups. Qatar Airways last week cited the problems while announcing plans to buy planes powered exclusively by GE turbines. Pratt was forced to cut promised deliveries this year by 25 per cent, frustrating some airlines and plane manufacturers counting on them. "This is their big play to get back on single-aisles," said Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co. "This is the one that’s going to have to happen if they’re going to be a player in large commercial engines." The company has characterised the production issues as "teething" problems typical to new technology. The president Bob Leduc said complaints were overblown, and the engines in service have been reliable while meeting promises of 16 per cent better fuel efficiency, 75 per cent noise reduction and 50 per cent less emissions. "The engine is as we advertised, period," he said. Pratt has about 8,200 orders for the product. This year, the new engine, known as a geared turbofan, debuted in commercial service on the 180-seat Airbus A320neo (the "neo" standing for "new engine option"). Engine list price is more than $10 million apiece, say analysts. But production issues led Pratt to revise its delivery schedule. Last month it said it would deliver only 150 engines this year, to plane makers such as Airbus and Bombardier, down from the 200 it had earlier pledged. One of the sharpest blows came last week when Qatar Airways made good on a threat to buy competitors to the A320neo over concerns about the delays. the combative chief executive Akbar Al Baker, a vocal critic of Pratt’s engine issues, said his carrier would order as many as 100 Boeing 737 Max jets to "mitigate our risk" on the Airbus plane. He stressed the reliability of Boeing’s jet, which use engines from CFM International, a joint venture of GE and France’s Safran. Pratt’s delays have forced Airbus to alter its delivery schedule, substituting 20 A320 jets with older engines in place of newer models, according to Douglas Harned, a Bernstein analyst. An Airbus representative said the company would hand over more older-version A320s this year "to make up for any shortfall on A320neo deliveries" but did not specify the number of planes. The engine problems "appear significant with path to resolution currently unclear", Mr Harned said. Pratt declined to discuss its plans to improve production processes. Delays also forced Bombardier to halve projected 2016 deliveries of its marquee C Series jetliner. The company has a deal to use Pratt engines exclusively on the plane. "This is very disappointing," said Alain Bellemare, Bombardier’s chief executive. But Mr Bellemare praised the engine’s core technology: "I’m still very pleased that we made that choice. It’s the best engine available out there today for commercial aircraft." Pratt’s rivalry with GE remains fierce. GE’s Leap engine, the other option on the A320neo, debuted this year and achieves fuel savings largely through advanced materials. A320neo customers have picked GE’s engine about 54 per cent of the time, and Pratt the rest, according to data from Ascend Flightglobal Consultancy. More than one-third of A320neo orders have not announced an engine choice yet, leaving plenty of sales up for grabs. The Pratt engine’s technical advances have contributed to some of the production problems. The aluminum-titanium fan blades are particularly complex, taking about 60 days to manufacture when they need to take half that time, said Gregory Hayes, the chief executive of United Technologies, Pratt’s parent. The company is "still struggling to come down the learning curve", he said. Pratt remains resolute, recently announcing plans to hire as many as 25,000 new workers in the next decade to work down the backlog. And joking aside, Mr Leahy is standing behind the company. "I have faith that Pratt will solve" the issues, he said after poking fun at the engine delays. "It is disappointing the situation we find ourselves in but it’s a good engine from everything we can see." business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related New A320s for biggest Thai budget airline as profits go stratospheric Boeing profit beats estimates as Dreamliner becomes cheaper to make Airbus and Boeing jet engine maker forecasts higher profit for the year Boeing wins $18.6 billion deal as Qatar Airways takes first 737 Max jetliner More Aviation Air Arabia third-quarter profit lifted by passenger gains Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Honda plans to increase business jet production Jet Airways income edges up MOST VIEWED Business | All Renault faces criminal inquiry over emissions cheating suspicions Abu Dhabi’s Royal Jet offers VIP alternative to travelling first class A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Dubai Parks operator aims to lift revenue as costs rise India’s currency move will hit property and gold Basking in the glow of Egypt’s devaluation Head of GE Oil & Gas says oil industry cuts not done yet Trump looms large over World Economic Forum event in Dubai More Most Viewed American-Iranian political tensions will only escalate UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi 2018 Africa World Cup qualifying: Chelsea pair Victor Moses and John Obi Mikel on target for Nigeria Louvre Abu Dhabi announces first contemporary art installations Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Muhammad Surur and the normalisation of extremism Girl, 16, trafficked to Dubai and forced into prostitution, court hears Trump win means ‘more Israeli settlements, fewer rights for Palestinians’ Hate crime and Islamophobia increases after Trump victory More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS India’s currency move will hit property and gold President Trump - What exactly does that mean?

But that’s what happened to Pratt & Whitney at an industry gathering recently, when John Leahy, the venerable chief salesman of Airbus Group SE, went on about a futuristic airplane -- with an engine that “no doubt will be delivered late.” While the audience was amused, Pratt surely wasn’t. It’s spent $10 billion and decades developing the quieter, more-efficient and less-polluting engine.

Qatar Airways last week cited the problems while announcing plans to buy planes powered exclusively by GE turbines. Pratt was forced to cut promised deliveries this year by 25 percent, frustrating some airlines and plane manufacturers counting on them. The troubles have dinged the stock of parent United Technologies Corp., as Pratt’s $14 billion in sales accounts for about one-quarter of its revenue. “This is their big play to get back on single-aisles,” said Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co. “This is the one that’s going to have to happen if they’re going to be a player in large commercial engines.” ‘Teething’ Problems The company has characterized the production issues as “teething” problems typical to new technology. President Bob Leduc told Bloomberg in June that complaints were overblown, saying the engines in service have been reliable while meeting promises of 16 percent better fuel efficiency, 75 percent noise reduction and 50 percent less emissions. “The engine is as we advertised, period,” he said. Pratt has about 8,200 orders for the product. Founded in 1925, Pratt has a storied history, supplying engines to early planes and later for fighters in World War II. In the 1970s Pratt was the leader in selling engines for large passenger planes. But its position slipped in the 1980s when it miscalculated the market. Cuts Noise By the end of that decade, Pratt engineers began work on technology to slow the engine’s fan speed, which cuts noise and can improve efficiency. This year, the new engine, known as a geared turbofan, debuted in commercial service on the 180-seat Airbus A320neo (the “neo” standing for “new engine option”). Engine list price: more than $10 million apiece, say analysts. But production issues led Pratt to revise its delivery schedule. Last month it said it would deliver only 150 engines this year, to planemakers such as Airbus and Bombardier Inc., down from the 200 it had earlier pledged. One of the sharpest blows came Oct. 7 when Qatar Airways made good on a threat to buy competitors to the A320neo over concerns about the delays. Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker, a vocal critic of Pratt’s engine issues, said his carrier would order as many as 100 Boeing Co. 737 Max jets to “mitigate our risk” on the Airbus plane. He stressed the reliability of Boeing’s jet, which use engines from CFM International, a joint venture of GE and France’s Safran SA. United Technologies fell 0.1 percent to $100.49 at 9:35 a.m. Monday in New York after Jason Gursky, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., downgraded the shares to neutral from buy. The geared turbofan’s issues will “create customer penalties over the next few years” while crimping growth in cash flow and impeding acquisitions, he said in a note. “It’s going to be tough sledding for a while.” Altered Deliveries Pratt’s delays have forced Airbus to alter its delivery schedule, substituting 20 A320 jets with older engines in place of newer models, according to Douglas Harned, a Bernstein analyst. An Airbus representative said the company would hand over more older-version A320s this year “to make up for any shortfall on A320neo deliveries” but didn’t specify the number of planes. The engine problems “appear significant with path to resolution currently unclear,” Harned wrote in a note. Pratt declined to discuss its plans to improve production processes.

But even after the various issues, Bellemare couldn’t muster bad words for the engine’s core technology: “I’m still very pleased that we made that choice.

GE’s Leap engine, the other option on the A320neo, debuted this year and achieves fuel savings largely through advanced materials. A320neo customers have picked GE’s engine about 54 percent of the time, and Pratt the rest, according to data from Ascend Flightglobal Consultancy. More than one-third of A320neo orders have not announced an engine choice yet, leaving plenty of sales up for grabs. The engine’s technical advances have contributed to some of the production problems. The aluminum-titanium fan blades are particularly complex, taking about 60 days to manufacture when they need to take half that time, Gregory Hayes, CEO of Farmington, Connecticut-based United Technologies, said in a presentation last month. The company is “still struggling to come down the learning curve,” he said. The introduction of new technology is bound to have glitches, experts and industry leaders say. For that reason, Hungarian low-cost carrier Wizz Air intentionally scheduled deliveries several years down the line to allow time for kinks to be worked out, according to CEO Jozsef Varadi. Sorted Out “I think by the time we start taking deliveries this will all get sorted,” he said in a recent interview. Wizz, which last year firmed up an order for 110 of the A321neo, targeted 2019 because “we don’t want to be associated with this mess.” Pratt remains resolute, recently announcing plans to hire as many as 25,000 new workers in the next decade to work down the backlog. And joking aside, Airbus’s Leahy is standing behind the company. “I have faith that Pratt will solve” the issues, he told reporters after poking fun at the engine delays. “It is disappointing the situation we find ourselves in, but it’s a good engine from everything we can see.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Their way to Europe is closed. Whether EU has so rigid requirements or domestic aircraft are in such a terrible state that it is not safe to fly by them? Up in the air EU and ICAO black lists include 13 air line companies of Kyrgyzstan. The international organization is concerned about safety of flights. Our rates in this area are low. ICAO audit is conducted in eight directions. At the beginning of 2016, the organization conducted an audit in five areas. As a result, there have been made 128 observations in the following areas: air legislation, the organizational structure of the Civil Aviation Agency, flight operation and readiness of aircrafts, personnel licensing. According to the inspection results, things look black in the qualification and training of technical personnel, the resolution of safety issues, obligations on supervision and inspection. It is also necessary to upgrade the fleet.   The last ICAO audit showed that the situation only worsened in some aspects, but there are positive signs. The improvement was noted in the part of the air law, aviation regulations and airworthiness. Kyrgyzstan knows how it should be according to the rules, but the execution of the laws is lame. Therefore, indices in personnel licensing and flight operations have deteriorated compared with the results of the audit in 2009.  After the check, the Civil Aviation Agency was able to eliminate one discrepancy on PEL aspect (personnel licensing). But this is not enough to withdraw companies from the blacklist. The main recommendation by ICAO: structure of the safety surveillance system must be provided with finance and personnel. Training of the personnel has already begun. Inspectors of CAA will attend training courses in Turkey and France. In addition, Kyrgyzstan was included in a special program of cooperation on the example of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Within it ICAO experts will arrive in the republic to identify weak places in the aviation. This will eliminate inconsistencies with international standards. Where's the money? At the end of 2015, the government of Kyrgyzstan has approved $ 5 increase in fee from passengers at Manas airport. The norm applies only to citizens of Kyrgyzstan and those who depart abroad. Previously, passengers were charged $ 10. The fee is included in the ticket price and, as it was noted in the government, is aimed at improving the airport infrastructure. The deputies of the Parliament offered to transfer a part of the collected funds to CAA. "The black list of the EU and ICAO in the first place indicates that we have a flights safety threat. We have been in the black list of ICAO for 10 years and now we were also included in the EU's black list. This shows that our civil aviation is in a deep crisis. Instead of elimination of the shortcomings, they have only increased - from 67 to 128. But 5-6 of them are very important because they demonstrate not only the safety threat, but also the existence of a threat to human life," the deputy Baktybek Sydykov said. In particular, his comments touched upon the recruitment of personnel. "Standards and ICAO regulations should be a guide to action. They specifically state what qualification an inspector should have. Why to invent? If we have recruited people with humanitarian, philological education, electrical engineers, it is unclear how we will come out from the black list," Baktybek Sydykov said. Aircrafts- in the first place Civil Aviation Agency did not wait until the issue on the transfer of the funds from Manas airport fees would be resolved and asked the government to allocate 55 million soms. That money, as the head of the agency Ermek Omurbekov told to 24.kg news agency, will be spent on personnel training.  Along with the development of the aviation industry, there is a gradual transition of airlines from the Soviet equipment (Tu, Yak aircrafts) to Western aircrafts (Boeing, Airbus). Consequently, the airlines staff should be trained. CAA as the body, responsible for supervision, should also have inspectors with permissions for these types of aircrafts. Agency director says that it is absolutely safe to fly by domestic aircrafts. Number of accidents and emergencies is minimal. "Aircrafts of Kyrgyzstan have valid airworthiness certificates and meet international requirements," Ermek Omurbekov said.  Disasters and accidents, involving aircrafts in Kyrgyzstan  Then, there is a logical question: why the airlines are still on the blacklist. Despite the fact that, according to the International Aviation Committee, Kyrgyzstan ranks last in the CIS by the number of air crashes victims. From 2006 to 2015, there have been recorded 10 air accidents, 2 of which - air crashes. - In 2006, Tu-154 of Kyrgyzstan airline hit the right wing of the American KC-135 tanker during a takeoff at Manas airport. Wing of Tu-154 was damaged, but it has managed to take off. Having made a circle, it made an emergency landing. No harm done.  - In 2008, passenger Boeing-737 of Itek Air airline has crashed. The aircraft tried to make an emergency landing right after departure from Bishkek, but crashed and caught fire at the turn. The survivors were 22 people, 68 were killed, including members of the Kyrgyz volleyball junior team. -In 2011, Tu-134 of Kyrgyzstan airline made a hard landing at Osh airport. At least 18 people turned for medical help, seven of them were hospitalized with injuries of moderate severity. - In 2015, the plane of Avia Traffic Company, coming from Krasnoyarsk, made a hard landing at the airport of Osh and skidded off the runway due to bad weather conditions. At least 153 people were on board, 7 of them were hospitalized.   According to forecasts, by 2018 the Kyrgyz airlines will come out from the black list and will be able to fly to Europe. CAA has made every effort to eliminate the defects, but this is not enough. Airlines themselves must decide for themselves: whether they are ready to invest in the development of aviation.

Global representatives at a recent International Civil Aviation Organization meeting recently agreed to an aviation-specific climate agreement. Image: Matthew Grapengieser, CC BY-SA 2.0 By Christiana Figueres and Laurence Tubiana Monday 10 October 2016 Share this story As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, demand for air travel is growing, with more than 30,000 new large aircraft expected to take to the skies in the next few years. But if we are to sustain growth in air travel without aggravating global warming, we must quickly reduce aviation-related CO2 emissions, which are substantial and not covered by the Paris climate agreement that more than 190 countries agreed to last December. Fortunately, now is the perfect time to decouple aviation emissions from air-travel growth. Representatives from 191 countries convened in Montreal last week for the 39th Session of the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization; after decades of wrangling, they have agreed to an aviation-specific climate agreement. The new ICAO framework aims for “carbon-neutral growth” in international aviation from 2020 onward, and has as its centerpiece a global market-based measure (GMBM) to help airlines affordably cap their net emissions at 2020 levels. When implemented, it will be the first carbon-emissions cap on a global industry that does not noticeably increase costs for consumers. And airlines will purchase emissions reductions from other economic sectors, thus funneling billions of dollars into low-carbon development around the world. For the first six years, the new framework will apply only to flights between countries that have voluntarily adopted it, which means that the ICAO will have to encourage adequate participation for the program to be effective. This opt-in approach has some critics, but whether a program is categorized as “voluntary” or “mandatory” is beside the point, because international accords generally apply only to the sovereign countries that have decided to join them. Some 64 countries have already signaled their willingness to sign on to the ICAO agreement, and together they account for nearly 80 per cent of expected growth in CO2 emissions above 2020 levels. That isn’t 100 per cent, but it’s a great start, and we can expect more countries to join when they see others reaping the benefits of low-carbon development. The airlines themselves will welcome a coherent global framework that establishes clear and predictable compliance metrics, rather than a regulatory patchwork that differs from country to country and complicates international operations. To minimize compliance costs – and because environmental sustainability is now a key competitive marker for customers and investors alike – airlines will likely encourage the countries where they do business to participate in the ICAO program. The new agreement provides an enormous opportunity to prevent the emission of 2.5 billion tons of CO2 in the first 15 years – the equivalent of taking roughly 35 million cars off the road every year the program is in force. “ By cleaning up our carbon footprint now, future generations of air travelers from all countries will be able to look out their window onto a healthy planet. The agreement will also spur major manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, and Embraer – which are already investing in quieter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and efficiency improvements for existing models – to develop cleaner technologies that will allow them to purchase fewer emissions offsets. However, the framework decided in Montreal is not complete, and crucial details need to be worked out quickly so that airlines can begin to plan how they will meet the new environmental targets. Developed countries have already offered to help implement the GMBM, which, it is hoped, will pave the way for investments in emerging economies that are becoming new aviation powerhouses. If the countries can leapfrog over old technologies, they can become new leaders in carbon-smart flying. They should seize the opportunity before them and join the ICAO framework so that their manufacturers have a clear and predictable path forward. At the Paris climate talks last year, we witnessed the power of global collective action to address climate change. No fewer than 187 countries – large and small, developed and developing – announced emissions-reduction targets in the months before the conference, which created the momentum to reach a landmark accord. With the Paris climate agreement on track to enter into force in the coming months – more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible – we still have that momentum. The ICAO agreement is the next wave in the international battle against climate change. Together, the two agreements will boost our chances of delivering environmentally sustainable economic growth. By cleaning up our carbon footprint now, future generations of air travelers from all countries will be able to look out their window onto a healthy planet.

Fiji airways planes Photo: Alex Perrottet/RNZ AFL's Communications Officer, Christopher Chand, said AFL apologises for the inconvenience to passengers and says the problems with the runway are due to the incorrect application of sealant by its specialist contractor, Supersealing. He said AFL has contacted Supersealing as well as Beca Erasito to review the job and to undertake remedial action. Fiji Airways said it won't land Boeing 737s at the airport until the runway problem is solved. The move has caused delays to passengers travelling to and from destinations such as Sydney and Auckland from Suva. AFL said Supersealing was engaged to carry out crack sealing works with the objective of extending the life of the Nausori runway by two years.

The home that she had lived in for 22 years and that flooded for the first time in the historic rain storm in October 2015 was once again under water. “I’m sick of it,” said the 71-year-old. “I just want to move now.” Livingston spent $30,000 of her retirement savings on replacing floors, wallboard and furniture and had moved back into the house in January. She did not have flood insurance last year. She does this year. Her home is on the edge of a flooded area that includes more than 35 homes, most built on ground-level slabs, on Peppercorn Lane that had a foot of water cover first floors. The flooding from Hurricane Matthew was not as bad last year’s event, and spared other homes that were affected, but enough to ruin repair work. The few residents that were on the scene Sunday expressed anger that local governmental entities had not performed the drainage work they called for. The consensus among residents remains that the construction of Palmetto Commerce Parkway and what they consider inadequate drainage for it has caused the problem. The four-lane parkway runs through a once-wooded area behind their homes and connects Ashley Phosphate and Ladson roads. North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said he believes the flood problem lies in a ditch that had been cleared but was discovered to be clogged again. He blames the flooding damage on extreme rain events and the fact that when the houses were built, in the 1980s, they were allowed to be on built slabs and not elevated, despite being in a flood zone. “That wouldn’t be possible by today’s standards,” said Summey, who added that he feels sad for the residents but that “the risk is there” and that all should have flood insurance. Of the residents on Peppercorn Lane, nobody experienced flooding worse than Jason Gardner and Amy Knox in October 2015. They had flood insurance but still had to borrow $25,000 and use $30,000 in retirement and personal savings to repair the house and replace belongings. Knox also lost $10,000 in home business supplies during the October 2015 flood and has not been able to continue that business. The flood has been a traumatic experience for her 5-year-old daughter, Izzy, who has asked weekly if the house was going to flood again. Like other residents, Gardner said he researched the flood history and that the area had not flooded during Hurricane Hugo. They moved there in 2014 and had just moved back in May. Gardner, who works as a manufacturing technician at Boeing, said he believes the problem lies largely in the fact that half of the area is supposed to drain out to the Goose Creek reservoir but that all of it heads to the Ashley River. “I want the city to buy it (the flooded houses) and turn it back into swamp land,” said Gardner. Summey responded the city will not do that. At this point, many are weighing their options, including moving. Kimmi James, 50, moved into a house on Peppercorn to take care of her father, who suffers from dementia. He has lived in the house for 31 years. The family stayed on the second floor during Hurricane Matthew, which flooded the den, her bedroom, a laundry room and two deep freezers. “Right now, we’re talking about everything (options), but it depends on my father. He has lived here too long and it was be very disruptive for him to move.” Site Links About Staff Mobile Apps Newsletters Become a member Place an Ad Advertising Rates Opinion Classifieds Search Related Properties Aiken Standard - Aiken, SC South Strand News - Georgetown, Pawleys Island, & Murrells Inlet, SC The Gazette - Goose Creek, SC The News - Kingstree, SC The Berkeley Independent - Moncks Corner, SC Moultrie News - Mount Pleasant, SC The Star - North Augusta, SC Journal Scene - Summerville, SC Free Times - Columbia, SC Evening Post Books - Charleston, SC Contact Information Post and Courier 134 Columbus Street Charleston, SC 29403 Phone: 843-577-7111 Email: webteam@postandcourier.com © , Post and Courier, an Evening Post Industries company.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 9, 2016 at 12:13PM Artist's depiction of China's future "Heavenly Palace" national space station. Image source: Penyulap, via Wikimedia Commons. "Beijing, we have a problem." Since it first went up in 1998, the International Space Station has played host to astronauts from more than a dozen countries -- but not one of them was from China. In fact, in 2011, the U.S. Congress passed a law specifically prohibiting Chinese access to the ISS over concerns about "national security." This, of course, has the Chinese a bit miffed. And as we mentioned last year, China has been planning to build its own, all-made-in-China space station instead. Slated for completion by 2022, the Tiangong 3, or "Heavenly Palace," space station will probably comprise three separate-but-linked modules, with a pair of laboratories flanking a central living habitat. Heavenly Palace is expected to go into service just as America and Russia are preparing to disassemble their International Space Station for obsolescence. Halt and catch fire While preparing to build its station, China sent up an orbital test bed (also, confusingly, called "Tiangong") in 2011. Initially designed for a two-year mission, Tiangong 1 was kept in service up until this year, although uninhabited, for research purposes. It's unclear precisely how long China was hoping to stretch out Tiangong 1's life span. But events have forced its hand: Last month, China confirmed that it has lost all control over Tiangong 1. Various observers say the station is now in a "slow roll," with its solar panels no longer angled to collect sunlight, "drifting out of control," and now on course to enter Earth's atmosphere in an "uncontrolled re-entry." Upon entering the atmosphere, Tiangong 1 will promptly catch fire. That's actually a good thing, though: The hope is that much of the space station's mass will burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere. The station's denser parts, however, will probably crash to Earth, and right now, no one's quite sure where. Beijing, we need a (couple of) new space station(s) Lucky for China, then, that as Tiangong 1 crashes to Earth, it has a replacement ready. Last month, the Tiangong 2 space lab was launched into orbit, awaiting the arrival of two Chinese astronauts later this month. When that one, too, is all used up, China's space program will culminate in the launch of the ultimate "Heavenly Palace": Tiangong 3. It's this version that will comprise a core module (Tianhe 1) and two labs (Wengtian and Mengtian), massing about 72 tons when all put together. With launches of the various modules slated to take place between 2020 and 2022, it's likely that China will try to keep Tiangong 2 going for somewhere between four and six years before sending it, too, to burn up in the atmosphere. What it means to investors Now what import does all of this have for investors? After all, it's not as if China is a publicly traded company that we can invest in. Furthermore, in all three versions, Tiangong is a project run by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, which, as S&P Global Market Intelligence confirms, is a privately held company. The answer is that we need to keep an eye on Tiangong not as an investment idea itself, but as a competitor to other potential investments. Recall that the International Space Station -- largely financed by America, built by American companies such as Boeing (NYSE:BA), managed by companies like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and serviced by companies including SpaceX and Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA) -- is nearing the end of its life span. Currently, NASA has no firm plans to build a new space station. But Russia might, and China definitely will. Almost certainly, these new space stations will neither be built by U.S. companies nor provide U.S. companies with lucrative service contracts. Granted, NASA has floated plans to sell the International Space Station to private investors after 2024. But these plans, too, are far from certain. For one thing, there's no guarantee that America's partners in running ISS will agree to sell it to private interests. For another, we've heard not a peep out of Boeing, Lockheed, or Orbital yet about their interest in paying for ISS, after years of getting paid by ISS. For that matter, there's also a very real question: Will companies that might otherwise like the idea of running experiments in space choose to pay to run them on an antiquated ISS? If China and/or Russia were to build brand-spanking-new space stations, it might be more cost-effective to hire these countries to perform research on contract rather than take responsibility for ISS and run them "in-house." The upshot is this: Five years ago, America lost its space shuttle, and was forced to begin paying Russia for rocket rides. And just a little more than five years from now, we may lose our only space station as well -- and begin paying China to use theirs.

But if we are to sustain growth in air travel without aggravating global warming, we must quickly reduce aviation-related CO2 emissions, which are substantial and not covered by the Paris climate agreement that more than 190 countries agreed to last December. Fortunately, now is the perfect time to decouple aviation emissions from air-travel growth. Representatives from 191 countries convened in Montreal this week for the 39th Session of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization; after decades of wrangling, they have agreed to an aviation-specific climate agreement. The new ICAO framework aims for "carbon-neutral growth" in international aviation from 2020 onward, and has as its centerpiece a global market-based measure (GMBM) to help airlines affordably cap their net emissions at 2020 levels. When implemented, it will be the first carbon-emissions cap on a global industry that does not noticeably increase costs for consumers. And airlines will purchase emissions reductions from other economic sectors, thus funneling billions of dollars into low-carbon development around the world. For the first six years, the new framework will apply only to flights between countries that have voluntarily adopted it, which means that the ICAO will have to encourage adequate participation for the program to be effective. This opt-in approach has some critics, but whether a program is categorized as "voluntary" or "mandatory" is beside the point, because international accords generally apply only to the sovereign countries that have decided to join them. Some 64 countries have already signaled their willingness to sign on to the ICAO agreement, and together they account for nearly 80% of expected growth in CO2 emissions above 2020 levels. That isn't 100%, but it's a great start, and we can expect more countries to join when they see others reaping the benefits of low-carbon development. The airlines themselves will welcome a coherent global framework that establishes clear and predictable compliance metrics, rather than a regulatory patchwork that differs from country to country and complicates international operations. To minimize compliance costs - and because environmental sustainability is now a key competitive marker for customers and investors alike - airlines will likely encourage the countries where they do business to participate in the ICAO program. The new agreement provides an enormous opportunity to prevent the emission of 2.5 billion tons of CO2 in the first 15 years - the equivalent of taking roughly 35 million cars off the road every year the program is in force. The agreement will also spur major manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, and Embraer - which are already investing in quieter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and efficiency improvements for existing models - to develop cleaner technologies that will allow them to purchase fewer emissions offsets. However, the framework decided in Montreal is not complete, and crucial details need to be worked out quickly so that airlines can begin to plan how they will meet the new environmental targets. Developed countries have already offered to help implement the GMBM, which, it is hoped, will pave the way for investments in emerging economies that are becoming new aviation powerhouses. If the countries can leapfrog over old technologies, they can become new leaders in carbon-smart flying. They should seize the opportunity before them and join the ICAO framework so that their manufacturers have a clear and predictable path forward. At the Paris climate talks last year, we witnessed the power of global collective action to address climate change. No fewer than 187 countries - large and small, developed and developing - announced emissions-reduction targets in the months before the conference, which created the momentum to reach a landmark accord. With the Paris climate agreement on track to enter into force in the coming months - more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible - we still have that momentum. The ICAO agreement is the next wave in the international battle against climate change. Together, the two agreements will boost our chances of delivering environmentally sustainable economic growth. By cleaning up our carbon footprint now, future generations of air travelers from all countries will be able to look out their window onto a healthy planet. - Christiana Figueres was Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) from 2010 to 2016.

Teri Lynn Cantlay will be featured in an upcoming edition of the Women of Distinction Magazine in 2016/2017. Better known in her professional life as "TeriLynn CanSee", Teri Lynn Cantlay established her business, TLC and Associates/Enterprises in June 2012 with the understanding that she would help clients make positive life choices by giving them that added insight that only she can provide. As a Psychic, Tarot Reader/Astrologer, and Metaphysical Holistic Healing Practitioner, Cantlay focuses her energy on helping clients find their own self-empowerment so that they can lead fuller, happier lives. "Guiding clients so that they can explore their options by reading happenings to them from their past, present, and future, I am very straightforward. I will not participate in negative energy readings, spells, or anything that will put them in a dark place. Instead, my job is to bring my client and their soul into the light of their own best being." Noting that her readings are intended to be supportive and provide options while making important life decisions, Cantlay says that is equally important that she be true to herself while working with a client, bringing a clear mind and clear energy with her always.

She also participates at several holistic fairs, including the School of Multidimensional Healing Arts and Sciences in Irvine, California and is involved in their monthly holistic fair on the last Saturday of every month, gives readings on the first Saturday of every month with the Temple of Light in Orange County, and participates in events on Facebook.com/TeriLynnCanSee.

Seattle in 1969 is swarming with Japanese businessmen here to do deals—shipping, lumber, imports, Boeing. And they want to seal those deals the best way they know how: at a sushi bar. But first, the liquor board needs convincing that a sushi bar is merely a counter where the chef stands, making food and presenting it directly to diners. posted by CrystalDave (12 comments total) 25 users marked this as a favorite   That was a welcome respite from the news of the day. posted by kiltedtaco at 7:20 PM on October 8 Any story about Shiro that includes Maneki is a delight and a treasure. posted by mwhybark at 7:24 PM on October 8 [1 favorite] Delightful, thank you! posted by nfalkner at 7:49 PM on October 8 Really enjoyed this and now have a reason to ride the train north to eat dinner, I mean see my sister... posted by sourbrew at 11:40 PM on October 8 [1 favorite] "fried prawn spot head" Sadly I will never ever be able to eat solely based on the sushi chef's discretion. I'll stick to my spicy tuna and salmon. posted by sio42 at 4:44 AM on October 9 I'm not a particularly adventurous sushi eater: I generally like most fish, not a fan of octopus or urchin. I got one of the sushi set dinners at Kashiba. I think they change what's in the sets based what's in season, but when I was there it was "safe" options + sea urchin. So I figured might as well give urchin another try.The urchin was heavenly. I promptly ate everybody else's. I still think longingly of it: I'm in the Midwest now, so back to the basics when it I get sushi. I think I need to book a flight to Seattle soon.... posted by ghost phoneme at 9:59 AM on October 9 I had omakase at Shiro's once. The best sushi I have ever had in my life. I nearly refused to eat other sushi for another year or two afterwards. posted by grouse at 11:29 AM on October 9 [1 favorite] As a lifelong vegetarian, upon reading this story, I wanted to eat his sushi. I know that I wouldn't appreciate it, and don't have the taste for meat (although I enjoy vegetarian sushi), and the experience would probably be wasted on me... But I still wanted it. posted by el io at 4:46 PM on October 9 What does an evening of Omakase cost at a good sushi place? Is it priced per dish and you don't have control over what you get or because the chef can use different things is it priced per diner? I like sushi (except for the egg one) so would easily try an Omakase evening, except for the open ended pricing (and lack of a good place to get it here) posted by koolkat at 1:32 AM on October 10 In my experience they'll offer price bands. $60, $80, $100; for example. You can also say to just go until the end (don't discount the tamago). I've been lucky enough eat at Shiro's Belltown location twice. (not with him himself, but still excellent) The last time was for a rare occasion, and it came out to $150/person. I still remember details from it, they had just bought an entire tuna half the night before and were showing photos before serving 4 different cuts from the same fish. I hardly would've believed that they were the same species if I hadn't known. Absolutely magnificent. posted by CrystalDave at 5:34 AM on October 10 At Kashiba, Shiro's current place, reviews put his omakase at $95 and up, presumably before drinks. I have had the omakase at the Belltown restaurant, also after his tenure, and second the $150. I would probably expect to pay more than that for omakase with Shiro himself at Kashiba, and there would be drinks on top of that. posted by mwhybark at 7:40 AM on October 10 Mmm. Things I miss from Seattle include Shiro's and (for a more budget evening) I *heart* Sushi. posted by rmd1023 at 8:26 AM on October 10 « Older Here’s how to tell the new Underworld and Resident...   |   Empire de la Mort: honoring the dead around the...

Gordon Gee repeated three themes from last year’s wide-ranging State of the University address: education, health care and prosperity. Gee spoke Oct. 10 during the Faculty Senate meeting, saying the university would ride its wave of momentum forward. “I have spoken about changing the arc of higher education,” Gee said. “It is time to stop talking and start doing. And we are.” Gee stepped up to the podium after showing a video highlighting the university’s recent accomplishments. He said some institutions of higher education would not survive that transformation, but WVU must be at the forefront of change. Gee said WVU must reduce its spending by $45 million to cope with declining state support and increased operating costs. Very much looking forward to my State of the University address this afternoon.— E. Gordon Gee (@gordongee) October 10, 2016 “Whatever the opportunity may be, if we always return to our purpose, if we ask ourselves, ‘Why am I here? What can I do to help? How can I be indispensable to the mission of this institution?’ I firmly believe we can transform West Virginia and this state we call home,” Gee said. Gee said the fall 2016 freshman class was the university’s largest ever, with more than 6,000 students enrolled at all three campuses. The fall freshman also had the highest high school GPA in school history, and Gee said the new LGBTQ+ Center shows the university is diverse and supports people’s individuality. Gee spoke about Project 168, which guides student development throughout their college careers, by suggesting how students spend their time outside the classroom. WVU boasted the country’s first dean of completion as well as an unprecedented 30 national scholarships. “I do not want to see a single bright young West Virginian leave our state to attend college,” Gee said. “And as one WVU, we must leverage all of our statewide resources — from Morgantown, Keyser, Martinsburg, Charleston and Beckley — to recruit and retain the best and brightest.” Gee: “I have spoken about changing the arc of higher education … It is time to stop talking and start doing. And we are.”— WVUToday (@wvutoday) October 10, 2016 Gee said work has begun to maintain the university’s Research 1 designation. WVU recently partnered with several hospitals throughout the state, including Camden-Clark Medical Center, Jefferson Medical Center and Reynolds Memorial Hospital. Gee said WVU is helping to tackle the state’s health care issues head-on. “Last month, Dr. (Vinay) Badhwar became the first physician in the state to implant a new, minimally invasive device for treatment of a leaking mitral valve, called mitral regurgitation,” Gee said. “This procedure does not require incisions in the chest or use of the heart-lung machine, so recovery time is improved.” Gee said the university has a goal to cure Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. The university consolidated all of its neurosciences research under a new WVU Blanchette Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute. The university’s associate professor of pediatrics, Susannah G. Poe, gained national attention for training the next generation of autism experts through the Intensive Autism Services Delivery Clinic. Gee said education, health care and prosperity are connected, and WVU continues to make partnerships in order to repair the state’s economy. The university is home to a new Women’s Business Center, which was funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration, as well as the Health Sciences Innovation Center. Partnerships for workforce training include Boeing, the U.S. Army Special Forces and Pierpont Community and Technical College. ”We will listen to our communities and then together create a plan that meets their needs,” Gee said. Gee said West Virginians must take care of one another. Gee says #WVU will continue to build the best health care programs in the country on campus and out in the community.— WVUToday (@wvutoday) October 10, 2016 “This summer, among some of the worst circumstances imaginable, we learned anew how compassionate, courageous and united Mountaineers can be,” he said. The university raised funds, which alumnus Ken Kendrick augmented with a $500,000 challenge match, and Gee closed his speech by welcoming School of Pharmacy student Rebecca Berhanu to perform her song, “West Virginia Strong.” Berhanu donated all the song’s royalties to the victims of the floods.
