The U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force, as well as allies, have asked Boeing Co. for more laser-guided bomb kits amid declining stockpiles due to the air war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. (U.S. Air Force photo/Senior Airman Tyler Woodward) Posted By: Oriana Pawlyk March 29, 2017 The Navy and Air Force, as well as U.S. allies, have asked Boeing Co. for more bomb kits, including laser-guided, amid declining JDAM stockpiles due to the air war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. “We’re ramping significantly across the portfolio, not just with [Joint Direct Attack Munition],” said Cindy Gruensfelder, Boeing’s director of direct attack munitions. “But with JDAM, we’re currently on a path by July of this year to ramp to a 150 weapons a day [rate] or over 36,500 [tail kits] per year — that is two full shifts at our facility,” she told reporters during a media briefing Tuesday at Boeing’s facilities near Washington, D.C. Gruensfelder said Boeing is looking to break the 36,000 kit annual production ceiling because of international partner requests. The ramp-up began last July, when an average of 130 tail kits a day were being produced. The Air Force — flying more than half the sorties for Operation Inherent Resolve, the name of the operation against ISIS — in December 2015 revealed bomb stockpiles were decreasing in light of the air war, which began in 2014. The stockpiles were strained further when the joint force began sharing weapons with coalition partners engaged against the terrorist group in the Middle East, said then-Lt. Gen. John Raymond, deputy chief of staff for operations at Headquarters Air Force at the time. Chicago-based Boeing recently celebrated its 300,000 JDAM production, Gruensfelder said. “To fast forward to the usage rates we’re seeing from some of the warfighters … usage of weapons for JDAM in particular was 80 a day on average,” she said of Boeing’s contribution. Small diameter bomb production will also see an increase. Boeing, which makes the GBU-39 kit, currently produces 1,000 units a year, primarily based on international needs, Gruensfelder said. But the company is in contract negotiations with the Air Force to have 5,000 units a year for the next lot, with the potential of 8,000 the following year. Over time, the JDAM has come down in cost, she said, adding Boeing aims to “drive it down even further.” She did not offer specific numbers because of ongoing negotiations. The laser-guided JDAM, first delivered in 2008, is “going through some ramps as well,” Gruensfelder said. “The modularity really allows for the weapon to be assembled in the field in minutes and is very capable — both the U.S. Navy and Air Force employ laser JDAMs as well as 17 international partners.” Nearly 18,000 laser-guided JDAMs have been delivered to date, she said. Negotiations are underway with the Navy for direct attack moving target capability, or DAMTC, for the laser JDAM kits, she said. “We will be working with our supplier base to ramp even further beyond 8,000 units per year,” she said.

Photo / Getty Images On Monday night, Sir Richard Branson was holding court. In the stunning surrounds of the arched greenhouse in the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum on the site of Seattle's 1962 World Fair, the billionaire was reminiscing about life before Virgin Atlantic. The great and the good of the West Coast city, including commissioners of the Port of Seattle, the deputy Mayor and staff from the Governor of Washington State's office, were gathered, supping on dry Riesling and eating topside of beef sliders. Branson, standing on a small stage, was there to celebrate the arrival of his transatlantic airline in Seattle. But he couldn't help take the assembled grandees back to where it all began, 33-and-a-half years ago. Then, the 32-year-old record label entrepreneur was due to be flying from Costa Rica to the British Virgin Islands to see his girlfriend at the time, Joan, who would later become his wife. But his American Airlines flight was cancelled. "I didn't want to be away for another night," he smiled. So he chartered a plane to fly to the islands, found a blackboard and chalk and wrote on it, "Virgin Airways, $39 a ticket." He filled the plane, and made it to the islands that night. The next day he called Boeing's head of sales, and said he wanted to buy a second-hand 747. After months of discussions he did so, and set about selling seats to fund its purchase. "One thing; the name doesn't work," said the Boeing sales chief. "With a name like Virgin, passengers will think it won't go all the way." Continued below. Related Content Barry Soper: Abortion laws overdue for review Your Views: Readers' Letters Projected employment growth may be hindered by ageing population: report More than three decades on, he has more than proved the salesman wrong. But, after warning last week that it will return to a loss this year, the airline is suddenly facing some strong headwinds. Craig Kreeger, the US-born airline executive who was drafted in to run Virgin Atlantic four years ago, is remarkably frank. "2016 was a very good year in difficult circumstances," he says. "It was our third year in a row of profitability... but our expectation for 2017 is to be loss-making." The timing of his remarks, as the airline sets out expansion into Seattle as well as new flights from Manchester to San Francisco and Boston, may seem odd. But it would appear to be all about under-promising and over-delivering. If he delivers a profit he will be seen to have done a good job. If not, he said it wouldn't. The airline's latest woes are three-fold; the result of sterling's recent weakness, a sharp spike in the price of fuel and an increase in competition. By far the most significant of those is its new currency problem. Kreeger estimates the fall in the pound cost Virgin £50m in profit in 2016. Fewer Brits are willing to travel across the Atlantic, while costs such as fuel and new planes are billed in dollars. The fact that this has come at the same time as Virgin has repositioned back to the US, thanks to its joint venture with Delta - which took a 49 per cent stake in the business in 2012 - could be seen as slightly problematic by some. Gone are routes including Mumbai, Tokyo and Sydney, while Atlanta and Seattle have been added. Branson's chief lieutenant is more optimistic, however. "Having a strong US partner means that it's pretty easy to turn on the taps and move more Americans in this direction," Kreeger explains. It is a plan which may work. Gerald Khoo, aviation analyst at Liberum, acknowledges that Virgin has "enormous brand presence in both the UK and the US". "Virgin Atlantic has survived worse, and now has the financial backing of Delta," he surmises. Kreeger describes the US expansion as "step one" in his fight-back plan. "The same thing is true of our sales efforts in China, Hong Kong and South Africa. We're spending more of our resources to drive traffic into the UK. "The other thing we can do is keep trying ways to become a more efficient business." Fuel is also causing problems. The price of jet fuel has risen by 50 per cent in less than 12 months. "The good news is that all of the hedges we had prior to 2015 have unwound," Kreeger explains. That means costs should now be more reflective of lower prices. "All the hedges now are in the new world," he continued, but refused to reveal further details. The third threat, and one which could have a slightly more lasting effect than the others, is changing competition. Although in the past the airline has thrived on its rivalries - its spats with British Airways in the early days are the stuff of legend - it is now having to cope with low-cost carriers across the Atlantic. Norwegian is perhaps the strongest of these. Offering no-frills flights for budget prices, it is attractive for leisure travellers looking to make their money go further in the US. A quick comparison shows that flying out in October, Norwegian is charging £353.70 for a return economy flight to San Fransciso from Gatwick, compared with Virgin's £551.57 for the same return on the same dates from Heathrow. But it's not just Norwegian that is a threat. Canada's Westjet is offering flights to Toronto from £192 (Virgin doesn't fly direct to Toronto but does offer connecting flights through Delta), while Icelandair is upping its game in the UK market, offering flights to the US, albeit via Reykjavik, for competitive prices. And that's all before Level - the new airline set up by British Airways and Aer Lingus owner IAG - starts flying from London. Kreeger believes that Virgin is up to the challenge. "We managed to increase our load factor last year despite an equally large capacity increase in 2016. So we don't have to match them pound for pound but we have to get close enough that we give customers a good reason to choose Virgin Atlantic because of what they get on our planes. "We think that strategy will work in this space." He refuses to be drawn into criticising Level, saying only "that's a Spanish low-cost carrier that will probably connect with their Vueling operation". Instead the Virgin modus operandi, for now at least, is not to go down a similar route and create an airline within an airline, but to focus on its existing operation, which Kreeger says is "uniquely Virgin". "It's our job to make sure customers know whose metal they're flying on. We can meet expectations regardless." Branson agrees, adding: "We must compete with anybody on low prices as well as quality. "That's what Virgin Atlantic has done for 33 years and will continue to do for the next 33 years; but we'll do it in away that doesn't bastardise our product." Not everyone is quite so convinced. "No airline can survive unless it is prepared to adapt and change and I fear that Virgin is in danger of falling into a rut," explains Howard Wheeldon, the independent industry analyst. Liberum's Khoo is also bearish on what these new challenges could mean. "Norwegian is certainly a bigger threat in the low-frequency leisure market than the business traveller market," he says, putting it head-to-head more with Virgin that British Airways. "Passengers' expectations of service from Virgin are high," he adds, explaining that if it has to adapt to lower its offering to compete with Norwegian on cost, there could be problems. Wheeldon suggests that one solution to that may be to move more upmarket, and reduce its exposure to the leisure market, but that then could lead to whole cabins flying empty, something which no airline can afford to allow, or a drastic reordering of some of its planes to focus on its popular Upper Class and Premium economy offerings. Virgin's secret weapon in the fight against Norwegian and others is Virgin Holidays. Approximately 50 per cent of the holiday firm's customers fly with Virgin Atlantic. The holidays arm had a good year in 2016, delivering £19.1m of pre-exceptional pre-tax profit, up 75pc on 2015. Despite its successes, the reality is that Virgin is entering somewhat uncharted territory as it attempts to respond to new business models while retaining its brand value. Still, 2017 will not all be bad news. In December 2012, Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA-owner IAG, wagered that Virgin would not be independent in five years time, and instead would have been swallowed up by Delta. The loser gets a knee in the groin from the winners. With just nine months to go until that deadline, the billionaire grins when it's mentioned. "I'm looking forward to calling it in," Branson smiles. Whether he'll be able to say the same five years from now depends on how the airline he created in unique circumstances 33 years ago responds to challenges firmly on its horizon. - Daily Telegraph UK Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Two smaller aircraft manufacturers are fervently hoping that United will decide to add smaller jets to its mainline fleet. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Apr 1, 2017 at 10:10AM From late 2014 through 2015, there was growing speculation in industry circles that airline heavyweight United Continental (NYSE:UAL) would order jets in the 100-seat size class from either Bombardier (NASDAQOTH:BDRBF) or Embraer (NYSE:ERJ). This would have filled a gap between its largest regional jets, which have 76 seats, and its smallest mainline plane, the 126-seat Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-700. Instead, United went the "safe" route, ordering 65 more 737-700s from Boeing in early 2016. However, United's fleet plan and priorities have changed in the past six months. This again raises the possibility that United Airlines could order Bombardier's CSeries jets or Embraer's E2-series E-Jets in the next year or so. United mulls an order for smaller jets In late 2014, United Continental began having serious discussions with Bombardier and Embraer about buying either the CS100 or some of Embraer's larger jet models. United is revisiting the idea of buying some CSeries jets. Image source: Bombardier. Adding jets in the 100-seat range would allow United to better match capacity to demand on certain routes. Furthermore, United's pilot contract allows it to expand its fleet of 76-seat regional jets if it also adds smaller mainline planes like the CS100 or E195. This would help United retire most of its fleet of cramped, inefficient 50-seat regional jets. By late 2015, officials at both Bombardier and Embraer were cautiously optimistic that they could get an order from United. But ultimately, both manufacturers got shut out. Back and forth In early 2016, United Airlines ordered 65 737-700s, with deliveries scheduled to start in late 2017 and wrap up in 2019. This was surprising, given that the 737-700 has been around for nearly two decades and is much less fuel-efficient than the state-of-the-art models that Bombardier and Embraer were offering. Price was the deciding factor. Boeing offered United Airlines huge discounts on end-of-line 737s, mainly to block Bombardier from gaining a foothold there. (It was also probably hoping to push United back toward an all-Boeing narrowbody fleet.) United Airlines ordered 65 737-700s last year before quickly reversing course. Image source: United Airlines. However, United Continental CEO Oscar Munoz revamped his executive team last year. The company's new leaders concluded that even at a bargain price, it didn't make sense to buy outdated planes like the 737-700. As a result, in November, the company effectively canceled the 737-700 order. It converted the four planes scheduled for delivery in 2017 to the larger 737-800 model. It deferred the other 61 orders indefinitely and plans to convert them to some of the larger variants of Boeing's new 737 MAX family. Back to square one United plans to keep some 50-seat jets around longer to fill the gap created by the 737-700 order deferral. However, that's only a short-term solution. As these small regional jets age, rising maintenance costs will make it increasingly uneconomical to keep them flying. Meanwhile, the scope clause restriction in its pilot contract means that United can't expand its 76-seat regional jet fleet any further. Thus, now that United Continental no longer plans to load up on 737-700s, it is likely to look at the CSeries and E-Jet E2 aircraft families again. At the moment, United Continental is in the midst of a thorough fleet review. This will cover the question of whether it should add planes in the 100-120 seat range, according to CFO Andrew Levy. The fleet review is likely to conclude within the next few months. High stakes If United decides to buy planes in the 100-120 seat range, Bombardier and Embraer are the only realistic contenders for winning the order. Both companies will be highly motivated. Embraer is eager to line up more orders for its new E190-E2. Image source: Embraer. Bombardier secured big CSeries orders from Delta Air Lines and Air Canada last year, but it still ended the year with only 353 firm orders. Forty of those are from bankrupt regional airline Republic Airways and will be canceled. There are big holes in Bombardier's CSeries order book beginning in 2020. Given that Bombardier has sunk more than $5 billion into developing the CSeries family, it needs to sell a lot more planes. Getting another marquee order from an airline like United would be a big help in that regard. Unlike the troubled CSeries development program, Embraer's less ambitious E2 program is still in line with its modest $1.7 billion development budget and ahead of schedule. The E190-E2 began flight tests last year, and the larger E195-E2 had its first flight just last week. Both variants appear to be performing well. However, order activity has been disappointing thus far. Embraer ended 2016 with 275 firm orders, but only 125 of those are really solid. That represents barely more than a year of production. Thus, Embraer needs a big win almost as badly as Bombardier. Both aircraft manufacturers -- and their long-suffering shareholders -- are eagerly awaiting United's decision.

Business Japanese giant has a taste for Seattle firm Eltana’s bagels Originally published April 1, 2017 at 8:00 am Updated March 31, 2017 at 5:12 pm A variety of wood-fired bagels are displayed at the counter of Eltana’s Capitol Hill location. (Aaron Leitz/Eltanas) Seattle’s Eltana bagel chain has a powerful new ally in Japan. Also, some United 777s are ‘seatless in Seattle’ as Boeing supplier Zodiac lags on delivering luxury seating. And, Starbucks helps an MBA student whose website brings together people of different political views. Share story By Seattle Times staff Seattle Times business staff Eltana, a small chain of four wood-fired bagel shops in Seattle, was thinking of expanding locally and along the West Coast. But apparently, fate had other ideas. Now the Eltana concept is set to make an appearance in Japan, of all places. “It’s curious,” said Stephen Brown, co-founder and president of Seattle-based Eltana. As far as he knows, “there’s no bagel culture in Japan, let alone much of a bread-eating population.” It wasn’t something Eltana sought out.

But about seven months ago, the company received an email out of the blue, saying that the president of Osaka-based Fujio Food System — which operates about 700 restaurants in Japan and elsewhere — had eaten at an Eltana store while visiting Seattle and had very much enjoyed both the bagels and the ambience, Brown said. Masahira Fujio, president of Fujio, likes bagels and also enjoys trying the local fare when he travels for his business, Natsuko Tokaji, of Fujio’s overseas business-planning division, said in an email. “Always, he enjoys food with (his) five senses and happened to visit Eltana and was fully impressed. He never had such a tasty bagel!” Tokaji said. Fujio wanted to know if Eltana had thought of expanding into Japan. “I said we had never considered that. But thank you,” Brown said. Fujio persisted. The publicly traded company, with more than $300 million in sales, eventually had five representatives visit Seattle to spend time with the Eltana team. Eltana eventually granted Fujio a license — another thing the bagel chain hadn’t thought of doing so early in its development. Now, the plan is to build the first Eltana stores in Osaka and/or Tokyo, possibly by the end of this year. If it’s well-received, Fujio intends to expand Eltana throughout Japan. While Fujio Food System intends to keep Eltana’s core bagel concept, it plans to make some modifications to better suit Japanese tastes, Tokaji said. Launched in 2010 by Brown and Daniel Levin, Eltana has stores on Capitol Hill, in South Lake Union, on Stone Way between Wallingford and Fremont, and in the Seattle Center Armory. Brown declined to disclose sales and profit figures for the privately owned company but said its revenues are a few million dollars a year and that it is “moderately profitable.” Eltana plans to expand along the West Coast in the U.S. In the Puget Sound area, it hopes to open 15 stores, including in Ballard and the Eastside. It’s also exploring opening a site in Los Angeles. — Janet I. Tu: jtu@seattletimes.com Luxury-seat snafus slow United 777s United Airlines faces a new setback in its bid to win back business customers as a supplier’s production snags hinder deliveries of Boeing jetliners outfitted with new luxury seats, Bloomberg News reports. “Short delays” are affecting two 777-300ER aircraft with United’s Polaris luxury interiors, said Megan McCar­thy, a spokeswoman for the airline. United and the plane maker are working with French seatmaker Zodiac Aerospace to expedite shipments, said McCarthy and Doug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing. The stumbles will slow United’s efforts to woo international travelers with a rebranding campaign centered on the Polaris cabins, which offer pod-style suites with Zodiac’s lie-flat berths. Zodiac, which agreed to be acquired by European aerospace firm Safran, has also held back production of Airbus Group’s marquee A350 with delays of seats and lavatories. “It’s not just seatless in Seattle, it’s seatless in Toulouse,” said aviation consultant Robert Mann, referring to the plane makers’ manufacturing hubs and a Tom Hanks movie. “It’s a serious problem and it’s been building.” Even delays of a month or two could hurt Chicago-based United if, after a year of marketing buildup, the airline misses a chance to deploy the brand-new 777s on high-profile routes to Asia during the peak summer travel season, Mann said by phone. “You can only make the most money when you have a product in the market at the right time,” Mann said. “You are talking consequential damages.” Boeing may have to park additional United planes if Zodiac can’t provide the complex seats on schedule. For Boeing and Airbus, receiving lie-flat seats at the right time is crucial because the products can require extensive rewiring, ductwork changes and reinforced cabin floors. When deliveries run late, plane makers may be forced to remove fittings such as galleys and lavatories so the berths can be installed. It’s the latest in a series of production stumbles for Plaisir, France-based Zodiac, which warned last month that fiscal 2017 operating profit would plunge 10 percent. Delays also slowed deliveries of Boeing 787 Dreamliners to customers such as American Airlines over the past two years. At United, Zodiac seats are being installed first on the 777-300ER fleet, then on the carrier’s 787-10 and Airbus A350-1000 jets. Existing 767-300 and 777-200 aircraft also will be retrofitted with the cabins. “We’re not happy, period,” United Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz told investors at a JPMorgan Chase event in March. “But rather than just be unhappy, we’ve got people on site with the folks there to make sure that we can expedite and accelerate as much as we can.” Zodiac on March 14 revealed bottlenecks at the Cwmbran, Wales, plant where the Polaris seats are manufactured, as well as problems at U.S. factories that make lavatories for Airbus. The latest production meltdown prompted TCI Fund Management to urge Paris-based Safran to abandon its acquisition of the seatmaker. Zodiac declined to comment on United, a spokeswoman said this past week. The company said in the March 14 statement that the snags in Wales were “generating significant disruptions and delays that are currently being addressed.” The production issues plaguing Zodiac are “probably the worst that the seat-supplier sector has seen in a decade,” said Gary Weissel, managing officer with Tronos Aviation Consulting. The French company has lost market share and sales, and been sued by American for fouling up 787 deliveries — a cost typically borne by the carrier, not the plane maker. Zodiac has struggled to integrate acquisitions and hire an adequate engineering force to design its seats. “Most people don’t understand the complexity of the products, which must also meet rigorous safety and certification standards for federal aviation regulators,” Weissel said. “It’s a combination of engineering, design and artistry all coming together.” — Bloomberg News App seeks to bridge political chasm After the presidential election, it became abundantly clear to Henry Tsai, an MBA student at Harvard Business School, that he and others lived in an echo chamber where they didn’t hear from people with different political perspectives — or, when they did, they ended up fighting. Within a few days, he launched an app designed to address that chasm: Hi From The Other Side, where people who sign up are matched with others holding different political views, in order to have conversations and find common ground. And currently, as an incentive to get people to sign up and converse, Hi From The Other Side is offering a Starbucks gift card for each pair of conversationalists to be matched. Starbucks donated 300 $10 e-gift cards — something it does with many nonprofits — after Tsai contacted the coffee company. “If two strangers are having a conversation and they want to meet up in public, one of the first places they think about is Starbucks,” Tsai said. “Having conversation over a cup of coffee — it make things more friendly.” Tsai’s project, built with technical lead Yasyf Mohamedali, a senior in computer science at MIT, has about 4,500 people signed up and there’s a waiting list. When people join, they say whom they supported in the last election and whom they would like to talk to (for example, an independent might want to talk to a Hillary Clinton supporter, or a Clinton supporter might want to talk to a Donald Trump supporter, and vice versa). They also disclose a little more about themselves, such as what their hopes and dreams were when they were young — details that help make sure those who sign up want to have civil discussions and to help find existing common ground to make better matches, Tsai said. Matches are made using an algorithm. If matches can’t be found locally, the app will try to find someone elsewhere in the country, with participants free to connect by phone or video chats. Hi From The Other Side also provides a conversation guide to get the talks flowing. The feedback has been positive so far, Tsai said. A pair of women in the Bay Area video chatted, and then invited each other to their homes, he said. Others have said that after the initial chat, they agreed to keep emailing and calling each other. To make sure both sides of a matched pair show up to redeem their free Starbucks drinks, the app gives each of the two participants half of the code to redeem the card. Working together to get their free coffee, Tsai said, is also a good way “to just get people to work together, even before having a conversation.” — Janet I.

This is SpaceX’s entire MO, the whole idea behind their business strategy. CEO Elon Musk has believed for years that by reusing and recycling tech and parts, we can bring the cost of space flight down dramatically. What SpaceX is doing could dramatically improve access to launch equipment, since the company is trying to operate like an airline — charging customers for the service of delivering something to space. Right now, a launch costs about $62 million from the customer. Most of that goes to the actual cost of constructing the 230-foot tall Falcon 9. But, if you can recycle major pieces of the mission, then that’s time and money that can go somewhere else.

The facility is Boeing's only jetliner assembly factory outside of Washington state and, in contrast to the others, is not unionized. Last month, the same plane provided a dramatic backdrop for President Donald Trump's visit to the Boeing factory on Feb 17, where he promised to boost U.S. manufacturing and punish companies for moving jobs overseas. Companies in Japan, China, Italy, Sweden, France and Britain produce many of the 787's major components, such as wings, fuselage sections and the rudder. Airlines can choose engines from General Electric Co of the U.S., or Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC. The first 787-10 took off from the runway around 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT) on an initial flight expected to last four hours. The 787-10 is the second and final "stretch," or elongation, of the original 787-8, which debuted in 2011. The 787-10 seats 330 passengers in a typical cabin configuration, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8. The 787 family has been a top seller, logging about 1,200 firm orders. So far, the 787-10 has booked 149 orders from nine customers, about 12 percent of the total of firm orders. The mid-sized 787-9 has captured just over half the total. After spending 2017 in testing, the 787-10 is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The plane, which sells for US$312.8 million (RM1.38 billion) at list price and rounds out a family of three carbon-fibre composite Dreamliners, flew well, the pilots said. “We had a great flight,” Captain Tim Berg said at a news conference after the flight. The plane “performed exactly like we thought it would.” The flight was one of three initial voyages yesterday, joining the Airbus A319neo jetliner and the Antonov An-132D, a light turboprop military transport developed with Saudi Arabia. Boeing's 787-10 is being built at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, due to its large size. The facility is Boeing's only jetliner assembly factory outside of Washington state and, in contrast to the others, is not unionized. Last month, the new plane provided a dramatic backdrop for President Donald Trump's visit to the Boeing factory, where he promised to boost US manufacturing and punish companies for moving jobs overseas. Companies in Japan, China, Italy, Sweden, France and Britain produce many of the 787's major components, such as wings, fuselage sections and the rudder. Airlines can choose engines from General Electric Co of the United States, or Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc. The first 787-10 took off at 9.38am EDT (1338 GMT) and landed at 2.35pm EDT. The plane is a second and final "stretch," of the original 787-8, which debuted in 2011. It is 18 feet (5.5 metres) longer than the 787-9 and seats 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8. The 787 has been a top seller, with 1,200 firm orders as airlines use it to open new routes between smaller cities that can be profitable with the fuel-efficient 787. Airbus competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, a remake of its older, aluminum-hulled A330 equipped with fuel-efficient engines. Both jets are optimised for shorter flights compared with other mid-sized, twin-aisle planes. After brisk initial sales, orders for both have slowed, with Airbus selling just over 220 of its A330neo. So far, the 787-10 has booked 149 orders from nine customers, about 12 per cent of the total of firm orders. The mid-sized 787-9 has captured just over half the total. After spending 2017 in testing, the 787-10 is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Trump to speak at conservative forum, as some question his immigration, trade views British foreign minister to visit Russia to discuss differences Flynn did not disclose income from Russian companies, says White House Panama Papers boost tax battle, but no silver bullet Colombia mudslides kill more than 200, sweep homes away (VIDEO) Trump to speak at conservative forum, as some question his immigration, trade views British foreign minister to visit Russia to discuss differences EU Parliament rebuffs May on post-Brexit ties Top Tibetan lama abandons monkhood to marry old friend Scoot, Emirates planes damaged in collision at Changi Airport; no injuries reported Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The words and numbers are being fired in the latest push by Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) to persuade the U.S. Navy to substitute planned purchases of the Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) F-35C fighter jet with Boeing’s own F/A-18 Super Hornet and Advanced Super Hornet fighters. According to a report in Defense One, Boeing is circulating a one-page white paper urging the Navy to purchase more F/A-18s and fewer F-35Cs. The white paper is “unbranded and does not mention Boeing,” but makes an argument that the company has been making on and off for years: over the course of 20 years, purchasing F/A-18s will save the Navy about $30 billion. Defense One cited the white paper’s contents: The U.S. Navy currently plans to have a Carrier Air Wing mix of 3 squadrons of F/A-18 Super Hornets and 1 squadron of F-35Cs in 2028 transitioning to 2 squadrons of F/A-18 Super Hornets and 2 squadrons of F-35C in 2033. This leaves significant capability gaps against emerging threats and under the current aircraft procurement plan leaves the Navy with a significant inventory shortfall. … Adding additional F-35Cs will not solve this capability gap and will be prohibitively expensive. Adding Advanced Super Hornet F/A-18XT squadrons gives the Carrier Air Wing a significant edge against future adversaries and is an affordable solution to the inventory challenge. Boeing revved up its promotion of the F/A-18s shortly after then president-elect Donald Trump criticized the F-35 program as “out of control.” The Pentagon initiated a capabilities review of the two fighters shortly after Trump took office and appointed James Mattis as Secretary of Defense. If the Navy were to buy two squadrons of the new F-18s instead of F-35Cs, according to a report at Breaking Defense that cites the white paper, the Navy would save $8 billion in procurement costs and an additional $1.4 billion annually in operations and maintenance costs. There are nonbelievers in the proposed substitution. At a confirmation hearing Thursday, Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the Air Force, Heather Wilson, told the Senate panel, “As a general matter, the real thing I don’t think you can do with an F-18 or an F-15 or an F-16 is give it stealth capability retroactively.” Wilson is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and has been president of the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology since 2013. She is also a former U.S. representative from New Mexico. The war of words probably will continue even after the Mattis-ordered review is completed. After all, there are billions of dollars at stake both Boeing and Lockheed.

Published: 18:32 April 1, 2017 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Charleston, US: Boeing Co.’s newest and largest 787 Dreamliner rumbled down a South Carolina runway, nudged its nose into the air and took flight for the first time — ahead of schedule. The early take-off served as an emblem of the 787-10’s relatively drama-free development program, according to Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg. Riding on its wings are the company’s hopes of turning the 787 into a cash machine amid a forbidding market for twin-aisle planes. The maiden flight is “a big, big milestone for us and our customers,” Muilenburg said on a company webcast of the event. “We’re bringing innovation to the marketplace.” Boeing’s most technically advanced jetliner is no stranger to the spotlight. For the plane’s public debut last month, it was rolled out of the North Charleston factory to serve as the backdrop for President Donald Trump’s address at the plant. The aircraft is the third Dreamliner model, an aircraft family boasting hulls made of spun-carbon fibre and cabin-humidity levels that lessen jet lag. It’s the first Boeing plane to be manufactured outside of the Seattle area. Jet Debuts The flight marked the third maiden voyage in a busy week of commercial-jet debuts. The A319neo, the smallest of Airbus Group SE’s upgraded single-aisle jets, also took wing for the first time Friday. Brazilian plane maker Embraer SA celebrated the first flight of its E195-E2 on Wednesday. The 787-10 figures large in Boeing’s efforts to wipe away $27.3 billion in production losses lingering from the Dreamliner program’s rocky beginning. It also gives the Chicago-based plane maker a direct competitor to the sleek Airbus A350-900, which is made of carbon-composite panels. “It starts to step on the very crisp, clean new competitor that Airbus has out,” said George Ferguson, senior air transport analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. The new Dreamliner stretches 224 feet (68 meters), eight feet longer than its European rival, and its cabin capacity of 330 travellers is designed to carry five more people than the Airbus plane. But the A350 has a longer range and has outsold the 787-10, garnering 602 sales to 149 for the Boeing aircraft. While Airbus had the benefit of launching its jet years earlier, the European plane maker has struggled to speed production amid supplier shortages. The 787-10 won a key campaign with Singapore Airlines last month and could pad its order book further if its market entry next year proceeds as smoothly as initial production, Ferguson said. Cash Need Boeing is counting on the 787-10 to mirror the drama-free development of the 737 Max and 787-9, all products of a disciplined process it fashioned for new planes following the delay-plagued debut of the 787-8 nearly six years ago. The new jet is the most expensive Dreamliner yet, with a list price of $312.8 million, and its market entry should coincide with growing profits for the aircraft family. The plane maker has just started to generate cash from its marquee jet after a decade, and will need to record an average profit of about $35 million per plane over the next 779 Dreamliners to avoid having to report an accounting loss for the program. Company executives insist they can get there by combining savings from suppliers with higher pricing on the 787-9 and 787-10 models, the Dreamliners with the greatest profit potential. The variants share about 95 per cent of the same design-and-build processes, honed after Boeing’s troubles delivering the initial 787-8 more than three years late in 2011. Doing so meant the newest 787 and its tooling felt familiar to Boeing mechanics in South Carolina. “It’s almost anticlimactic because it just went so smoothly,” Mark Jenks, a Boeing vice president and general manager of the 787 program, said on a company webcast Friday. “This doesn’t happen a lot of times in a Boeing career. We have learnt a lot across our development programs.” Boeing faces a challenge to notch sales for the newest Dreamliner in a wide-body market that’s already pressuring pricing — and that’s before any collateral damage from Trump’s tough talk on trade with China, a critical aircraft market. A glut of used Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 aircraft, fuelled by high production rates and cheap oil, is stifling sales of new long-range jets, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group.

By WP Bloomberg Apr 1, 2017 at 7:54 am | Print View If President Donald Trump gets confrontational with Chinese President Xi Jinping over trade at their Mar-a-Lago summit in Florida in April, the Chinese leader will have potential allies in some surprising places — namely, Austin, Sacramento and Olympia. The economic ties that bind China to the U.S. are primarily regional and run deep. Now, with a wild card in the White House, the Chinese want even more leverage should bilateral trade relations get hammered. China’s Ministry of Commerce says it’s working to expand various investment agreements with California, Texas, Iowa and other states, deals it estimates were worth $2.5 billion to U.S. and Chinese businesses in 2016 alone. “‘A good relationship between two nations is based on close connection between their peoples,’” said Sun Jiwen, a spokesman for the ministry, citing an old Chinese saying. “Province-state and intercity economic partnerships provide an important foundation for China-U. S. economic ties.” While the outreach is a continuation of regional ties promoted for several years by Xi, it’s taken on added urgency as Trump’s economic team weighs whether to follow through on campaign-trail promises of tariffs of as much as 45 percent on Chinese goods. Part of the thinking is that making more American friends outside Washington could slow the push for protectionist measures, according to a person involved in the ministry’s campaign who asked not to be identified discussing its internal deliberations. If such cooperation flourishes, “it will not be easy for anyone to shake,” says He Weiwen, a former ministry official who’s now deputy director of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization. Attention has focused on the massive trade deficit in trade of goods with China — $347 billion in 2016, almost half of the U.S. total. But China, with its 1.37 billion people, is also among the top three export markets for 33 states. Texas oil and gas producers, Michigan automakers and Georgia paper mills would all suffer if China were to impose import restrictions in response to American tariffs. China has also ramped up its investments in the U.S. — by one estimate, they tripled last year to $45.6 billion — which helps create the jobs Trump has promised. U.S.-China trade ties aren’t solely between Zhongnanhai and the White House. They’re forged in places like Moraine, Ohio, where American workers are employed by Fuyao Glass, a Chinese-owned company that bought part of a shuttered General Motors plant in 2014. Many of China’s cross-border investments are welcomed locally and aren’t the kind of deals that draw scrutiny from the U.S. government, which reviews foreign purchases for national security concerns. In Lancaster, California, a desert town north of Los Angeles hit hard by the financial crisis, the Republican mayor, R. Rex Parris, in 2008 began courting the Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co., which is part-owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. “Saved our city,” he says of BYD’s electric bus plant in Lancaster. BYD now employs almost 500 there and anticipates tripling that within three years. “I’m telling people, ‘you’re going to have to not want a job to not have one,’” says Parris, who expects the local unemployment rate to drop to 2 percent. China’s Ministry of Commerce began formalizing the provincial-state ties in 2012, when Xi visited the U.S. and talked with governors including Iowa’s Terry Branstad, an old friend from a 1980s cultural exchange, about boosting trade opportunities. California, Texas, Iowa, Michigan, New York, the state of Washington and the city of Chicago have since signed agreements with the Ministry of Commerce, calling for regular trade visits, business matchmaking and other exchanges. The deals cover 25 Chinese provinces and cities, which sent 22 delegations to the U.S. in 2016 while the U.S. organized 14 trips to China, according to the ministry. Officials and executives from Shanghai made two visits last year to Chicago, which helped convince the popcorn maker Garrett Popcorn to choose the city for its first store in mainland China, according to a statement from Shanghai’s commerce commission. In the manufacturing hub of Guangdong, officials plan a slate of cooperative activities this year, among them setting up a regional trade office in Los Angeles, hosting a biotech delegation from Massachusetts and sending representatives to an “Invest in America” summit sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Guangdong Commerce Department said in a written statement. Bob Honts, the owner of Texas Lone Star Enterprises in Austin, Texas, accompanied Texas governor Rick Perry on a trade mission to China in 2014. Honts, whose company raises investment money under the EB-5 visa program, says Chinese immigrants have put $200 million into real estate, oil exploration and other ventures in the state. “To ignore the Chinese is like you’ve got this racecar and you’re using three cylinders out of eight,” says Honts, a Republican. “You can’t do that. We need to work with China.” Trump hasn’t resolved tension in his administration between hard line advisers like Stephen Bannon, who has called for “economic nationalism,” and such moderate voices as Branstad, who’s now slated to become Trump’s ambassador to China. Few companies have more to lose from a trade war than Boeing, which makes most of its commercial jetliners in Washington state and has collected $60.2 billion from deliveries to China since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That far outweighs the $800 million to $1 billion that Boeing spends a year on aircraft parts made in the People’s Republic, joint ventures and other operations. At Boeing Field in Seattle, many of the 737s lined up for testing are Chinese domestic carriers. But if would-be Chinese buyers get caught in the middle of a trade war, “they will simply buy Airbus,” says Gary Locke, a former governor of the state who was also ambassador to China under former President Barack Obama. The state’s director of commerce, Brian Bonlender, went to China in preparation for a visit from provincial officials that had been planned for June but now has been pushed back to September and a planned trade mission led by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee in August. Bonlender says his counterparts at the ministry in China have been more “engaged” and “helpful” since Trump’s election — and seem especially focused on finding Chinese businesses with advanced ideas for investment projects and bringing them to the state’s attention. “We’re very encouraged” by the increased outreach, Bonlender says, adding that it’s likely due in part to the “changing tenor of international engagement” under Trump.

Ademilola "Lola" Odujinrin completed the final leg of his historic journey this afternoon, landing safely at Washington Dulles International Airport. The pilot has completed the entire circumnavigation in a Cirrus SR22, stopping in more than 15 countries on five continents, returning to Washington DC, where his journey began back in September. The flight is part of Project Transcend, a foundation which aims to inspire young people to achieve their goals regardless of their personal circumstances. Lola says: “Ever since I was a child, I dreamed of one day flying around the world. We have a responsibility to lead by example and follow our dreams. I want African children to think: 'I can do this too!'." I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Air Djibouti’s Chairman, Aboubaker Omar Hadi, and Cardiff Aviation’s Chairman, Bruce Dickinson, who have supported me throughout this journey. Without them this would not have been possible.” Both formed part of a high-level delegation to welcome the historic aviator on the tarmac at Dulles Airport, including: His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Siad Doualeh', Ambassador of Djibouti to the United States, Mr. Dawit Michael Gebre-ab, Senior Director of Strategic Planning for Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority (DPFZA), and Mr. Moussa Houssein and COO of Air Djibouti. Other distinguished guests included the CEO Africa World Press, which plans to publish a book on the journey. Lola has logged over 4,000 hours as a commercial Boeing 737 pilot, since earning his pilot licence six years ago. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, Chairman of Air Djibouti, says: “By supporting initiatives like Lola’s flight around the world, Air Djibouti hopes to inspire a new generation of pilots in Africa and help to pave the way for the aviation industry to thrive in the region. “The benefits will be felt within the region, as this will encourage more intra-African trade and sustainable economic development. With the commencement of the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) set for June 2017, air travel in the continent is positioned to grow rapidly and become a key contributor to the region’s economic and social development.” Globally, the aviation industry represents a massive opportunity for African economies to play a larger role/ It is estimated that 2017 alone will see approximately 4 billion airline passengers worldwide as well as over 50 million tonnes of cargo being transported by air. Air Djibouti is a venture owned 100% by the government of Djibouti. Djibouti Ports and Free Zone Authority (DPFZA) is the governmental body overseeing ports in the country. The organization also oversees the national free trade zones, serving as a liaison between the companies working therein and other government agencies. Air Djibouti’s activities were relaunched in May 2015. The management of the airline was entrusted to UK based Cardiff Aviation, led by Mr. Bruce Dickinson. Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DFITZ) is a mega-free trade zone project in Djibouti which aims to become the biggest in Africa. The initial phase of 250 hectares will be operational by the summer 2017, with planned expansion to more than 4800 hectares. Cardiff Aviation is a fully-approved and certified MRO and pilot training company based at St Athan - Cardiff Airport Aerospace Enterprise Zone in South Wales, United Kingdom. Operating from a former RAF maintenance base equipped with 6,000ft ILS runway and parking for up to 20 narrow-bodied airliners, Cardiff Aviation can conduct MRO work on aircraft of almost any size, including Boeing 757s and Airbus 320s.

Ogg March 29, 2017 9:05 am EDT Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated marginally higher on Wednesday, after Tuesday finally broke a multiyear record for down days in the markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is still down less than 600 points from its recent all-time highs, and investors have to understand that there is still an interest in buying every pullback, even as the bull market is more than eight years old. Investors are also still looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week in an effort to find new ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, and some reports cover stocks to sell or to avoid. Color has been added on many of the following calls, and the consensus analyst price targets referenced are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Wednesday, March 29, 2017: Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) was started with a Buy rating and assigned a $202 price target (versus a $177.36 prior close) at Berenberg. Boeing has a 52-week trading range of $122.35 to $185.71 and a consensus analyst target price of $176.50. Capital One Financial Corp.

(NYSE: NRG) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $26 price target (versus an $18.11 close) at Goldman Sachs. NRG has been among the top stocks in the S&P 500 in 2017, in part on takeover hopes. It has a 52-week range of $9.84 to $18.56 and a consensus analyst target of $20.36. NRG shares were indicated up 2% at $18.50 on Wednesday morning. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Known the X-37B, the U.S. Air Force’s unmanned mini-shuttle whizzes along an average of two hundred miles above the surface of the Earth. Exactly what it’s doing up there is bit of a mystery. The space plane that would eventually become the X-37B was originally conceived of by NASA in 1999. The Space Shuttle program had failed to bring down the per-pound cost of ferrying a payload to orbit, but a smaller, unmanned aircraft using newer technologies might prove more economical. Boeing’s Phantom Works division was given a four-year contract to develop the X-37 in conjunction with NASA, followed up in 2002 with a new agreement to develop an Approach and Landing Test Vehicle to test horizontal landing concepts. Once successful, that would be followed up with an actual Orbital Test Vehicle, a launch into space, and a Space Shuttle–like landing. In 2004 NASA transferred the X-37 program to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA. The ALTV vehicle successfully tested out atmospheric flight concepts, but NASA’s OTV space plane was never built. Instead, the U.S. Air Force built its own OTV space plane along the same lines. In fact, it built at least two. The X-37 is lifted into space by a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket using Russian-supplied RD-180 liquid-fuel rocket boosters. It sits at the top of the rocket, encased in an aerodynamic payload fairing. The X-37 is twenty-nine feet, three inches long, with a wingspan of fourteen feet, eleven inches; it weighs five tons at launch. Its payload bay is seven feet long by seven feet wide—about the same as a pickup truck. In orbit, the space plane is powered by gallium arsenide solar cells with lithium-ion batteries. According to the Air Force, the space plane tests a variety of technologies, including “advanced guidance, navigation and control, thermal protection systems, avionics, high temperature structures and seals, conformal reusable insulation, lightweight electromechanical flight systems, advanced propulsion systems and autonomous orbital flight, reentry and landing.” The missions are run on the ground by Third Space Experimentation Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado. The first space plane flight, OTV-1, launched from Cape Canaveral on April 22, 2010 on an Atlas V named AV-012. The web site NASA Spaceflight speculated that the spacecraft was carrying a payload of “technology demonstration and development experiments” for the Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office. OTV-1 would spend 224 days in space. The X-37 was originally designed to spend up to nine months in space, but the Air Force quickly pushed beyond that threshold. The second mission, OTV-2 was the first flight of the second X-37B, and lasted from March 5, 2011 to June 16, 2012, a total of 469 days. OTV-3 was launched in December 2012 and returned on October 17, 2014, for a total of 675 days. OTV-4 was launched on May 20, 2015, and has been up in space ever since. What are the X-37s doing up there? There have been all sorts of theories. One theory was that the X-37 has been sidling up to the military satellites of potential adversaries such as China and Russia, examining them and even returning to American soil with them safely tucked into the payload bay. While this Blofeld-style act of orbital grand theft fires the imagination, the truth is that the X-37’s orbit is fairly easy to track and such a heist would take place literally in front of the entire planet. Other theories are that the X-37 is a form of nuclear space bomber, loaded with nuclear bombs or even “Rods from God”—kinetic energy projectiles dropped from space that accelerate to hypersonic speeds, obliterating their targets on Earth. Parked in orbit for months at a time, the X-37 could provide a quick means of delivering devastation, faster than ICBM and more difficult to detect. The last “sexy” theory is that the space plane is basically a spy satellite with the ability to return to Earth and have its optical sensors periodically upgraded. The X-37 has orbited over some interesting locations, including North Korea, China, ISIS-held territory and Iran. U.S. optical spy satellites are, however, quite large—the size of a school bus—and the X-37’s payload bay is far too small.

Zhenhai Refining and Chemical, a Sinopec subsidiary based in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, said the plant would convert 100,000 tonnes of leftover kitchen oil into 30,000 tonnes of aviation-grade biofuel a year. The fuel would be sold to airlines operating long-haul international flights, especially to countries that charged high emissions taxes, it said. Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific seeks 80pc emissions reductions on some long flights with big switch to biofuels Although biofuel does not add extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, since it originally comes from plants or animals that are part of the biological cycle, some researchers have argued it is not suitable for long-term storage and might constrict or even block fuel flow in pipelines because of its tendency to form a gel at low temperatures. In another blow to its aviation prospects, the US Air Force reported last year that jet fighters using biofuel had been infested by thriving colonies of bacterium that threatened the safety of mechanical and electronic components. But Zhenhai Refining spokesman Huang Zhongwen told the South China Morning Post passengers need not worry because the new fuel would be “absolutely safe” for planes, adding that it would also not smell like a kitchen. Sinopec, China’s largest oil company, started the project in 2011 as a countermeasure to a carbon tariff on civil aviation proposed by the European Union. The first sample product was synthesised in a Sinopec laboratory the following year but the biofuel was not used in a commercial flight until March 2015, when a Hainan Airlines Boeing 737 used a 50-50 mix of conventional jet fuel and biofuel to fly 156 passengers from Shanghai to Beijing. “The flight was a one-off; just for show,” Huang said. “The plant, however, means long-term business.” The design of the plant, to be built in Ningbo’s Zhenhai district, was near completion and other preparations were proceeding smoothly and on schedule. Cathay Pacific invests in biofuel developer to meet carbon-neutral growth targets “We have confidence about breaking ground in 2018 ... output will meet the annual demand of certain long-distance flights,” Huang said. He declined to provide the investment cost or what the biofuel would sell for. According to Boeing, a major maker of passenger jet planes, more than 1,500 commercials flights had used biofuel since 2011. These were all for demonstration purposes, however. The world’s 100,000 daily flights still stick to conventional fossil fuel. Using waste kitchen oil was a challenge, said Professor Li Xuebing, a biofuel researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, in Shandong province. “The barrels come in with all kinds of stuff: vegetable oil, animal fat, various proteins, salt, pepper …” he said. But researchers had developed sophisticated technology to filter out the “junk”, Li said. They heated the oil to over 350 degrees Celsius to get rid of water molecules, which might damage jet engines, and added hydrogen to extend the fuel’s shelf life and combustion efficiency. That added to the cost of the final product and made it more expensive than fossil fuel. But Li said the Sinopec’s aviation biofuel had met stringent safety standards. For instance, it did not form a gel at temperatures low as minus 47 degrees Celsius, and its manufacturing process should kill off all sorts of bacteria. Chinese biologist Cui Qiu seeks out productive biofuel sources “Chemically speaking, it should be almost identical to fossil fuel,” he said. “Even better, in fact, on some performance benchmarks.” Sinopec might struggle to find enough raw material, however. Chinese restaurants produce more than five million tonnes of waste oil a year, according to some estimates, but most of that goes down drains and some is sold to underground workshops which recycle it and sell it back to restaurants as cheap “gutter oil”. The use of gutter oil in restaurants has become one of the biggest food safety concerns in China. Li said he was not sure whether the refinery would be able to collect enough gutter oil for mass production. “There is tough competition,” he said.

(Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) As Trump girds for talks, U.S., China trade ties run deep Sat Apr 1st, 2017 9:42pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Bloomberg If President Donald Trump gets confrontational with Chinese President Xi Jinping over trade at their Mar-a-Lago summit in Florida this week, the Chinese leader will have potential allies in some surprising places — namely, Olympia, Sacramento and Austin. The economic ties that bind China to the U.S. are primarily regional and run deep. Now, with a wild card in the White House, the Chinese want even more leverage should bilateral trade relations get hammered. China’s Ministry of Commerce said it’s working to expand various investment agreements with California, Texas, Iowa and other states, deals it estimates were worth $2.5 billion to U.S. and Chinese businesses in 2016 alone. “‘A good relationship between two nations is based on close connection between their peoples,’” said Sun Jiwen, a spokesman for the ministry, citing an old Chinese saying. “Province-state and intercity economic partnerships provide an important foundation for China-U.S. economic ties.” Regional ties While the outreach is a continuation of regional ties promoted for several years by Xi, it’s taken on added urgency as Trump’s economic team weighs whether to follow through on campaign-trail promises of tariffs of as much as 45 percent on Chinese goods. Part of the thinking is that making more American friends outside Washington could slow the push for protectionist measures, according to a person involved in the ministry’s campaign who asked not to be identified discussing its internal deliberations. If such cooperation flourishes, “it will not be easy for anyone to shake,” says He Weiwen, a former ministry official who’s now deputy director of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization. Attention has focused on the massive trade deficit in trade of goods with China — $347 billion in 2016, almost half of the U.S. total. But China, with its 1.37 billion people, is also among the top three export markets for 33 states. Texas oil and gas producers, Michigan automakers and Georgia paper mills would all suffer if China were to impose import restrictions in response to American tariffs. China has also ramped up its investments in the U.S. — by one estimate, they tripled last year to $45.6 billion — which helps create the jobs Trump has promised. U.S.-China trade ties aren’t solely between Zhongnanhai and the White House. They’re forged in places like Moraine, Ohio, where American workers are employed by Fuyao Glass, a Chinese-owned company that bought part of a shuttered General Motors plant in 2014. Many of China’s cross-border investments are welcomed locally and aren’t the kind of deals that draw scrutiny from the U.S. government, which reviews foreign purchases for national security concerns. In Lancaster, California, a desert town north of Los Angeles hit hard by the financial crisis, the Republican mayor, Rex Parris, in 2008 began courting the Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co., which is part-owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. “Saved our city,” he says of BYD’s electric bus plant in Lancaster. BYD now employs almost 500 there and anticipates tripling that within three years. “I’m telling people, ‘You’re going to have to not want a job to not have one,’ ” says Parris, who expects the local unemployment rate to drop to 2 percent. China’s Ministry of Commerce began formalizing the provincial-state ties in 2012, when Xi visited the U.S. and talked with governors including Iowa’s Terry Branstad, an old friend from a 1980s cultural exchange, about boosting trade opportunities. State trade deals The states of Washington, California, Texas, Iowa, Michigan, New York and the city of Chicago have since signed agreements with the Ministry of Commerce, calling for regular trade visits, business matchmaking and other exchanges. The deals cover 25 Chinese provinces and cities, which sent 22 delegations to the U.S. in 2016 while the U.S. organized 14 trips to China, according to the ministry. Officials and executives from Shanghai made two visits last year to Chicago, which helped convince the popcorn maker Garrett Popcorn to choose the city for its first store in mainland China, according to a statement from Shanghai’s commerce commission. Trade office in L.A. In the manufacturing hub of Guangdong, officials plan a slate of cooperative activities this year, among them setting up a regional trade office in Los Angeles, hosting a biotech delegation from Massachusetts and sending representatives to an “Invest in America” summit sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Guangdong Commerce Department said. Bob Honts, the owner of Texas Lone Star Enterprises in Austin, Texas, accompanied Texas Gov. Rick Perry on a trade mission to China in 2014. Honts, whose company raises investment money under the EB-5 visa program, said Chinese immigrants have put $200 million into real estate, oil exploration and other ventures in the state. “To ignore the Chinese is like you’ve got this race car and you’re using three cylinders out of eight,” says Honts, a Republican. “You can’t do that. We need to work with China.” Trump hasn’t resolved tension in his administration between hardline advisers like Stephen Bannon, who has called for “economic nationalism,” and such moderate voices as Branstad, who’s now slated to become Trump’s ambassador to China. Few companies have more to lose from a trade war than Boeing, which makes most of its commercial jetliners in Washington state and has collected $60.2 billion from deliveries to China since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That far outweighs the $800 million to $1 billion that Boeing spends a year on aircraft parts made in the People’s Republic, joint ventures and other operations. They’ll buy Airbus At Boeing Field in Seattle, many of the 737s lined up for testing are for Chinese domestic carriers. But if would-be Chinese buyers get caught in the middle of a trade war, “they will simply buy Airbus,” says Gary Locke, a former governor of the state who was also ambassador to China under former President Barack Obama. The state’s director of commerce, Brian Bonlender, went to China in preparation for a visit from provincial officials that had been planned for June but now has been pushed back to September and a planned trade mission led by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee in August. Bonlender said his counterparts at the ministry in China have been more “engaged” and “helpful” since Trump’s election — and seem especially focused on finding Chinese businesses with advanced ideas for investment projects and bringing them to the state’s attention. “We’re very encouraged” by the increased outreach, Bonlender says, adding that it’s likely due in part to the “changing tenor of international engagement” under Trump.   Most Read Julie Muhlstein Cruzin’ in reverse: Everett car show will return after all Classic car aficionados learned bad news late last year, but there’s been… Mar 31st, 2017 by Julie Muhlstein School bus driver who sought girl for sex is sentenced EVERETT — A former bus driver with the Edmonds School District who… Mar 31st, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins Reverse sticker shock: Lawmaker’s car tabs going down OLYMPIA — When Mark Harmsworth went online earlier this month to renew… Mar 31st, 2017 by Jerry Cornfield Two loyal customers fight to save Snohomish’s JCPenney SNOHOMISH — A couple of women are hoping to save a JCPenney… Mar 31st, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins Everett, Cemex close to completing 100-acre land transfer EVERETT — After nearly two decades of waiting, a deal to provide… Mar 31st, 2017 by Chris Winters © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

Ryan would raise prices on “the Jose Cuervo tequila that’s in your happy hour margarita.” Three days later, a second conservative group kicked off a lobbying campaign saying it would amount to a $1.2 trillion tax on seniors and the working poor. The next day, still another group weighed in, issuing a news release that highlighted how Latinos would be “among those hardest hit” by the new tax on imports. All three organizations share a common lineage: They are part of the political network overseen by Charles D. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative businessmen. Now they are among a host of conservative organizations mounting a furious campaign against a new tax on imports proposed by House Republicans, imperiling what is supposed to be a centerpiece of the Republican tax overhaul effort. Their opposition threatens yet another rupture with President Donald Trump, some of whose advisers see the provision as a critical way to bring about tax reform while protecting American manufacturers. The battle could not only jeopardize Mr. Trump’s second major legislative initiative, but also redefine the boundaries of conservative economic policy. Much like the failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the import tax is dividing conservatives, the business sector and some of the deepest-pocketed groups funding conservative politics. Along the way, it is exposing the broader ideological divide between nationalist policies embraced by Mr. Trump and the traditional small-government movement that his election ejected from the driver’s seat of Republican policy-making. “Trump ran on a different set of economic issues than traditional conservative Republicans have,” said Stephen Moore, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation who favors the border tax on intellectual grounds, but said he had come to see it as a “poison pill” for broader tax reform. “The baton has been passed on from Mr. Reagan to Mr. Trump,” Mr. Moore continued, “and there’s no doubt he ran on a much more populist economic message.” The idea of a border adjustment tax has percolated among academic economists and in think tanks since the 1970s, as the United States has considered ways of harmonizing its tax code with countries that use value-added taxes. Central to the plan is a provision that would tax imports at a rate of 20 percent while exempting exports from taxation. In theory, this would buttress domestic manufacturing, make American products more competitive with foreign goods and encourage American companies to bring home cash they have been parking overseas. “It is a simple and elegant way to get good tax compliance,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist and president of the right-leaning American Action Forum, a nonprofit tied to a “super PAC” that backs House Republicans. Some conservatives oppose it for the same reason: In their view, such a tax would be too easy to increase, with the potential costs to Americans hidden behind rising prices. Groups like Americans for Tax Reform — headed by Grover Norquist, perhaps Washington’s most famous anti-tax crusader — have praised the border tax proposal, saying it would put American businesses “on a level playing field” with foreign competitors. Retailers that import many of their goods are lobbying against the idea, while domestic manufacturers like Boeing and Caterpillar — whose interests figure heavily in Mr. Trump’s economic thinking — are supporting it. The Koch network and groups like the Club for Growth, which for years have targeted what they call “crony capitalism” in Washington, have opposed the border tax as an unnecessary tax increase and a form of favoritism that would hurt the economy. But Mr. Trump and his team have pledged to target what they see as a more insidious kind of cronyism, including unfettered free trade that some Trump advisers say benefits wealthy elites at the expense of American workers. The dispute echoes Mr. Trump’s battles with his party last year, when the Club for Growth, a group of wealthy conservatives that backs anti-tax candidates in Republican primary races, financed a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign against him. The Koch network, uncomfortable with Mr. Trump’s proposals on trade and immigration, sat out the presidential election entirely, turning its advertising dollars and activists to down-ballot races. Both the Club for Growth and the Koch network also played a critical role in killing a proposal backed by Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In March, as the repeal vote approached, two Koch-aligned groups pledged to spend upward of $1 million on ads defending any Republican who voted against the replacement legislation. Now, some of the same groups are organizing visits to lawmakers and paying for an online advertising campaign attacking the border tax proposal.

The same 200-mile trip by train takes just as long – not to mention the £160 ticket. But am I worried? No... I’m in the Honda. True, the soft leather seats are rather more luxurious than the usual Japanese hatchback. I’d say it looks and smells more like a Bentley than a family runaround. In fact, there are four comfy passenger seats with two up front, sleek fold-down tables, plenty of legroom and side windows that turn opaque at the flick of a switch. Not that you’d want to flick the switch – the view as you approach the top speed of 500mph is little short of stunning. By then, you are cruising, whisper-quiet, at 43,000ft – that’s high above commercial airliners, let alone crammed motorways. All in all, it seems a shame the entire journey takes only 40 minutes. This, you may have gathered, is no ordinary Honda. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Revealed: Private jet caught in the wake of a superjumbo... Inside the 'billionaire bunkers' where the world's super... Share this article Share I’m sitting aboard the new Hondajet, a revolutionary plane that is, inevitably, already being called the ‘Civic of the Skies’. At £4 million, it is rather more expensive than the company’s bestseller, the £17,600 Honda Civic hatchback. But it’s a positive snip when compared to the Gulfstream G650, said to be the best jet £50 million can buy. For the price of one Hondajet you could buy 227 of the company's best-selling Honda Civic hatchbacks  Despite the unlikely brand name, Japanese giant Honda, which makes everything from lawnmowers to motorbikes and engines for Formula 1 racing cars, is so serious about aviation it has spent an estimated £1.6 billion and 30 years developing its first small jet. Despite the hefty pricetag, five British customers have already put down deposits for a plane which has been hailed as ‘one of the most creative designs in the history of aviation’. So far, just one of them has landed in the UK – and The Mail on Sunday was invited aboard to take it for an exclusive spin. I don’t have a pilot’s licence, so my chauffeur for the day was Mike Finbow, demonstration pilot for Hondajet Europe. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Badgering on!: Footage captures Badger burying a COW carcass Watch video SpaceX SES-10 makes history by launching recovered Falcon 9 rocket Watch video Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner completes first flight Watch video Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner assembly Watch video VR headset helps ostrich take flight in Samsung #DoWhatYouCant ad Watch video The HondaJet is the first private plane from manufacturer Honda Watch video Hilarious teacher gives impossible spelling test as April Fools' Watch video Live boa constrictor studded with quills after porcupine attack Watch video Woman screams as burglars break into her home and rob her Watch video Confrontation involving notorious spitting woman of Upper East Side Watch video Florida jeweler foils diamond heist and locks suspect inside vault Watch video CCTV captures milkman killing tuk-tuk driver with a BRICK In a trice we were speeding down the runway and airborne. So what’s it like to fly one class above First Class? Well, quite eerie is one answer. Despite its tiny size and the fact that it has two turbofan jet engines, each with 2,000lb of thrust on either side of your head, the Hondajet is unsettlingly smooth and quiet, even on take-off. At a fast, high-altitude cruise it’s serene. And as this is a private aircraft, you can keep using your phone until you fly too high to get a signal. Most will have to crouch a little in the 5ft tall cabin, but you don’t have far to walk to your seat. There are precision-engineered fold-out tables and the seats slide inwards to create more space against the cabin wall for larger passengers. At the back there’s a separate lavatory which, it turns out, is quite a blessing in the world of private planes. Some ‘very light jet’ (VLJ) rivals offer only an ‘emergency potty’ filled with cat litter and – if you’re lucky – a curtain to preserve your modesty. But because they add weight, a solid toilet door, washbasin with running water and ‘external servicing’ for the loo are optional extras: at £80,000 for all three. The Hondajet has a higher level of automation than almost any other aircraft - the pilot compared it to using an iPhone Honda, you may recall, has a history of rather eccentric innovations, including personal jetpacks and Asimo, the humanoid robot. But it is deadly serious in its aim to shake up the private aviation market. The company’s innovative design looks a little strange, but it works superbly. It mounts its new, low-emission jet engines high above the wings, rather than below as on your common-or-garden Airbus or Boeing. This makes it up to 25 per cent faster and 17 per cent more fuel-efficient and 20 per cent bigger inside than its older, slower rivals – huge advances in aviation terms. The design also frees up interior space for that toilet and 400kg of luggage in a rear hold the size of a small van. Like a hybrid-powered Honda car, the HondaJet claims to be highly efficient, clean – and in this case significantly cheaper to run than its rivals. The jet fuel for our 40-minute flight from Chester to Stansted with six people aboard cost just £150, or £25 a head – little more than two tanks of petrol for a Civic. Traveling across Britain in a private jet can feel like teleportation. Private aviation terminals means that your plane leaves within minutes of you arriving To that, you’ll need to add maintenance, hangar storage, landing fees and your pilot’s salary. Not that’s it’s unduly tricky to fly. The HondaJet uses the latest ‘glass cockpit’ system by American tech giant Garmin – effectively an aeronautical super-satnav – and has a higher level of automation than almost any other aircraft. ‘It’s like using an iPhone for the first time,’ said pilot Mike. The company expects that many of its customers will employ a professional pilot for business trips, but fly themselves around at the weekend. There is no cockpit door, which means they will be able to chat with family and friends. Its range is about 1,400 miles – enough to fly from London to Malaga in a fraction over three hours. Travelling across Britain by private jet feels more like teleportation than transportation. It’s a faster process on the ground too. There are private aviation terminals at all the major airports and dozens of smaller ones. Most allow you to park directly outside and walk through to your plane with no queues for security or ticket checks. Your plane leaves within minutes of you arriving at the airport. There is enough space within the jet for 400 kg of luggage - the same amount of cargo space that a small van holds  The United States is by far the biggest market for private jets, with 61 per cent of global sales. Sales have rebounded since the financial crisis, but despite making good business sense they are still held back by worries about the high cost of ownership and the negative image of private jets. Honda is hoping to change that with its new jet, which was designed in Japan and is manufactured in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Hondajet should be cheaper to operate than its rivals. And Honda is hoping that a name more associated with affordable cars and motorbikes will make its private jet look a bit less arrogant. For me, going back to easyJet, let alone the family hatchback, is not going to be easy.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) PHILADELPHIA — John L. Harrison Jr., who served as a World War II pilot with the famed all-black Tuskegee Airmen, has died. He was 96. Harrison died March 22 at a hospice in Philadelphia, according to the Murphy Ruffenach Funeral Home. A funeral with military honors was held Friday. Harrison was 22 when he became one of America's first black military airmen, one of nearly 1,000 pilots who trained as a segregated unit with the Army Air Forces at an airfield near Tuskegee, Alabama. "We were Americans, we were young, and we wanted to defend our country, just like everyone else," Harrison said in a 2009 oral history. Fellow Tuskegee airman Eugene Robinson said that becoming a pilot was a childhood dream of Harrison's after seeing airplanes in Omaha, where he grew up, and reading in a magazine about black men being trained as pilots. Robinson said it was a big dream for a black child during segregation. "He wanted to fly an airplane, like so many young people," Robinson said. Harrison saw combat in Italy during World War II and remained in the service until his retirement as an Air Force major after two decades.

He flew all types of planes, including prop fighters, jet fighters, twin-engines, four engines and sea planes. His family said Harrison crossed the Pacific Ocean more than 50 times, and the Atlantic Ocean 35 times as a pilot for the Military Air Transport Service. Harrison was stationed and traveled in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Arctic. He also served as an officer and a director for the Peace Corps, based in East Africa. He worked in the administrations of President Richard Nixon and Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh, and as director of affirmative action for the Boeing Aircraft Company. In 2007, the Tuskegee Airmen were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. President George W. Bush saluted the then-300 surviving airmen at a ceremony in the Capitol, and apologized for "all the unreturned salutes and unforgivable indignities" they had endured. Like what you just read?

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor The Hangar ⚠ Breaking: The game has changed! SES-10 mission redefines space flight NASA’s human spaceflight plans come into focus with announcement of Deep Space Gateway Curt Godwin April 1st, 2017 NASA has revealed their plans for a Deep Space Gateway, situated in cislunar space, as the next step on their Journey to Mars. Image Credit: NASA With NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) well into development, the agency has finally laid out plans for the early missions of its super-heavy-lift rocket. After an initial shakedown flight for Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) – which may carry crew – the SLS will deliver components of what has been designated a “Deep Space Gateway” to lunar vicinity. Big journey, now with details NASA presented a plan to begin building a “Deep Space Gateway” in cislunar space. (Click to enlarge) Image Credit: NASA For several years, NASA has been promoting their Journey to Mars and the role the SLS would play in missions to the Red Planet. While cislunar activities were mentioned as part of “proving ground” objectives, the agency was often light on details of what, exactly, that meant. However, in a talk with the NASA Advisory Council (NAC) Human Exploration and Operations Committee at the agency’s headquarters, Bill Gerstenmaier – NASA’s chief of human spaceflight – presented some of the first concrete details of what will constitute activities in the proving ground. After the first fully integrated launch of the SLS in its Block 1 configuration for EM-1, tentatively scheduled for the late 2018–2019 timeframe, the mammoth rocket will evolve to its Block 1B design for the launch of the Europa Clipper robotic spacecraft, and the subsequent EM-2 through EM-8 missions. Capable of lofting 105 metric tons to low-Earth orbit (LEO), the Block 1B model gives SLS the capability to deliver co-manifested payloads (CMP) in the 10 metric ton range to lunar vicinity when carrying crew, or more than 41 metric tons when in the cargo-carrying configuration. This extra capacity will be used to ferry components of the Deep Space Gateway to lunar vicinity, with the first delivery – a 40-kilowatt solar electric propulsion module – slated to launch on EM-2 in 2023. Following that, a cadence of one to two SLS launches per year will deliver habitation and support modules to the Gateway as the facility evolves into an outpost capable of supporting Mars-bound missions. Who will build the lunar outpost? Gerstenmaier’s presentation comes more than seven months after the agency announced the selection of six companies to develop ground-based prototypes for cislunar habitation modules. One of the companies, Bigelow Aerospace, currently has a test module attached to the International Space Station (ISS). Their 16-cubic-meter Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) was launched to the ISS aboard the SpaceX CRS-8 mission on April 8, 2016, and subsequently attached to the orbiting outpost eight days later. Though not nominally inhabited, astronauts have occasionally entered BEAM to recover test data to send back to Bigelow. Bigelow expects to field their XBASE (Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement) module for the NextSTEP initiative. The 330-cubic-meter habitat is based on the company’s B-330 spacecraft, though modified to attach to the ISS as a “visiting vehicle” for on-orbit testing. NASA also selected industry blue chips Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Sierra Nevada, and Orbital ATK, along with relative newcomer NanoRacks, for the second Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP-2) program. It’s not yet clear which, if any, of the companies involved in the NextSTEP-2 program will be part of the Deep Space Gateway roadmap, though one may be safe in assuming it will be at least one of the six companies mentioned above. Red Planet or Bust Phases 2 and 3 of NASA’s Deep Space Gateway involve commercial partners to help deliver hardware for their Mars-bound Deep Space Transport spacecraft. (Click to enlarge) Image Credit: NASA Ultimately, the goal of the Gateway is to enable human exploration of Mars. Long the focus of science fiction writers and space explorers alike, the Red Planet presents a compelling location to cement as humanity’s second home in the cosmos, but getting there represents one of the greatest technical challenges ever undertaken. To ensure that the hardware and infrastructure are ready for a journey to the fourth planet in the Solar System, NASA plans to extensively test the systems that will enable a crewed mission to Mars. “In 2029 we’re ready to go do a verification flight, where we essentially have the crew stay in the vicinity of the Moon to simulate roughly one year of activity on the way to Mars,” Gerstenmaier was quoted as saying, in a piece by Eric Berger for Ars Technica. Should everything go as planned, humans may embark on a flight to Mars sometime in the mid-2030s. This mission, perhaps lasting as long as three years, could make use of a gravity assist at Venus on the way to the Martian system. However, if the mission might last three times as long, why test the transportation system for only a year? “That verifies that the vehicle you will take to Mars has operated for one year, and it’s ready to go do its three-year requirement,” concluded Gerstenmaier. No bucks, no Buck Rogers Though the agency has presented a logical roadmap for human exploration, it cannot be achieved without the support of the United States government, along with commercial and international partners. “I envision different partners, both international and commercial, contributing to the gateway and using it in a variety of ways with a system that can move to different orbits to enable a variety of missions,” stated Gerstenmaier, in a release issued by the agency. Indeed, non-SLS-based support appears to be integral to the design of the Deep Space Gateway architecture, with commercial launches tapped to augment the SLS as early as EM-3 in 2024. However, all of this planning is for naught if there’s no money to support it. Though the agency has been largely spared from deep budgetary cuts, NASA will need greater support over the coming years to ensure the schedule can be met. While President Trump has indicated a strong interest in seeing human spaceflight beyond low-Earth orbit before the conclusion of his first term, he has also made it clear he also wants to focus on infrastructure problems closer to home. Without adequate funding, NASA’s Journey to Mars may be nothing more than an aspirational goal. Despite the potential budgetary issues, though, the agency has finally made public a compelling and achievable plan to realize one of humankind’s greatest undertakings: a mission to Mars.

Since the beginning of 2017, the index has added another 4.5%. The so-called Trump bump peaked at the beginning of March with both the S&P and the Dow up around 7% for the year. Any way you look at it, that’s a good start for the year and miles better than the dismal start to 2016. Whether stocks will continue their upward trend remains to be seen. Much depends on the ability of the Trump administration to deliver on promised tax cuts and regulatory changes, and we may not have anything but rumors to go on until the second quarter is in the books given comments that the target date for the plan is August. Here are the top five DJIA index performers for the first quarter. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is up 24.6% year to date. The iPhone maker reported a solid first fiscal quarter, while speculation about the next iPhone (called, variously, the iPhone 8i or the iPhone X by everyone but Apple) drove the stock even higher. Shares closed down about 0.2% on Friday, at $143.66 in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $144.50, a high set earlier in the week. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) is up 14.6%. Boeing’s stock has risen less on corporate performance than on potential gains from tax law changes. A border adjustment tax would be an absolute godsend for Boeing and, so far at least, that is not off the tax reform table. Shares closed down about 0.6% on Friday at $176.86 in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $185.71. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) is up 14.1%. The financial stocks have been on a tear since January, primarily due to expected regulatory relief from some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Shares of Visa closed down about 0.2% on Friday, at $88.87 in a 52-week range of $73.25 to $92.05. Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO) is up 12.8%. The tech sector has been a good performer among all 30 Dow stocks. Apple was the top performer in the sector, but IBM, with a gain of nearly 6%, was the worst. Not bad, as a group. Cisco stock closed up about 0.2% on Friday to $33.80, in a 52-week range of $25.81 to $34.53. Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD) is up 10.2%. The home improvement giant has led the consumer discretionary sector on solid earnings and revenue growth coupled with an upbeat outlook. Shares closed Friday at $146.83, down less than 0.1% for the day, in a 52-week range of $119.20 to $150.15.

World Trade Organization is not legitimate. The WTO does not have a permanent judiciary, but hires lawyers, often who have conflicts of interest to be temporary judges. In the Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) case, a Mexican attorney chaired the panel that ruled against United States in favor of Mexico. Unlike the Trump University case with a U.S.-born judge of Mexican heritage, this Mexican judge was illegitimate because he had a current conflict of interest. The panel chair in the COOL case was Ricardo Ramrez-Herna'ndez, a Mexican citizen who has represented Mexico in trade matters. In addition, WTO proceedings are not open to the public or the press, but should be. Court proceedings in the United States are almost always open to the press and the public. The WTO ruled that the United States could not require cattlemen from Mexico and Canada to label their beef as "Product of Mexico," or "Product of Canada." 2. The House of Representatives Voted To Repeal COOL for meat, caving in to Canada and Mexico, even though the U.S. Trade Representative was then negotiating with Mexico and Canada. Now our cattlemen have lost $20 billion because consumers are not informed about where their meat comes from. - Advertisement - 3. Country of Origin Labeling Act is supported by 90% of America consumers and farmers. You must push Congress to put labeling back on meat. 4. Canada charges 300% duties on American dairy products and chicken. Our very "nice" neighbors to the north have been screwing us on trade in dairy, chicken, beer and autos for years. 5. Mexico illegally subsidizes sugar and steel. You forgot to give Mexico and Canada notice on January 20th that we are getting out of NAFTA. 6. Army and Navy PXs don't sell many made in USA products. With a stroke of your pen, you can create 100,000 jobs by requiring the Army and Navy to buy American-made products and offer them to their soldiers and sailors. I have put together a group of American manufacturers who can supply the Defense Department with hundreds of products for their PX stores. - Advertisement - 7. The Department of Defense is dependent on Russia and China for rockets and fuel for the Hellfire missile. Changing this is a no brainer. 8. The Export-Import Bank was allowed to expire despite fact that Europe and China have similar institutions to finance exports. This puts our companies, like Boeing and Caterpillar, at an economic disadvantage. 9. China cheats at trade by manipulating currency, stealing intellectual property and by illegally dumping in U.S. It is time to start tough negotiations with China. 10. Most American drug manufacturers have moved to Ireland because of its 12.5% tax rate, including Pfizer, largest drug company in the world, maker of Lipitor and Viagra. We don't have to cut our tax rate to their level, just impose a countervailing duty on drugs from Ireland. 11. 80% percent of our generic drugs imported from India and China. At the same time, the FDA is incapable of inspecting plants in Asia. Most Americans do not want to buy drugs from India or China. 12. CVS and most major drugstores fail to put country of origin labels on prescription drugs despite federal law that requires it. I have asked the attorney general to get tough with our drugstores and require country of origin labeling. The law currently allows criminal prosecution for anyone mislabeling drugs. Transferring drugs from a labeled bottle (that CVS gets from Pfizer) and putting it in an unlabeled bottle is a criminal violation. - Advertisement -   - Advertisement - View Ratings | Rate It Chairman, Made in the USA Foundation, economist and lawyer, author of ten books and hundreds of articles.

Administrators of this reputed aviation training institute have already initiated steps to upgrade Air India's (AI) CTE into a deemed aviation university and are currently doing a feasibility study. "There is acute shortage of good training institutes and colleges to train aspirants in the aviation sector. CTE has an excellent track record of six decades in training and state-of-the art infrastructure and training facilities. We want to make optimum utilisation of the available resources and increase the capacity for training. Setting up a deemed university in aviation sector is a step in this direction," said Captain Amitabh Singh, Executive Director - Training, CTE. Capt Amitabh Singh said that MBA in Aviation, a first-of-its-kind in India, and other courses will be offered through CTE's deemed university. AI's CTE head-quarters in Hyderabad is spread over 20 acres and also has campuses in Mumbai and Delhi. CTE has six simulators, four Boeing simulators at Mumbai and two Airbus simulators at Hyderabad, to train pilots. Apart from training pilots, CTE offers cabin crew, aviation security, aircraft engineering, aviation marketing and management courses. "We will acquire ATR flight simulator by October with an outlay of Rs 65 crore to train pilots flying ATR flights. We will train Alliance Air pilots through this simulator. Right now pilots are going to foreign countries like Singapore, Bangkok and France for ATR simulator training. Indian pilots can train in India itself after ATR simulator is made available," said Amitabh Singh. Besides training Air India pilots and other staff, CTE is focusing on training pilots and staff of other airlines also. While about 150 to 200 type rated pilots are trained by CTE annually, the management wants to increase the number to 300 over the next year.

Strata Manufacturing, owned by Mubadala Development Company, said the Strata 2.0 facility will more than double its capacity and will add about 60,000 sq m. The company said in a statement that construction on the Strata facility is expected to start in 2018, and will become fully operational by 2020. The new plant will manufacture two of the most complex work packages that include the horizontal tail plane for the Airbus A320 and the vertical fin for Boeing’s B787 airliners it added. These work packages will be manufactured, fully equipped, tested and delivered directly to the final assembly lines of both Airbus and Boeing. Ismail Ali Abdulla, deputy CEO of Strata, said: "This new factory will deliver on innovative solutions that will seek to revolutionise traditional production methods in aerospace by introducing smart technologies and additive manufacturing to create a unique and seamless flow." Abdulla described the new factory as "a true milestone for the company, aligning achievements with future opportunities".

Norquist March 31, 2017 TweetShareShare Substantive tax reform will pass in 2017. Its outlines are clear and the details are congealing. Keep in mind that the tax-reform package will be passed through the reconciliation process, which requires that changes not increase the deficit in years eleven to fifty. Anything goes in the first ten years, but if the total package is not deficit neutral by year eleven, the legislation expires. This allows the House and Senate to pass fundamental tax reform with only Republican votes. No Democrats’ votes are required—and none is expected. How did we get here? Donald Trump released his tax-reform proposal during the primary campaign a year ago; his most eye-catching goal was to drive the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent. Obama had flirted with 28 percent. House Republicans were proposing 25 percent. The House Republican Blueprint quickly moved their target to 20 percent. Trump had not initially included full and immediate business expensing (to replace long depreciation schedules) in his plan. Every other Republican presidential candidate and the House Republicans led with expensing, which dramatically reduces the cost of capital. Trump adopted full expensing. Trump’s plan reduced individual tax-rate reductions, and his plan merged with the House Republican individual reform, to move the present seven tax rates to three rates: 12, 25 and 33 percent. Capital-gains taxes will be set at 50 percent of the individual rates, for a top rate of 16.5 percent. Corporate capital gains will be reduced from today’s 35 percent to 20 percent. The emerging Trump/House plan abolishes the death tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. The death tax was first imposed to finance the Civil War, and the AMT was imposed to solve a “fairness problem” that was supposed to hit 115 millionaires, and now hits millions of Americans. The United States will move from its present “worldwide” tax system—where Uncle Sam insists on the ability to tax American companies and individuals, regardless of where they work or are located. This puts American firms and American companies at a severe disadvantage. French firms and French citizens earning income in the United States pay U.S. taxes but not French taxes. Americans working abroad pay both French and American taxes (U.S. law allows limited deductibility of taxes paid abroad). The bill would allow the estimated $2.5 trillion of American earnings overseas to be returned, after paying an 8 percent tax on cash and 3 percent on fixed assets. After that, all earnings overseas could be returned tax free, forever into the future. American companies are happy to pay a one-time smaller hit and win permanent territoriality. It is the higher business tax and the worldwide tax system that makes an American company that operates worldwide worth more if it is bought by a Canadian or Belgian company. Corporate inversions are driven, not by wicked foreigners, but by destructive American tax law. The Trump/House plan ends that incentive to invert or move headquarters overseas. To “pay for” some of these tax reductions, business will lose the deductibility of net interest payments and many smaller deductions. The most controversial changes is making the corporate income tax “border adjustable,” so that when Boeing exports a plane worth $100 million it deducts $100 million from its reported income, and reduces its tax liability by $20 million in taxes ($100 million × 20 percent). An importer bringing in a $100 product must add the $100 to its taxable base and pay $20, or $100 × 20 percent. This does raise the cost of imports and reduces the after-tax cost of exports. Manufacturers in the United States like this a lot—importers less so. The border-adjustable feature raises $1 trillion over a decade. Without the border-adjustable feature in the corporate income tax, the tax writers would have to find another $1 trillion in higher taxes somewhere else in the code, reducing spending by $1 trillion in the next decade. The Senate rules insist that the budget changes be deficit neutral (not tax revenue neutral) over years eleven through fifty. If the tax and budget changes in tax reform do not keep the expected deficits from increasing from today’s expectations, then the tax package expires at the end of ten years. This is what happened to the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. Both Trump and the House very much want the legislation to be permanent. This is why the fight over repealing Obamacare was, and is, important. The American Health Care Act (AHCA) would have repealed $1 trillion of Obamacare taxes and $1.2 trillion in Obamacare spending over the next decade. It also would have expanded Health Savings Accounts and block-granted Medicaid to the states. In addition to being good health-care policy—moving decisions to consumers, and having competition, not price controls, keep down prices—it would have lowered the spending and tax projections of the future by $1 trillion a decade. This would have freed up a great deal of running room for tax reform. If Congress does not double back and revisit its failure to repeal Obamacare last week, it makes fundamental tax reform significantly more difficult. The tax reform would have to be smaller to fit inside the budget rules (a law, not a preference), since reconciliation bills or tax reforms would be temporary and turn into Cinderella’s pumpkin in ten years. The tax-reform package, like the Obamacare repeal, has been put together by House, Senate and White House leadership over the last year. Even governors have been brought into the sausage-making process—and this explains why both official Washington and the stock market have begun to see this reform as something as inevitable as anything can be in Washington.

American astronaut Peggy Whitson made history when she floated outside the International Space Station, breaking the record for the most spacewalks by a woman. Whitson, 57, is making her eighth career spacewalk, surpassing the record of seven previously held by American Suni Williams. The spacewalk formally began at 7:29am when Whitson and Shane Kimbrough switched their spacesuits to battery power before venturing outside the airlock and into the vacuum of space. "Be safe and enjoy your time out," said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet as the hatch opened. "I will be waiting for you." The goal of the spacewalk is to continue upgrading the International Space Station for the arrival of commercial spaceships in the years to come. Today's walkabout is the second in a series of three spacewalks to outfit the exterior of the orbiting outpost with parking spots for a new generation of space taxis ferrying astronauts to the station. SpaceX and Boeing are currently designing crew vehicles that will begin flying people to the ISS as early as next year. Dr Peggy Annette Whitson is an American biochemistry researcher, NASA astronaut and former NASA chief astronaut. Her first space mission was in 2002, with an extended stay aboard the International Space Station as a member of Expedition 5. Her second mission launched October 10, 2007, as the first female commander of the ISS with Expedition 16.

Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz on March 31 said the $7.6 billion deal will "allow us to guarantee the security of the Polish state." NATO member Warsaw is attempting to overhaul its armed forces by 2023 to counter what Macierewicz referred to as the "growing aggression and a growing threat from the East." Poland intensified its efforts following Russia's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014, its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, and its military and political assertiveness in the region that was formerly part of the Soviet Union or within its sphere of influence. Poland's deputy defense minister, Bartosz Kownacki, said the missile system would help protect the country against Russian missiles stationed in Kaliningrad, a Russian region on Poland's northeastern border. Macierewicz told reporters the government and Raytheon had concluded "a very important stage" of discussions on the acquisition of the eight medium-range missile systems. During negotiations, Warsaw said an earlier price of $12.7 billion for the system was "unacceptable." It said it would pay no more than $7.6 billion. The contract still requires approval from the U.S. Congress as it involves advanced military technology. Bill Schmieder, Raytheon's head for Europe, cautioned that it was not yet a done deal. "It's premature to say that it is all done," he told reporters. "But we have very high hopes that the process will proceed normally." Also on March 31, Poland's Defense Ministry said it had signed a $524 million agreement with Boeing to supply three 737-800 airliners -- two new and one used -- for the use of senior Polish state officials.

Follow us on Home Oman Region World Opinion Sports Business Features Videos About us Archives Blogs Lights go out as Oman Air joins global movement of celebrating Earth Hour April 01, 2017 Muscat -  The lights went out across Oman Air’s network of 55 international destinations, as Oman Air, the national carrier of the sultanate, joined millions of people around the world in marking Earth Hour. Earth Hour is a campaign which was launched by WWF in 2007. It has since grown into a global movement which crowdsources actions from individuals, businesses, organisations and governments to generate environmental outcomes, encouraging innovation and creativity for the planet. The airline’s headquarters in Muscat took the lead for Oman Air and was joined by all its stations across the Middle East, Europe, Asia and Africa in confirming its commitment to protecting the environment. Only Oman Air’s essential services were exempt from taking part in the initiative. Dr Khalid Abdulwahab al Balushi, senior manager – Government Affairs at Oman Air, said, “Oman Air was once again proud to take part in Earth Hour this weekend, when we switched off the lights in all but our most essential services in order to raise awareness of the need to protect our planet. “This is the seventh consecutive year that Oman Air has joined millions of people on every continent in drawing attention to the role that each of us can play in minimising our environmental impact. I would like to thank all of our staff throughout our network, not only for participating in Earth Hour but also for playing an active part in moving Oman Air’s environmental programme forward.” Oman Air’s participation in this year’s Earth Hour continues the airline’s efforts to reduce its environmental impact. Ongoing initiatives include energy reduction and waste reduction strategies, increasing the local sourcing of supplies, operating smaller aircrafts on short haul routes and replacing older aircraft with new, more fuel-efficient models.

Print Story X Print Story World April 1, 2017 Share Advertisement Space blanket floats away during spacewalk MIAMI: A space blanket floated away from American astronaut Peggy Whitson on Thursday as she made a historic spacewalk outside the International Space Station, setting a new record for the most spacewalks by a woman. The crew was not in danger due to the mishap, which occurred when Whitson was trying to fold up a bulky cloth cover, known as an axial shield, and put it in a bag. The incident briefly raised concern at mission control in Houston that the shield might come back and hit the orbiting laboratory. About four hours into the spacewalk, however, Nasa determined that the gear had drifted a safe distance away and there was “no recontact risk,” said Nasa commentator Gary Jordan. Images on Nasa television showed the shield as a small white dot in the darkness. A statement on Nasa´s website said the shield “was inadvertently lost” and “posed no immediate danger to the astronauts”. The space blanket was one of four covers designed to guard the station from micrometeoroids, and also for thermal protection.  The spacewalk formally began at 7:29 am (1129 GMT) when Whitson and Kimbrough switched their spacesuits to battery power before venturing outside the airlock and into the vacuum of space. “Be safe and enjoy your time out,” said French astronaut Thomas Pesquet as the hatch opened and Whitson made her way out in the dark, her path illuminated by a light on her helmet. “I will be waiting for you.” For Whitson, 57, the seven-hour, four-minute spacewalk was the eighth of her career, surpassing the record of seven previously held by US astronaut Sunita Williams. During the walkabout, Whitson also beat Williams´s time spent spacewalking. Williams´s record was 50 hours 40 minutes. Whitson´s total time is now 53 hours and 25 minutes. “This is a significant milestone,” said Jordan, as Whitson became the world´s most experienced female spacewalker. “Congratulations to Peggy Whitson.” The goal of the spacewalk was to continue upgrading the International Space Station for the arrival of commercial spaceships in the years to come. SpaceX and Boeing are currently designing crew vehicles that will begin flying people to the ISS as early as next year. Whitson earned a doctorate in biochemistry and served as the first female space station commander in 2008. She is a native of Iowa and is known for her quick wit, sense of humor and ease in communicating complicated science topics to a lay audience.
