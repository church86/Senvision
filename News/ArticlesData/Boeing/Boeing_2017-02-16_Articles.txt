Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. (Wade Spees/The Post And Courier via AP) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant have rejected an effort to unionize, maintaining Southern reluctance toward unionization and setting up a picture-perfect stop for President Donald Trump, who visits the facilities this week. Vote totals weren't immediately available Wednesday, but the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers' lead organizer said it's "the workers who dictate what happens next." National Labor Relations Board rules require workers wait a year before another union vote. Wednesday's balloting came just two days before Trump was slated to make the first visit by a sitting president to the sprawling North Charleston complex, where Boeing makes the 787 Dreamliner. On Friday, Trump is coming to town for the rollout of the first 787-10 model. The presidential visit marks a photo finish for Boeing, which for weeks vigorously campaigned against the Machinists' effort. Billboards, radio and television ads blanketed the Charleston area, arguing to employees why they should not surrender their rights to the union. In its campaign, Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized — a tactic that often surfaces when collective bargaining efforts arise — perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. Trump himself engaged with the company during the presidential campaign, blasting Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the union would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold in the state. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in the state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

The Labor Department will report on the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits last week. Freddie Mac reports on this week’s average U.S. mortgage rates. It will also issue quarterly results before the opening of trading on Wall Street. TRUMP-LABOR SECRETARY Puzder withdraws nomination to be Trump’s labor secretary WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s nominee for labor secretary abruptly withdrew his nomination Wednesday after Senate Republicans balked at supporting him, in part over taxes he belatedly paid on a former housekeeper not authorized to work in the United States. Fast-food executive Andrew Puzder issued a short statement abandoning the effort, saying he was “honored to have been considered by President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Labor.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined to comment on possible replacements, but said late Wednesday that the White House had seen the writing on the wall. Labor groups and advocates had criticized Puzder’s comments about replacing fast-food workers with robots and his opposition to significant wage hikes. But industry executives and franchisees saw him as a figure who would have championed their interests in the government. BOEING-UNION VOTE Boeing workers maintain South’s anti-unionization history NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing’s South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren’t immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker’s campus. YELLEN-CONGRESS Yellen defends Fed independence, banking regulations WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen defended the central bank’s independence Wednesday from Republican lawmakers who are pushing for major changes in how the central bank operates and how regulators oversee the nation’s banking system. During a hearing that stretched over four hours, GOP lawmakers repeatedly challenged Yellen’s handling of the economy and her leadership in implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a measure that President Donald Trump and Republicans have vowed to overhaul. On monetary policy, Yellen repeated the testimony she delivered on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee. She indicated that the Fed, which has implemented two modest quarter-point interest rate hikes over the past two years, is likely to accelerate increases this year if the labor market remains healthy and inflation continues to move toward the Fed’s 2 percent target. RETAILERS-TRUMP Trump tells retail CEOs people will ‘love’ his tax plan WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump met Wednesday with the CEOs of large retailers like Target and Best Buy, who have a built-in concern: They’re worried about a possible border tax on imported goods. The president has provided scant details about his own tax overhaul, but said people will “love” his planned tax reforms. He assured retail CEOs Wednesday that tax rates would be lowered and simplified in a “massive” plan that “will be submitted in the not too distant future.” Retailers called the hourlong meeting positive and productive, though they offered few details. HEALTH CARE SPENDING US report: Trend of rising health care spending back to stay WASHINGTON (AP) — Government experts say the nation’s problem with rising health care spending is back and here to stay. Wednesday’s report from nonpartisan experts at Health and Human Services concludes that health care spending will claim a growing share of national resources for the foreseeable future, regardless of what President Donald Trump and Congress do with the Obama-era health law. Health care will grow at an annual average of 5.6 percent from 2016-2025, outpacing expected economic growth. Now $3.5 trillion, the nation’s health care tab will increase to nearly $5.5 trillion in 2025, accounting for about one-fifth of the economy. That puts a squeeze on other priorities, such as infrastructure improvement. Accelerating spending is due to fundamentals such as rising prices for treatments and services, as well as an aging population. INSURERS-COLLAPSING DEALS No Valentine’s Day love: 2 big insurance deals appear off UNDATED (AP) — It was a rough Valentine’s Day for the U.S. health insurance industry. One giant merger was abandoned, another is threatened by infighting, and a major insurer announced it will stop selling coverage on public exchanges in 11 states. Both merger deals had already been rejected by federal regulators and judges, but the companies were considering appeals to those decisions. Now they both appear to be off. Aetna said it was abandoning its planned $34 billion purchase of Medicare Advantage provider Humana early Tuesday. Then, later in the day, Cigna said it is suing Anthem to kill a $48 billion acquisition bid. The collapse of one deal and the uncertain future of the other could hurt shoppers on the exchanges next year by leaving them with even fewer options and potentially higher prices. MARTIN SHKRELI-HARVARD Fire alarm, protests disrupt ex-pharma exec Shkreli’s talk CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — A fire alarm and student protests have disrupted indicted former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli’s (SHKREL’-eez) appearance at Harvard University. The former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals was invited by the Harvard Financial Analysts Club to discuss investing at the Wednesday night event. But a few minutes before it started, someone pulled a fire alarm and police evacuated the building. When the event did begin, protesters kept interrupting Shkreli’s presentation, chanting and calling him names before walking out. Shkreli was criticized after his company purchased a drug used by AIDS and cancer patients to fight parasitic infections and hiked up the price. He’s free on $5 million bail pending his federal securities fraud trial in an unrelated case. He has pleaded not guilty. Shkreli also is scheduled to speak Thursday at UMass-Boston. YAHOO-CYBERSECURITY Yahoo issues new security warning to users LONDON (AP) — Yahoo is warning users of potentially malicious activity on their accounts between 2015 and 2016. It’s the latest development in the internet company’s investigation of a mega-breach that exposed 1 billion users’ data several years ago. It’s not clear how many users were affected by the malicious activity, which involved the use of forged cookies — strings of data which can be used to allow people to access online accounts without re-entering their passwords. Yahoo said in a statement issued Wednesday that its investigation “has identified user accounts for which we believe forged cookies were taken or used. Yahoo is in the process of notifying all potentially affected account holders.” The company declined to say how many people were potentially affected. AMERICAN GIRL-BOY DOLL American Girl to sell its first-ever boy doll NEW YORK (AP) — For the first time in its more than 30-year history, American Girl will sell a boy version of its pricey dolls. The 18-inch “Logan Everett” doll will go on sale this week. American Girl, which is owned by Barbie maker Mattel Inc., says Logan is a drummer and will come with a doll-sized drum kit. It’s the latest move by Mattel to be more relevant to iPad-playing kids and their parents. A boy appeared in a Barbie commercial for the first time two years ago. And Barbie got a major makeover last year, giving the iconic doll several ethnicities and body shapes. To boost sales, Mattel began selling American Girl dolls in Toys R Us stores late last year. Sales of the brand rose 4 percent during the last three months of 2016.

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. >> Production workers at Boeing’s South Carolina plant voted today not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren’t immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. “Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next,” Evans said. “We’ve been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better.” The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker’s campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states’ lack of union presence, it’d it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state’s minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. “It is an economic development tool,” Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. “We’ll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina.” At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren’t unionized or haven’t experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers’ efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company’s board of directors, Hirsch said. “Boeing is very, very different,” Hirsch said. “No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union.” Boeing didn’t threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. “Costs are out of control,” Trump tweeted in early December. “Cancel order!” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina’s former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina’s labor department, the governor played up Templeton’s union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to “fight the unions” at Boeing. “They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can’t deliver it,” Templeton said. Asked earlier today about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn’t feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. “I think we’re doing just fine without a union presence,” he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump’s visit, the first by a sitting president to the company’s North Charleston facilities. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event,” she said.

Photographer: Bryan R. Smith/Pool via Bloomberg Days before taking office, President-elect Donald Trump made two surprise calls to the Air Force general managing the Pentagon’s largest weapons program, the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 jet. Listening in on one of those calls was Dennis Muilenburg -- the CEO of Lockheed’s chief rival, Boeing Co. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the $379 billion F-35 program as “out of control,” made the highly unusual calls to Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan on Jan. 9 and Jan. 17, according to two people familiar with the matter. Muilenburg, whose company makes a fighter jet Trump has suggested might replace some of one F-35 model, was in the president-elect’s New York office for a meeting during the second call. He appeared caught off-guard but heard at least Trump’s end of the call, according to the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing sensitive information. After speaking with Trump, Bogdan wrote two three-page memos, titled “phone conversations with President-Elect,” dated Jan. 10 and 18th and stamped “For Official Use Only,” to limit distribution. They outlined Trump’s questions about the capabilities of Boeing’s Super Hornet fighter and how it might compete against Lockheed’s F-35C, said the people. About a dozen Pentagon officials were alerted to the calls after they occurred, the people said. ‘It Creates Chaos’ Since winning election, Trump has stressed his experience in real estate as evidence he can get taxpayers a better deal on expensive Pentagon programs. Boeing, too, faced Trump’s wrath when he criticized potential spending on a new version of the Air Force One presidential airplane. But Trump’s calls to a uniformed program manager to discuss a contract that was competed 16 years ago were unprecedented and potentially disruptive, said a defense analyst. “When a president ignores the chain of command by going directly to a program manager, it creates chaos in the system,” said Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Virginia, who’s followed the F-35 program since Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contract in October 2001. “Behavior that looks decisive in the business world can unhinge a military organization that depends on order and discipline,” said Thompson, who also consults for Lockheed. Following his Jan. 17 meeting with Trump, Muilenburg said he “made some great progress” in his talks with the president-elect. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters at Trump Tower in New York. Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an e-mail, “I have nothing to add to what Mr. Muilenburg said to reporters after” his Trump Tower meeting on the 17th. Congressional Hearing Lockheed declined to comment. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Bogdan’s spokesman, Joe DellaVedova, declined to answer any questions about the calls or provide the memos, which Bloomberg has requested under the Freedom of Information Act. Bogdan may be asked about the calls when he testifies on the F-35 program Thursday before a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. He first met Trump Dec. 21 at his Palm Beach resort during an official visit by 11 military officers. Trump has shaken the defense industry -- and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice -- with his frequent Twitter posts about business issues ranging from the F-35 to sales of his daughter Ivanka’s brand at Nordstrom Inc. stores. Trump’s phone calls to the Pentagon came after a December tweet: “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Different Capabilities There’s probably not much Boeing could do to make its jet comparable to the F-35. The two aircraft have different capabilities and mission requirements. Moreover, in an effort to drive the fighter’s costs down, the F-35 has been marketed to allies around the world, with production and maintenance contracts spread from the U.K. to Australia. The U.S. Air Force, which plans to buy 1,763 of the F-35A model jets, would not fly Boeing’s minimally stealthy “fourth-generation” Super Hornet, which is designed for aircraft carrier operations. As a so-called fifth-generation fighter, the F-35 is stealthier and is equipped with more advanced radar, sensors and communications systems. Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up The Navy version of the F-35 is easier to target because it’s not scheduled to be operational until August 2018 at the earliest. The service plans to buy only 260 carrier models of the plane; the Marine Corps will buy 80 of the Navy model and 340 of a version capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings, according to the Congressional Research Service. Lockheed has delivered 26 of the Navy jets to date, with four more on order, according to spokesman Mike Rein. Pentagon Review Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said in an e-mail that “Trump seems to really like interfering in the requirements process” but “hopefully, he realizes that the Super Hornet/F-35 battle only impacts a very small part of the F-35 program.” Nevertheless, Trump is not the first person to suggest that the F/A-18E/F could replace some F-35s. The Pentagon’s first Quadrennial Defense Review in May 1997 said that “should Joint Strike Fighter development be delayed additional F/A-18E/Fs” beyond planned quantities “may be added later as appropriate to sustain planned forces.” Defense Secretary James Mattis in a memo last month translated Trump’s tweet into action when he asked Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work to oversee a review that “compares F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assesses the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements (an advanced Super Hornet) can be made in order to provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative.” Under current plans, the Pentagon is scheduled to increase overall purchases of the F-35 in the coming fiscal year to 70 from 63 this year. Purchases would grow to 80 aircraft in fiscal 2019, and there’s a pending “block buy” of 450 aircraft after that. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Picture: REUTERS Chicago/Dallas/Washington — After a rocky start, Boeing CE Dennis Muilenburg appears to have gained the ear of President Donald Trump. The US aircraft manufacturer was among Trump’s first post-election corporate targets, and a tweet about soaring Air Force One costs briefly tanked the firm’s shares in December. But the Twitter tirade also gave Muilenburg an opening to press the case of the largest US exporter — and the 1.5-million jobs at its jet-equipment suppliers — in meetings with Trump. The CE’s entreaties seem to have worked. Trump has emerged as a booster for Boeing’s F/A-18 fighter jets and voiced support to legislators for a key Boeing initiative: reopening the US Export-Import Bank for major deals. Trump will attend an event at Boeing’s South Carolina factory on Friday showcasing the newest 787 Dreamliner where he is expected to make an announcement about the federal export credit agency. "The supply chain for Boeing doesn’t just run through the state of Washington," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies. The Ex-Im Bank is "a door opener". Donald Trump tweet reignites the Boeing vs Lockheed dogfight Supporting the lender would put Trump at odds with some Republicans, who view the bank as providing corporate welfare. Boeing Bank Ex-Im has been dubbed the "Bank of Boeing" for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by airlines unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it has been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10m because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a Senate committee since 2015. Trump was committed to re-establishing a quorum on the bank’s board, US Senator Heidi Heitkamp said. That is needed to allow the bank to lend more as it faces a backlog of as much as $30bn in projects. Boeing and General Electric have argued without the financing, they would face a competitive disadvantage against companies in Europe, Canada, Brazil, China and Russia, who do not face similar restrictions. Boeing had lost or faced delays on three commercial satellite sales because of the lack of export credit, said Kate Bernard, a spokeswoman for the manufacturer.

Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

By DougCameron Workers at Boeing Co.’s large plane-making facility in South Carolina on Wednesday voted against joining a union in a move that could affect where the company manufactures future aircraft models. Seventy-four percent of the nearly 3,000 hourly staff at Boeing’s plants around Charleston, which assemble 787 Dreamliner jets and other parts, voted not to recognize the International Association of Machinists, Boeing BA, +0.47%   said in a statement. The hard-fought campaign drew criticism from both sides for the tactics employed to sway workers. The Charleston plants are the sole assembly facility for the new 787-10, the largest member of the Dreamliner family, which is set to be rolled out Friday at a ceremony attended by President Donald Trump.

According to a company statement, more than 2,000 of the nearly 3,000 Boeing workers at the plant eligible to vote in the closely watched election voted against the union, and only a bit more than 700 members voted yes. "We will continue to move forward as one team," said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina. "We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team." Manufacturers have been drawn to the South because the region is strongly anti-union. Less than 2% of South Carolina workers are union members, the lowest unionization rate in the nation. Boeing (BA) spent billions to open its North Charleston plant, arguing it needs to assure customers who buy the 787 Dreamliner, which is built there, that the plant wouldn't go on strike. Related: Trump move on Iran could cost jobs at Boeing A win would have given the Machinists, who represent most Boeing factory workers, even more leverage over Boeing in future labor talks. The loss could further encourage other manufacturers to open union-free plants in the South. The vote was seen as an uphill battle for the union, which dropped plans for a vote last year. About 40% to 50% of organizing votes fail. "Boeing management spent a lot of money to make sure power and profits remained concentrated at the very top," said Mike Evans, the union's chief organizer. The union will now have to wait at least a year to petition for another representation vote. "The IAM remains committed to getting Boeing South Carolina workers the respect, wages and consistency they deserve." Boeing's South Carolina assembly line, where workers voted Wednesday not to join the Machinist union. The plant will get additional attention this week as President Donald Trump plans to visit the plant Friday to mark the completion of the first 787-10, the newest version of the Dreamliner. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," said Robinson-Berry. Wages were a key issue in the vote. The union says South Carolina workers earn about $10 an hour less than union members at Boeing's Washington state plants. Related: Boeing pitches China facility as Trump-friendly For its part, Boeing says pay scales are driven by wages in the local market, and that the South Carolina plant already pays better than a union-represented Boeing plant in Alabama.

Results of a vote released Wednesday show workers have rejected union representation. Bruce Smith/AP Updated 10 p.m. ET The International Association of Machinists says workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant have voted not to unionize. In a video on the union's Facebook page, lead organizer Mike Evans says the workers have decided "at this time they don't need representation," and he says the IAM respects the process. He tells workers that the company should "pay attention to your issues and make Boeing a better place, not just for a few, but for everybody." Boeing released a statement saying that 74 percent of employees who voted rejected the union, adding: ""We will continue to move forward as one team," said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of BSC. "We have a bright future ahead of us and we're eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team and to developing new opportunities. "Friday we will mark the most recent incredible accomplishment in the proud history of the BSC team with the rollout of the first 787-10," said Robinson-Berry. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event." President Trump is expected to visit the plant on Friday for that event.

The IAM reports it represents 35,000 workers at 24 Boeing locations around the country." "The state has the lowest union membership rate in the country," Alexandra reported for NPR's All Things Considered. "Around Charleston, Boeing [had] billboards, T-shirts and ads criticizing the IAM.

An artist’s conception shows NASA’s Orion capsule in flight. (NASA Illustration) NASA and its commercial partners say they’re studying the possibility of sending astronauts beyond the moon years earlier than planned, by putting a crew on the first flight of the space agency’s heavy-lift Space Launch System. The NASA study, sparked in part by a desire for the Trump administration to do something dramatic in space during its first term, would consider whether such a flight could occur in 2019 or 2020. The current plan calls for an uncrewed test flight of the SLS and NASA’s Orion capsule in late 2018, known as Exploration Mission-1 or EM-1. That mission would followed by a crewed test flight called EM-2 in the 2021-2023 time frame. In a statement, NASA said acting administrator Robert Lightfoot asked Bill Gerstenmaier, the agency’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations, to assess whether the first crew could ride on EM-1 instead of EM-2. “The study will examine the opportunities it could present to accelerate the effort of the first crewed flight and what it would take to accomplish that first step of pushing humans farther into space,” NASA said. Gerstenmaier discussed the study with NASA’s commercial Orion/SLS partners at a conference today in Washington, D.C. NASA representatives declined to specify how long the study would take, but some of the reports that emerged after Gerstenmaier’s talk suggested a 30-day time frame. Boeing, Lockheed Martin on board EM-1’s current mission plan calls for sending the Orion capsule on a trajectory beyond the moon, most likely into lunar orbit, and then back to Earth. No lunar landing would be attempted. The trip would be similar to Apollo 8’s “Earthrise” mission in 1968. The current plan calls for EM-2 to go beyond the moon as well. The revised plan would force NASA and its partners to ensure that EM-1 had all the safety and life support features required for human spaceflight. That’s why EM-1 would have to fly somewhat later that currently planned. The crewed Orion/SLS flight would mark the first trip for humans beyond Earth orbit since NASA’s last Apollo moon mission in 1972. There’s another historical angle if the round-the-moon flight were to take place in 2019, in that it would come during the golden anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, NASA’s two main commercial partners in the multibillion-dollar Orion/SLS program, both said they’d look into accelerating their schedules. Boeing is the prime contractor for the SLS rocket, while Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the Orion crew capsule. “The possibility of NASA accelerating the timeline to put humans into the vicinity of the moon and onto Mars is exciting,” Boeing spokeswoman Kelly Kaplan said in an email. “Safety of the crew is most important, so of course there will be many factors we will consider as we assess the feasibility of adding crew to EM-1. We applaud NASA’s bold path forward in this transition time, and we’re proud to be a part of the journey to Mars.” Lockheed Martin is also on board with the study, said Allison Miller, a spokeswoman for the company’s Orion program. “We’ll look at accelerating remaining crew system designs, as well as potential technical and schedule challenges and how to mitigate them,” she said in an email. Trump’s space strategy Word of the potential schedule shift comes after weeks of speculation over how President Donald Trump and his advisers might change the focus of the nation’s space program. Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, had initially set NASA’s sights on sending astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid in the mid-2020s, followed by trips to Mars and its moons in the 2030s. Those plans have morphed over the years, and at the same time, billionaire-backed commercial ventures such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin have upped the ante. Last fall, Musk unveiled plans to send settlers to Mars in the 2020s, and Blue Origin executives said their long-term vision for spaceflight included trips to the moon and Mars as well. Some of Trump’s advisers reportedly pressed for an accelerated campaign to send astronauts on trips around the moon, and put commercial robotic landers on the moon’s surface, by 2020. One scenario even called for an “internal competition” between NASA’s traditional industrial partners and more recent market entrants such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.

Lightfoot is serving in a caretaker role – but he is regarded as one of the prospects for the official appointment, along with U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla. Speeding up the schedule for sending astronauts beyond Earth orbit carries significant risks. It would be highly unusual for humans to get on board for the first test launch of a new type of rocket. Contractors would have to shorten their time frame for testing the hardware needed for crewed flight, ranging from launch abort systems to life support systems. Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee who now runs the independent NASA Watch website, said in a posting that the schedule speed-up looked like a “Hail Mary pass” for the expensive SLS program. “To move this rather important milestone up now in the midst of dueling and ever-shifting policy directions – for no clearly articulated reason other than politics – starts to smell like launch fever to me,” he wrote.

On Wednesday, Boeing production workers will vote on whether to join the Machinists union. Bruce Smith AP/File photo i The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Workers at a Boeing plant in South Carolina have rejected an effort by the Machinists to unionize a plant. The National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday released the results of the vote. Nearly 3,000 production workers were eligible to vote in the balloting at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. For weeks, both Boeing and the union bought billboards, print ads, television and radio ads, urgings workers to vote for or against the unionization effort. The Machinists initially tried to unionize the plant in 2015 but called off that vote because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Boeing plant for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 6:30 p.m. Counting is underway for a vote that will determine if thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will be represented by a union. Ballots are being counted Wednesday evening for the vote on representation by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Nearly 3,000 workers were eligible to participate in Wednesday's voting. Union officials said they expected results later in the evening. The election comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 4:35 p.m. Voting is wrapping up for Boeing workers in South Carolina considering if they want to be unionized. Polling places were scheduled to close at 4:30 p.m. Union officials say they expect results later this evening. Nearly 3,000 workers were expected to make a decision on whether they should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 1:20 p.m. An afternoon round of balloting has begun among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want to be unionized. Polls are open for several hours Wednesday afternoon at several locations on the aviation giant's manufacturing facilities in North Charleston. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to participate in the vote determining if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union petitioned for a vote in 2015 but withdrew it because of what the Machinists called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. President Donald Trump is expected to visit Boeing on Friday for the rollout of the first 787-10 Dreamliner from the South Carolina campus. A year ago, then-candidate Trump warned during a campaign appearance that, unless he won, Boeing would soon ship all its jobs from South Carolina to China, where Boeing had agreed to open a facility. ___ 10:45 a.m. South Carolina's chief executive says Boeing's workers should reject an effort to unionize the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Gov. Henry McMaster said "there is no reason to put anyone in the middle" between Boeing and its workers. The Republican governor hasn't said much publicly about the vote, which was announced last month by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. McMaster has only been in office a few weeks, after former Gov. Nikki Haley accepted a job as ambassador to the United Nations. He was an early backer of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and is expected to join the president on Friday when he visits South Carolina for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 9:30 a.m. The morning round of voting has concluded among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. The first of two voting shifts wrapped up around midmorning at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Machinists spokesman Jonathan Battaglia says the union feels Boeing workers are "ready to make history" with the vote. Boeing came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 6:45 a.m. Voting is underway as thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant decide if they want to unionize. Polling places opened early Wednesday morning throughout the aviation giant's sprawling facility in North Charleston. A second wave of voting takes place this afternoon. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The global aviation giant came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 4:10 a.m. Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding if they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. If successful, Wednesday's balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas. And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing.

Women in science and engineering were once hidden figures. You may have seen the movie highlighting their struggles. CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) - Workers at Boeing South Carolina have voted not to unionize under the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.  According to Boeing officials, 74% of total votes cast on Wednesday were against joining the IAM.  Officials say there were 2097 votes for no and 731 votes for yes.  Both Boeing and the union spoke out about the results, and both said they’re looking ahead to the future. "The outcome is not what I was hoping for, but this is the labor movement," said  IAM lead organizer Mike Evans."It isn't easy and we will continue to do our best to help workers in the workplace." “We will continue to move forward as one team,” said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina following the vote. “We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team and to developing new opportunities." Live 5 News The vote was held under the oversight of the National Labor Relations Board and 3,000 employees were eligible to have their say.   Union spokespersons also said there were no voting irregularities. Many advertisements have been run from both sides.  Proponents said employees would get respect on the job, better wages and consistency in unionizing. "Workers at Boeing deserve to be treated fairly and they deserve to be treated with respect," Lead IAM organizer Mike Evans said when he announced the vote last month. "Over the past year and a half, management at Boeing has repeatedly failed to make improvements they promised workers. Instead, workplace policies remain inconsistent and raises remain subjective. Boeing workers deserve better than that."  Boeing wanted employees to vote no, citing expensive union dues and saying IAM   does not have the workers' best interests at heart. Saying "no” would allow workers to keep their voice and their direct working relationship with the company, according to Boeing.  "Boeing believes firmly that a union is not in the best interest of Boeing South Carolina," Boeing Vice President and General Manager Joan Robinson-Berry said at a press conference hours after IAM's announcement. "That's been our consistent position and we will never change that."  Voters marked their ballots in secret, according to the National Labor Relations Board.  RIGHT NOW: Boeing SC workers have begun casting secret ballots on whether to unionize: https://t.co/phPrdgHrc3 #chsnews #scnews pic.twitter.com/1PxjhmGAo0— Live5News (@Live5News) February 15, 2017 The ten polling locations opened at various times, according to the election notice posted on Boeing's website.  The first time the IAM scheduled a union vote at Boeing SC was in 2015.  However, union officials said they canceled the vote because of a "toxic environment."  According to officials, they came to the decision following home visits with more than 1,700 Boeing workers.  Moving forward, Boeing will roll out its first 787-10 on Friday.   “Friday we will mark the most recent incredible accomplishment in the proud history of the BSC team with the rollout of the first 787-10,” said Robinson-Berry. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event.” President Donald Trump is expected to be in attendance at the ceremony.  Copyright 2017 WCSC.

Ware   |   Feb. 15, 2017 at 6:51 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo Feb. 15 (UPI) -- Thousands of Boeing production workers voted Wednesday whether to organize, in what's seen by many as a landmark event for American workers in the South. The Chicago-based aerospace company spent billions to open the production facility in North Charleston, which assembles the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing chose South Carolina for the plant's location in part because it wanted to assure airlines that ordered the new aircraft that there is little chance of a strike. South Carolina has the fewest organized employees in the United States -- with just 1.6 percent belonging to a union. More than 3,000 Boeing workers were eligible to vote in the election. The polls closed at 4:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, and the results were expected later. The National Labor Relations Board is orchestrating the vote, which was requested by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which has more than 700,000 current and retired members. The union, which seeks to represent the Boeing workers, held a "vote yes" rally on Monday. Boeing has been running television and radio advertisements to advise workers against unionizing. "After weeks of Boeing management scare tactics, intimidation and television and radio propaganda ads, 3,000 workers at the South Carolina 787 assembly plants will have their chance to join the IAM," the union said in a news release before Wednesday's vote. "[The] rally was held [Monday] to give supporters a chance to come together and get factual answers to the lies Boeing management has been spreading." Boeing, though, has said its South Carolina workers already earn better wages than some of its union employees in the South. If the union succeeds, it will have to negotiate a contract with the aerospace company to cover the workers. If it fails, it could attempt another vote next year. President Donald Trump plans to visit the Boeing plant on Friday.

Teal Group forecasts demand for big jets will fall. AFP / STR An Airbus A380, the world's largest jetliner, at Le Bourget airport near Paris. Backlogs should help cushion a drop-off in demand for twin-aisle jets. Pascal Rossignol / Reuters Boeing and Airbus jetliner demand to fall but military aircraft to cushion blow February 16, 2017 Updated: February 16, 2017 10:41 AM Related Defence sector in focus ahead of Idex and Navdex in Abu Dhabi next week Boeing’s new stretched 737 jetliner set for maiden flight Airbus left red-faced as failure of new military plane strands defence chief China’s new passenger jetliner to fly by the summer Related Defence sector in focus ahead of Idex and Navdex in Abu Dhabi next week Boeing’s new stretched 737 jetliner set for maiden flight Airbus left red-faced as failure of new military plane strands defence chief China’s new passenger jetliner to fly by the summer Topics: Boeing Airports Demand for jetliners made by Boeing and Airbus is in decline but no big bust for the industry lies ahead, a leading analyst said, noting that military aircraft sales should rise. "The great boom is over," Richard Aboulafia, analyst at Teal Group, said at an industry conference near Seattle. "But I don’t see a bust cycle" unless there’s a trade war, he added. An industry slowdown has implications for investors and suppliers trying to anticipate the flow of orders as a guide the capacity they will need to meet changes in aircraft production. Multi-year backlogs of jetliner orders at both big plane makers will cushion the downturn, along with rising sales of military aircraft, especially spy and fighter planes as defence spending is expected to rise at least initially under the US president Donald Trump, he added. Higher interest rates and a possible border tax on imports could hurt the US aerospace industry, however, by causing the dollar to strengthen further, Mr Aboulafia said. Also, the risk of a major trade dispute is as high as at any time since Second World War, he added. A US trade dispute with China would likely benefit the European plane maker Airbus since China could easily retaliate against the US by curbing orders of Boeing planes, Aboulafia said. In the commercial aircraft market, a planned boost in output of single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft is likely to continue. The two plane makers plan to increase output by more than 30 per cent through the end of the decade and need the income from these high-volume assembly lines to hit their financial targets.

REUTERS/Randall Hill prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C.: Boeing Co handily defeated a union drive by workers at the company's aircraft factory in South Carolina on Wednesday, as almost three-quarters of workers at the plant who voted rejected union representation. The secret ballot vote, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at polling locations throughout the North Charleston plant, was the first for Boeing and a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The NLRB said 74 percent of the 2,828 workers who cast ballots voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). “We will continue to move forward as one team,” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president in charge of Boeing South Carolina, said in the post. In a statement, IAM lead organizer Mike Evans said: “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation.” The results come just before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit Boeing's South Carolina plant on Friday, as the world's largest planemaker rolls out the first completed 787-10, the largest version of its Dreamliner. Any remarks Trump makes at the factory could bring into sharper focus his views on organized labor before he chooses appointees to fill vacant seats on the five-member NLRB. "I think he will cheer the 'no' vote," said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California Berkeley specializing in labor and the global economy. "I think he's going to make the case that he wants to see the plant succeed and do everything to create a more competitive environment." MORALE BLOW The loss was not seen as a surprise in a state with a strongly anti-union culture. South Carolina is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is highest with 23.6 percent. "It's a blow, but largely to morale more than anything practical," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. The vote preserves the status quo on the factory floor at Boeing in South Carolina and is unlikely to alter relations with the 30,000 IAM members at Boeing's factories near Seattle, Shaiken said. Boeing ran a hardball campaign against the IAM in South Carolina, which has been trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. The IAM canceled a vote at the Boeing plant in April 2015, claiming political interference from state officials. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. "Haley said South Carolina doesn't want or need unions," said Shaiken. "That creates an atmosphere where to vote 'yes' - in the minds of many workers - puts them at risk." The 26 percent of workers who supported the union showed the IAM had established a foothold, he added. "Can they build on it? That will be their challenge going forward." Under NLRB rules, the union must wait a minimum of 12 months before petitioning for another election. Boeing said the union was not needed because it is divisive, picks fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers out on costly strikes. President of the Seattle-area IAM local, Jon Holden, said Boeing's anti-union campaign was not a surprise and followed a strategy they had seen before. The Chicago-based company produced videos that aired heavily on local TV stations and were also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, told Reuters in an interview. Boeing invested US$750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent US$1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent.

Boeing, it just so happens, is a big fan of something called the Export-Import Bank. It's a trade-promoting agency that some Republicans have worked very hard to kill.  In fact, some senators have kept the bank only partially functional for the past year by refusing to approve people to run it.

Results of a vote released Wednesday show workers have rejected union representation. Updated 10 p.m. ET The International Association of Machinists says workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant have voted not to unionize. In a video on the union's Facebook page, lead organizer Mike Evans says the workers have decided "at this time they don't need representation," and he says the IAM respects the process. He tells workers that the company should "pay attention to your issues and make Boeing a better place, not just for a few, but for everybody." Boeing released a statement saying that 74 percent of employees who voted rejected the union, adding: ""We will continue to move forward as one team," said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of BSC. "We have a bright future ahead of us and we're eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team and to developing new opportunities. "Friday we will mark the most recent incredible accomplishment in the proud history of the BSC team with the rollout of the first 787-10," said Robinson-Berry. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event." President Trump is expected to visit the plant on Friday for that event. Alexandra Olgin of South Carolina Public Radio reported that the IAM had promised "nearly 3,000 workers at Boeing respect, wages and consistency. The IAM reports it represents 35,000 workers at 24 Boeing locations around the country." "The state has the lowest union membership rate in the country," Alexandra reported for NPR's All Things Considered. "Around Charleston, Boeing [had] billboards, T-shirts and ads criticizing the IAM. And the union [countered] with its own rallies and ads." Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

In the past three weeks, Trump has: staffed the White House, sent a dozen Cabinet nominees to the Senate, browbeat Boeing into cutting its price on a government contract, harangued American CEOs into keeping their plants in the United States, imposed a terrorist travel ban, met with foreign leaders and nominated a Supreme Court justice, among many other things. (And still our hero finds time to torment the media with his tweets!) What have congressional Republicans been doing? Scrapbooking? More than 90 percent of congressional Republicans kept their jobs after the 2016 election, so you can cross “staffing an entire branch of government” off the list. Only the Senate confirms nominees, which they’ve been doing at a snail’s pace, so they’ve got loads of free time — and the House has no excuse at all. Where’s the Obamacare repeal? Where are the hearings featuring middle-class Americans with no health insurance because it was made illegal by Obamacare? The House passed six Obamacare repeals when Obama was president and there was no chance of them being signed into law. Back then, Republicans were full of vim and vigor! But the moment Trump became president, the repeals came to a screeching halt. After the inauguration (gigantic!), House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put out a plan for repealing Obamacare … in 200 days. They actually gave their legislative agenda this inspiring title: “The Two Hundred Day Plan.” TWO HUNDRED DAYS! What was in the last six Obamacare repeals? If we looked, would we find “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” carefully typed out 1 million times? Seriously, what does Paul Ryan’s day look like? This is the Silence of the Lambs Congress. They’re utterly silent, emerging from the House gym or their three-hour lunches only to scream to the press about Trump. To the delight of the media, these frightened little lambs are appalled by nearly everything Trump does. They’ve been especially throaty about Trump’s temporary travel ban from seven terrorist nations — as designated by the Obama administration (and by everybody else who hasn’t been in a deep freeze in a Finnish crevasse for the past decade). Just like the six Obamacare repeals, a refugee ban was already written and passed by one house of Congress. Then suddenly: the Silence of the Lambs. McConnell and Ryan are hiding under their desks, as Trump is being attacked from every side. Way, way back, 15 long months ago, congressional Republicans didn’t have a problem with a total ban on Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Not for a mere three months like Trump’s order — but permanently, unless the director of the FBI, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence personally certified that a particular refugee posed no danger to the U.S. That bill passed the House with an overwhelming, veto-proof majority, including 47 Democrats. Then it went to the Senate to die. But when President Trump imposed a comparatively mild three-month ban on immigrants from Syria, Iraq and five other terrorist nations, the same Republicans who had voted for a limitless ban on refugees whiled away their days calling reporters to denounce Trump. A little more than a year ago, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, bragged in a press release that he had introduced the House’s refugee ban, calling it a bill that would “protect Americans from ISIS.” But when it came to Trump’s three-month pause, McCaul told the Post that Trump’s order “went too far.” I guess that ISIS problem just sort of faded away. (Or maybe we should check with Mrs. McCaul, inasmuch as it’s her family money that makes Rep. McCaul one of the richest members of Congress.) Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., who voted for the House’s permanent refugee ban, demanded that Trump immediately rescind his travel ban, babbling on about the “many, many nuances of immigration policy” — which he must have learned about on one of his congressional jaunts to a Las Vegas casino. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., said that Trump’s order “overreaches and undermines our constitutional system.” Evidently, he was suddenly struck by the realization that it’s “not lawful to ban immigrants on the basis of nationality,” despite having voted to ban refugees on the basis of nationality just 15 months earlier. (I’m OK with this, provided the Syrians, Somalis and Yemenis are sent to live on Justin’s street after being told about his support for gay marriage.) Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Ben Sasse, R-Neb., both rushed to The Washington Post with this refreshingly original point: NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS! Why, thank you, senators! Where would the GOP be without you? The Post also quoted spokesmen — spokesmen! — for Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina complaining about not having been briefed on Trump’s order. The senators themselves were far too busy to talk to the press because they were — wait, what were they doing again? Words With Friends? Decoupage? Since the election, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., has been mostly occupied polishing his anti-Trump quotations to get a pat on the head from an admiring media. He complained about Trump’s order, saying it was “poorly implemented” and that he had to find out about it from reporters. (I wonder why.) This is the moment we’ve been waiting for our entire lives, but Republicans in Congress refuse to do the people’s will. Their sole, driving obsession is to see Trump fail. I am not presently calling for these useless, narcissistic, Trump-bashing Republicans to be defeated in their re-election bids, but they’re on my Watch List. To be cleared, they can start by getting off the phone with The Washington Post and passing one of those six Obamacare repeal bills.

Carolina Boeing Nearly 3,000 workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017, not to join the Machinists. The state has only 52,000 unionized workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. (The Associated Press) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press Follow on Twitter on February 15, 2017 at 7:22 PM, updated February 15, 2017 at 7:49 PM comments NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under National Labor Relations Board rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. -The Associated Press Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union claimed was a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in the state. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the facility. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Boeing workers maintain South's anti-unionization history World by Meg Kinnard, The Associated Press Posted Feb 15, 2017 7:36 pm MST Last Updated Feb 16, 2017 at 1:40 am MST FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2016 file photo, An engine and part of a wing from the 100th 787 Dreamliner to be built at Boeing of South Carolina's North Charleston, S.C., facility are seen outside the plant. The morning round of voting has concluded Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017, among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. (Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. – Production workers at Boeing’s South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren’t immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. “Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next,” Evans said. “We’ve been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better.” The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker’s campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states’ lack of union presence, it’d it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state’s minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. “It is an economic development tool,” Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. “We’ll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina.” At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren’t unionized or haven’t experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labour and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labour unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labour relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers’ efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company’s board of directors, Hirsch said. “Boeing is very, very different,” Hirsch said. “No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union.” Boeing didn’t threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defence contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. “Costs are out of control,” Trump tweeted in early December. “Cancel order!” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later.

Even if they are promising it, they certainly can’t deliver it,” Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn’t feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. “I think we’re doing just fine without a union presence,” he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice-president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump’s visit, the first by a sitting president to the company’s North Charleston facilities. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event,” she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

The secret ballot vote, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at polling locations throughout the North Charleston plant, was the first for Boeing and a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. Boeing said in Facebook post that 74 percent of the 2,828 workers who cast ballots voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). “We will continue to move forward as one team,” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president in charge of Boeing South Carolina, said in the post. In a statement, IAM lead organizer Mike Evans said: “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation.” The results come just before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit Boeing in South Carolina on Friday, as the company rolls out the first completed 787-10, the largest version of its Dreamliner. The world's largest planemaker ran a hardball campaign against the IAM, which has been trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. Opposition is strong in South Carolina, which is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is highest with 23.6 percent. The IAM canceled a vote at the Boeing plant in April 2015, claiming political interference from state officials. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. Boeing says the union is not needed because it is a divisive force that picks fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers out on costly strikes. The Chicago-based company produced videos that aired heavily on local TV stations and were also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, told Reuters in an interview. Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent. The South Carolina plant helps build the 787-8 and larger 787-9, and exclusively builds the 787-10 "stretch" version.

The morning round of voting has concluded Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017, among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. (Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. – Production workers at Boeing’s South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren’t immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. “Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next,” Evans said. “We’ve been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better.” The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker’s campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states’ lack of union presence, it’d it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state’s minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. “It is an economic development tool,” Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. “We’ll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina.” At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren’t unionized or haven’t experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labour and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labour unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labour relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers’ efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company’s board of directors, Hirsch said. “Boeing is very, very different,” Hirsch said. “No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union.” Boeing didn’t threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defence contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. “Costs are out of control,” Trump tweeted in early December. “Cancel order!” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina’s former labour director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina’s labour department, the governor played up Templeton’s union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to “fight the unions” at Boeing. “They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can’t deliver it,” Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn’t feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. “I think we’re doing just fine without a union presence,” he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice-president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump’s visit, the first by a sitting president to the company’s North Charleston facilities. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event,” she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

REUTERS/Randall Hill 8/8 By Alwyn Scott and Harriet McLeod | SEATTLE/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. SEATTLE/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. Boeing Co (BA.N) handily defeated a union drive by workers at the company's aircraft factory in South Carolina on Wednesday, as almost three-quarters of workers at the plant who voted rejected union representation. The secret ballot vote, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at polling locations throughout the North Charleston plant, was the first for Boeing and a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The NLRB said 74 percent of the 2,828 workers who cast ballots voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). “We will continue to move forward as one team,” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president in charge of Boeing South Carolina, said in the post. In a statement, IAM lead organizer Mike Evans said: “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation.” The results come just before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit Boeing's South Carolina plant on Friday, as the world's largest planemaker rolls out the first completed 787-10, the largest version of its Dreamliner. Any remarks Trump makes at the factory could bring into sharper focus his views on organized labor before he chooses appointees to fill vacant seats on the five-member NLRB. "I think he will cheer the 'no' vote," said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California Berkeley specializing in labor and the global economy. "I think he's going to make the case that he wants to see the plant succeed and do everything to create a more competitive environment." MORALE BLOW The loss was not seen as a surprise in a state with a strongly anti-union culture. South Carolina is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is highest with 23.6 percent. "It's a blow, but largely to morale more than anything practical," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. The vote preserves the status quo on the factory floor at Boeing in South Carolina and is unlikely to alter relations with the 30,000 IAM members at Boeing's factories near Seattle, Shaiken said. Boeing ran a hardball campaign against the IAM in South Carolina, which has been trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. The IAM canceled a vote at the Boeing plant in April 2015, claiming political interference from state officials. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. "Haley said South Carolina doesn't want or need unions," said Shaiken. "That creates an atmosphere where to vote 'yes' - in the minds of many workers - puts them at risk." The 26 percent of workers who supported the union showed the IAM had established a foothold, he added. "Can they build on it? That will be their challenge going forward." Under NLRB rules, the union must wait a minimum of 12 months before petitioning for another election. Boeing said the union was not needed because it is divisive, picks fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers out on costly strikes. President of the Seattle-area IAM local, Jon Holden, said Boeing's anti-union campaign was not a surprise and followed a strategy they had seen before. The Chicago-based company produced videos that aired heavily on local TV stations and were also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, told Reuters in an interview. Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent.

Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. (Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

(Reuters) - Boeing Co handily defeated a union drive by workers at the company's aircraft factory in South Carolina on Wednesday, as almost three-quarters of workers at the plant who voted rejected union representation. The secret ballot vote, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at polling locations throughout the North Charleston plant, was the first for Boeing and a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The NLRB said 74 percent of the 2,828 workers who cast ballots voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). “We will continue to move forward as one team,” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president in charge of Boeing South Carolina, said in the post. In a statement, IAM lead organizer Mike Evans said: “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation.” The results come just before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit Boeing's South Carolina plant on Friday, as the world's largest planemaker rolls out the first completed 787-10, the largest version of its Dreamliner. Any remarks Trump makes at the factory could bring into sharper focus his views on organized labor before he chooses appointees to fill vacant seats on the five-member NLRB. "I think he will cheer the 'no' vote," said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California Berkeley specializing in labor and the global economy. "I think he's going to make the case that he wants to see the plant succeed and do everything to create a more competitive environment." MORALE BLOW The loss was not seen as a surprise in a state with a strongly anti-union culture. South Carolina is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

More than 2,800 of the 3,000 workers eligible to vote in the election cast ballots, according to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) – which oversaw the voting.  Of those, a whopping 74 percent (2,097) voted against unionization. The defeat of the unionization campaign – which was led by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) – was widely expected given South Carolina’s status as a right-to-work state. Our sources pegged this outcome weeks ago after the union appeared to be losing ground following a 2015 “probing action.” “Boeing is in a much better place than it was last time and the union has made no progress,” one source close to the vote told us. “I don’t think the IAM is well organized to get a win,” another said. They were right … News of the initial IAM unionization push was exclusively reported by this website back in August of 2014. Big Labor’s defeat at Boeing’s South Carolina plant comes just two days before U.S. president Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the facility for the unveiling of its first 787-10 Dreamliner.  That’s the extended version of the much-maligned passenger jet that’s built exclusively in North Charleston. This website has been highly critical of Boeing, a crony capitalist company that has received more than $1 billion in taxpayer-funded incentives from South Carolinians.  Of course our contempt for the company doesn’t mean we supported the IAM push – far from it. As we’ve stated repeatedly, we believe unions are cancers … and we’re pleased whenever workers in any state rebuff their advances.  Only 11.1 percent of American workers currently belong to a union – and half of those belong to government unions.  In South Carolina, only 1.6 percent of workers are unionized – the lowest percentage of any state in the nation.

In a statement that sent its shares down 22 percent, the company said 2017 could be even worse, as it struggled to fix operational problems in difficult markets. Its shares had already more than halved in the last 12 months. Cobham on Thursday cut its readout for 2016 trading profit by another 20 million pounds, to 225 million pounds, slipping yet again just a month after its last downgrade. The group, which scrapped its final dividend last month, said "undoubted" uncertainties in the market meant its ability to forecast its performance was not as strong as it should be, and it was difficult to predict the year ahead. In addition, it said it had to fix many operational issues to get the business back on track, which would require more spending. "The board considers that delivery of a similar performance to that of 2016 in 2017 may be challenging," it said. Chief Executive David Lockwood, who took over in December, said 2016 was an "incredibly turbulent and disappointing year". "Execution failure in many businesses led us to miss expectations badly and provides a poor entry point into 2017," he said.

Cobham, which provides communications equipment, control systems and services to the defence industry, will take a £574m impairment on problems across several of its units. It will also take a £150m charge on spiralling costs related to its contract to develop a mid-air refuelling tanker for Boeing.  Underlying profit for the year - stripping out these one-off charges - will now be £225m, the company said, down from the £245m in a warning last month. Cobham has now issued five profit warnings in two years.  Shares plunged 19pc in early trading, to 106p. Cobham share price Cobham warned that it was unable to give any "balance sheet guidance" for 2017, saying "the ability of the group to forecast performance is also not as strong as it should be". The company added in a statement: "The balance sheet is clearly not strong enough to properly support the operations of the group, given the important role it plays in many customer programmes." It will provide more information in its preliminary results on March 2. Cobham shares plunge 18%. Will the next news be a rights issue? Probably. Likely announced on March 2 alongside FY results.— Garry White (@GarryWhite) February 16, 2017 David Lockwood, chief executive of Cobham, said: "2016 was an incredibly turbulent and disappointing year for Cobham. Execution failure in many businesses led us to miss expectations badly and provides a poor entry point into 2017. "The medium term provides significant opportunity with encouraging market dynamics and strong product and programme offerings. The route to realising this potential is strong operational performance and financial control, which will be the relentless focus through 2017. This has commenced and the potential to improve is clear." Last month Cobham's shares nosedived after the company cancelled its dividend and issued its last profit warning. Last year it was forced into a £500m rights issue to get its debt under control.

Can't Keep Calm The Rolling In The Deep singer was also seen expressing her immense love and respect for the 35-year-old singer during her acceptance speech at the Grammys after she won Album Of The Year Grammy. Notably, Adele left behind Beyonce, who was nominated for the same category for her recent album Lemonade. In her emotional speech, Adele claimed that the award should have belonged to Beyonce as her nominated album was so well-thought, inspiring and monumental. "I can't possibly accept this award. And I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful and gracious. But my artist of my life is Beyonce. And this album to me, the Lemonade album, is just so monumental. Beyonce, it's so monumental," Adele said. Meanwhile, Beyonce won two Grammy Awards this year and also made her baby bump debut at the awards gala.

The International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (IAM) held the vote under the auspices of the National Labor Relations Board. It was open to about 3,000 Boeing employees at the North Charleston facility. “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation” the IAM’s Mike Evans said. “But more than anything, we are disheartened they will have to continue to work under a system that suppresses wages, fosters inconsistency and awards only a chosen few.” The vote is a victory for Boeing who campaigned hard to fight off unionisation at the South Carolina plant. Workers at Boeing’s other 787 facility in Washington state are already represented by the IAM union. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before voting again on union representation.

According to a company statement, more than 2,000 of the nearly 3,000 Boeing workers at the plant eligible to vote in the closely watched election voted against the union, and only a bit more than 700 members voted yes. “We will continue to move forward as one team,” said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina. “We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team.” Manufacturers have been drawn to the South because the region is strongly anti-union. Less than 2% of South Carolina workers are union members, the lowest unionization rate in the nation. Boeing spent billions to open its North Charleston plant, arguing it needs to assure customers who buy the 787 Dreamliner, which is built there, that the plant wouldn’t go on strike. A win would have given the Machinists, who represent most Boeing factory workers, even more leverage over Boeing in future labor talks. The loss could further encourage other manufacturers to open union-free plants in the South. The vote was seen as an uphill battle for the union, which dropped plans for a vote last year. About 40% to 50% of organizing votes fail. “Boeing management spent a lot of money to make sure power and profits remained concentrated at the very top,” said Mike Evans, the union’s chief organizer. The union will now have to wait at least a year to petition for another representation vote. “The IAM remains committed to getting Boeing South Carolina workers the respect, wages and consistency they deserve.” The plant will get additional attention this week as President Donald Trump plans to visit the plant Friday to mark the completion of the first 787-10, the newest version of the Dreamliner. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event,” said Robinson-Berry. Wages were a key issue in the vote. The union says South Carolina workers earn about $10 an hour less than union members at Boeing’s Washington state plants. For its part, Boeing says pay scales are driven by wages in the local market, and that the South Carolina plant already pays better than a union-represented Boeing plant in Alabama. The company emphasized the cost of union dues, about $800 a year, as well as the risk that the workers could be caught up in a strike they opposed.

Top News U.S. News World News Voices Entertainment Movies Music TV Odd News Defense Energy Sports Fantasy Football NFL NBA MLB NHL Golf Tennis College Football College Basketball Science Health Photos Latest Photos 2016 Olympics News Entertainment Sports Features Archives Archive The Almanac Search Home / Top News / U.S. News Trump may get Kennedy-esque with earlier return to moon NASA is looking at the possibility of putting astronauts in lunar orbit late next year, far ahead of schedule. By Doug G. Ware   |   Feb. 15, 2017 at 8:20 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo Feb. 15 (UPI) -- The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Wednesday indicated that President Donald Trump may want the United States to resurrect its pioneering spirit in outer space -- much the same way another American leader did five decades ago. Acting NASA Administrator Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr., sent a memo to employees Wednesday saying he had instructed the agency to work up a feasibility report on adding astronauts to its planned EM-1 flight late next year. The mission, which is currently unmanned, will launch NASA's new Space Launch System rocket with an Orion capsule. The spacecraft would orbit the moon and return to Earth. The agency's EM-2 mission, scheduled for years later, was supposed to be the spaceflight to carry humans. Lightfoot's directive, though, raises the possibility that NASA will instead put astronauts near the lunar surface far sooner than expected. EM-1 was planned as a test flight for both the SLS and Orion craft, with the expectation they would facilitate astronaut missions in the future -- including a manned mission to Mars. Placing humans on EM-1 could also speed up NASA's return to the moon's surface. The SLS is a heavy expendable launch vehicle designed by Boeing to succeed the canceled Constellation program and replace the Space Shuttle. The Orion craft, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, is intended to carry up to four astronauts to low Earth orbit and beyond. "The possibility of NASA accelerating the timeline to put humans into the vicinity of the moon and onto Mars is exciting," Boeing said Wednesday. Because both spacecrafts have yet to be completed and are still in the development stage, experts say adding astronauts to EM-1 would require substantial work and cost. "I know the challenges associated with such a proposition, like reviewing the technical feasibility, additional resources needed, and clearly the extra work would require a different launch date," Lightfoot wrote in the employee memo. "That said, I also want to hear about the opportunities it could present to accelerate the effort of the first crewed flight and what it would take to accomplish that first step of pushing humans farther into space." It's unclear how likely an attempt to man EM-1 is to succeed. Wednesday's memo to even explore the idea of ramping up next year's spaceflight is unusual for NASA, which had planned for years before putting Astronauts in space on past excursions. Trump's motivation to get aggressive, advisers say, may be to send a message to China that the United States intends to maintain its dominion in space -- much in the same way former President John F. Kennedy did with the Russians. Kennedy famously pledged in 1961 to beat the Soviet Union and put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. His assassination two years later kept him from witnessing the fruition of that goal in July 1969. To this day, the United States is still the only country to send a manned mission to the moon, having landed on the lunar surface six times between 1969 and 1972. NASA was set to return in 2020 under former President George W. Bush's Constellation program, but that endeavor was canceled in 2010 by former President Barack Obama.

Shally Seth Mohile Cessna is among the prominent aircraft makers that manufacture small business jets. Photo: Bloomberg Bengaluru: TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd, which makes aero structures and other aircraft parts, is looking to contract-manufacture small business jets having two to 10 seats, chief operating officer Lokesh Ranjan Srivastava said. The Tata group company also expects robust growth on the back of a strong order book from its key customers Boeing Co. and Airbus, Srivastava said in an interview at the Aero India air show. Though new business will shape up only in 2019, TAL has already begun talks with some plane makers for contract manufacturing, Srivastava said, declining to elaborate further. Jet Airways may order at least 50 Boeing 737 Max planes this year Bombardier Inc., Cessna Aircraft Co. and Dassault Aviation SA are some of the global aircraft makers that build small business jets. “It’s all at an early stage. It has to make business sense for us as well as the original equipment makers,” he said. TAL hopes to have a revenue of Rs730 crore by the end of 2020, said Srivastava. Its revenue has grown from Rs15 crore in fiscal 2014 to Rs45 crore in fiscal 2015 and Rs108 crore in fiscal 2016. It expects to end the year with Rs200 crore, he said. Airbus Helicopters scouting for manufacturing site in India “We have an order book of worth Rs2,000 crore to execute over the next six to seven years,” he said. To accommodate the new orders, TAL is in the process of acquiring land for an additional facility near its existing unit in Nagpur. Meanwhile, on the back of steady growth and strong order book of TAL and orders from Boeing and Airbus, Tata Advanced Materials Ltd, a sister company of TAL that makes composites and structural parts for the aerospace industry, also aims to double its revenues from the estimated Rs400 crore in fiscal 2017 to Rs800 crore by 2020, said S.R. Mukherjee, chief executive officer at Tata Advanced Materials. “The idea is to be a dominant player in aero structures,” he said. The company, which has also been a supplier of bullet-proof jackets to the military, concluded an order of 50,000 units last month. It also supplies assemblies and parts to Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.

In opening deals the FTSE 100 index was off 7 points at 7,295.6, having closed up 0.5 per cent higher at 7,302.41 on Wednesday - its highest level since January 17.  Banks have been the big winners on both sides of the Atlantic this week as the prospect of higher interest rates is good for their balance sheets as it boosts margins. But a promise of deregulation in the sector has also boosted their stocks. President Trump's administration is packed full of bankers, many of whom cannot see the point of regulations such as Dodd-Frank. Bank stocks: Financial shares have been the big winners this week  In focus this session will be a meeting of G20 Foreign Ministers which takes place in Germany.  The meeting will see Boris Johnson, Rex Tillerson and their Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov meet for the first time.  Tillerson is expected to confirm that the US remains committed to Nato, at the gathering of ministers in Bonn.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was little changed in percentage terms at 371.34 points by 0821 GMT after recent strong gains to a two-month high in the previous session. Cobham slumped more than 21 percent to its lowest since late 2004 and headed for its biggest-ever daily fall. The company said it would take a 150 million pound ($187 million) charge on its work on Boeing's troubled KC-46 tanker programme and downgraded its likely 2016 trading profit again. European miners fell 0.9 percent, the biggest sectoral decliners, tracking weaker metals prices. However, losses were offset by a rally in airline stocks after Air France-KLM reported better than expected operating profit for 2016 and said it had made a "resilient" start to 2017. Shares in International Consolidates Airlines Group and Lufthansa rose 2.2 and 2.4 percent higher respectively to feature among top risers on the STOXX 600. IT services group Capgemini was up 3.3 percent after saying that it was targeting higher earnings in 2017.

The brand, which was founded by Vivienne Westwood’s son and is popular with celebrities including the Kardashians, has suffered weak sales in recent years, hit by a slow-down in luxury high street spending. It is currently majority owned by private equity firm 3i, which has reportedly been trying to sell the company. Read more How luxury brands are planning to take your money in 2017 The Guardian on Thursday reported that restructuring firm AlixPartners has now been appointed to lead a sale process. The paper reported that bids for the company were tabled late last week with about five bidders thought to include Lion Capital, the former private equity owner of La Senza and American Apparel, and Alteri. The Guardian said that advisers were looking for sums in excess of the £30m Agent Provocateur owes to its lenders, and that 3i is looking to finalise a deal ahead of a deadline for rent and rate payments which falls around late February or early March. Agent Provocateur’s manufacturing operations includes suppliers in Britain, Asia, continental Europe and North Africa, according to Reuters.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Adkins Special to the AFRO / (Photo by Rob Roberts) / February 16, 2017 0 5 tweet The Black Engineer of the Year Awards’ (BEYA) 31st annual STEM Conference drew major corporations and organizations that are keen on recruiting Black engineers and with more than 10,000 registered participants – a record number – there were plenty to choose from. BEYA – which, according to a sign at the conference, could also stand for Becoming Everything You Are – is annually held in D.C., and offers support and leadership to Blacks in STEM fields. It brings in STEM students and professionals to explore academic and professional opportunities. Thousands of students and professionals gathered at the Marriott Wardman Park hotel in D.C. to network during the Black Engineer of the Year Awards conference. (Photo by Rob Roberts) Eugene DeLoatch, BEYA co-founder and dean emeritus and professor at Morgan State University in Baltimore, received the organization’s 2017 Black Engineer of the Year Award. The award honors outstanding leaders in STEM fields who work to close the racial digital divide. DeLoatch said he countered the perception that Black students couldn’t become engineers and arguably produced more of them than anyone else in higher education. He said he created a precollege transition program that helped prepare students for the school’s engineering program and developed creative courses that focused on teaching introductory subjects. DeLoatch spent 24 years teaching at Howard University in D.C. before arriving at Morgan. As a testament to DeLoatch’s legacy, two of his former students from Howard – Albert Spencer Jr., chief engineer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service, and John H. James Jr., executive director of the Missile Defense Industry for DoD – thanked him in their remarks at the awards’ gala on Feb. 11. Spencer received a career achievement in government award while James presented the award for outstanding technical contribution in government. DeLoatch went on to become the first Black president of the American Society of Engineering Education. He currently chairs the Council of Engineering Deans of HBCUs. “We have so much work to do and we have so much more material to work with,” DeLoatch said in his acceptance speech. “Why don’t we just call it quits talking about these kids in the inner city that they cannot do it?” STEM jobs are growing faster than any other sector in the United States. The estimated size of the STEM workforce in the U.S. is expected to swell to more than 9 million jobs by 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. White and Asian men comprise the bulk of those jobs, though the emerging workforce is mostly women and underrepresented minorities, according to a report from {Wired}, a digital technology publication. Mike Jorgensen, a systems engineer at Lockheed Martin, said he’s been going to the conference for eight years, and that its career fair is the perfect place to recruit top talent for internships and jobs. However, there was steep competition with other major corporations at the career fair, including The Boeing Company, Airbnb, and Chrysler Group. Diversity has become a crucial priority at Lockheed Martin and the company fielded nearly two-dozen representatives at the conference.  “We’re hiring a lot of people at this event because there’s a lot of extremely intelligent young people,” Jorgensen said. “I don’t think there’s a slouch amongst them.” Safir Monroe, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering at Howard University, stopped by Lockheed Martin’s table to inquire about working in mechanical design after graduation. The 20-year-old said he designs different mechanical systems. In the future, Monroe hopes to design robotics and improve manufacturing processes, while doing some web development on the side. Monroe has been going to the conference for four years and said it has always been well organized and professional. He said his time at an HBCU taught him that if he fails to succeed in his career, that race has nothing to do with it – it’s all about his work ethic and network.  “I don’t have to have a second thought in my mind that I’m limited in my skin,” Monroe said. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army teamed up with BEYA this year to build awareness about the career opportunities it offers in STEM fields and dispel the notion that everyone in the Army is thrown into combat. “The military needs a lot of great minds and STEM majors are a place where we can find them and diversity is a big piece of this,” said Lt. Col. Joel Thomas, a professor of military science at Bowie State University, who also develops leaders within the school’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). ROTC cadets Jackie Berry and his twin brother Eric, 19, are sophomores at Bowie who may be poised to carry on that torch. The Army ROTC awarded both of them with $68,300 scholarships at the conference. Eric is focusing on network security while Jackie is studying for a career in database management or electrical engineering.  They were also at the conference to recruit high school and college students for the ROTC and say their time at Bowie has shown them what leadership is all about. “Because Bowie State doesn’t have the student body size as one of these big universities, lectures are more engaging and more tailored to our students,” Jackie said. “So if a student does not understand something, he or she doesn’t fall behind.” SHARE Facebook Twitter Previous articleD.

By: Bloomberg | Published: February 16, 2017 1:10 PM The development of the twin-turboprop plane suffered a setback in 2009 when a test flight ended in a fiery crash, killing all three crew on board. (PTI) India is reviving a three-decade-old plan to build its first passenger aircraft as the South Asian country struggles to join an exclusive club of Asian nations that have advanced far ahead in creating their own home-made jets. A 14-seat aircraft, called Saras, is undergoing preliminary tests, Jitendra Jadhav, director of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research at state-controlled National Aerospace Laboratories, said in an interview in Bengaluru on Wednesday. The development of the twin-turboprop plane suffered a setback in 2009 when a test flight ended in a fiery crash, killing all three crew on board. India may need a few hundred small planes that can carry less than 30 people over the next five to seven years for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to succeed in his plan to boost air links in remote areas of the country, according to Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation. India’s air force, which has committed to purchasing 15 of the Saras planes, needs to test the aircraft before certifications and sale to commercial airlines, Jadhav said. The process of getting full certification could take as long as three years, he said. Watch this also: Delays in production of new aircraft is common across the world, even with established companies like Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. announced a fifth delay last month in delivering Japan’s first locally made passenger jet to its launch customer, while China’s Advanced Regional Jet ARJ21 took 13 years to design, build and bring to market. India’s Saras program was conceived about 29 years ago. A separate plan to build a bigger, 50-70 seat commercial aircraft is stuck pending government funding, Jadhav said. Feasibility study for the project, which would need a private party to manufacture, has been done and the proposal has been with the government since 2013, Jadhav said. “The government should sanction funds, only then we can do it,” Jadhav said.

X Norwegian Air International to open transatlantic routes Plan well advanced to begin flying from Cork and Shannon to Boston and New York about 3 hours ago Updated: about an hour ago US pilots met president Donald Trump this week to voice their concerns at Norwegian’s entry to the market. Photograph: Stephen Crowley/The New York Times         Norwegian Air International’s plans to begin flying from Cork and Shannon to Boston and New York seem to be finally taking shape, three years after it first got its Irish airline licence and applied to the US authorities to be allowed to fly there. Stewart International Airport, about 60 miles north of New York city, has emerged as the latest contender as a destination for some of the proposed flights from Ireland, which some reports say could include Belfast alongside the two Munster destinations. Norwegian is not saying, but it has already confirmed that it is likely to fly to secondary airports in the US. Their charges are lower than the likes of New York’s JFK or Boston’s Logan, thus allowing it more scope to offer lower fares. Stewart is also preparing to extend an incentive scheme that will allow it to offer discounts and other breaks to airlines launching new routes from there. As Norwegian has confirmed that it will establish a base there, the airline is likely to benefit from this also. While Norwegian passed the regulatory barrier when the US department of transportation granted it a foreign air carrier’s permit in December, the opposition that delayed this in the first place did not go away. US pilots met president Donald Trump this week to voice their concerns at Norwegian’s entry to the market. Only a very brave person would predict how the US president is likely to react. His administration has made some positive remarks about Norwegian’s plans, particularly in highlighting that the airline was buying lots of US-made Boeing aircraft for its fleet. Additionally, the airports with which Norwegian has been talking, along with the businesses and politicians in their respective districts, seem to be happy to welcome it. Presumably they are not beyond doing some lobbying of their own. ADVERTISEMENT Assuming that the flights go ahead, it would then be a question of whether there is a viable business flying between Cork, Shannon and Belfast and the US east coast. Watching how that, and Norwegian’s plans to offer low-cost long-haul travel between Europe, the US and Asia, play out, will make for interesting viewing.       Topics: Cantillon Donald Trump Munster Boeing Norwegian Air Stewart International Asia Belfast Boston(US) Europe Ireland New York City United States Read More Government playing fast and loose with house statistics Dublin failing to rise to challenge of higher-density housing Cheltenham index could be a measure of our success Why is Twitter getting trumped by Facebook?

David Nachman of Nachman, Phulwani, Zimovcak Law Group came to Ramapo on Wednesday to lead a discussion on how Trump’s immigration rules and policies could affect international students. Nachman focused on immigration and nationality laws and also shared with international students what options they had to continue living in the U.S. legally after completing their degree. “It’s been a wild and crazy ride for me since President Trump entered office because obviously the cornerstone of the Trump initiative has been to deal with illegal immigration,” said Nachman, who added that his office phones have been ringing almost constantly with questions regarding Trump’s policies. “Everyone is in favor of legal immigration, we want to obey the laws, but immigration laws in the United States are extremely confusing and convoluted,” he continued. Trump has expressed his interest in ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. The program allows illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to defer action for two years. However, Nachman thinks that it is unlikely that Trump will follow through with ending the program because he would risk the support of the more than 750,000 people in the U.S. in the program. “The political power of the DACA population and immigration advocates cannot be underestimated,” he said. “I think it would be political suicide for him because he knows how important the Hispanic vote is.” Nachman does believe that Trump will follow through with his plan to build an “impenetrable physical wall on the southern border.” “The Republican platform is to increase defense spending,” said Nachman. He added that he also believes the contract to build the wall will be given to a large company such as Boeing or BlackRock to “provide jobs and support trickle-down economics.” Other parts of Trump’s immigration platform include ending catch and release, ending sanctuary cities and reforming legal immigration. Trump also wants to curb the jobs and benefits that he believes are attracting immigrants to come to the United States illegally. “This point assumes that jobs are the only reason why foreign nationals come to the United States illegally,” Nachman said. “It leaves in the dust the fact that individuals also come to the United States to be reunited with their close family members.” Nachman stressed that there is a large difference between illegal and legal immigrants and that, while difficult, there is a process for international students to remain in the country after graduation. Typically, international students have a student visa which is a type of nonimmigrant visa. “Nonimmigrant means that you intend to leave the United States," said Nachman. “It means that you don’t have an intention to immigrate to the U.S.” Other types of temporary, nonimmigrant visas include visitors, performing artists and religious workers. On the typical path to a green card, a student would transition from a student visa to an H-1B employment visa. An employment visa is another type of nonimmigrant visa, but it allows for students to have “dual intent,” in which they both intend to stay and leave. After this, they can apply for employment-based permanent residence. However, there are only 65,000 employment visas given out to students each year. In 2016, this cap was met on the first day that filing opened when more than 240,000 people applied. Nachman shared that his law office often works with students and businesses to place the students in jobs to increase their chances of being granted an employment visa. “It’s very tough right now because the large corporations that are H1-B dependent and that have concerns about how to deal with the future of their business are worried if they should even submit H1-Bs this year,” he said, referencing the businesses he works with that employ many workers on an H1-B employment visa. However, Nachman added that they have yet to see a drop in interest from businesses in hiring students despite Trump’s tough immigration policies.   ecoslop@ramapo.edu Tags: Donald Trump, president, immigration, student visas, international students By Staff Writer Follow Staff Writer Get Top Stories Delivered Weekly Please enter Email More ramaponews News Articles Funds Prevent Colleges from Becoming Sanctuaries Panel Reflects on Relationship of Religion and LGBTQ+ Grad90 Celebrates Basketball Teams and Graduates Visit to Google Headquarters Offers Students Insight Recent ramaponews News Articles Funds Prevent Colleges from Becoming Sanctuaries By KARLITO ALMEDA Photo courtesy of Gage Skidmore, Flickr Since Donald J.

(REUTERS/Jorge Duenes) By Philip Rucker, The Washington Post Feb 11, 2017 at 3:29 pm | Print View President Donald Trump vowed in a pair of tweets Saturday morning to negotiate the costs of constructing a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border “way down,” after a government analysis estimated the price at a whopping $21.6 billion. The Department of Homeland Security said this past week that the wall would cost $21.6 billion and take 3 1/2 years to construct. Reacting to the estimate, Trump tweeted: “I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the. . .design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN!” Trump sent his tweets from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where he and first lady Melania are hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. During his transition period before being sworn in as president, Trump spoke with executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to try to negotiate down the costs of the government’s contracts to build new F-35 fighter jets and a modern Air Force One jumbo jet. After the discussions, both companies, highly dependent on government defense contracts, announced efforts to reduce costs on the programs. The border wall is a signature campaign promise of Trump’s. He said on the campaign trail that it would cost only about $8 billion, but that seems to have been an unreasonably low estimate. Trump prides himself on his negotiating abilities. As a real estate developer, he famously squeezed contractors for profits, yet still often experienced massive cost overruns. Government contracting is more prescribed than in the private sector, of course, and involves an open bidding process. Your next Nation & World articles Former U.S. Justice Department official ...

Ask any business owner a few months after they have completed their strategy, what is the biggest problem they face. You will get exactly the same answer from both. The strategy is not being executed. According to Professor Richard Rumelt of UCLA, there are only two types of strategy, “good strategy and bad strategy.” (He is the author of a book by the same name, reviewed in this column in 2012.) The strategy method described at the beginning of this book would fall into Rumelt’s definition of bad strategy, and I wouldn’t read this book for Part I. That said, it is a valuable guide on how to ensure your strategy is executed. The execution comes from your leader’s ability to integrate the strategy into their leadership method. Many good leaders I have met have never considered this issue, and many senior managers have never thought about what it would take to do so. Authors Harbir Singh and Michael Useem of Wharton Business School have formulated this process into six steps. The first step is the realisation of the connection between leadership and strategy. As a guest at a barbecue one weekend, I was asked what I did for a living. I replied that I am a strategist, to which one of the guests responded that his firm had recently gone through just such a process. I asked him how it was going and he replied: “We are so busy with our regular work, we simply haven’t had the time to even think about the strategy.” One has to wonder what the regular work could possibly be, except trying to execute the strategy! That is the beginning of Singh and Useem’s prescription for strategic leadership: integrating strategy and leadership. Strategic leadership is being clear what the strategy is so you can make choices of where to play and how to win, how to prioritise goals, and to ensure you have the human capabilities necessary to achieve these goals. “Integrating the two areas calls for a continuous and simultaneous discussion of both strategy and leadership questions,” the authors exhort. The key word here is “continuous”: the discussion of leadership and strategy at every opportunity. The continuous discussions are around the positions of the organisation to meet the strategy, and whether you still have the right people and architecture in place. Strategy must be taught The second step on the strategy leader’s roadmap is the acknowledgement that neither strategy nor leadership is a natural skill set; it must be taught. Academic research, borne out by management practice, has identified several ways this type of development can be achieved. Possibly the most effective is a combination of formal learning, one-on-one coaching and exposure to instructive experience. These experiences are chosen for the opportunity they offer to force the candidate to apply the learning and coaching if he or she is to succeed. Formal learning, one-on-one coaching and exposure to instructive experience is a powerful combination. This approach has been behind the success of General Electric, Boeing, American Express, IBM, and Procter & Gamble. And it doesn’t require deep pockets, only determination from senior leadership and the board. The third step to ensuring the strategy is executed is by identifying the strategic fit between the current managers and the particular challenges the incumbent will face. The executive must have the temperament and relevant experience that aligns with the specific imperatives of the firm at the moment. If they don’t, then the second step, development, as described above becomes necessary and if that fails, another leader must be sought. This process entails pinpointing the priority skills the leader requires through careful and detailed analysis, not coffee table discussion. The fourth step is to convey the strategic intent (or what I call your ‘functional strategy’) – how you have to function to achieve the strategic outcomes in a dynamic and fast-changing business environment. “Managers at all levels must also be able to convey strategic intent if they are to effectively exercise strategic leadership”, the authors explain. The fifth step is to see leadership in layers. Once the most senior leaders have absorbed the strategy, it is up to them to cascade it down to the next level with such clarity that this level can do the same to the level below, and onward. The last step is to “decide deliberatively”, that is to use the strategy to guide each and every decision, under all circumstances, and every time. No exceptions. These six steps will ensure that your strategy is executed. They will ensure your expenditure of time, effort and money in your strategy yields a strong return. That does however presuppose your strategy is a good one.

The three top officials were Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Chief of Staff Christian Marrone, and General Counsel Stevan Bunnell. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER The documents include emails discussing sensitive meetings with Kuwaiti and Saudi Arabian officials. They also reveal a West African $4.5 million online consumer fraud scam, Judicial Watch noted. The documents showed that the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S. sent an email to Johnson’s unsecured email account attempting to set up a meeting for Johnson with Kuwait’s Interior Ministry. The Interior Minister reportedly already scheduled meetings with the heads of the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Director of National Intelligence. “The reason I am reaching out is to let you know that our Minister of the Interior (your counterpart in Kuwait) is planning to visit Washington from August 24-26. He is already scheduled to meet with the directors of the CIA, FBI, and DNI,” the email from the ambassador said. The emails also showed that the U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia emailed Johnson’s unsecured email account discussing his upcoming meetings at the Saudi Interior Ministry in Jeddah. One part of the email redacts the name of a general also visiting during the same timeframe, referred to as the “Chairman.” The timing of the email suggests the general in question was then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Army Gen. Martin Dempsey. The emails also revealed Chief of Staff Marrone discussed Lockheed Martin earnings with an unidentified individual as well as a space vehicle launch consortium between Lockheed and Boeing. Judicial Watch received the documents in response to a May 23, 2016, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. DHS did not initially respond to a Dec. 29, 2015, FOIA request for emails relating to official government business sent to or from the private accounts of Johnson and three other officials. Judicial Watch played a leading role in the release of emails from former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s private server she used to conduct official work while Secretary of State. The group previously revealed that Johnson and 28 other agency officials used government computers to access personal web-based email accounts, despite a 2014 agency-wide ban on doing so due to heightened security concerns. One email to Johnson’s private account showed an email scam using the former secretary’s identity. Some of the emails in the release had redacted portions. “The fact that the documents found in these email accounts were so heavily redacted and that Johnson’s name and email account were spoofed in a phishing scam is indicative of just how lax communications security was inside Homeland Security during the Obama administration,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

By Kris B. Mamula / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette A $35 million specialty hospital that’s under construction in Lancaster, Pa., is blazing what could be the future of health care by promising big savings with assurances of quality care and patient satisfaction. General acute care hospitals should worry. For-profit Clio Health could change health care in the way Netflix streaming movies and TV shows changed Blockbuster Video. The affiliate of venture capital firm Aspire Ventures of Lancaster is building a private, micro-hospital with four operating rooms — and space to add two more — where a palette of surgical procedures will be done: general, orthopedic, spine, vascular, urological and cosmetic. The surgical services are among the most lucrative for community hospitals, where revenue generated from higher-margin service lines such as cardiology is often funneled to so-called loss leaders, including mental health services and staffing primary care doctors’ offices. In this way, competition from Clio could dent the budgets of nearby community hospitals. “This is going to have a pretty dramatic impact on health care,” Clio CEO Joseph Frank said. “What I see is a nationwide movement.” Size may impede traditional health systems in keeping up with the likes of Clio, said David Simons, an anesthesiologist and president of the Lancaster City & County Medical Society. “They’ve become very large, cumbersome in their ability to cut costs,” he said. So far, Lancaster-area doctors are reacting to the nimbler Clio with curiosity, said Dr. Simons, who is not affiliated with Clio, while some doctors view its emergence as an opportunity. While doctors wait and see what happens in Lancaster, Clio is pressing ahead with ambitious expansion plans for four more hospitals by 2019. None have been announced for Western Pennsylvania — yet. “Pittsburgh is a very sophisticated medical market,” said Mr. Frank, a University of Pittsburgh graduate. “We would be able to develop a micro-hospital there that would be so much more affordable.” Micro-hospitals are gaining traction nationwide because of comparatively lower construction costs and generally higher reimbursement for services than urgent care or ambulatory surgical centers. Clio says it will discount its surgical services by one-third to 50 percent when compared to the local health system, depending on the procedure. Beating those prices could mean less revenue to support lower margin service lines at traditional hospitals, according to Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a Downtown-based consultant. Whether that creates financial headaches for community hospitals depends on the facility’s operating overhead and other factors. “The evidence around the country is that you could charge a lot less for surgery without cherrypicking patients,” ones with the richest commercial insurance coverage and lowest medical risk, Mr. Miller said. “The truth is there is a lot of cross subsidization going on” inside most hospitals. Clio’s financial plan also calls for limiting acceptance of government health plans for the elderly, poor and disabled, Medicare and Medicaid, which community hospitals are obligated to accept. The new micro-hospital will only accept Medicare and Medicaid for doctor bills, medical imaging and rehabilitation therapy — not hospital or surgery center care due to legal requirements, a spokesman said. Health care experts say Medicare and Medicaid pay hospitals less for care than commercial insurers, and in the case of Medicaid, often less than the cost of providing the service. In some areas of Pennsylvania, private surgical hospitals have siphoned patients with commercial insurance while leaving community hospitals to deal with poorer, sicker and more costly patients. Clio’s strategy includes offering direct contracting for surgical care, a strategy used by Wal-Mart, Boeing and other big employers to hold down health care costs. Under the arrangement, self-insured employer groups will be able to contract directly for surgical care for employees. In addition to lower cost, specialty hospitals overall report fewer facility-acquired infections and complications, shorter stays and more convenience when compared to regular hospitals. Mr. Frank said Clio will offer all of those advantages to employer groups, plus advertise its rates for surgical procedures, allowing patients to shop for savings when the hospital opens in early 2018. Nationwide, few hospitals disclose charges and none in Western Pennsylvania have adopted the practice. The 35-bed Clio is projecting that it will perform 2,000 operations in Lancaster during its first year. By comparison, the 328-bed St. Clair Hospital in Mt. Lebanon reported a combined 7,766 inpatient and outpatient surgeries for the six months ending Dec. 31. “This is the beginning of something interesting,” Mr. Frank said. “The timing is right.” Kris B.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here India is reviving a three-decade-old plan to build its first passenger aircraft as the South Asian country struggles to join an exclusive club of Asian nations that have advanced far ahead in creating their own home-made jets. A 14-seat aircraft, called Saras, is undergoing preliminary tests, Jitendra Jadhav, director of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research at state-controlled National Aerospace Laboratories, said in an interview in Bengaluru on Wednesday. The development of the twin-turboprop plane suffered a setback in 2009 when a test flight ended in a fiery crash, killing all three crew on board. India may need a few hundred small planes that can carry less than 30 people over the next five to seven years for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to succeed in his plan to boost air links in remote areas of the country, according to Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation. India’s air force, which has committed to purchasing 15 of the Saras planes, needs to test the aircraft before certifications and sale to commercial airlines, Jadhav said. The process of getting full certification could take as long as three years, he said. Delays in production of new aircraft is common across the world, even with established companies like Boeing Co. and Airbus SE. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. announced a fifth delay last month in delivering Japan’s first locally made passenger jet to its launch customer, while China’s Advanced Regional Jet ARJ21 took 13 years to design, build and bring to market. India’s Saras program was conceived about 29 years ago. A separate plan to build a bigger, 50-70 seat commercial aircraft is stuck pending government funding, Jadhav said. Feasibility study for the project, which would need a private party to manufacture, has been done and the proposal has been with the government since 2013, Jadhav said. “The government should sanction funds, only then we can do it,” Jadhav said.

"Join me in Florida this Saturday at 5 p.m. for a rally at the Orlando-Melbourne International Airport!" Trump tweeted, along with a link for supporters to RSVP.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 Trump himself had floated the idea of hosting campaign-style rallies even as president, Politico noted. The rally comes as the young administration has dealt with intelligence leaks that led to the resignation of Trump's national security adviser, Mike Flynn, and protests over some of his Cabinet nominees. The rally will follow the president's trip to Charleston, S.C., on Friday, where he is expected to attend the unveiling of a new Boeing plane: the 787-10 Dreamliner, Politico reported. "This [South Carolina] visit will give the president an opportunity to celebrate a huge milestone for thousands of workers at Boeing, America's No. 1 exporter in the millions of American workers involved in aerospace," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, per Politico. "This trip has been months in the making, and we're thrilled to celebrating the rollout of this amazing plane."

See Offers Business Posted Yesterday at 8:23 PM Updated February 15 increase font size Retailers try to sell Trump on killing ‘border adjustment’ tax plan The tax on imports would hurt business and the wider economy and raise product prices, they say. By Sarah HalzackThe Washington Post Share Comment Read Article WASHINGTON — President Trump met Wednesday with a group of executives from big-name retailers such as Target and Best Buy, as the industry leaders made the case that they believe a Republican plan for tax reform would be detrimental to their businesses – and to the wider economy. Major retailers have come out swinging against a provision of the tax proposal known as border adjustment, which effectively creates a new tax on imports. Given that goods such as apparel and electronics are largely made overseas, the stores fear their tax bills will soar so high that they will be forced to hike the prices that shoppers see on store shelves. President Trump meets with retail industry leaders Wednesday at the White House. To his left are Jo-Ann Craft Stores CEO Jill Soltau, Gap Inc. CEO Art Peck, and Jeremy Katz, an adviser to National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. It's not clear whether Trump supports the 'border adjustment' tax idea proposed by Republicans. Associated Press/Evan Vucci Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → “We stressed the importance of taking a thoughtful approach to tax reform for both individuals and corporations,” Bill Rhodes, chief executive of AutoZone and chairman of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said in a statement released after the meeting. “The retail industry is the nation’s largest private-sector employer providing and supporting more than 42 million American jobs. The president understands we support pro-growth policies that we believe will lead to greater domestic investment.” In opening remarks at the meeting, Trump told the executives “my administration remains very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth,” and he went on to talk about his plans to slash regulations and overhaul the tax code. And he praised the retail business as “one of the great job producers” in the U.S. economy. It is not clear whether Trump supports the border adjustment idea that congressional Republicans have put forward. In an earlier interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said it was “too complicated.” In their efforts to convince Trump not to support this tenet of the tax plan, industry leaders are trying to hammer home the ways that this could indirectly affect consumers. Matt Shay, the chief executive of the National Retail Federation, said on CNBC Wednesday morning that the border adjustment tax would essentially be a “new national sales tax.” “I don’t think that’s what the voting population voted for in November,” Shay said. Congressional Republicans have included border adjustment in their tax plan as a way to generate more than $1 trillion in revenue for the federal government. It could prove difficult to get them to abandon the provision because it is a linchpin of the entire plan: It raises the dollars needed to offset some of the other tax cuts being proposed. The border adjustment tax has created fault lines in corporate America: Oil refiners, for example, have joined retailers in opposing the plan. But a coalition of exporters has thrown their support behind the proposal. The American Made Coalition, which includes the likes of GE and Boeing, says the tax plan would level the playing field for them and other American exporters. In addition to Rhodes, the executives who attended the Wednesday meeting at the White House included Brian Cornell of Target; Marvin Ellison of J.C. Penney; Art Peck of Gap; Hubert Joly of Best Buy; Gregory Sandfort of Tractor Supply Co.; and Jill Soltau of Jo-Ann Stores. In a statement released after the White House meeting, Cornell said the group had a “positive and substantive discussion” about economic policy, including the border adjustment tax. “If enacted, the House proposal would have profound implications for our guests and business, and at Target, we believe that anything that raises prices for families is not a good idea for America,” Cornell said. Many economists rebuff retailers’ worries about the potential effects of implementing the tax. They say the value of the dollar will rise if it is enacted, thereby making the cost of imported goods lower. Meanwhile, the plan that includes the border tax also calls for cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Economists say that, given these factors, importers’ tax bills won’t actually change that much. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was little changed in percentage terms at 371.34 points by 0821 GMT after recent strong gains to a two-month high in the previous session. Cobham slumped more than 21 percent to its lowest since late 2004 and headed for its biggest-ever daily fall. The company said it would take a 150 million pound ($187 million) charge on its work on Boeing's troubled KC-46 tanker programme and downgraded its likely 2016 trading profit again. European miners fell 0.9 percent, the biggest sectoral decliners, tracking weaker metals prices. However, losses were offset by a rally in airline stocks after Air France-KLM reported better than expected operating profit for 2016 and said it had made a "resilient" start to 2017. Shares in International Consolidates Airlines Group and Lufthansa rose 2.2 and 2.4 percent higher respectively to feature among top risers on the STOXX 600. IT services group Capgemini was up 3.3 percent after saying that it was targeting higher earnings in 2017.

'Negotiations for the purchase of aircraft from ATR have reached the final stage and at the moment, the two sides are at the stage of exchanging documents,' Akhoundi said. The  minister added that with the finalization of document exchange, the introduction of the first ATR aircraft into Iran’s air fleet will begin to be followed up through official channels. The deal was first signed in February 2016 in Tehran following the commercial discussions held in Rome and Paris during visit of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani Akhoundi to those countries. Iran has several private and public airline companies in operation, among which IranAir is the oldest one. The number of operational airports in the country is 46. Since sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic were lifted last year, Iran began to take steps to upgrade its air industry, revamp an aging airline fleet, equipment and airports. When sanctions were eased in January 2016 after Iran certified that it had shelved its nuclear program, Tehran immediately opened talks with Boeing Co. and the European manufacturer Airbus to buy hundreds of aircraft. The deals represent the biggest commercial result of the nuclear accord. --- Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz   #ATR PLANE #IRAN Related News Iran hopes to finalize gas deal with French Total 15 February 15:08 National basketball team wins silver in Iran 15 February 12:24 Azerbaijan, Iran eye financial and banking cooperation 15 February 11:38 Iran welcomes deepening ties with EU members 14 February 17:35 Iran plans to use nuclear technology in marine industry 14 February 16:42 Turkish plane makes emergency landing in Iran 13 February 12:20 Iran’s growing gas output vs. dwindling prices: any practical use? 11 February 18:00 Tehran says Russian warplanes continue to fly through Iran 11 February 16:50 Tehran says Russian warplanes continue to fly through Iran 11 February 16:39 Tehran says Russian warplanes continue to fly through Iran 11 February 15:02 Latest Popular 13:31 • CBA reveals volume of strategic currency reserves 13:11 • Alim Gasimov to give concert in Tehran [PHOTO] 12:58 • Musical Theatre to join Turkish international festival 12:50 • Participants to attend USACC Annual Conference confirmed 12:39 • Azerbaijani pianist to perform in London 12:37 • Freestyle Wrestling World Cup opens in Iran [PHOTO] 12:19 • President Aliyev receives Iranian delegation 12:18 • Russia eyes increasing investment in agrosector of Azerbaijan 12:00 • Kashagan oil may go via Azerbaijan 11:40 • Iran finalizing deal for ATR plane 11:26 • President Aliyev receives delegation led by Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff of U.S. 11:23 • Montenegrin President to join 5th Global Baku Forum 11:14 • Mine clearance continues in liberated Jojug Marjanli 11:01 • U.S., Russian military officials to meet in Baku 10:59 • Turkmen, Afghan presidents mull TAPI project 10:50 • Armenian militaries breach truce, shell Azerbaijani positions 10:42 • SOCAR, IBM ink cooperation deal 10:33 • World’s first LNG Bunkering Vessel delivered to co-owners 10:24 • Final rehearsal of World Cup opening ceremony held in Baku [PHOTO] 10:17 • Currency rates for February 16 15 February 17:08 • Bilateral meetings on Syrian crisis begin in Astana 15 February 16:35 • Iteca Caspian to open Baku exhibition season in April 15 February 21:45 • Foreign diplomats informed about atrocities of Armenians in Jojug Marjanli [UPDATE / PHOTO] 15 February 17:54 • Turkey needs the support of Gulf countries for regional stability 15 February 18:03 • European Commission hails importance of SGC 15 February 15:30 • Secured financing for TANAP to hit $3.7B 15 February 13:51 • Gazprom is not SOCAR's rival in TAP 15 February 18:10 • Baku hosts poetry evening [PHOTO] 15 February 17:32 • Global ranking: Azerbaijan - one of safest countries in the world 15 February 15:13 • Moscow: No complaints received from blogger Lapshin 15 February 17:36 • Taekwondo fighters win 10 medals in Turkey [PHOTO] 15 February 17:47 • Privatization process to stipulate opening of new working places 15 February 16:04 • Date set for presidential election in Kyrgyzstan 15 February 15:08 • Iran hopes to finalize gas deal with French Total 15 February 17:16 • 'Molla Nasraddin anecdotes' published in English 15 February 17:02 • Azerbaijani model joins beauty contest in Taiwan [PHOTO] 15 February 14:49 • Issue on Khojaly genocide raised in Australian Senate 15 February 14:43 • In search of lost time 15 February 16:13 • Turkey seeks to host UEFA Euro 2024 15 February 14:27 • Action plan on "Year of Islamic Solidarity" approved AzerNews Newspaper Facebook Twitter Google+ RSS Information About us Contacts Advertising Azernews In Print News Archive © 2017 AzerNews.

Philip Hammond, the chancellor, announced that British government would take an active role in supporting research and development, a departure from the stance taken by his more laissez-faire predecessors. In November’s Autumn Statement, Mr Hammond provided more detail: a new National Productivity Investment Fund will inject £4.7bn extra into R&D between 2017 and 2021. It is the largest increase in R&D investment since the Labour government of the late 1970s. The UK government is no longer the outlier among European nations in keeping its market interventions minimal and its regulations as light touch as possible. The government has also included this investment in its broader industrial strategy, which is being designed to help businesses cope after Britain’s departure from the EU. The change is a positive step after years of real-terms reductions in government R&D spending, says Professor Sir Keith Burnett, vice-chancellor of Sheffield university and president of the UK Science Council. He wants the government to articulate an even stronger sense of “national purpose” for research, otherwise “you’re never going to get citizens wanting to pay for it”. The importance of governments in driving a nation’s scientific and technological achievements were outlined most clearly in the 2013 book The Entrepreneurial State by Mariana Mazzucato of Sussex university. In it, Prof Mazzucato traced the role the US government had played in creating Apple’s iPhone. Without undermining the creative genius of Steve Jobs or the supply chain mastery of his successor Tim Cook, Prof Mazzucato found that almost every piece of technology in the ubiquitous smartphone had its origin in a government programme, dispelling the myth that the success of Silicon Valley was largely the work of eccentric entrepreneurs tinkering in their garages and savvy investments made by venture capitalists. Apple’s voice-activated personal assistant software Siri, the microprocessor and the micro hard-drive all had their origins in research by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), run by the Department of Defense; the multi-touch screen was developed by the CIA and Darpa; GPS, found on most smartphones, was a technology originally created by Darpa and the US Navy. It was the patient investment of government that made today’s digital revolution reality. Prof Mazzucato says: “In almost every sector from IT to biotech, nano tech and clean tech, it has been the US government that has led the way investing in key areas across the innovation chain.” The UK has had its own science successes over the decades — from the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA to genetic fingerprinting and to the sophisticated lasers that made CDs and DVDs play. But when it comes to government funding, the UK lags behind peers almost everywhere. Government spending on research and development in the UK has been on a downward trend, falling from 0.56 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 0.49 per cent of GDP in 2013, according to figures compiled by the Campaign for Science & Engineering (Case). The average in OECD countries in 2012 was 0.7 per cent of GDP, while the EU average was 0.64 per cent. Mr Hammond’s promise to increase funding was welcomed by the scientific community. However, Naomi Weir, deputy director of Case, says that many questions remain about access to EU programmes and networks after Brexit and the extra cash “takes us about a quarter of the way” towards the 3 per cent of GDP Case believes the government should be devoting to R&D. Jonathan Haskel, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School in London, says UK science has been “pretty cheap”, and has resulted not only in taking research out of the lab and into the market, but in lifting overall productivity in the private sector. Related article Brexit: An experiment full of risk for British science Can the UK craft new policies to keep its lead in research and development? Thursday, 16 February, 2017 Despite some fears in the business world that such public investments might “crowd out” private ones, Prof Haskel says that the opposite tends to happen, with public money attracting further investment from companies. One place where the government and academia work closely with the private sector is at Sheffield university’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, where Boeing, Rolls-Royce and other companies have clustered to develop sophisticated materials and manufacturing processes. It is one of seven such centres in the UK which, Sheffield university’s Sir Keith says, “create an intimate relationship” between government and business. At the same time, Sir Keith says that another form of state-driven strategic investment has been lost, as the sale of state-owned businesses — such as airports and the nuclear industry — has made co-ordinated national R&D investments more difficult. “We have broken up our strategic resources so it is tricky to build back a strategic plan.” Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.
