The country's national airline has provisionally agreed to buy U.S. and European aircraft worth over $50 billion at list prices, marking a high-profile test case for the reopening of its economy under a deal with world powers to ease sanctions. Nine months after the sanctions deal took effect, foreign banks are reluctant to get involved because of concerns that they could be caught up in restrictions applying to U.S. banks, which are still banned from doing business with Iran. Under the deal to lift nuclear-related sanctions, Iran can buy passenger planes and other goods but is not allowed to pay for them in dollars or to use the U.S. financial system, due to core U.S. sanctions that remain in force. The ban on paying in dollars is a particular headache for Boeing and international leasing companies, which usually account for their portfolios in the world's leading currency. Paying in other hard currencies could generate fleeting movements in the U.S. financial system known as U-Turn transactions, which are also banned. "We are negotiating and I hope that during the trip of President (Hassan) Rouhani to the U.S. today or tomorrow, we can have some news on the subject," Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told foreign investors at the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh is traveling to New York as part of Rouhani's delegation for the U.N. General Assembly. The United States has said it has no plans to reinstate "U-turn" authorization, which would allow foreign banks to use its financial system to transfer funds for some Iran-related trade. Iran wants to pay Boeing in dollars but failing such an agreement - which many observers consider unlikely - it wants the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to approve the financing as part of a separate process under which it must also grant licenses before jets can be exported to Iran. Industry sources say Boeing is talking to third-parties about handling the transactions and paying it in dollars, but is unlikely to proceed without clear guidance from Washington. EXPORT LICENSES Although it usually sells planes in dollars, France-based Airbus is expected to be paid in euros and would not need further permission to absorb the cash, industry sources said. However it does need the same U.S. export licenses as Boeing due to the high proportion of U.S. parts in its aircraft. Kashan said earlier he felt the U.S. Treasury export licenses for all of Iran's potential suppliers could be granted by end-September. Foreign banks, some of which have faced huge fines for breaking U.S. rules, are worried about financing the deals. "The problem for European banks is that we don't know the conditions under which OFAC will approve (the deals) and the second is that it is a question of reputation," Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director at Germany's DVB told Reuters. "Even if OFAC gives approval, what most of the big European banks fear, because they have great franchises in the U.S., is that there may be some fight-back in an unknown form and at an unknown time for the business they may have with Iran." Republicans who oppose the nuclear deal have warned against allowing Iran to use the dollar in business transactions. Lack of clarity over the currency regulations is also causing headaches for leasing companies which are expected to play a major role in Iran's fleet renewal by taking ownership of many of the jets and leasing them back to IranAir."If there are significant restrictions, that would be a real issue" said Firoz Tarapore, Chief Executive of Dubai Aerospace.

 One of Boeing's most important customers just said something very troubling Benjamin Zhang Sep. 18, 2016, 11:45 AM 33,412 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Norwegian Air Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. Flickr/Eric Salard Norwegian Air is making waves in the airline industry. Recently, Norwegian Air Chief Commercial Officer Thomas Ramdahl told Business Insider in an interview his airline plans to launch $69 fares on trans-Atlantic flights starting next year. As a long-time Boeing customer, Norwegian selected the new generation 737 MAX 8 to launch the new fare. In fact, the airline, which currently operates a fleet made up exclusively of more than 100 Boeing jets, has 100 of the planes on order. But there's more to this story. Even though the 737 Max has a range of about 4,000 miles, there are routes where Norwegian will need greater range than the plane can deliver but won't require the services of a pricey wide-body jet. In other words, Norwegian is in need of a 'tweener. Traditionally, those routes have been the domain of Boeing's 757. However, Boeing discontinued the controversial plane in 2004 and still does not have an aircraft capable of matching its capabilities, although Boeing did tell Business Insider that it is currently studying the possibility of a 757 replacement. An Airbus A321neo LR. Airbus That's where the 30 A321neo LR jets Norwegian ordered from Boeing's arch rival, Airbus, come into play. "From the figures I've seen so far, the A321neo LR will have longer range than the MAX, so that gives us opportunities in smaller cities where frequency is more important than having a large wide-body jet," Ramdahl said. While some airlines are holding onto their aging fleets of 757s, Norwegian seems to believe that it may have found a worthy successor for the long-serving jet. "It's difficult to say yes or no, but I think so," Ramdahl told us when asked if the A321neo LR is a true replacement for the 757. "It's interesting to see if Boeing is coming up with a replacement for the 757 as well, because they'll need to if the LR does what Airbus is saying it will do." In fact, Ramdahl told us that the A321neo offers 10% to 15% lower costs per seat than a wide-body jet. Based on Airbus' projected range of more than 4,600 miles, the A321neo LR should be able to match or beat the 757's range, the Norwegian executive told Business Insider. In addition, Norwegian Air's A321's are expected to be equipped with 220 to 230 seats — which is on par with the capacity of the 757-200. A La Compagnie Boeing 757-200. La Compagnie This is potentially distressing news for Boeing. Even though the segment traditionally occupied by the 757 is not as large as the 737s or as profitable as the large wide-bodies, there is still plenty of demand for airplanes of its type. With the LR outselling its Boeing rival — the 737 MAX 9 — 5 to 1, it looks like Airbus is the only one with a truly competitive product on offer in the segment. And if a major, long-time customer like Norwegian is willing to defect, then it certainly stacks the deck against Boeing when it comes to drawing customers. The 737 MAX jets features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. It's one of the most advanced and efficient airliners in the world. The A321neo LR also features upgraded avionics and aerodynamics but is equipped with a more powerful CFM LEAP-1A engine. However, Boeing is not in a position to simply bolt on larger engines to match the A321neo LR's range, because there is a direct correlation between the diameter of a turbofan engine's fan blades and the amount of thrust the engine can produce. For example, the more powerful 1A engine's fan blades have a diameter of 78 inches — 9 more than the 1B. A Norwegian Boeing 737 MAX 8. Boeing An upgrade to a larger engine will likely involve a redesign of the 737's landing gear. That's because the 737 was designed in the 1960s to be powered by Pratt & Whitney's JT8D engine with a much more compact fan diameter of 49 inches. Since then, Boeing has been bolting larger and larger engines onto the 737, but the under-wing space has not changed. The 737 has essentially maxed out on the engine size that can fit under its wings. As a result, Boeing will have to raise and relocate the plane's landing gear. This means that whether it decides to modify the 737 or to build a new plane from scratch, it'll be a move that will likely cost billions. Norwegian expects to take delivery of its 737 MAX 8 in 2017, with the first A321neo LR expected in 2019.

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French Iran says US to OK its plane purchases Sun Sep 18, 2016 1:7PM Home Iran Economy Iran says it expects the US Treasury to approve sales of planes by aviation including giants Airbus and Boeing to the country by the end of September. Iran says it has been told that the US Treasury Department will approve licenses for global aviation giants such as Airbus and Boeing to export planes to the country within the next weeks. "Today we are expecting that (approval) by the end of September for Boeing, Airbus and ATR," Iran’s Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. Fakhrieh Kashan emphasized that the Treasury approval was expected to be issues by the end of August and warned that any failure by the US to approve the licenses would breach a nuclear deal that Iran sealed with the P5+1 group of countries – the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany – last year.  On a related front, Iran’s Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told reporters that Tehran the Islamic Republic hopes that the US Treasury would soon move to facilitate purchases of planes by the country.  Akhoundi further emphasized that the strong participation by aviation companies in the CAPA event shows that all businesses in this industry want the US to move ahead with approving sales of planes to Iran.       The Iranian minister further emphasized that Tehran has no problems in providing the required funds for its planned purchases of planes.  He added that the country is ready to proceed with other aviation companies over purchases of planes.  Any new negotiation with the companies, Akhoundi emphasized, will nonetheless depend on a much-delayed move by the US Treasury to lift restrictions in dealing with the Islamic Republic.    Loading ...

Photograph: Vahid Salemi/AP Reuters in Tehran Sunday 18 September 2016 09.29 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.32 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 2 months old Iran urged the US on Sunday to remove remaining obstacles to its ability to buy passenger planes, following the lifting of international sanctions, and it spread out the welcome mat to foreign investors as it seeks to boost its aviation sector. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy more than 200 jets worth $50bn at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning US treasury approval, which is needed due to the high proportion of US parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe’s Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of US dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are reimposed. West failing to deliver nuclear deal promises, says Iran vice-president Read more Roads and urban development minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and meanwhile continued to negotiate with other plane makers. “We are negotiating with all those big names … There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved,” he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under US sanctions. US critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a US blacklist, such as the country’s largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. “We have a contract. We will stick to it,” he said. He also told a news conference that the Tehran event, attended by dozens of foreign firms, proved that aviation was international in scope and “the US government cannot stand against it”, according to a translation of his remarks. The House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by Barack Obama. Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years. Besides the aircraft sales, Iran is dangling the prospect of significant business for western companies including nationwide airport expansion as it emerges from decades of sanctions. “There are more than 60 airports in Iran, but 80% of flights are in just 10 and these are working beyond capacity; that is why we need to develop,” Akhoundi said. “They are all ready to attract investors, who are welcome to invest in any part,” he told the conference held at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport, which plans a $2.8bn expansion.

McIntyre September 18, 2016 8:59 am EST Print Email Tweet Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), humbled by competition from Airbus, financial results that have not met expectations, fraud accusations and mechanical problems with one of its planes, has had a share price of 12.37% this year, the largest drop of any Dow Jones Industrial Average component. Its current share price is $126.71. The Dow has moved the other direction. It has risen 4.01% to 18,123.80. Twenty of the 30 Dow stocks are higher this year. Among Boeing’s troubles is its disclosure of a large drop in its earnings forecast. According to MarketWatch, [T]he aircraft maker warned second-quarter charges will reach $2.05 billion, stemming from setbacks and difficulties in three separate programs and including problems related to weaker air-cargo market trends. In its 787 program, Boeing decided not to invest funds for the refurbishment and sale of the two remaining unsold flight test aircraft. The costs associated with these aircraft were reclassified to research and development expenses, resulting in a non-cash after-tax charge of $847 million, Boeing said in a statement. Moreover, due to “current and anticipated weakness” in the air-cargo market, Boeing will no longer increase the production rate of its 747-8 aircraft in 2019, resulting in a $814 million after-tax charge, also reflecting lower estimated revenues on future aircraft sales. The company will also recognize a $393 million after-tax charge related to its KC-46 Tanker program, to account for higher costs associated with the previously announced program schedule and technical challenges, Boeing said. Boeing will update its 2017 guidance when it reports second-quarter earnings on July 27, the company said. Although earnings beat expectations, the numbers from the most recent quarter were poor. Revenue was up only 1% to $24.8 billion. The company posted a net loss of $234 million, compared to a profit of $1.1 billion in the same quarter a year ago. If orders, earnings and revenue do not rise soon, Boeing could be at the bottom of the Dow list at year end. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Photo / Mike Kane The smallest aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus Group are about to find a new role operating trans-Atlantic routes that were previously the preserve of some of the world's biggest planes. The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 per cent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range -- just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern US and Western Europe. While eight hours on a 130-foot plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travelers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn't otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. "The Max is very competitive," Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. "It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure." Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Continued below. Related Content Cartoon: Uncle Sam is 'well and truly impaled' The best workplace in New Zealand named Meet New Zealand's youngest politician and high school drop-out Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines and link St. John's, Newfoundland, with Dublin -- distance 2,000 miles -- and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The UK and Irish routes planned for Norwegian's 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus's A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with "trans-Atlantic range." TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the US. For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city.Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 -- dubbed the Max 10 -- that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. "For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there," said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. "But they're coming."

(Starbucks) Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner disputes Donald Trump’s assertions that the company’s jobs will go to China. Also: Starbucks’ new video series, called “Upstanders,” likely won’t be its last foray into original content; and Amazon’s Alexa talks about Safeco insurance. Share story By Seattle Times staff Seattle Times business staff Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has declared while campaigning that Boeing will move American jobs to China, emptying U.S. plants. “China is making them build a massive airline facility, right? Massive, like bigger than anything you’ve seen. You feel good about Boeing right now? Tell me in five years … All of a sudden you’re gonna be reading a big front-page story, all over the place, that Boeing is going to leave South Carolina, they’re going to make all their planes in China. Because that’s what they do,” he told a Walterboro, S.C., crowd earlier this year. Boeing hasn’t challenged him on this publicly before, but this past week Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner initiated a phone interview specifically to declare emphatically this is not true. Conner said, “Trump has made an issue about our involvement with the Chinese assembly center, saying we’ll move all these jobs to China.” Most Read Stories Trump supporter in state Senate says some protests are ‘economic terrorism,’ should be felonies Flesh-eating bacteria traced to tilapia bought from Bellevue market Earl Thomas, Rob Gronkowski have cool Twitter exchange about hard hit in Sunday's game Should California, Oregon and Washington join Canada? #Calexit talk envelops West Coast Cheap Eats: Some of Seattle’s greatest food isn’t found at the priciest places | PNW Magazine  WATCHUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. That’s not the case, Conner insisted. The Chinese center, announced a year ago when Chinese President Xi was in town, is “our largest opportunity for sales, creating an expanded relationship, but it will also create more jobs here. It’s lopsided on what we get and give — we get more. It’s being portrayed as the opposite.” The 737s sold to Chinese airlines will continue to be assembled in the Puget Sound region, then flown to China, where they will be painted and have the interior installed. The deal, Conner said, actually protects Boeing by limiting intellectual-property transfer. More than 70 percent of Boeing’s commercial-jet deliveries are outside the United States. China needs an estimated 6,000 airliners over the next 20 years. In addition to competition from Airbus, Boeing faces the certainty that China will field an indigenous commercial airliner, too. The finishing center keeps Boeing solidly in the game. Aerospace altogether generates 1.5 million American jobs and is the bedrock of many small companies. Conner is also concerned about the general anti-trade rhetoric of the election. For example, both Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership. “Some people do get impacted by trade agreements, no question. In general, these create more opportunity. The right controls need to be in place to protect American workers. But these agreements aren’t as bad as being portrayed,” Conner said in the interview. “We … need to be cognizant how important trade is to this region,” he said. “Boeing for sure, but this region. People need to take time to educate themselves. It sounds good to take it back to a time when life seemed better. But the world will not sit still. “We need to make the best agreements possible. But to shut our doors to the rest of the world would be a real problem.” — Jon Talton: jtalton@seattletimes.com Starbucks’ series a bid to inspire Starbucks’ first foray into creating original content — a series of videos, podcasts and stories it calls “Upstanders”, highlighting ordinary Americans doing inspirational things — likely won’t be its last. Certainly, the series is meant to be uplifting, providing examples of things people could do to better their communities. And it falls in line with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz’s ruminations about the role of corporations in public life. “For the last couple of years, we’ve been asking: What is the role and responsibility of a public company?” Schultz said during a screening of “Upstanders” Monday night at the SIFF Cinema Egyptian. That role, he believes, is not just to make money but also to “elevate discourse, provide a significant understanding that we, as a corporation, as private citizens, need to do more to advance the cause of social impact in our communities.” But that’s not to say there isn’t also a bottom-line reason the company is getting into creating original content. “For any consumer brand, especially a brick-and-mortar retailer like Starbucks, the rules of engagement, because of Amazon and mobile commerce, are really changing,” Schultz said. Companies such as Starbucks now have to create “something really experiential” in the stores, he said — like the Roasteries that Starbucks has opened as a multisensory showcase for its higher-end beans and drinks. But companies also have to enhance the emotional connection with consumers even outside the stores, and extend the relevancy of their brands, Schultz said. “We’re never going to become a media company,” he said. “But we can extend the brand and the experience through media and original content.” He envisions people viewing such content via the Starbucks app on their smartphones, an important business tool for the company. Currently, a quarter of all transactions are conducted through the company’s mobile app. Others have recognized the reach of Starbucks’ mobile app, with the company being approached to put movie trailers on it, for instance. But Schultz said it was important to him to “leverage our scale for good and do something around original content — and not to do that in a commercial way.” For instance, the Upstanders series of 10 minidocumentary films, each five to six minutes long, does not promote Starbucks products. The series is written and produced by Schultz and Rajiv Chandrasekaran, Starbucks executive producer and a former senior editor of The Washington Post. The series debuted last week and can be viewed online, through the Starbucks mobile app, and via the company’s in-store digital network. The series showcases people such as a church pastor who reached out to local Muslims building an Islamic center nearby; a former NFL player who started a workout group for wounded veterans; and townspeople who banded together to raise money for college scholarships for every student in town. Also featured in the series are two people who attended the showing at the Egyptian: Sue Rahr, director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission and former King County sheriff, who’s working on changing the way police officers are trained; and Susan Burton, who spent years in prison and is now helping keep other female ex-convicts from returning to prison by providing them with a place to live. At Monday’s screening, Burton’s daughter, who also attended, said it would soon be her birthday and that the film about her mother was “the best birthday present.” It had been a long road, she said, getting to where she could believe in her mother again. Burton, in reply, said that she couldn’t get back years of going in and out of prison but that, through her work, she could help others get their sons and daughters back — and that through that work, “I got my daughter back.” — Janet I. Tu: jtu@seattletimes.com Alexa, can we talk about insurance? Nobody wants to talk about insurance. But Safeco Insurance is betting that doing so through Alexa, Amazon’s voice-powered artificial-intelligence concierge, will make the conversation smoother. Seattle-based Safeco has released a new Alexa app dubbed the “Insurance Advisor.” It won’t talk you through a roof replacement or any other crisis, but it can explain insurance’s often jargony terms, or find a local independent agent for those interested in specific kinds of policies. “We know insurance is a complicated, confusing space,” said Samuel Affolter, who heads Safeco’s research and innovation efforts. “This provides an easy way for consumers to get that type of information about insurance.” Safeco’s arrival on the Echo, the voice-powered Amazon speaker that uses Alexa, illustrates how Amazon’s decision to make Alexa an open platform for third-party developers is paying off in the rapid proliferation of apps. This past week Amazon.com reported that the number of Alexa apps, or “skills,” has tripled to about 3,000 since June. New apps being launched include a Twitter reader, and a GE appliances “skill” to control kitchen appliances. “Today there are tens of thousands of developers building Alexa skills,” the company said in a news release. “The fact that they open-sourced their (software development kit) is the reason we were able to do what we’ve done with Alexa,” Affolter said in an interview. “It they hadn’t done that, it’d be the same as Google Now or Siri,” platforms that also interact with the human voice but until recently were tightly controlled. (Apple in June said it would allow third-party developers to tap into Siri’s voice abilities, something Google did in March, according to news reports.) Safeco’s app, which took about three months to develop, also showcases both the promise and the limitations of the Alexa platform, which animates the Echo speaker and other devices, including a recently launched tablet. The interface — the human voice — is naturally inviting; Liberty Mutual, Safeco’s parent company, makes much of a Gartner study that predicts that 30 percent of interactions between users and computers will be through the voice by 2018. But actions initiated by voice commands remain in the realm of the relatively straightforward: hail an Uber, order a pizza, play some music, query information. In the case of Safeco’s app, the voice interaction replaces the act of pulling a phone out of a pocket and typing an insurance question into a web browser. The high-stakes matters of opening a claim or selling an insurance product seem at this point to be well beyond Alexa’s skills. “Those independent agents can do a lot for them, probably better than anything we can do within the virtual assistant,” Affolter said. Liberty Mutual, based in Boston, is also working on its Alexa app, which it promises to release in the fall. It is expected to give what Liberty calls “actionable advice” on typical home and auto concerns, and take the complexity up a notch by providing a car insurance estimate. Affolter said Safeco is already working on finding new Alexa-borne solutions not only for general insurance inquiries, but for more specific questions from its customers. “I think there’s a ton of opportunity there,” he said. — Ángel González: agonzalez@seattletimes.com Seattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Denmark rejected the Boeing Super Hornet, touted by Liberal insiders as the best jet for Canada. Instead, it decided to buy the same F-35 stealth fighter the Harper government originally wanted. But Boeing calls Denmark’s procurement process flawed. The company has submitted a “request for insight,” which would require the country’s defence ministry to provide the data used to pick the F-35 over the Super Hornet. Boeing said this is the first stage for a formal legal challenge of the proposed F-35 purchase. Related Liberals pay $33 million to stay in F-35 development program, despite promise not to buy the fighter jet F-35, the aircraft Trudeau said is ‘far from working,’ now declared ready for combat by U.S. Air Force F-35 exit strategy: Canada could pay about $313M to pull out of jet program, defence documents show The U.S. airplane maker is questioning how the Danes decided the Super Hornet would cost significantly more than the F-35, pointing out U.S. Defence Department budget information indicates otherwise. Denmark would be paying about US$83 million for each F-35, according to reports, compared with US$122 million for a Super Hornet. Alan Williams, former procurement chief for the Department of National Defence (DND), said Boeing seems to have a case. It would also be able to mount a legal challenge under the Canadian system. “The current data have the U.S. government putting the fly-away cost of the F-35 as about $99 million, so if I’m Boeing and see that someone is claiming $83 million, then I would know that’s not accurate,” said Williams, who oversaw Canada’s entry into the F-35 program. “If the same thing happened in Canada, they would also know such a price is fictitious.” Denmark will buy 27 F-35s. The Danes say the aircraft offers more value than the Super Hornet in terms of military, strategic, economic and industrial criteria. But Boeing insists Denmark inaccurately assessed the plane’s cost and capability. “We’re taking this step because there’s too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet,” said Debbie Rub, a Boeing vice-president. Peter Christensen, the Danish defence minister, has said Boeing would be given the information it requested. The Danish procurement was “a very thorough and transparent process,” he added. Airbus, the European aerospace giant, is also concerned about Denmark’s evaluation process. The firm, which led a consortium offering the Eurofighter, is in discussions with Denmark to better understand how it picked the F-35. During last year’s election campaign, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau promised Canada would not buy the F-35, an aircraft he said was unnecessary for the country’s needs and too expensive. If the same thing happened in Canada, they would also know such a price is fictitious In the summer Ottawa looked at a sole source purchase of Super Hornets. But that was shelved after Lockheed Martin threatened to freeze out Canadian aerospace firms from working on the F-35. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has said he is interested in an open competition to pick a replacement for the CF-18 fighter jets. How the government will now proceed is unknown. Five companies recently responded to its call for information about fighter jets:  Boeing (Super Hornet), Lockheed Martin (F-35A), Dassault (Rafale), Eurofighter (Typhoon) and the Saab Group (Gripen). The F-35 became a major political headache several years ago for the Conservative government. Although a Liberal government originally signed on to a research and development program for the plane, the Conservatives significantly expanded commitment and later agreed to buy 65 of the planes. But the F-35 program has been dogged by controversy and the aircraft has faced numerous technical problems. The DND originally claimed the project would cost about $14.7 billion, but then-parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page said it would be about $29 billion. An independent audit ordered by the Conservative government put the cost at $44 billion over the 42-year life of the plane. That figure included everything from maintenance to fuel. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Flight MH370 Flap Part Confirmation Could Help Unravel the Mystery of the Ill-Fated Plane, Experts Claim Posted By: Faramarz HedayatiPosted date: September 18, 2016In: Social Page 1 of 212» The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has confirmed on September 15 that the flap section found on the island of Pemba off the coast of the east African country of Tanzania in June belongs to the ill-fated Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370. The latest ATSB announcement comes as the official search for the wreckage of the plane in the vast Indian Ocean is set to be concluded in December, notes the International Business Times. The large flap section is just one of the many debris found over the last couple of months mostly on the eastern shores of Africa. In its official report, the ATSB said that upon the flap section’s arrival, several part numbers were immediately located on the debris that confirmed the preliminary identification. The initial findings were consistent with the physical appearance, dimensions, and construction of the part. The bureau added that all of the identification stamps had a second OL number, in addition to the Boeing part number that was the unique identifier related to part construction. Boeing subsequently recovered build records for the numbers located on the part and confirmed that all of the numbers related to the same serial numbered outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404 are the same. Based on the company’s records, aircraft line number 404 was delivered to Malaysian Airlines and registered as 9M-MRO. Just like what they did to the flaperon found last year near the coast of Reunion Island off Madagascar, ATSB would use their confirmation on the flap section to determine how the debris drifted to its final resting place as affected by winds and currents. One of the biggest aviation mysteries of all time Investigators are confident that the confirmation of the flap section and the flaperon could help them solve one of the biggest aviation mysteries of all time, reports the Express of UK. They are still examining other pieces of debris that were found in Mozambique, South Africa, and the Rodrigues Island off the coast of Mauritius. There have been a number of conspiracy theories about the plane’s disappearance on March 8, 2014. There are those who are saying that Malaysian pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately crashed the plane into the ocean in a horrific suicide mission, which was denied by his family. Another theory suggested that the plane went down after a sudden loss of electricity or experiencing a flash fire in its cabin. Some investigators also pointed out the possibility in July that the plane may have glided and not plunged in its final moments. Fugro project director Paul Kennedy said that if the plane was manned, it could have glided a long way, which is why Flight MH370 veered way off course. Search will be officially ending soon Sometime last month, there were reports saying that the search operation for the wreckage of the Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 shall be suspended indefinitely if nothing turns up by December. However, because of the inclement weather conditions in the southern Hemisphere area where the search for the wreckage of the ill-fated Flight MH370, the team decided to halt everything for the time being until the weather becomes conducive, which would likely begin in October. The families of the victims of Flight MH370 took the news as a welcome development more than the announcement previously that the search will be suspended indefinitely. Flight MH370 was laden with 239 passengers onboard during its flight from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia to Beijing in China on March 8, 2014, and most of them were Chinese. The families of the victims believe that they would not have a complete closure if the wreckage and perhaps the remains of their relatives are still not found.

China is the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing's forecast. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4% annually in China over the next 20 years." Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes, such as the new 737 MAX 8 and current 737-800, through 2035, accounting for 75% of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X. This year's forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China's single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18% of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China's widebody fleet only represents approximately 5% of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. Worldwide, Boeing projects investments of $5.9 trillion for 39,620 new commercial airplanes to be delivered during the next 20 years. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model – the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies.

Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on a longer-than-expected process of winning U.S. Treasury approval, which is needed because of the high proportion of U.S. parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe's Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of U.S. dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are re-imposed. Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and continued to negotiate with other planemakers. "We are negotiating with all those big names. ... There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the U.S. Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under U.S. sanctions. ALSO READ: Iran executes Kurdish Islamists for armed attacks U.S. critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a U.S. blacklist, such as the country's largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. "We are committed to any contract that we sign," he said. Tweet Do you ever witness anything interesting or exciting?

Iran Presses For Banking Agreement To Facilitate Sanctions Pact International Business Times 9/18/2016 Reuters © Provided by IBT US Iran is pressing the United States to ease banking obstacles to the reopening of trade under last year's nuclear deal and hopes for progress on the sidelines of United Nations meetings in New York this week, an Iranian official said on Sunday. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 145.84 +0.51 +0.35% The country's national airline has provisionally agreed to buy U.S. and European aircraft worth over $50 billion at list prices, marking a high-profile test case for the reopening of its economy under a deal with world powers to ease sanctions. Nine months after the sanctions deal took effect, foreign banks are reluctant to get involved because of concerns that they could be caught up in restrictions applying to U.S. banks, which are still banned from doing business with Iran. Under the deal to lift nuclear-related sanctions, Iran can buy passenger planes and other goods but is not allowed to pay for them in dollars or to use the U.S. financial system, due to core U.S. sanctions that remain in force. The ban on paying in dollars is a particular headache for Boeing and international leasing companies, which usually account for their portfolios in the world's leading currency. Paying in other hard currencies could generate fleeting movements in the U.S. financial system known as U-Turn transactions, which are also banned. "We are negotiating and I hope that during the trip of President (Hassan) Rouhani to the U.S. today or tomorrow, we can have some news on the subject," Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told foreign investors at the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh is traveling to New York as part of Rouhani's delegation for the U.N. General Assembly. The United States has said it has no plans to reinstate "U-turn" authorization, which would allow foreign banks to use its financial system to transfer funds for some Iran-related trade. Iran wants to pay Boeing in dollars but failing such an agreement - which many observers consider unlikely - it wants the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to approve the financing as part of a separate process under which it must also grant licenses before jets can be exported to Iran. Industry sources say Boeing is talking to third-parties about handling the transactions and paying it in dollars, but is unlikely to proceed without clear guidance from Washington. Export Licenses Although it usually sells planes in dollars, France-based Airbus is expected to be paid in euros and would not need further permission to absorb the cash, industry sources said. However it does need the same U.S. export licenses as Boeing due to the high proportion of U.S. parts in its aircraft. Kashan said earlier he felt the U.S. Treasury export licenses for all of Iran's potential suppliers could be granted by end-September. Foreign banks, some of which have faced huge fines for breaking U.S. rules, are worried about financing the deals. "The problem for European banks is that we don't know the conditions under which OFAC will approve (the deals) and the second is that it is a question of reputation," Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director at Germany's DVB told Reuters. "Even if OFAC gives approval, what most of the big European banks fear, because they have great franchises in the U.S., is that there may be some fight-back in an unknown form and at an unknown time for the business they may have with Iran." Republicans who oppose the nuclear deal have warned against allowing Iran to use the dollar in business transactions. Lack of clarity over the currency regulations is also causing headaches for leasing companies which are expected to play a major role in Iran's fleet renewal by taking ownership of many of the jets and leasing them back to IranAir."If there are significant restrictions, that would be a real issue" said Firoz Tarapore, Chief Executive of Dubai Aerospace.

According to the U.S. Navy, Boeing and other sources, the P-8A is armed with missiles, mines, torpedoes, bombs, and a High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon system. The older P-8 type conducts anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, shipping interdiction and an electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) role. This involves carrying torpedoes, depth charges, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and other weapons. It is also able to drop and monitor sonobuoys.

It's not a rhetorical question -- it might be a question of financial life or death. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 18, 2016 at 10:13AM SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket explosion, microseconds after it began on September 1, 2016. Image source: YouTube still. For SpaceX, it's back to square one -- or more precisely, square zero. A little over three weeks ago, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket undergoing pre-launch testing at Cape Canaveral exploded on its launch pad. Along with the rocket, and an on-board Israeli satellite, the explosion sent SpaceX's year-long streak of successful launches up in smoke, resetting it to zero. Now the question is: How long will it take SpaceX to return to space? How long to get back to square one? A competitor chimes in Last week, a controversial headline from Reuters implied that United Launch Alliance (ULA) CEO Tory Bruno had predicted SpaceX would be out of commission for between nine and 12 months. Such an apparent assertion from a SpaceX rival (ULA is a joint venture between Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), two of the biggest names in spaceflight and two of SpaceX's biggest competitors), naturally raised eyebrows. But reaching out to ULA, I was able to confirm that Bruno wasn't predicting such a long delay for SpaceX in particular -- or even necessarily. Rather, Bruno referred to the results of an internal ULA study surveying "the entire history of rocket failures dating back decades," which suggested nine to 12 months was the norm for any space company recovering from a mishap. So, what does history tell us about this? A tale of two space explosions No Boeing or Lockheed rockets have blown up in ULA's past 111 launch attempts. Rival Arianespace, the Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) subsidiary, boasts a streak nearly as long: 73 successful flights by its Ariane 5 launch vehicle, and a 74-flight streak by the Ariane 4 before it. But there are a couple of recent examples to guide us. Orbital ATK and Antares Take Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA), for example. On October 28, 2014, an Orbital ATK Antares launch vehicle carrying supplies to the International Space Station exploded over Wallops Island in Virginia, mere moments after liftoff. It took more than 13 months for Orbital to return to space (on December 6, 2015). Even then, it did so not on its own rocket -- but on a Lockheed Martin Atlas V. 13 months -- that's already past the high mark on ULA's timeline for rocket companies recovering from a setback. What's more, Orbital's efforts to return to space on its own rockets (to be powered by upgraded RD-181 engines from Russia) seem to be taking longer than expected. The revamped Antares has yet to make an operational flight, and its planned launch in August was postponed until later this month -- nearly two full years after the explosion at Wallops. SpaceX and the Falcon 9 SpaceX itself provides our second example. Prior to this month's explosion, SpaceX had successfully launched nine rockets in 12 months without incident. Moreover, its first launch of the streak featured a history-making re-landing of the launched rocket on Earth. But what preceded that streak? On June 28, 2015, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket (like Orbital's, loaded with supplies for ISS) exploded two minutes into its flight -- the company's first failure after a previous streak of 20 successful launches. It took the company several weeks to confirm that a support strut within the rocket's second stage had failed, causing the explosion, and six months total to fix the problem and prepare Falcon 9 for its return to space. And there you have two examples -- one high of Bruno's nine-to-12 months estimate for the average time to return to space, and one below it. A question of financial life or death Facing the difficult task of determining what made its rocket explode when the "engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source" is a tough nut to crack. In fact, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says this month's "anomaly" is "the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years." But tough as the task seems today, SpaceX's previous success in getting its rocket ready to fly again in record time suggests the company may "beat the odds" again. In fact, SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton tells me SpaceX expects "to have identified and resolved the cause of the anomaly" and "return to flight in November" -- a mere two-month turnaround time. Let's hope that's true -- because if it takes much longer, SpaceX could be in real trouble. SpaceX isn't like United Launch Alliance, you see. Unlike ULA, it cannot depend on backing from widely diversified aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin to keep it afloat when things go awry. Unlike Ariane, it has no Airbus to fall back on. SpaceX isn't even like Orbital ATK, a diversified military hardware supplier with a thriving business in building satellites. SpaceX launches rockets -- and that's it. Aside from that space launch, SpaceX has precious few revenue streams to fall back on. Every minute that SpaceX must spend figuring out why its rockets are blowing up, instead of launching them, is time the company is not collecting revenue, not earning profits, and not making progress toward Elon Musk's goal of amassing enough money to finance a manned mission to Mars. So long as SpaceX is kept busy figuring out the SpaceXplosion phenomenon, there can be no relaunch of a "used rocket," and no test launch of the company's new Falcon Heavy rocket, either. Meanwhile, SpaceX's website continues to describe the company as "profitable and cash-flow positive" -- even after two explosions and a combined seven months of inactivity over the past 15 months. The longer SpaceX remains grounded, though, the more questionable those claims will become. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 145.84 +0.51 +0.35% Singapore Airlines Ltd SINGY ▼ 13.57 -0.44 -3.11% Delta Air Lines Inc DAL ▲ 48.72 +0.21 +0.43% As impressive and attention grabbing as the aircraft may be, it hasn't had the same paradigm-shifting effect that the Boeing 747 had upon its debut decades earlier.  Most of the airlines around the world who either operate the A380 or are thinking about investing in the plane have struggled to figure out a way to maximize its revenue generating potential. As a result, Airbus has struggled mightily over the past few years to find new customers for its flagship airliner.  However, the double-decker jet has no bigger supporter than Emirates Airlines. Of the 319 orders Airbus has won for the super jumbo, 140 of them have come from the Dubai-based airline. In comparison, Singapore Airlines has the second largest order with 24 A380s. < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 4NEXT SLIDE > Airbus A380 © Provided by Business Insider Why does Emirates love the A380 so much? "Airport congestion around the world is getting worse," Emirates President Sir Tim Clark told Business Insider. "And up-gauging aircraft is a solution for this." Emirates' business strategy involves funneling large masses of people to its palatial home base in Dubai and dispatching them to various destinations around the world. Often times, those destinations are either well-developed first world cities or under developed third-world cities, that are both plagued by airports bursting at the seams with people and planes.  According to Sir Tim Clark, the A380 allows Emirates to get ahead of congestion issues at major airport around the world. With infrastructure struggling to keep up with demand for landing slots and airport gates, the superjumbo allows the airline to increase passenger volume with fewer aircraft and fewer flights. "It works great for our network structure's long-haul to long-haul connections," Emirates senior vice president for operations Hubert Frach told Business Insider in an interview. "It allows us to offer efficient connections between developing economies with well established economies." As a result, Emirates and its centrally located-Dubai base has become a gateway — connecting Europe and North America with Africa and Asia.  While other carriers operating the A380 have concerns over filling the double decker's cavernous cabin, Emirates does not seem to have that concern. "Although you can't operate each and every destination with the aircraft, we do see the demand pull of the A380," Frach said. "Take London for example. We operate nine A380 flights into London every day and, believe me, they are all full." And the strategy seems to be working. In May, Emirates announced a record $1.93 billion profit for the last fiscal year with a margin of 8.4%. Although it should be noted that Emirates, along with the rest of the airline industry, has benefited greatly from plummeting fuel costs. In addition, the rapid growth of Emirates and its fellow Middle Eastern carriers Etihad and Qatar have come under criticism from American, United, and Delta Air Lines. The US3 allege that the ME3's stellar performance and service are unfairly augmented by as much as $42 billion in subsidies over the past 10 years. The ME3 have denied these allegations. In addition to the operational benefits of the A380, it's also a great marketing piece. "At the Berlin Air Show, we usually bring a brand new A380 that's just been delivered from the Airbus factory in Hamburg and the line to see the plane usually a mile long," Sir Tim Clark told us while in New York for the US Open tennis tournament for which his airline is a major sponsor.  It's a sentiment echoed by Frach. "Every time I'm on an A380, I still see people taking selfies and photos of the plane," the executive added. "It's iconic and it's a customer magnet." Emirates isn't the only airline that understands the marketing power of the superjumbo. In May, Qatar Airways launched its inaugural flight to Atlanta — the home fortress for Delta, arguably the Middle Eastern airlines' staunchest critic. Although the flight is normally operated by a smaller Boeing 777, Qatar decided to make a splash by rolling into town with a superjumbo — an aircraft Delta does not possess in its 800-plane fleet. Etihad operates its glamour routes to London and New York using its A380s as well. Why don't more airlines buy the A380? If the A380 works so well for Emirates, why don't more airlines around the world commit to the plane? "Since the great recession, airlines around the world are run by risk averse boards who don't want to spend $400 million on a single plane,"  Clark said. "Here, we don't have that, it's just me and my boss (Emirates Group chairman H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum)." Due to geography, Emirates operates only international flights and boasts a fleet of roughly 250 wide-body long haul jets. In addition to the world's largest fleet of A380s, it also boasts the world's largest fleet of Boeing 777s with more than 150 of the twin-engined jets.   However, the reality of the A380 is that it is the largest and most expensive airliner in the world at $428 million a plane. Boeing's 777-9X is second at $400 million. Even though it's capable of offering its operators the lowest per-seat cost of any airliner in the world, its four-massive turbo fan engines are far from economical. As a result, even Emirates' well-financed neighbor Etihad have limited its fleet of A380s to just 10 planes.  "No, we're done," Etihad Aviation Group CEO James Hogan told Business Insider last year when asked whether he'd buy more A380s. "We just believe in two-engine technology — they are much more efficient."  But for now, the Airbus A380 is alive and moving forward with its most important customer.   "We are taking another 50 or so A380s," Clark said. "So we're keeping the production line going."

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 18, 2016 at 8:13AM Image source: United States Navy via Flickr. August was not a kind month to unmanned aerial vehicle maker AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV). News that the company's revenues had declined 23% in fiscal Q1, while losses swelled 66%, sent AeroVironment's shares into a tailspin -- down 19% in a single day. But fear not, says AeroVironment. There's better news on the way -- and you can thank the U.S. Navy for it. Eyes in the sky On Sept. 7, AeroVironment announced the successful completion of a run of tests it conducted with the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. These tests showed how U.S. navy submarines can use AeroVironment Blackwing unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) to communicate with "swarms" of drone submarines (called unmanned underwater vehicles, or UUVs). "Using an open-architecture communication system," says AV, Navy subs of the future will be able to communicate with and "control ... multiple unmanned vehicles over long distances." And there's more. At the same time they help sub-drivers to control "a swarm of unmanned undersea vehicles" wirelessly, these same Blackwings serve another purpose: As aerial eyes in the sky, they can beam down "unique intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability to submarine commanders." "Swarms"? Do we even have "swarms"? Now, if you've been following news in the world of underwater military robots, you know that the Navy does not actually possess literal "swarms" of UUVs for Blackwing to talk with. It has "a handful" at best. Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), and Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) all have prototype UUVs in development. And presumably, these are the "multiple UUVs" that Blackwing was communicating with during the Navy's Annual Naval Technology Exercise on Aug. 16, where Blackwing was tested.  In fact, if you squint, you can probably just make out depictions of Boeing's Echo Ranger, General Dynamics' Knifefish, and what might be either Huntington Ingalls' Proteus or Lockheed Martin's troubled "RMMV" drone submarines in AeroVironment's illustration of the Blackwing in action: Image source: AeroVironment. What it means for investors But that's not the point. Even if AeroVironment perhaps stretched the definition of "swarms" a bit, the major thesis of its argument rings true. Earlier this year, AV confirmed U.S. Navy plans in place to deploy its Blackwing across its fleet of attack and guided missile submarines. That fleet currently boasts 70 boats, with more on the way. As I've stated before, my best guess at the value of deploying Blackwing across this fleet is that it's worth roughly $5 million in revenue to AeroVironment, multiplied by the number of Blackwings deployed per submarine. I also assume that each sub would carry multiple Blackwings -- and now we're learning there may be more revenue streams in play as Blackwing gains new capability in commanding and controlling remotely operated drone subs. AeroVironment is notorious for holding the price of its wares close to the vest, so it's hard to say at this point precisely how big of a revenue opportunity this is. But for a small defense contractor like AV, it sure does sound like a sizable opportunity. One more thing: In its press release describing Blackwing, AeroVironment also disclosed that it has partnered with Sparton Corporation (NYSE:SPA) on the project. Smaller in size than General Dynamics or Huntington, and far smaller than Boeing and Lockheed, Sparton boasts a revenue stream 65% greater than AeroVironment's own -- but a market cap less than half AV's size. If you think AeroVironment is worth investing in on the prospect that Blackwing will take off, Sparton Corp may make for an even more promising opportunity.

Tehran provisionally agreed this year to buy more than 200 jets worth US$50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Iran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of US dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are re-imposed. The roads and urban development minister Abbas Akhoundi said Iran was complying with its obligations and meanwhile continued to negotiate with other plane makers. "We are negotiating with all those big names … There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," he told the Capa summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the US Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under US sanctions. US critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by the national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a US blacklist, such as the country’s largest carrier, Mahan Air. The house of representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the senate and signed by the US president Barack Obama. Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years. The country is also planning nationwide airport expansion. "There are more than 60 airports in Iran but 80 per cent of flights are in just 10 and these are working beyond capacity; that is why we need to develop," Mr Akhoundi said. "They are all ready to attract investors, who are welcome to invest in any part," he told the conference held at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport, which plans a $2.8bn expansion. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related As the US withdraws, what changes must be made?

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 18 September 2016 | MYT 6:38 PM Iran expects U.S. export licences for aircraft at end-Sept - official TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iran has been told that the United States will issue export licences within weeks to facilitate the purchase of Boeing and Airbus jets and European ATR turboprop planes, a senior Iranian official said on Sunday. Approval had been expected by the end of August, but that has been pushed back to the end of September, Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan said. "Today we are expecting that (approval) by the end of September for Boeing, Airbus and ATR," he told the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. The U.S. Treasury can veto sales of modern aircraft to Iran, including non-U.S. ones, due to the high proportion of U.S. parts. Failure to issue the required U.S. approval would breach an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities, Kashan said. An Iranair official said the airline is meanwhile looking to acquire second-hand aircraft or hire crewed aircraft to help meet its most urgent needs.

Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning U.S. Treasury approval, which is needed due to the high proportion of U.S. parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe's Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of U.S. dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are re-imposed. Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and meanwhile continued to negotiate with other planemakers. "We are negotiating with all those big names ... There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the U.S. Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under U.S. sanctions. U.S. critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a U.S. blacklist, such as the country's largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. "We have a contract. We will stick to it," he said. He also told a news conference that the Tehran event, attended by dozens of foreign firms, proved that aviation was international in scope and "the U.S. government cannot stand against it," according to a translation of his remarks. The House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama.     Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years. Besides the aircraft sales, Iran is dangling the prospect of significant business for Western companies including nationwide airport expansion as it emerges from decades of sanctions. "There are more than 60 airports in Iran but 80 percent of flights are in just 10 and these are working beyond capacity; that is why we need to develop," Akhoundi said. "They are all ready to attract investors, who are welcome to invest in any part," he told the conference held at Tehran's Imam Khomeini airport, which plans a $2.8 billion expansion.

Comair CEO Erik Venter said this week that for everyone to stay in business, an airline had to go belly-up or airfares needed to increase. Aviation analyst Joachim Vermooten said there was over capacity due to SAA and Mango increasing their aircraft and the entry of FlySafair. Turning to Africa, Venter said that routes in Africa were “very thin” and most routes could only handle one airline. If another airline entered a route, both airlines would become lossmaking. “Opportunities in Africa are few and far between.” Comair has taken delivery of three new 737-800s from Boeing, with the last aircraft from the original order of eight aircraft scheduled for delivery in November. The delivery of eight Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft will be made from 2019 to 2021. Venter said that the new aircraft saved Comair about R20 million in costs a year because they were more cost-efficient and reliable. “These are bigger aircraft and more seats can be sold,” he said. Comair was focused on its non-airline interests for growth and these included its airport lounges, pilot training centre and on-board food catering unit, Venter said. The airline would like to see half of its profits coming from its non-airline interests, up from 18% at the moment, he added. Venter said the new SAA board had “strong people”, but there was only so much they could do because the airline didn’t have the right people in its top executive. Venter said that Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was likely to have persuaded a number of new board members to sit on the board. “If Pravin Gordhan goes, those people are also likely to go,” he said during an interview. At least six of SAA’s top 13 executives are in an “acting” or “interim” capacity, including CEO Musa Zwane. At the beginning of this month, Cabinet reappointed Dudu Myeni as SAA chair for a further year and appointed 11 new nonexecutive directors for three years, starting this month. SAA’s new board has three nonexecutives that have aviation industry experience. They are Myeni; deputy chairperson Tryphosa Ramano, who was SAA chief financial officer from 2004 to 2006; and Thandeka Mgoduso, who has served on the board of Air Traffic Navigation Services. Comair, which owns the local British Airways (BA) and kulula.com businesses, has a 17-person board and Venter said that five nonexecutive directors, excluding executives on the board, had aviation industry experience. These included Comair chairman Pieter van Hoven, who was Comair managing director from 1980 to 2006; Martin Moritz, Comair deputy chairman, who has been involved with Comair since 1969; Wrenelle Stander, a Comair nonexecutive and previously CEO of Air Traffic and Navigation Services; Khutso Mampeule, a Comair nonexecutive, who was CEO of SA Express from 1999 to 2001; and Gavin Halliday, a Comair nonexecutive, who served at BA for 18 years. Comair has brought a damages claim of as much as R2 billion, once interest has been factored in, against SAA for abusing its market dominance.

"There is no problem for selling airplanes to Iran and conditions are ripe for obtaining license from Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)," Benturd told reporters in Ashgabat on Friday. He underlined that Boeing and the Iranian airliners are continuing their talks on the sale of passenger planes. OFAC is a financial intelligence and enforcement agency of the US Treasury Department. In mid-June, Head of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) and Deputy Road Minister Ali Abedzadeh announced that the country has signed a deal with Boeing on purchasing 100 planes from the US manufacturer. "The two sides reached a written agreement to purchase 100 planes," Abedzadeh said. He said that the written agreement was made after representatives of Iran and Boeing company held several rounds of talks, adding that the planes will be provided to Tehran through a financing deal. Earlier this month, Iranian Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi had also disclosed that the country has reached an agreement with global aviation giant Boeing. "We have reached a deal with the global aviation giant Boeing over the purchase of new planes that could set a new milestone in the country’s efforts to revamp its aging air fleet," Akhoundi said. The Iranian minister reiterated that the deal with Boeing has been finalized, and said, "Its details will be announced within next few days." Akhoundi reiterated that Iran has been able to save at least $5 million in its last negotiations over the finalization of the purchase.         Related News Japan's Mitsubishi Emerging as New Rival for Boeing, Airbus in Iran's Aviation Industry  Iran Declares Deal with Boeing  Minister: Iran, Boeing Agree on Airplane Purchase Deal  Official: Iran Negotiating with Boeing to Buy Aircraft from Giant Aviation Company  Boeing Official: Iran Can Purchase Airplanes in Euro  Boeing to Fix “Dollar Issue” for Iran Plane Deals  Boeing Offers 3 Plane Models to Iran  Boeing Due in Tehran Next Week to Talk Planes  LATEST STORIES (48) Syrian Soldiers Clash Fiercely with Nusra Terrorists in Dara'a City 15 Terrorists Killed, Wounded in Syrian Army Shelling in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Storms ISIL's Positions in Energy-Rich Region in Deir Ezzur 20 ISIL Terrorists Killed in Army Attacks in Deir Ezzur AEOI Spokesman: Iran to Export Extra Heavy Water to Foreign Countries Thailand Calls for Boosting Tourism Cooperation with Iran Commander: Iranian Navy to Provide Security for Further Development of Makran Coastline Iran, France to Hold Joint Economic Commission Meeting in Tehran Soon Terrorists Suffer Heavy Casualties in Syrian Army, Air Force Attacks in Aleppo Syrian Army Continues to Shell ISIL's Defense Lines in Eastern Homs Intelligence Minister: Enemies Unable to Distort Security in Iran Senior Cleric Blasts US for Sponsoring Terrorism in Region Iran Calls for Lifting Visa Barrier with Russia Entire Members of Terrorist Group Killed in Clashes with Syrian Army in Deir Ezzur Iran, Norway Ink MoU on Oilfield Development Syrian Soldiers Clash Fiercely with Nusra Terrorists in Dara'a City TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian military forces engaged in heavy fighting with the militants of Fatah al-Sham Front (previously known as the al-Nusra Front) in Dara'a al-Balad district, killing several terrorists and destroying their positions. 15 Terrorists Killed, Wounded in Syrian Army Shelling in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian Army's artillery units opened heavy fire at the concentration centers of Fatah al-Sham Front (previously known as the al-Nusra Front) in Western Ghouta, inflicting at least 15 casualties on the militants.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 17, 2016 at 10:13AM SpaceX's winning streak went up in a ball of fire and a puff of smoke in September. Image source: U.S. 45th Space Wing. Americans love to cheer for an underdog. So let me preface today's column with a hearty three cheers for SpaceX -- the first company to land an orbital rocket back on Earth on its own tailpipe, the first to land a rocket intact at sea, and -- potentially, one day -- the company that will put mankind on Mars. The fact that one small private company, backed by one visionary (and his money), has managed to accomplish so much in such a short period of time (SpaceX is less than 15 years old), and against such entrenched competition from the world's aerospace giants, seems nothing less than extraordinary. But now, let's get real -- and take a really hard look at SpaceX's safety record. Spaceflights for cheap... SpaceX has shaken up the space industry, and not just here in America, where its $62 million rocket rides are cutting off Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) at the knees (their United Launch Alliance joint venture charges twice that). Over in Europe, Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) subsidiary Arianespace says that SpaceX is really the only space company they're worried about. In Russia, Roscosmos is flabbergasted at the Walmart-like everyday low prices that SpaceX advertises. What's even more amazing is that for a while there, SpaceX was doing a pretty good job of beating its competitors at their own game. Up until June 2015, SpaceX had strung together 20 straight successful space launch missions in a row before one of its rockets blew up. And even after stumbling when its CRS-7 mission exploded midflight, SpaceX quickly regained its footing, returning to flight in December last year and sticking its first landing on Earth in the process. Nine successful launches later, though, SpaceX suffered yet another failure. On Sept. 1, a Falcon 9 rocket preparing to send an Israeli telecommunications satellite into orbit exploded on its pad during pre-flight testing. Ever since, SpaceX has been sending out plaintive tweets asking space fans to send "audio, photos or videos of our anomaly" in hopes they will prove "useful for investigation" of the as-yet unsolved mystery. And SpaceX's winning streak has reverted to zero. "Cheap" at a price Now compare that to the records at ULA and Ariane, SpaceX's two chief rivals in space launch. Last week, ULA successfully launched the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission aboard one of its Lockheed-built Atlas V rockets. Its mission: to extract mineral samples from an asteroid and return them to Earth for study. OSIRIS-REx was ULA's 111th straight successful launch, counting missions sent up by both Atlas V and Boeing-built Delta IV launch vehicles. Since ULA was formed in December 2006, it has yet to suffer a single mishap on any of its big rockets -- a near-10-year streak of unbroken success. Airbus' record at Ariane is nearly as stellar, and in some respects even better than ULA's. The company's previous launch vehicle, the Ariane 4, racked up 74 straight successes before its retirement in February 2003. Its current vehicle, the Ariane 5, has flown without a single incident since its inauguration in 2003. Ariane 5's record of 73 straight successes stands within a whisker of beating Ariane 4's record -- and Ariane 5's history of 13 straight years of flight without incident has already outpaced that of ULA (admittedly, mostly because ULA hasn't yet existed for 13 years). Cheapest... and least reliable? If SpaceX keeps blowing up its rockets at the rate of one per year, it's going to be awfully hard for the company to catch up to the rocket launch leaders. But that's more of a marketing problem for SpaceX. Here's where it morphs into a business problem: Currently, SpaceX is the cheapest launch provider in the West. At a base launch cost of $62 million for a Falcon 9, SpaceX launches rockets at a price per ton roughly half that of its nearest competition. And that big price disparity has given SpaceX an enormous advantage in bidding for launch contracts. In just three years, however, Boeing and Lockheed plan to field a new and improved launch vehicle called the Vulcan, which could shrink SpaceX's price advantage considerably from 2019 on out. One year later, Airbus and Ariane will introduce their new and improved rocket called the Ariane 6, which could drop their launch cost to within just 11% of SpaceX's for very large payloads by 2020. At that point, space launch customers will face an interesting dilemma: Do they pinch pennies and save 11% by launching with SpaceX, despite its checkered history of rocket reliability? Do they opt for Ariane's long record of reliable launches, and pay a bit more? Or do they pay even more for ULA's even longer record of safe launches?

Zhang, who calls himself Craig while in the United States, said many people in China want to become pilots, but it takes much more time in China to get the training. Zhang, 21, said he has wanted to be a pilot since he was a boy. "We come here. We get the knowledge and that's good," he said. "I love to fly. In China, the airspace belongs to military. We can't just go out and do the different maneuvers we do here without getting permission from the military. That takes time." Liu, who chose the name Norman, said he is enjoying his time in the United States. He already is contracted to work for Hainan Airlines, the largest privately owned air transport company and the fourth-largest airline in terms of fleet size in the People's Republic of China. Li, known as Sam, arrived in mid-July and is just beginning his classes. (It has been a tradition since the training school opened that students adopt American first names because their own are difficult to pronounce, according to Craig Anderson, director of Griffith Aviation Inc., which has operated the airport since 1984. They choose names from movies or someone they like and admire.) Zhang, Liu and Li are among 45 Chinese men currently learning to become pilots at the Griffth-Merrillville Airport through an agreement between the airport and the Civil Aviation Flight University of China, at which all are students. Growing need The Civil Aviation Flight University of China is the largest civil aviation university in Asia and the world's largest flight training institution. It is under the direct leadership of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, a government agency. The airport made the arrangement with the flight university in 2007, and the first group of Chinese students began classes in the spring of 2008. Since that time, they have trained nearly 300 Chinese men to be pilots, Anderson said. To date, no women have enrolled in the flight school. As global economies expand and airlines take delivery of tens of thousands of new commercial jetliners over the next 20 years, there is extraordinary demand for people to pilot and maintain these airplanes, according to Boeing's website. To meet this growth, the 2016 Boeing Pilot and Technician Outlook forecasts between now and 2035, the industry will need more than 2 million new aviation personnel - 617,000 commercial airline pilots, 679,000 maintenance technicians and 814,000 cabin crew. The largest growth is expected to be in the Asia-Pacific region where the demand for pilots is estimated at 248,000, according to the website. North America will require 112,000, Europe 104,000, the Middle East 58,000, Latin America 51,000, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)/ Russia 22,000 and Africa 22,000. Anderson said the need for pilots in China and the lack of airspace for training there creates the need for commercial training in the U.S. "When students come over here they haven't flown in China," he said. "They get physicals here. They earn their pilot certificates here. They attend ground school here and earn a private pilot's license, too. They attend classes for 10 to 12 months from 7:30 a.m. to about 6 p.m. each day." Time for flight, time for fun The students live in an apartment complex in Crown Point. While here, they fly to Midway in Chicago, Michigan, Indianapolis and other areas. When the Chinese students graduate from the program at Griffith, they will have commercial pilot certificates with instrument and multi engine ratings. All of them already are contracted to work with an airline in their home country. The airlines pay the cost of the education for the Chinese students in the U.S. Anderson couldn't release the cost because it is confidential. However, he added, that money keeps small airports like the Griffith-Merrillville Airport solvent. Ying said his employer, China Eastern Airlines, which operates international, domestic and regional routes, will require him to do additional ground training when he returns home and will convert his certificates to Chinese. It hasn't been all hard work and study for the Chinese students. They've also visited nearby communities. Ying said they go to Chicago monthly and stop in Chinatown to buy food and meet other Chinese locals. "It's beautiful here and the skies are blue," Ying said. "In China, it's rare to see the blue skies because of the pollution. We see the Gary Air Show and the Chicago Air Show. It was cool." Li said he didn't expect to see such a big city like Chicago. "It's all very interesting," he said. "Everything is fresh to me." ___ Source: The (Northwest Indiana) Times, http://bit.ly/2cRhr6b ___ Information from: The Times, http://www.nwitimes.com Article Comments (0) Tweet This article filed under: News Indiana Associated Press Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

The Iranian government also spread out the welcome mat to foreign investors as it seeks to boost its aviation sector. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy more than 200 jets worth US$50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning US Treasury approval, needed due to the high proportion of American parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe’s Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of US dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are reimposed. Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations. “There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved,” he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the US Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle American troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under US sanctions. American critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a US blacklist, such as the country’s largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. “We have a contract. We will stick to it,” he said. He also told a news conference that the Tehran event, attended by dozens of foreign firms, proved that aviation was international in scope and “the US government cannot stand against it.” The House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years.

Deputy Managing Director of Boeing Martin Benturd had two days earlier said the company is prepared to sell planes to Iran, adding however that the sales should be permitted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Intense competition between two giant aircraft manufacturers has posed obstacles over Iran's purchase of Airbus crafts, an Iranian aviation official said in June. Secretary of Association of Iranian Airlines Companies Maqsoud Asadi Samani has said that the major deal Tehran signed with Airbus to purchase 118 planes from the European aviation giant is still pending authorization from the US. Meanwhile the Americans seek to resolve the issue of a possible deal on exporting Boeing aircrafts to Iran before issuing the authorization for Airbus purchase, he added. The official added that the Iranian aviation company is in talks with Airbus and Boeing to settle the issue. US approval for Iran's purchase of Airbus crafts is necessary because more than 10 percent of components in Airbus planes are of American origin. Meanwhile all those individuals aiming to do business with Iran need to apply for OFAC license from the US Treasury.

Iran is trying to upgrade its aging airline fleet and in June signed an agreement with Boeing to buy 80 planes and lease 29 more. But the deal has come under pressure from lawmakers in the U.S. who have discussed various measures to restrict the sale, including prohibiting the Treasury Department from licensing it. The transaction would be the Chicago-based plane maker’s first in Iran since sanctions on the country were lifted in January and follows a $27 billion agreement with Airbus Group SE for 118 planes. Airbus jets have more than 10 percent U.S. content so they also require export licenses. “The U.S. should’ve issued the licenses already and they haven’t done that,” Kashan said, adding that they will be granted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, known as OFAC. Kashan said Iran has an agreement with a leasing company for $10 billion in financing for the Airbus deal and that it will be signed within days. He didn’t disclose the name of the leasing company or say where it was based. The value of Iran’s deal with Boeing has yet to be finalized and financing talks are ongoing, he said. “Our latest forecast is that by the end of the current Iranian year (March 2017), we will definitely see a number of those planes, both from Airbus and Boeing, arrive in Iran,” he said.

Iran is ready to welcome foreign investors. Published: 15:57 September 18, 2016 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Tehran: Iran urged the United States on Sunday to remove remaining obstacles to it buying passenger planes following the lifting of international sanctions and spread out the welcome mat to foreign investors as it seeks to boost its aviation sector. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion (Dh183.5 billion) at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning US. Treasury approval, which is needed due to the high proportion of US parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe’s Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of US dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are reimposed. Obstacles Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and meanwhile continued to negotiate with other plane makers. “We are negotiating with all those big names ... There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved,” he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the US. Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under US sanctions. US critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a US blacklist, such as the country’s largest carrier, Mahan Air. In an interview with Reuters, Akhoundi dismissed the concerns. “We have a contract. We will stick to it,” he said. Amendments He also told a news conference that the Tehran event, attended by dozens of foreign firms, proved that aviation was international in scope and “the US government cannot stand against it,” according to a translation of his remarks. The House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. Iran estimates it will need at least 400 aircraft to renew and expand its fleet, including some 250 in the next 10 years. Besides the aircraft sales, Iran is dangling the prospect of significant business for Western companies including nationwide airport expansion as it emerges from decades of sanctions. “There are more than 60 airports in Iran but 80 per cent of flights are in just 10 and these are working beyond capacity; that is why we need to develop,” Akhoundi said. “They are all ready to attract investors, who are welcome to invest in any part,” he told the conference held at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini airport, which plans a $2.8 billion expansion.

Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing following the removal of anti-Tehran sanctions. Later, the US House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. The Iranian minister also said that CAPA proved that aviation was international in scope and "the US government cannot stand against it”. The two-day CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit opened at Novotel Imam Khomeini International Airport on September 18 with the participation of business leaders and representatives of 150 aviation companies such as Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a lasting nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers- came into force in January, some Iranian officials have complained about the US failure to fully implement the accord. Back in March, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said Americans have yet to fulfill what they were supposed to do as per the nuclear deal. Iran still has problems in its banking transactions or in restoring its frozen assets, because Western countries and those involved in such processes are afraid of Americans, the Leader said at the time, criticizing the US for its moves to prevent Iran from taking advantage of the sanctions removal.

Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus (AIR.PA: Quote) and Boeing (BA.N: Quote) under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Both deals hinge on a longer-than-expected process of winning U.S. Treasury approval, which is needed because of the high proportion of U.S. parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe's Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of U.S. dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are re-imposed. Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi told an aviation conference that Iran was complying with its obligations and continued to negotiate with other planemakers. "We are negotiating with all those big names. ... There are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," he told the CAPA Aviation Finance Summit, the second large gathering of aviation leaders in Tehran since sanctions were lifted in January. Critics in the U.S. Congress argue that Iran could use passenger jets for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria or transfer the aircraft to airlines still under U.S. sanctions. U.S. critics of the nuclear deal also say it could allow Iran to skirt remaining sanctions by transferring jets acquired by national carrier IranAir to airlines that remain on a U.S. blacklist, such as the country's largest carrier, Mahan Air.   Continued...

Approval had been expected by the end of August, but that has been pushed back to the end of September, Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan said. "Today we are expecting that (approval) by the end of September for Boeing, Airbus and ATR," he told the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. The U.S. Treasury can veto sales of modern aircraft to Iran, including non-U.S. ones, due to the high proportion of U.S. parts. Failure to issue the required U.S. approval would breach an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities, Kashan said. An Iranair official said the airline is meanwhile looking to acquire second-hand aircraft or hire crewed aircraft to help meet its most urgent needs.

The first public offer by an insurer in Indian market would open for bidding on September 19 and is scheduled to close on September 21, during which the stock would be offered in a price band of Rs 300-334 per share. Ahead of the IPO, ICICI Prudential has allocated over 4.89 crore shares at Rs 334, the top-end of the price band, aggregating Rs 1,635.33 crore to a clutch of anchor investors from India and abroad. It marks one of the biggest anchor investor placements in the Indian IPO market. Among the 40-odd anchor investors are Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Nomura, Government of Singapore, UTI MF, Russell Investment, GMO Emerging, SBI MF, Tata MF, HDFC Standard Life, Reliance, Birla Sun Life, Kotak Mahindra, IDFC,National Pension Service Managed By Oaktree Capital Management L P and The Boeing Company Employee Retirement Plans Master Trust. The public offer comprises of up to 18,13,41,058 equity shares of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company, including a reservation of up to 1,81,34,105 equity shares (10% of the offer) for the shareholders of ICICI Bank. The offer would constitute 12.63% of the company's post-offer paid-up equity share capital. At the upper end of the price band, the offer would be worth Rs 6,057 crore. This would be the biggest initial public offering after Coal India. The state-run firm had hit the capital markets in 2010 to raise over Rs 15,000 crore. The company, which filed the draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on July 18, got the regulator's go-ahead on September 2. The insurer is a venture between banking major ICICI Bank and UK's Prudential Corporation Holdings. Singapore's Temasek and PremjiInvest also are shareholders. ICICI Bank has around 68% stake in the insurer, while Prudential has 26%. Last November, ICICI Bank sold nearly 6% stake in ICICI Prudential to Temasek and PremjiInvest. The shares were offloaded for around Rs 1,950 crore valuing the insurer at Rs 32,500 crore. PremjiInvest holds 4% in the insurance company while Temasek owns 2% in the firm. At the end of March this year, the assets under management of ICICI Prudential — which started operations in financial year 2001 — stood at Rs 1,039.39 billion, as per its website. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and ICICI Securities are global coordinators and book running lead managers to the issue. Others are CLSA, Deutsche, Edelweiss, HSBC, IIFL, JM Financial, SBI Capital Markets and UBS. "We got tremendous response in the anchor book, with a lot of marquee long term investors, both international and domestic institutions participating in the anchor book. On foreign institutional front, GIC (investment arm of Government of Singapore) came with the largest application," said a banker associated with the issue. "In case of institutional investors back home, UTI MF was the largest bidder with bids through various funds," he added. Post allocation to the anchor investors, more than 132 million shares will be available for subscription in the offer. In the net offer, 57,122,434 shares will be available for subscription by retail investors.

Politik Wirtschaft Wissenschaft Energie & Klima Kultur Medien Magazin Telepolis Politik Our 9/11 Our 9/11 18. September 2016 Mathias Bröckers Gedenken 2004: Tribute in Light. Bild: Derek Jensen, Public Domain Affirmation replaces criticism: the "Church of Free Fall" In August this year I received a note requesting advice on a new project. As the project in question was rather unique in scope - dealing as it did with founding a new religious order or church - the signatories of the note requested that I preserve their anonymity should I decide to report on their activities. Doing so would be quite welcome, though, "to gain first insights into the potential reach of such a project." The note continued: "Now that almost 15 years have passed and the crimes of September 11, 2001, have yet to be prosecuted or the true perpetrators and instigators of the crime identified and named, investigations that deserve that name cannot be expected to happen for decades yet. As understandable and as legitimate as it may be to continue demanding the truth about 9/11 and for a decent crime investigation into the gruesome mass murder that happened on that day, it is unfortunately just as illusory and unrealistic to expect the demands to be met in real life. Given that the official legends promulgated by governments and media alike are thus going to continue to stand as truths, realpolitik tells us that rational arguments are no longer any use against them. Wherever legends have become official "true history" and have been declared state creeds on which governments base their power politics, rational critique has become obsolete. It is for these reasons that we propose to found a new creed that states clearly its unshakable belief in the official stories of 9/11 and which celebrates the miraculous promotion of these myths to the ranks of solidly governmentally verified truths. As this involves in part violations of the laws of nature and statistics as well as those of logic or common sense, we have decided on a working title of "Church of Free Fall" for our project. We are working to achieve official recognition as a religious order for the "C. o. F. F.". The C.o.F.F. - despite originating as a secular "knowledge community" -has its very own founding myths and miracles that are in no way inferior to those of established churches, as its Credo as attached below amply demonstrates. The Credo has been adopted officially by the International Section of the preliminary C.o.F.F. Episcopate, to serve as a firm foundation of the religious community. Further extensions of the Credo, including additional fundamental beliefs, dogmas, and rituals, are currently under development. The C.o.F.F. Credo bows to a realpolitik of war, observation, and "security" that has arisen from the dust and ashes of the WTC towers. The C.o.F.F. replaces strength-by-refusal with the joy of affirmation, celebrates the insanity of reality as well as the truly just Great War on Terror. Instead of fighting its enemies, the C.o.F.F. embraces its enemy in a stranglehold. You are welcome to publish our manifest." Which I will do forthwith: We trust in the one suitcase of 200 Which got left at the gate And which revealed all the proof We might ever have needed: Teaching videos on how to fly a Boeing plane, Instructions for airplane hijackers, A Hamburg, Germany, registration form, A diploma granted by the Technical University of Hamburg, And the Final Will and Testament of Mohammed Atta, The "Leader" of the hijackers. We believe That that man wished to carry his testament With him onto his suicide mission, Just in case his deadly flight Failed to end in an enormous ball of fire. Or because he figured His testament naturally indestructible, Just like the passport of his fellow hijacker Al Sugami That was discovered unscathed next to the WTC. We believe That two airplanes are able to Bring down three skyscrapers The first time ever in the history of construction That steel framed skyscrapers became Pulverized by burgeoning fires alone, While a plastic-and-paper passport Is able to survive the inferno unscathed. We believe In the Free Fall In which burning office furniture Brought down WTC7 so fast That the BBC was able to report it 20 minutes beforehand. We believe That Hani Hanjour might have been bad at flying small aircraft, Bad enough for the rental agency to refuse to rent him a Cessna, But that he did succeed in hitting the Pentagon From behind at ten feet above the ground Descending with a jumbo jet at 500 mph In an ingenious curve around the building. We believe That he did not just keep on flying straight Into the offices of the Pentagon Chiefs Because he wished to make air navigation history Through an ingenious maneuver taking him "Once around the most highly secured building of the world" Along with aces of the air like the Red Baron before him. We believe That the total absence of an air defense Not just above the Pentagon But above the entire U.S. air space Had nothing whatsoever to do With the "war games" that Were taking place that morning. We believe That "nobody could ever have imagined That terrorists would ever fly a hijacked plane into a building" (CONDOLEZZA RICE) Despite the fact that these war games Were using as a war scenario precisely what was happening that day, Namely the hijacking of passenger airplanes. We believe That Osama Bin Laden masterminded this "Surprise attack" from a cave in Afghanistan Even when the FBI announces it has no proof of his complicity in the attack, And even when he himself refused to take any credit whatsoever for Taking part in that particular act of terror In his first interview after, on Sept. 18, 2001. Bild: Robert J. Fisch/CC BY-SA 2.0 We believe That he and his 19 "hijackers", armed with nothing but box cutters, Were solely responsible for succeeding in this attack, Despite the fact that due to totally bogus visas 15 of them would never even have reached U.S. soil Had not the U.S. Consulate in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Simply waved through the lot of them. We believe That the CIA never had any idea of this Even if a visa official of that consulate, Michael Springman, became a whistleblower Because his office was constantly being used To funnel suspicious Arab "freedom fighters" Into the U.S.A. We believe That the Saudi security service had no idea either And that it was purely as an act of charity That the "terror logistics expert" Al Midhar And his colleague Al Hazmi received Monthly stipends from the wife of Royal Ambassador to the U.S., Prince Bandar, during their stay in San Diego. We believe That the Pakistani secret service had nothing to do with 9/11 either, Whose chief, General Ahmad, was having breakfast in Washington on 9/11 With the heads of the secret service oversight committees of House and Senate, Bob Graham and Porter Goss, And who shortly after resigned without a word When word got out that his secret agent Omar Saeed Sheikh Transferred 100,000 U.S. Dollars of funds to Mohammed Atta. We believe That neither was Israel's Mossad involved Even if five of its agents were arrested in New York City Filming themselves triumphing and showing victory signs With the WTC towers burning in the background Only to claim on a TV talk show in their home country, Where they had quietly been deported to, They had been in New York City "to document the events". We believe That it was simply a hugely unlucky chain of events That all these ever vigilant secret services "failed" their duties And a truly unlucky chain of unlucky events that enabled Osama and his 19 box cutter wielding hijackers To pulverize three skyscrapers all by themselves And to murder 3000 people. We believe In George W. Bush's warning to the United Nations General Assembly: "We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th; malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists, themselves, away from the guilty." We believe That only malicious liars, outrageous conspiracy theorists, Intolerable anti-Semites and notorious anti-Americans, Enemies of freedom and friends of terrorism Can deny the truths of the 9/11 Commission's Final Report After all, it includes the undeniable confessions of an accomplice By the name of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed. We believe In the truth of these confessions Even if they were extracted in 182 torture sessions During which the prisoner was subjected to waterboarding Because only malicious heretics and crazy conspiracy theorists Who also believe in aliens from outer space or who have been infested by the devil Would question the investigations into 9/11 Or much less request a completely new re-investigation. We believe In our democratic media of repute Who recognize the divisive poison in these doubts And pillory those who heinously try to spread it To strengthen the belief of our Brothers and Sisters In the Holy Script of the 9/11 Report And in our governing bodies that proclaim it In defense of our freedom and security. Let us therefore pray: Our 9/11 Thou camest from out of the blue sky Hallowed be thy name Thy GWOT* has come Whose will be done With drones in the heavens As it is with wars on Earth. Give us this day our daily budgets (the fall of the Soviet Union had put those very much in question, after all) And never forgive a terrorist As thy GWOT* just keeps on Creating new ones daily And lead us not into temptation To deliver ourselves from the evils of a war Without end and without an end. For thine is the imperial kingdom And the military power And "Full Spectrum Dominance" For ever Amen. *Great War On Terror © C.o.F.F.

Trends Malaysia MH17 plane crash The video, published by the Serodnia.ru website, recalled that as the sole developer and manufacturer of all components of the BUK missile systems, Almaz-Antey held two consecutive experiments to shed the light on what happened to MH17. A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine’s Donetsk Region on July 17, 2014. The lives of 298 people were lost in the tragedy, which took place in an area where Kiev’s troops were battling rebels who are rejecting the coup-imposed central power and battling for the establishment of a self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. Two years after the crash, the official Dutch investigation ruled that the plane was brought down by a Russian-made BUK air defense system, but didn’t name the responsible side. A crane moves wreckage at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 © Maxim Zmeyev Russian bloggers slam Bellingcat MH17 investigation for ‘falsified evidence’ During the test firings, the Russian arms maker attempted to verify or refute the conclusions of the Dutch-led investigation into the tragedy, and revealed that the experts were wrong about the type of rocket that hit the plane, the place from where it was launched and the spot on the jet’s cockpit where the explosion took place. The international inquiry, however, ignored Almaz-Antey’s findings in an attempt to “make the events fit the already prepared scenario,” the company believes. The video alleges that the Dutch investigators pointed to the wrong type of warhead, having found just a couple of butterfly-shaped holes on the cockpit of the Malaysian Boeing downed over Ukraine. Meanwhile, one of the experiments by Almaz-Antey with same payload has produced dozens of such holes, which suggests that the international experts made a mistake in establishing the exact type of rocket that hit the plane. The angle at which Flight MH17 was hit, and therefore the place from where a missile was launched, were also calculated wrongly by the Dutch investigators, Almaz-Antey said. The plane’s cockpit was perforated by destructive agents during the Russian test. But on the debris of the downed Malaysian jet there were plenty of non-penetrating scratches, which indicate that the destructive agents traveled on a tangential trajectory. The video also draws attention to alleged violations and investigation procedure failures during the MH17 inquiry. Not all of the rubble was collected at the crash site by the Dutch experts, it said. While the collected fragments that contradicted the results that the investigation wanted to achieve were showcased separately from the other parts. “But these are the debris that can drastically change the perception of what happened” to the Malaysian airliner, the authors of the video stressed. rt.com Tags Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 Previous article Alabama pipeline ruptures, leaking 250,000 gallons & causing ‘fuel emergency’ → Next article Putin: We don’t approve of WADA hackers, but information they leaked raises questions → Comments Deja un comentario Cancelar respuesta Tu dirección de correo electrónico no será publicada.

The anti-drones market is estimated to be at $209.77 million in 2016. Anti-drone systems are used to detect, identify and neutralize rogue drones. These systems uses different technologies such as jamming, high energy lasers, directed energy weapons, command and control (C2), electro-optical surveillance, electronic surveillance and RF threat management to detect and neutralize unmanned aerial vehicles. The high growth of anti-drones market in aerospace and defense industry is majorly attributed to increasing security breach by unidentified drones. Various instances, for example, incidents when a drone crashed at the White House lawn, a flying machine overflew the nuclear facilities at France and the near misses to an aircraft at the airports across the world have triggered the need for anti-drone systems. For instance, in April 2016, an incident at San Francisco where a British Airways flight was hit by a drone causing slight damage to the aircraft which raised serious safety concerns. Thus, the growing number of incidents by unknown drones is a primary driver for development of the market. Moreover, there are a number of opportunities for counter-UAV systems in defense and non-defense applications. Anti-drone systems use different modes of engaging the threats such as kinetic system, laser system, and electronic system. The laser systems accommodate for the highest share in terms of value. The technology is being used to shoot small UAVs using a high energy laser beam. Some of the defense prime contractors such as Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Rheinmetall Defense Electronics are using laser technology for their anti-drone systems. Due to technological innovation, electronics system has been observed to be a powerful tool to be used in anti-drones systems. Hence, it is expected to grow at a faster CAGR in the forecast period. The anti-drone systems vary according to its usage in military and commercial applications. The increase in the terrorism, drone attacks, and borders infraction are some of the factors driving the defense market. The increase in the R&D activities by the defense prime contractors and illicit activities has resulted in the highest revenue of the defense segment. Globally, the usage of commercial drones has considerably increased which has posed a serious threat to the public safety and the violation of privacy. Moreover, there is an impending need for anti-drone systems at airports, prisons, events, and critical infrastructure that has driven the non-defense segment to grow at a faster rate. North America is currently dominating the anti-drones market; however, the geographical analysis of this market unveils a great potential for growth in the Asian countries. According to the analysis, the U.S. will grow at a faster rate; accommodating majority of the revenue. Recently, Federal Aviation Administration initiated a Pathfinder Programme and selected Anti-UAV Defense System (AUDS) to start a trail phase to protect the major U.S. airports from drones. Similarly, in 2015, France has started a program named Project Angel as that focuses on 18-months study on counter-UAV systems. Russia, China and Canada are also expected to have a decent rate of growth from 2016-2021. Key Topics Covered: Executive Summary 1. Research Scope and Methodology 2.

U.S. finalizes rule to limit gas ‘flaring’ at drilling sites In Pittsburgh's neighborhoods, a natural gas leak every 2 miles Army Corps wants more study on Dakota Access oil pipeline Even without the cracker, Shell’s industrial site is impressive Home About Companies Consumers Policy Energy Jobs Energy Forum Login Register Logout Login Register Logout Home About Companies Consumers Policy Energy Jobs Energy Forum Login Register Logout Advertisement Good Jobs First exec sheds more light on corporate subsidies September 17, 2016 12:00 AM Lake Fong/Post-Gazette Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, gives a thumbs-up before talking to an audience at Carnegie Mellon University. An artist's rendering of the cracker plant courtesy of Shell. By Len Boselovic / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Tweet Email Pennsylvania taxpayers are providing $1.65 billion in incentives for Shell’s Beaver County ethane cracker plant, but they will have to share benefits generated by the project with other states, according to an expert on government subsidies who spoke Friday at Carnegie Mellon University. “The Royal Dutch Shell deal is going to leak into Ohio and West Virginia,” Good Jobs First executive director Greg LeRoy said at a Heinz College forum attended by about 70 students and economic development officials. “I have to assume a lot of the benefits will go to your neighbors,” Mr. LeRoy said. Good Jobs First, based in Washignton, D.C., has compiled a database of about $250 billion in tax breaks, grants, low-cost loans and other subsidies that federal, state and local governments have provided to businesses. According to Mr. LeRoy, those subsidies are conservatively worth about $70 billion annually. His organization believes much of that is money poorly spent. Outsized incentive packages like the $8.7 billion the state of Washington provided to Boeing leaves states paying an average of $658,000 for every job created, Mr. LeRoy said. Sixteen states allow companies to keep state income taxes they deduct from their workers’ paychecks, he said. Because taxes are such a small part of business expenses, “Incentives almost never matter,” he told the audience. PG graphic: “Free” enterprise? (Click image for larger version) Shell was vigorously courted by Pennsylvania officials, who believe the incentives are an excellent investment in the region’s economy. Shell has said building the complex will create 6,000 jobs and that the plant will employ 600 when it opens. The debate over whether the subsidies are a good investment or corporate welfare may become a little more informed when a new accounting rule requires many governments to disclose how much tax revenue they are losing by providing the subsidies. The rule was approved last year by the Government Accounting Standards Board, a Norwalk, Conn., body that oversees government accounting rules. Pennsylvania’s 66 counties, 516 school districts, and state colleges and universities are required by law to comply with the government accounting standards. But the state’s more than 2,400 municipalities are not. Governments that are required to comply must start reporting the foregone tax revenue for fiscal years that began after Dec. 15, 2016. The new rule only requires each subsidy program to provide an overall cost figure. No company-specific data will be disclosed unless a government does it voluntarily. Even though Mr. LeRoy would have preferred a stronger standard, he told the audience the new standard “will change the debate forever.” One of the biggest impacts will be on school districts, which have little to say when governments exempt businesses from paying property taxes, the biggest source of education funding. “Property tax breaks are going to come out of the shadows,” Mr. LeRoy said in an interview. He expects a cottage industry of companies will spring up over the next few years to analyze the data in the disclosures. He is hopeful the additional information will lead to a more informed debate about the impact of the foregone tax revenue on education and other government services.

Mark Crawford, Contributing Editor Q3 2016 By most reports, Mexico’s economy is doing well. Although there were some rough spots, Mexico’s overall economic performance in 2015 was solid, with promising projections for 2016 and 2017. Related Research Do Free-Trade Agreements Represent Fair Trade? The Case for Supplier Parks in the Automotive Supply Chain Auto/Aero Firms Redrawing the Map Criteria for Selecting a High-Tech Cluster The Mexican economy experienced an annual rate of growth of 2.5 percent during 2015, which helped keep the unemployment rate low (about 4.2 percent in January 2016). Over the first three months of 2016 the Mexican economy grew at a rate of 2.6 percent. Further, according to A.T. Kearney, GDP growth is expected to average 2.6 percent over the next three years, thanks to an expanding middle class, a robust manufacturing sector, and proximity to the U.S. market. Even with low oil prices, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects Mexico’s GDP growth to reach 3 percent in 2017, reflecting the positive impact of new government reforms. The current administration of Enrique Nieto Peña hopes to attract US$150 billion in new FDI over its six-year term with $30 billion of that targeted for 2016 Much of this economic growth is anchored by manufacturing. Exports account for more than 30 percent of the country’s economic output, and overall trade as a percentage of GDP now exceeds 60 percent, outpacing even China. Exports from Mexico totaled US$380.8 billion in 2015, with about 84 percent of these products shipped to North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, the United States and Canada. In addition to its economic performance, good business climate, and increased trade, Mexico’s new political reforms and improved government stability are making it more attractive to foreign investors, especially manufacturing companies. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Mexico ranks 10th in the world for FDI investment. FDI inflows in 2015 totaled about US$21.5 billion. The 2016 A.T. Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index ranks Mexico 18th in the world, with most of its investors being industrial firms headquartered in the Americas. The Mexican government is committed to increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in key sectors by breaking up cartels, reducing corruption, and improving competition. The current administration of Enrique Nieto Peña hopes to attract US$150 billion in new FDI over its six-year term, with $30 billion of that targeted for 2016, especially in the automotive, medical device, aerospace, and electronics industries. Manufacturing-Driven Manufacturing accounts for about one third of Mexico’s total economic output. Seven of the top-10 exporting groups are manufactured products. Expand Close Manufacturing accounts for about one third of Mexico’s total economic output. Seven of the top-10 exporting groups are manufactured products. Factors that make Mexico ideal for manufacturing are its strategic location between North and South America, political stability, shipping infrastructure, and lower labor costs with higher productivity/quality compared to other low-cost countries, especially China. Mexico’s many free-trade agreements (FTAs) with more than 40 countries, and incentive programs with others, make it an attractive location for foreign investors to set up manufacturing operations. “The benefits that Mexico offers to manufacturers include competitive wages, growth prospects thanks to an open-trade philosophy, reliable infrastructure, proximity to the U.S., an educated workforce, and a growing supplier base,” notes Doug Donahue, vice president of Business Development for Entrada Group, which helps manufacturers locate in Mexico. “These factors combine to make Mexico a location any manufacturer seeking growth has to consider.” Key Industry Clusters Automotive: The top manufacturing industry in Mexico is automotive. Mexico became the world’s seventh-largest auto producer in 2015. It now produces more vehicles than Brazil and is projected to be the world’s fifth-largest vehicle producer by 2020. More than three-quarters of the vehicles are exported to the U.S. and Canada. Mexico is also a top supplier of automotive parts to the U.S. As a result, Mexico’s automotive sector has attracted steady foreign investment. For example, FDI from European and Asian car manufacturers includes recent investments from Nissan and Volkswagen — whose global delivery center in Mexico is the company’s largest production site outside its German headquarters. Lear, a leader in automotive seating and electrical systems, in Ramos Arizpe Industrial Park, Coahuila “In all, some US$15 billion of additional investment in automotive capacity is anticipated before the end of the decade,” reports Deloitte in its May 2015 report entitled “Competitiveness: Catching the Next Wave, Mexico.” Electronics: Electronics is another major manufacturing industry in Mexico, which began with the foreign-owned maquiladoras that developed along the U.S. border decades ago. Electronics manufacturing operations have advanced considerably since then in terms of size, technology, and supply chain sophistication. Electronics clusters are located close to the manufacturing industries they serve — for example, a northwest cluster supplies parts for nearby automotive and aerospace facilities; to the northeast, electronics manufacturers serve computer and appliance companies. The largest and most sophisticated cluster is in Guadalajara, home to more than 400 manufacturers that employ about 50,000 workers — sometimes called the Silicon Valley of Mexico. Eight of the top 10 contract electronic manufacturers have operations in Guadalajara. In fact, Guadalajara’s high-tech industry — led by electronics — provides 60 percent of the state of Jalisco’s total exports. Aerospace: Although it is still a relatively small industry, aerospace is emerging as a growth area for high-value production. Mexico’s aerospace industry has grown from 100 manufacturers in 2004 to over 300 in 2016; major U.S. players with operations in Mexico include Gulfstream Aerospace/General Dynamics, General Electric, Textron, and Honeywell. Other nations with an aerospace presence in Mexico include France (Safran Group), Canada (Bombardier Aerospace), the Netherlands (Fokker), and Spain (Aernnova). A significant engine-component cluster is located around Guaymas, in the state of Sonora. NKPM, a logistics provider for Honda and other suppliers, in Bajio Industrial Park, Guanajuato Research and development is also happening in Mexico. For example, Boeing, Aeromexico, and the Mexican government are working together to develop sustainable biofuels to protect the environment and reduce costs. “Boeing and Aeromexico and other key stakeholders are collaborating to move Mexico’s sustainable aviation biofuel industry forward,” says Marc Allen, president of Boeing International. “Sustainable jet fuel will play a critical role in reducing aviation’s carbon emissions and will bring a new and innovative industry to Mexico.” Oil and gas: Perhaps the greatest political triumph for the Enrique Nieto Peña administration is the reform program that will allow foreign companies to explore for oil in Mexico — the first time this has happened since 1938. This creates open competition with government-owned Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), which should stimulate considerable foreign investment. However, the current low oil prices have made oil and gas companies reluctant to invest capital until the industry improves. In 2015, foreign investors did win several bids on exploration lands, including Italian national oil company Eni and several consortia led by oil companies from Argentina, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. Oil and gas companies are also highly interested in the potential for shale gas across Mexico. Also, when oil prices turn around and exploration ramps up, significant FDI will likely be spent on pipeline improvements, oil storage, and other refining infrastructure. Telecommunications: Growth in this sector has been hampered in the past by poor coverage, not enough modern infrastructure, and only a few key players, creating a cartel structure for telecommunications and television broadcasting as well. For example, one company, América Móvil, controlled 70 percent of the mobile phone market and 80 percent of the nation’s fixed lines. Reforms passed in 2014, however, have reduced the influence of these controlling companies, which is attracting foreign companies into this emergent marketplace. For example, U.S. firm AT&T recently acquired two Mexican telecom companies — lusacell for $2.5 billion in November 2014 and Nextel Mexico for $1.9 billion in 2015. A Promising Future Reforms to major markets, improved labor laws, and concerted efforts to reduce corruption and crime have accelerated foreign interest in investing in Mexico. In fact, according to Deloitte, “Mexico’s medium-term growth could average 4.5 percent per year, up from a projected 3.1 percent real annual growth rate for 2015-2034, if the government can deliver its broad reform initiatives.” Further, if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is enacted, it could foster even greater foreign investment, “raising Mexico’s longer-term growth rate by close to 1 percentage point.” Momentum will quickly stall, however, if the Mexican government falters on enforcing reforms and other economic initiatives, including anti-corruption measures. And, with manufacturing creating one third of the country’s GDP, it is important for the government to invest in critical infrastructure, such as transportation and border crossings, to support its growing manufacturing sectors and to attract more FDI. Also, the lack of key infrastructure and adequate water in prime oil-and-gas exploration areas could discourage energy-investing in these territories. “As Mexico begins to break up longstanding monopolies and push forward with a number of significant reforms, “it will continue to open its economy more fully to global trade and competition,” states Deloitte in conclusion. “There are a number of opportunities that suggest the country’s competitive future should be bright.” Mark Crawford, Contributing Editor Mark Crawford is a full-time freelance writer in Madison, Wisconsin, who specializes in business writing.

Mobile phone users rarely consider the mini power plants that keep their devices multi-tasking all day. Now those rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are big news. Samsung Electronics Co. is ending production of its big-screen Galaxy Note 7 following more than 100 reports of fires or explosions, which affected even some of the replacement phones distributed after a recall. As batteries have gotten both smaller and more powerful, lithium-ion woes have been popping up more frequently. The batteries that power much of the information economy have led to recalls of laptops, bans of hoverboards and a delayed jetliner debut. 1. Why are Samsung phones catching fire? The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said the compartment for the battery is a little too small and pinches the battery, causing short circuits and overheating. Samsung previously said that a manufacturing flaw brings negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat. The company said in a different report that a piece of technology that separates the electrodes might be thinning out, leading to short-circuiting. While the company had said the problem was isolated to one supplier, fires were reported on replacements as well, leading to the decision to end production entirely. 2. Why didn’t the phones just stop working? The Note 7 features a larger battery than its predecessor, one that can store 3500 milliamp hours of electric power, compared with 3000 mAh for the Note 5. More power means more danger when something goes wrong. Rather than simply malfunction, these batteries have enough stored energy to catch fire or explode. 3. Are other phones dangerous? Potentially, but it’s a long-shot. The iPhone 7 Plus, the Note 7’s main competitor, has a less-powerful 2900 mAh battery, which reduces the danger if the battery malfunctions. In general, lithium-ion batteries are safe because manufacturers have gone through rigorous testing of the designs. But smartphone makers have pressed for smaller and more powerful battery packs, as well as a fast-charging feature, which puts additional stress on the batteries. A number of other phones have that feature, while the iPhone does not. 4. How do lithium-ion batteries work? Lithium ions move from the negative pole (anode) to the positive pole (cathode) while discharging and vice versa while charging. Between the electrodes is a liquid chemical, an electrolyte, and a permeable membrane, a separator, that allows only ions to pass through. One way to increase the power capacity has been to make that separator thinner, increasing the chance that the wall will be penetrated, according to Martin Reynolds, a vice president at research firm Gartner.  5. How else have lithium-ion batteries caused problems? A Sony Corp.-made battery pack that overheated led to the recall of millions of laptops made by Dell Inc., Toshiba Corp. and others in 2006. Problems with the batteries also triggered a global grounding during the debut of the Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner in 2013. Earlier this year, about 500,000 hoverboards were recalled in the U.S. by 10 companies after reports of overheating, sparks and fire. 6. How did Samsung respond?

That includes any new replacement device they received due to the recall. Samsung is offering to give users all their money back, or they can exchange their phone for a Galaxy S7, with Samsung refunding the difference. 7. What does this mean for Samsung? The end of the Note 7 represents a big setback for the South Korean electronics giant in its battle with Apple, whose iPhone 7 hit stores in September. The Note 7 stood out with its stylus, large edge-to-edge display, iris scanner and better waterproofing techniques. Along with the S7, it was the device that Samsung pitched at premium users to battle Apple. The Note 7 was rolled out in August, just before Apple unveiled the iPhone 7. Samsung has now lost much of the momentum it built in smartphone sales. Instead of celebrating a triumphant launch of a premium product, the company has had to deal with consumer complaints and employees’ feelings of humiliation and the death of a product that fueled earnings in its semiconductor and display businesses. Now it needs to recover its reputation. The Reference Shelf What to do with your Note 7. A story on the perils of building better batteries. An explainer on batteries.

Like all people, we want a secure home, steady income, healthy kids, and good meals. As liberals, we'd like everyone to enjoy these, but our own comfort tops the list. We care about poor people in distant lands, but vote for those who kill them. We condemn exploitation of peasant labor and land, but enjoy the products they make. We deplore destruction of the environment but devour its bounty. We sign petitions, march with signs, read liberal news, write checks to right wrongs. Genuine caring, though, is risky. Justice requires social change that's bold and deep. This means living and voting very differently. Many of my friends will vote for Hillary because she is a woman or because she is not Trump. Few will vote for her because she is liberal, because instead both she and Trump, technically speaking, are fascists. Fascism is the merger of government and large corporations. Together these dominate law, labor, money, military, media, and politics. During the past 40 years, through corporate mergers and immense political contributions, our country has become extensively fascistic. Our freedom becomes bounded more by corporations than by Constitutions. Nazism is fascism that dominates by exterminating dissent, and attacking nations without first being attacked. This is "aggressive war," the chief war crime for which Nazi leaders were hung. By these international standards, most U.S. presidents since William McKinley have been war criminals. Most recently, LBJ, Nixon, Reagan, Bill Clinton, both Bushes and Obama have approved various war crimes. This is easy to do, with 900 military bases worldwide. Our country has bombed 30 countries since World War Two, none of which attacked us. During Bill Clinton's presidency (1993-2001), for example, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children died from his embargo. Corporate control of media and the military ensured you did not see them die on television. Clinton's extraordinarily racist "three strikes" law and TANF legislation led to an explosion of the African-American prison population and family collapse. But Bill is a Democrat, so liberals admire him still. Hillary stood by Bill, then while Secretary of State pushed her own attacks on Libya, Syria, Yemen. The Clinton Foundation bagged millions of dollars from some of the world's worst dictators-- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Algeria, Oman, the Emirates-- and some of the most toxic corporations-- Monsanto, ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, NRG Energy, Pfizer, Boeing. Now as candidate for president she is backed by her "friend" Henry Kissinger, a war criminal. She would likewise revive the Cold War with Russia. She has threatened to "obliterate" Iran. Others are welcome to vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but both Trump and Hillary will continue America's decay. Trump will shred our flag by dividing us by race and religion. Hillary will aggravate every problem by serving the industries that have been dragging us down-- the military-industrial complex, the prison industry, agribusiness, big pharma, big oil and fracking, predatory banks, medical insurers, job loss by globalization, and global warming. - Advertisement - Every society, including ours, contains the seed of fascism, ready to sprout from fear and anger. We were taught after World War 2 that "just following orders" made us "good Germans" but bad Americans. We were taught pride in America's revolutionary history and our obligation to speak against tyranny. We were taught that obedience to evil makes one evil. So I do not vote for war criminals. And I say so though many friends disagree. Trump would harm us unpredictably. Hillary would harm us systematically. Neither is inclined to push back. They are both creatures of this machine. Such a situation reduces voting to a noble folly. Even when there are worthy candidates, elections are corrupted by slush money, closed debates, hacked voting machines and crooked voting officials. Many liberals vote for fascists because for decades they have rejected third parties. They've narrowed their choices to fascists by repeatedly relying on a Democratic Party that is abandoning liberalism. Just as the Republican Party is no longer the party of Lincoln, the Democratic Party is no longer the party of FDR. Today, Republicans throw us off the cliff, while Democrats escort us politely over the edge. Liberals have also allowed this decline because many of us depend on the very institutions which threaten us. We seek to conserve our remaining privileges as consumers benefitting from a global military empire. The Democratic Party invites us to believe they are at least comparatively humane. Every year, however, the Party becomes less humane, less liberal, and less democratic. - Advertisement - The challenge of replacing fascist parties, and fascist politicians regardless of their gender, color, religion, style, promises, or charm is thus up to us, not to them. I will vote for Jill Stein, but real change will come through revolution. Nonviolent revolution requires us to rely less on the corporations that rule elections. We do this by leaving the Middle Class to become the Mutual Class. What is the Mutual Class? We build grassroots eco-housing on land trusts, we start local health co-ops, we invest in regional organic farms, green schools, promote transit and biking, credit unions, state banks, regional stock exchanges, and local currencies. We own the essential systems that keep us alive, and manage them co-operatively. We take control of the economy, starting where we live. We focus on creating, more than consuming. There is no shortcut to restoring our liberties. While the Middle Class goes further into debt, the Mutual Class gets ahead by getting together.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) SEOUL, South Korea - Samsung's recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones after several dozen caught fire and exploded may stem from a subtle manufacturing error, but it highlights the challenge electronics makers face in packing ever more battery power into ever thinner phones, while rushing for faster release dates. Announcing the recall on Sept. 2, Samsung confirmed dozens of cases where Note 7 batteries caught fire or exploded, mostly while charging. It plans a software update that will cap battery recharging at 60 percent capacity to help minimize risks of overheating. But it is urging owners to keep the phones turned off until they can get them replaced, beginning Monday. U.S. safety regulators stepped in Thursday with an official recall, saying Samsung's voluntary efforts were inadequate. Though Samsung promised replacement devices, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said U.S. customers would be eligible for refunds if they choose. Replacements are expected in stores by next Wednesday. The Note 7 debuted to rave reviews in August thanks to its speed, new software features and - not least - the estimated nine hours it would run between charges. But all that power comes at a price: Users began reporting the phones were catching fire or exploding, in one case incinerating the SUV it had been left in. Aviation authorities in the U.S., Australia and Europe have urged passengers not to use or charge Note 7s while flying and not to put them in checked baggage. On Monday, Canada issued an official recall. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, said in announcing the recall on Sept. 2 that an investigation turned up a "tiny error" in the manufacturing process for the faulty batteries in the Note 7s that was very difficult to identify. The end of the pouch-shaped battery cell had some flaws that increased the chance of stress or overheating, he explained. That kind of manufacturing error is unimaginable for top-notch battery makers with adequate quality controls, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research center at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Samsung and other experts should search for factors outside the battery cells that could have led to overheating, he said. "If Koh's argument is right, that makes Samsung SDI a third-rate company," Park said. "But it does not appear to be a simple battery problem." Time also is a factor in marketing and making the phones. In 2015, Samsung moved up its unveiling of its new Galaxy Note model to August from September, seeking a leg up on Apple's September iPhone upgrades. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping pace with demand for the Note 7. Samsung has not recalled Note 7s sold in China, but the company has refused to say which of its two battery suppliers made the faulty batteries or clarify whose batteries are used in which Note 7 smartphones. The company also refused comment on South Korean media reports that it has stopped using batteries from Samsung SDI, one of its two suppliers, in the Note 7. C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Seoul, cited SDI officials in estimating that about 70 percent of the batteries for the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones came from SDI. The other 30 percent are thought to have been supplied by Amperex Technology Ltd., a Chinese-based manufacturer that reportedly also is a main supplier of batteries for the iPhone. Problems with lithium batteries have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner, though having so many lithium-ion battery fires in a short time is unheard of, Park said. The batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing. If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. That's what happened with the Note 7, Samsung's Koh explained. "The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together," he told reporters in Seoul. It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7. It confirmed delays in shipments for extra quality tests weeks later, in late August, after photos of charred phones began popping up on social media. South Korean experts suggested Samsung may have been so ambitious with the Note 7's design that it compromised safety. "There was no choice but to make the separator (between positive and negative anodes) thin because of the battery capacity," said Lee Sang-yong, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked more than a decade at LG Chem, a leading lithium battery maker. Thicker separators can improve safety but will not necessarily prevent all overheating issues, he said. Doh Chil-Hoon, head of the state-run Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute's battery research division, said that based on the limited information provided by Samsung, he believes the push to increase battery power was part of the problem. "Even with a small manufacturing mistake, if there had been enough elements to ensure safety, it would not explode," Doh said. "It is a roundabout way of admitting weak safety." The Note 7 phones have a powerful 3,500 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 smartphone, which has a slightly smaller body than the Note 7, features a 3,000 mAh battery. So does the Note 5, launched in 2015. Apple does not provide information on the iPhone's battery capacity in milliampere hours. But two research firms that specialize in analyzing tech gadgets and their components said the battery in the iPhone 6S Plus is 2,750mAh. The size of the battery in the newly released iPhone 7 is not yet known. The 3,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Note 7 is "one of the highest, if not the highest, capacity battery we've seen in a phone," said Wayne Lam, an industry analyst at IHS Markit Technology. Lam said he thinks the Note 7 battery problem resulted from weak controls in manufacturing, not a poor or unsafe design. A spokeswoman at iFixit, which publishes repair guides for electronic gadgets, offered a similar view. "We don't think any internal design changes in the Note 7 are responsible for the exploding batteries - more likely just a manufacturing defect," IFixit's Kay-Kay Clapp said in an email. Apple has tweaked hardware and software it developed itself to make iPhones use power more efficiently, while Samsung has increased the capacity of the batteries in its phones. That can be done without increasing size by adjusting components or changing the production process, Lam said. "You have two different trajectories, with Samsung packing in more energy density, versus Apple trying to trim it down by optimizing everything else," he said, adding that the two rivals are "constantly locked in this arms race of improving and one-upping." While Apple and Samsung are using built-in batteries for their premium phones, LG Electronics, Samsung's smaller South Korean rival, has opted for a replaceable, 3,200 mAh capacity battery for its new premium, jumbo screen smartphone, the V20. LG chose to make the phone thinner and allow customers to extend battery life by swapping out batteries. "The security of the battery isn't directly related to whether the battery is replaceable or not," Cho Joon-ho, head of LG's mobile business, told reporters. "But we make efforts to secure safety with quality controlling tests beforehand."

Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing under an agreement between Tehran and world powers to ease sanctions in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Both deals hinge on the longer-than-expected process of winning US Treasury approval, which is needed due to the high proportion of US parts in virtually all modern jetliners, including those made by Europe's Airbus. There have also been delays in getting European banks to finance the deals because of restrictions over the use of US dollars and concerns over legal risks if sanctions are re-imposed.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 17, 2016 at 8:13AM Before and after pictures of the damage incurred by the Sentinel-1A satellite. Image source: European Space Agency. Seven years ago, a defunct Russian military satellite made headlines by running headlong into a satellite operated by Iridium Communications (NASDAQ: IRDM) and smashing it to smithereens. Since that date, there have been multiple close calls, near misses, and actual satellite fatalities recorded in orbit. Here's the latest: On Aug. 31, the European Space Agency (ESA) noticed an anomaly on data coming from its Sentinel-1A radar imaging satellite. Now, Sentinel-1A has only been in orbit for a couple of years -- hardly enough time for things to start breaking down on their own. So when ESA was alerted to a "sudden power reduction," combined with a change to "the orientation and the orbit" of the satellite, this naturally piqued their interest. Flipping on the sat's onboard cameras, they were startled to discover a 40-centimeterwide dent in its solar array (pictured above). Anybody catch the license plate on that meteor? ESA has only had a few days to examine the evidence so far, but initial indications are that the satellite's solar array was pierced from the rear by a flying piece of orbital debris -- space junk -- or perhaps a "micrometeoroid" of nonterrestrial origin. Either way, ESA's best guess is that the perpetrator of this crime was traveling at a high rate of speed but was no more than "a few millimetres" in diameter itself. When you think about it, that's kind of worrisome. One particle of random space junk, moving at high speed, put a dent in Sentinel-1A roughly 100 times the particle's own size. And it gets worse. On Sept. 7, roughly a week after the impact was first reported, U.S. Strategic Command's Joint Space Operations Center reported that it has detected five "small" pieces of debris in the vicinity of Sentinel-1A, which are all thought to have been created "due to Sentinel 1A['s] small particle impact." These latter pieces of debris were not detectable prior to the impact because, as ESA points out, "only objects greater than about 5 cm can usually be tracked and, thus, avoided by manoeuvring the satellites." The fact that debris is detectable now, therefore, suggests that the original impact with Sentinel-1A created five new pieces of space junk, each five centimeters or more in size. The Kessler effect Put another way, not only did the original piece of space debris cause damage 100 times its own size, but it also created five new bits of cosmic flotsam, each more than 10 times the original perpetrator's own size -- and each with the potential to cause damage 100 times their own size to other spacecraft! In astrophysics, this phenomenon is termed the "Kessler effect." One collision between space objects not only damages the objects involved (and in greater proportion than the size of the objects involved) -- it also creates an exponential number of new pieces of space junk, each with the capability of causing additional disproportionate harm to other objects. Lather, rinse, and repeat until Earth's orbit has been transformed into a floating junkyard. So what's the solution? And why should investors care? In fact, we're already well on our way to that scenario. The U.S. Air Force is currently aware of 20,000 (rather large) items of "space junk" in orbit. But NASA estimates that the total population of orbiting pieces of space junk marble-sized or larger is closer to 500,000. Now, time will fix some of this. As Jim Cantrell, CEO of microsatellite launch service Vector Space Systems, told me recently, space junk in low Earth orbit will, over time, be slowed down by contact with Earth's atmosphere, lose velocity, fall back to Earth, and burn up in the atmosphere. The higher up the debris is, though, and the faster it's moving (and the more destructive potential it has from those higher speeds), the longer it takes for "the Earth herself [to clean up] with atmospheric drag." That's why the Air Force has hired Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) to construct a "space fence," consisting of Earth-based S-band radars tasked with detecting, cataloging -- and warning space companies to avoid -- orbital debris. Once complete in 2018, this $2.5 billion project will be able to detect, track, and characterize 200,000 items -- 10 times what the Air Force is currently capable of detecting. (That will still be only 40% of the threat, but it's a start, and Lockheed has plans to tighten its fence even further in 2021.) At the same time, over at ULA, both Lockheed Martin and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are working to build a "space truck" service of utility spaceships in orbit. In conjunction with detection data from the space fence, one potential use of these ships would be cleaning up some of the space junk currently circling the globe. It's a big job, but consider the cost of not doing it: Sentinel-1A cost Europe $384 million to put in orbit, but one misaimed piece of space junk threatened to trash that entire investment. As ESA's close call with a mere millimeterswide piece of space junk showed us last month, this is a job that's worth doing. And with billions of dollars' worth of Air Force contracts on the line, it's a job that America's space tech firms will be happy to perform.

Sputnik earlier wrote about a leaked report about the MH17 tragedy, allegedly prepared by Russia’s Almaz-Antei company, and which appeared in a recent issue of Novaya Gazeta. © AFP 2016/ VASILY MAXIMOV Russian Newspaper Reveals Draft Text of Response to Bellingcat MH17 ProbeA team of Russian volunteers and bloggers earlier published their first findings about the July 17, 2014 crash, aptly titled “Anti-Bellingcat Report.” The analysis of the Bellingcat investigation shows that from the very beginning the so-called “independent experts” chose followed a pro-Ukrainian version of militiamen’s guilt for the crash. In the introduction of their report the Bellingcat authors unambiguously state that “within hours, the world became aware of the general circumstances that led to the tragedy: a group of pro-Russian separatists shot down the passenger plane with a Buk anti-aircraft missile”. According to the authors of the “anti-Bellingcat report,” however, this statement actually rules out any need for any further investigation into the crash. First off, most of the photo and video evidence, used by self-styled researchers, were downloaded to the Internet on the day of the crash, but the authors of these photos still remain anonymous. Maksim Blinov MH17 Crash Probe Initial Results to Be Unveiled September 28Based on so-called “fair evidence” presented by Ukrainian politicians, the so-called independent investigation by Bellingcat advocated the version of US military intelligence officials about the missile launch site of the Buk launcher. It is worth mentioning, however, that neither before nor afterwards, was there any information about the use of Buk missile launchers by independence supporters. One of Bellingcat's charges concerns a satellite image showing a white transport truck carrying the Buk missile allegedly used to shoot down flight MH17. However, this image was proven to be a fake because three of the vehicles Bellingcat claims were part of the Buk convoy are actually pictured going in the opposite direction of the site the missile was allegedly launched from. In an interview with Komsomolstaya Pravda, Yuri Kotenok, a leading author of the “Anti-Bellingcat Report,” said that there were lots of discrepancies in the Bellingcat’s version. “In their July 17 video we see a Buk convoy passing by a gas station in Makeyevka. A good clean road, but in a Hot News  video posted on June 15 we see a road severely dented  by caterpillar trucks we don’t see in the July 17 video. Meaning that in a wartime situation they had taken just one day to fix it! This is a fake, no doubt about that,” Kotenok added. © Sputnik/ Igor Maslov Kremlin Questions Bellingcat's Report on MH17 Crash in East UkraineThus all Bellingcat claims that the Boeing was downed by a Buk missile transported on a white trailer simply hold no water. Next, the "Anti-Bellingcat Report" effectively proved that the photo showing the smoke trail from a Buk missile allegedly launched by independence supporters had either been digitally altered or taken on a different day since other photo and video evidence from July 17 have confirmed that the weather in the area was cloudy, not clear, as claimed by Bellingcat. Yuri Kotenok also said that on July 17, 2014 the sky in the area of the MH17th crash was overclouded and not clear as in the Bellingcat photo. “This means that you simply couldn’t see any traces of a  missile launch. The Bellingcat photographs provide no particular time frame of when they were made and their volunteers tend to disappear in a very mysterious way,” Kotenik said. This means that there was no missile launch from Snizhne (an area controlled by independence supporters) and that  the photos of a white smoke trail against a clear blue sky used in the Bellingcat report were forged. In additional proof of this, Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to Almaz-Antei Concern’s chief designer, flatly denied allegations that the missile that shot down the Malaysian airliner had been fired from Snizhne because in this case the right side of the plane would not have remained intact. “All they want everyone to believe is that the missile had come from Snizhne, but this is not true because if fired from there it could not have reached the aircraft under that angle. If they agree [that the missile been launched from the territory controlled by Ukrainian armed forces] then their entire version will fall through,” Malyshevsky said. As to the crucial Bellingcat claim – that MH17 was hit by a single Buk SAM in the hands of the Donbass militia, the report reiterated that this is a practical impossibility, since the detection range of a single Buk is limited to 120 degrees in azimuth and 7 degrees in elevation, and its effectiveness of fire is limited. A single Buk system can guard only a pre-assigned airspace sector with knowledge of its potential targets' parameters, up to and including enemy flight time (that is, to wait in 'ambush' mode). Without this information, normally provided by support systems elsewhere in the military command, a single Buk is not capable of precisely locating and then hitting its target. The authors of the "Anti-Belligcat Report" will continue their work to debunk the myths and falsifications being spread by the Bellingcat “experts.” ...

They were even denied to have someone photograph the parts. They can prove that it was not a BUK warhead, noting holes in the 777 hull/fuselage that entered on the lateral axis. Meaning side on. I have also found an image noticing a perfectly round 30mm sized hole in a hydraulic reservoir tank.

(KOIN) — On their first date, Bert Harrison kissed Lucy as they rode through the Tunnel of Love in Seattle’s Playland Amusement Park. Now, 70 years later, they’re still in love. Bert and Lucy Harrison got married on September 13, 1946 — a Friday the 13th — and now 2 children, 5 grandchildren, 7 great-grandchildren and 4 great-great-grandchildren later, they’re happy, smiling and sharing the secrets to a long marriage. He said they haven’t thought too much about the anniversary until just now. “I just think it’s mind boggling,” Lucy said. “It happened one day at a time, and yet all of a sudden it’s here.” It began with a blind date in May 1946. Bert was in the Merchant Marines and in port in Seattle when a friend of his urged him to come out on the blind date. Bert also had a car and his friend didn’t. “I wasn’t too sure about her at first,” Bert said. “Both girls got in the backseat and I was the driver, so I had to tell them one of them belonged up here.” “And I happened to be the one that got up there,” Lucy said. At the end of the date — and after the kiss in the Tunnel of Love — Bert told his friend he was going to marry Lucy. “Actually, he didn’t ever ask me to marry him,” she said. “He simply put the ring on my finger and he says, ‘If you don’t want it, give it back.’ How romantic can that be?” Lucy said, laughing. 70 years of wedded bliss View as list View as gallery Open Gallery Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Lucy Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) A Shoot-the-Chutes-style ride at Playland, circa 1934 (Courtesy: MOHAI collection) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison on the 70th anniversary of their wedding, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day in 1946 and a recent photo, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison have been married 70 years on September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison married 70 years ago, September 13, 2016 (Courtesy photos) 70 years of wedded bliss x Thumbnails Gallery                   Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Lucy Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) A Shoot-the-Chutes-style ride at Playland, circa 1934 (Courtesy: MOHAI collection) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison on the 70th anniversary of their wedding, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day in 1946 and a recent photo, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison have been married 70 years on September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison married 70 years ago, September 13, 2016 (Courtesy photos) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Lucy Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) A Shoot-the-Chutes-style ride at Playland, circa 1934 (Courtesy: MOHAI collection) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison on the 70th anniversary of their wedding, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day in 1946 and a recent photo, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison have been married 70 years on September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison married 70 years ago, September 13, 2016 (Courtesy photos) On that first date, they also got stuck on one of the rides called The Hammer. When he kissed her in the Tunnel of Love, Bert wasn’t sure if he was going to be slapped. “I thought he was being a little bit on the fresh side,” she told KOIN 6 News. “In those days it just wasn’t done.” That was in May, and they were married just 4 months later. Over the years Bert drove trucks across the country and started an automotive center. Lucy worked for Boeing, was a quality control inspector for one of the moon buggys and also worked on the first Air Force One. They moved to Salem in 1970 and they’ve been there since. Through it all, they’ve figured a few things out. There is give-and-take in a marriage, and they balance each other out. She said his gentleness is a good counterpoint to her being bull-headed. “That’s how the 70 years has lasted is we work with each other all the time,” he said. “It’s not something you can just stand aside and let it happen. It takes work every day. But it’s loving work.” “Never go to bed on a fight. I don’t care how long it takes you to work it out, never go to bed on a fight,” she said. “Kiss him in the morning for a good day, kiss him at night for a good night’s sleep. That’s it. What else do you need?” Bert said they each have their own hobbies. “I help her with hers, she helps me with mine.” This weekend they’re having a 70th anniversary party with family and friends to celebrate what Bert said has been “just a wonderful life.” How do they feel about each other now? “I still love him. He’s my best friend. Most of all, he’s my best friend,” Lucy said. “Yep,” Bert said. “Same here.” Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Related Posts Report It Wrap: Did you know Terre Haute had a Civil War camp? ‘I never thought it was possible‘: 100-year-old women mark momentous Election Day Wabash Valley man spends years restoring 500 bikes for area kids in need Grandparents stepping up in the addiction crisis Advertisement « Previous Story — Next Story » Comments are closed.

The Greenville-based code school announced earlier this month that it was launching the Tech Opportunity Fund in hopes of increasing diversity in the industry by making it cheaper to get an education. It aims to eventually gather $100 million in scholarships for women and minorities. “To maximize the potential of the tech industry, we must maximize the potential of a diverse tech workforce,” Iron Yard chief executive Peter Barth said in a statement. The program will also include Code Fellows, a West Coast code school that’s committing $5 million in scholarships, and Operation HOPE, a nonprofit that will provide financial literacy training. The initiative got the attention of the vice president at a speech he gave in St. Louis earlier this month focused on the importance of training more programmers and making the tech industry more accessible. The push dovetails with Obama administration efforts to boost tech training, Biden said, and to give underrepresented groups “a shot at these good-paying jobs.” “It matters, because these investments matter,” Biden said. Stacy Merrick, a spokeswoman for the code school, said the program would cover “several thousand full-tuition scholarships” over the next five years at The Iron Yard’s 21 campuses, including Charleston. That works out to two students per campus for each round of classes the school offers. Applications will be accepted starting in January 2017 at the Tech Opportunity Fund’s website, http://www.techopportunityfund.org. Atlatl Software said last month it would beef up its sales and engineering work with a fresh round of financing. Another investment disclosed last week should add fuel to those efforts. In a securities disclosure filed Thursday, Atlatl said it had raised $2.5 million from a private investor. That includes a $300,000 investment it reported last month. Marc Murphy, the new CEO of the Meeting Street firm, said the company’s plans haven’t changed: It’s still hoping to speed up its engineering work and grow its sales and marketing staff. Atlatl’s software is aimed at helping manufacturers sell things that are otherwise hard to visualize. It lets sales representatives create 3-D renderings that show clients how the products they’re selling work and look — and then generate a price quote. STEM Premier is having a big year in Indiana. The Mount Pleasant startup, which aims to help high-tech companies recruit high school students, said this month it had inked a deal with Toyota’s manufacturing arm in the southern tip of the Hoosier State. That factory employs almost 4,000 people who make some 365,000 cars a year. And Casey Welch, the company’s co-founder and chief operating officer, says it also recently closed a deal with Cummins Inc., an Indiana-based manufacturer that makes diesel engines and industrial machinery. The Fortune 500 corporation also has a factory in North Charleston. Terms of those deals were not disclosed. STEM Premier’s software is intended to do for science and math what sites like Rivals and Hudl did for sports — to give companies a way to scout young talent and to give students a way to show off their skills. The platform has been embraced by manufacturers, including several in South Carolina. Boeing Co.’s North Charleston facility is among its clients, and it launched an initiative this year to push students toward advanced manufacturing jobs with the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance. “The theme is the same overall — really overall what’s happening across the country, whether it’s here in the Charleston area, South Carolina, Indiana or Pennsylvania,” said Welch, who himself attended Indiana’s Purdue University. “Everybody hears about the issue with workforce. Everybody knows about the baby boomer generation retiring. Everybody knows we need to get more students in certain areas to fill the pipeline.” Reach Thad Moore at 843-937-5703 or on Twitter @thadmoore.

(Source: WISTV) CLEMSON, SC (WIS) - On Saturday, the SC State Bulldogs are headed to Death Valley to take on the Tigers, and SC State's president is taking Bulldog pride to a new level, literally! President Clark will lead what is believed to be the first-ever formation flight led by a university president. He'll be flying a red and white RV-6, which was custom built by Clark and his friend. The flight will represent the endless possibilities and new beginnings for SC State after the university overcame a lengthy battle with their accreditation. Right before kick-off, Clark alongside 8 other pilots will fly in a unique formation over Death Valley. He says this flight will represent the future possibilities he wants the university to explore in the aviation industry. WIN A TABLET FROM WIS! "We're looking at how we can merge what we're doing as an academic institution with what the industry needs. Before, I was very involved in various aspects of the industry as it were. Now that I'm on the educational and academic side, I'm at a unique juxtaposition of the two. So, hopefully I can find some opportunity where SC State can be something unique with entities like Boeing,” SC State University President, James Clark said. While being a university president is a new venture for Clark, he's been a pilot for more than 25 years. The pre-game flight is at 11:55 Saturday morning at Clemson. Copyright 2016 WIS.
