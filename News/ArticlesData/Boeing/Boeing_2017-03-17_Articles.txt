More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon If the Liberal government goes ahead with its decision to purchase Super Hornet fighter jets instead of stealthy F-35s, Canada may be giving up its sovereignty over the High Arctic as it comes to depend on U.S. jets flying from airfields in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Rankin Inlet, Iqaluit and Alaska. That was the unanimous opinion of half a dozen retired fighter pilots I spoke with recently, pilots with decades of experience flying over the continent’s northern margins and in senior positions at NORAD headquarters in Colorado: that Canada would be relegated to “second-tier status” in defending its own territory. U.S. war planes such as the F-35 and F-22 would defend the bulk of Canada’s vast northern air space because they would be invisible to Russian radars and would be able to seamlessly share data and sensor information with each other and with airborne and ground command posts, the retired Canadian pilots said. Canada’s CF-18 Hornets and Super Hornets, operating much older technologies and much less able to deliver such complicated data fusion, would likely be tasked with defending North American cities far to the south or with shooting down any missiles that managed to penetrate the first line of defence, they said. The 18 Super Hornets the Trudeau government has said it intends to buy are expected to cost between $5 and $7 billion. On Tuesday, the Canadian government sent a letter to its U.S. counterpart outlining what it’s looking for in a potential Super Hornet purchase, which the jets’ manufacturer, Boeing, will use to draft a formal proposal by this fall. If the price and timeline are right — and if the purchase would provide enough economic spinoff benefits for Canada — the Liberals hope to sign a contract by late this year or early next. The plan has drawn plenty of criticism. “Will Canada be surrendering sovereignty? The simple answer is yes,” said Lt.-Gen. George MacDonald, who flew CF-18 Hornets from Bagotville, Que., for NORAD for five years and was the binational military alliance’s deputy commander before 9/11 and then served as vice chief of the defence staff in Ottawa before retiring in 2004. (He now works for CFN Consultants, which has as a client Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-35.) “The Russians would be delighted to see Canada flying Super Hornets in the north,” said Gen. Tom Lawson, the retired former chief of the defence staff and ex-deputy commander of NORAD, who sometimes works as a consultant for Lockheed. “The Super Hornets will be a big, bright object on the radars of Russian early-warning aircraft. With the F-35, the Russians will not see them until they are too close.” Gen. Jean Boyle, a former chief of defence and fighter pilot who was Boeing’s vice-president of international business when the Super Hornet was coming online nearly 20 years ago, says he can see the argument against using Super Hornets in the Far North. “In times of increased tension there is no doubt that NORAD would put its best assets, the (U.S. Air Force’s) F-35 and F-22, forward instead of a Super Hornet, to ensure the defence is thorough. “My position, even when I was chief and ever since I was a colonel and started to understand national security, is that Canada should have a defence capability where we can defend all the northern and maritime approaches to our country, 100 per cent, that it is fully paid for by us and that there are no arguments on that point.” “I am loathe to say we should buy the F-35 but skeptical about the capabilities of the Super Hornet,” Boyle said. “Having been with Boeing when it was developed, I am relatively aware of what the Super Hornet can do. It is fourth-generation compared to fifth-generation.” Related Liberals take next step toward buying 18 Super Hornets, hope for deal by year’s end Buying ‘political insulation’: Liberals to call for bids in 2019 for permanent fleet to replace CF-18s Retired air chiefs urge Liberals to ditch ‘costly and unnecessary’ plan to buy Super Hornet jets A fourth retired Canadian air force general, who had not worked for either Lockheed or Boeing but whose company does not allow employees to be quoted by name, concurred. He highlighted “survivability issues” for Super Hornet crews because they could be seen by enemy radars, and warned that new Russian cruise missiles would be “a game-changer” if not confronted by a fighter with cutting-edge technology. None of the former pilots interviewed for this article were among the 13 retired air force three-star generals who recently sent a letter to the prime minister decrying the Super Hornet purchase. “I don’t know what the government’s calculus is but if they look to the threats in the future we should go to a competition quickly,” Lawson said. “Enough information is already available to develop an operational requirement to have a competition within one year to 18 months and to have the first aircraft delivered within three years.” That is approximately the same timeline the government has been using to justify the need for an emergency purchase of Super Hornets rather than F-35s. The RCAF told parliamentarians last year that it can safely fly its existing CF-18s until 2025. The F-35 and Super Hornet were both “tremendous airplanes,” Boyle said. “My position is to not buy from an interim proposal. We should move forward with an open competition. Put them up against each other and make a decision.” — with files from The Canadian Press Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Workers at the company’s Washington state factories were informed by their union that Boeing had issued a federally-required notice that “involuntary layoffs were scheduled for May.” A Boeing spokesman confirmed the 60-day notice, but declined to say precisely when it would initiate the layoffs or how many positions would be cut. Boeing has been cutting staff to reduce costs since early 2016, primarily through buyouts and the attrition of executives, managers and engineering staff. The notices are the first official signal from the company that it will lay off some of the factory workers who assemble its jets. The Machinists union in Seattle, which represents thousands of Boeing employees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After years of record buying, the pace of orders for Boeing’s twin-aisle jets, including its 777 and 787 Dreamliners, has slowed significantly. Boeing is cutting back current-generation 777 production, its most profitable large jet, by nearly 60% from its peak. Boeing is adjusting its employment to account for that lost revenue and is under pressure to offer better prices to airlines while promising Wall Street improved profit margins. As of last month, Boeing had 148,000 workers. About half its employees work in its commercial aircraft unit, where the buyout offers were made. The company had already cut the jetliner unit’s head count by 9% in the past year.

Trump Sends Coal Lobbyist to EPA and Boeing Exec to DoD Published on Friday, March 17, 2017 by Common Dreams Drain What Swamp? Trump Sends Coal Lobbyist to EPA and Boeing Exec to DoD 'Personnel is policy' by Nika Knight, staff writer 0 Comments "How's that swamp draining going again?" (Photo: Defending Our Future/Twitter) A coal lobbyist and a Boeing executive are to be nominated to deputy positions at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Defense (DoD), respectively, making President Donald Trump's campaign promises to "drain the swamp" continue to look like a lot of hot air. Andrew Wheeler, the lobbyist to be nominated as deputy EPA administrator, works for an oil and gas industry-serving law firm and is a registered lobbyist for Murray Energy, the largest privately-owned coal company in the country, according to The Hill. He also served on the staff of climate change denier Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and will join several fellow former Inhofe staffers at Scott Pruitt's EPA. Patrick Shanahan, meanwhile, is a top Boeing executive with no military or political experience. "He is, however, familiar with defense procurement from the business side,"  reports the Seattle Times, which notes that Shanahan "ran Boeing's military rotorcraft division in Philadelphia for two and a half years, where he was responsible for the Apache and Chinook helicopter programs as well as the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor airplane." (On Friday, it was reported that an attack possibly from a U.S.-made Apache helicopter killed 31 Somali refugees off the coast of Yemen.) The coal lobbyist and Boeing executive join former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson and a plethora of former Goldman Sachs executives in Trump's cabinet. These latest hires continue to confirm suspicions that Trump's policy isn't so much to drain the swamp, as to fill it. Trump's broken promises to drain the swamp weren't forgotten by observers: Goldman Sachs, Exxon, Boeing, and big coal run our government now. https://t.co/YaZ3701uG3 — Arden Jones (@ardenjones478) March 17, 2017 So Coal lobbyist to the EPA and Boeing VP to be second in command at Defense... how's that swamp draining going again? — President Sanford (@DanSantheMan) March 17, 2017 "Personnel is policy," as Washington Post correspondent James Hohmann tweeted: Personnel is policy: A coal lobbyist will be #2 at EPA, a Boeing exec will be #2 at DOD and Goldman's CEO celebrated alumni at WH/Treasury. — James Hohmann (@jameshohmann) March 17, 2017 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License Share This Article Related Articles The Trump GOP Prescription for America: Don’t Get Sick FBI and NSA Chiefs Forced to Fact-Check Boss as Trump Live-Tweets Hearing Memo to the Media: How Not to Cover the President A Last Chance for Resistance More in: U.S. , Donald Trump, Coal, Pentagon, EPA, Goldman Sachs, Corporate Power Top Comments (Click to see more comments or to join the conversation) Join the resistance!

Tech was busy, too. We’re reviewing the potential impact of the Trump administration’s proposed budget; a Boeing executive tapped for deputy defense secretary; healthcare IT doings at Accolade and Limeade; PACCAR’s work on self-driving trucks with Nvidia; Alexa’s move onto Siri’s turf (and an early sign of what advertising via voice assistant may sound like); new stats from PitchBook on VC investments in women-founded companies; and some recommended reads. The details: —Federal research funding flows into Washington’s innovation economy through institutions like Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The budget proposal floated by the Trump administration this week would stanch that flow, with potential impacts to scientists and, eventually, the entrepreneurs who license their discoveries to build new businesses and patients who benefit from novel treatments. It’s a long way from a White House budget proposal to the actual federal budget that determines grant-making levels at agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. But the cuts outlined this week to NIH and other federal agencies provoked a strong response from Washington state’s scientific research community. Fred Hutch and the UW are among the top recipients of funding from NIH, which is in line for a nearly 20 percent cut. As The Seattle Times reports, Fred Hutch President Gary Gilliland said the proposed cuts “are indefensible and would severely impede our progress.”.” Some 85 percent of the research center’s funding comes from NIH. —Pat Shanahan, a senior Boeing executive and University of Washington regent, was nominated to be deputy secretary of defense by President Donald Trump. The Seattle Times has a good look at Shanahan’s Boeing career and what the nomination might mean for the relationship between the aerospace giant and the administration, which got off to a rocky start. —Seattle-based Accolade is teaming up with Teladoc (NYSE: TDOC)—which provides quick access to doctors via phone, mobile app, or Web—to help drive up utilization of the service among people whose health insurance plans cover it. It’s the latest partnership for Accolade, which bills itself as a healthcare concierge, helping people navigate and efficiently use their benefits, and is building an ecosystem of partners that provide those benefits. The company previously teamed up with Bellevue, WA-based Limeade, a corporate wellness technology provider. —Limeade, meanwhile, added a new service that can identify employee turnover risks based on their utilization of corporate wellness programs. Limeade allows employers to examine trends in employee turnover in discrete groups, such as within a given department or location, but not at the level of an individual employee. The insights the dashboard delivers are based on Limeade research showing that “turnover rates were four times higher among employees who weren’t registered for a well-being program compared to registered employees,” the company says in a news release. Employees who registered but had lower participation levels had turnover rates two times higher than those with high levels. —The pace of deal-making and alliance-building in self-driving vehicles continues accelerating. Bellevue-based heavy truck manufacturer PACCAR—which makes trucks under the nameplates DAF, Kenworth, and Peterbilt—is working with NVIDIA, the chip-maker whose graphics processing units are fast becoming work-horses in machine learning applications. The companies said they’ve already developed a proof-of-concept self-driving truck. —If you use Alexa on your iPhone, will Siri be jealous? The turf war over virtual assistants took on a new dimension this week when Amazon put Alexa inside its popular iOS app. Open the Amazon app on your iPhone or iPad, tap the microphone, and Alexa is there. In the words of Wired reporter Brian Barrett: “Amazon’s shopping app, already a top destination, now becomes a Trojan Horse for Amazon’s most promising product in years. Stop in to check the daily deals, and get acquainted with the most fully formed voice assistant out there while you’re at it. Might as well order an Echo or Dot or Tap while you’re in there. The Fire Phone may have fizzled, but who needs it when you’re on the iPhone 7?” —In other voice assistant news, Google Home started inserting what appeared to be advertising into its chatbot’s “My Day” dialogues with users, which provide information about the weather, calendar events, and the like. The Register reports the details of the ad, which promoted the debut of the Disney live action “Beauty and the Beast” reboot. Google’s initial corporate response, which The Register described as “absolutely pants-on-head mad” denied that it was an ad, and then doubled-down on the advertising for the film: “the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.” A Google spokesperson later added that it “wasn’t intended to be an ad. … We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” The indispensable Twitter account of @SwiftOnSecurity took note of the episode and offered the following reminder: We carry a camera and microphone tethered to the greatest, fastest centralization of trust in human history. Arrogance is still ill-advised. — SwiftOnSecurity (@SwiftOnSecurity) March 16, 2017 —Seattle-based PitchBook says venture capital investors funded startups with female founders at a higher rate in 2016 than in any prior year. It’s still a pretty low rate: 16.8 percent of VC investment deals in 2016 went to companies with at least one female founder, up from 16.5 percent in 2015, and 7.2 percent in 2007. —A couple of Xconomy stories to catch up on: Former Gates Investor, Advisor Unveil $200M Biomatics Health Fund Visit the Titanic in OceanGate’s Carbon Fiber Sub: Only $105,129  —And finally, in these fraught and unprecedented times, it’s hard to know what’s important. But this clearly is: Making sure a pint is a pint. Crosscut raised the issue of the city of Seattle enforcing a true, 16-ounce pint. Apparently, there are glasses out there that are designed to hold only 14 ounces, but look and feel like a standard 16-ounce pint. Is there not yet an app for this?

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Mar 18, 2017 at 10:50AM Last November, U.S. legacy carrier United Continental (NYSE:UAL) announced that it would cut its capital spending plans for the next few years by deferring 61 orders for Boeing's (NYSE:BA) workhorse 737 jet. This caused some investors to worry about whether Boeing would still be able to ramp up 737 production as planned. However, Boeing continues to sell current-generation 737s -- confusingly called the 737 Next Generation (or 737 NG) by Boeing -- at a slow but steady pace. Combined with the company's policy of "overselling" its production slots, this means that Boeing's 737 production plans still look safe. Boeing has an aggressive plan for the 737 With demand for the aging (but highly profitable) Boeing 777 widebody falling off a cliff lately, the Boeing 737 is set to become the company's main cash flow generator in the years ahead. To maximize the 737 program's cash flow and meet customer demand, Boeing plans to aggressively raise output over the next two to three years. Boeing plans to boost production of the 737 by 36% over the next three years. Image source: Boeing. Today, Boeing is building 737 jets at a rate of 42 per month. It will boost production to 47 per month this summer, with plans to increase output to 52 per month next year and 57 per month in 2019. These projected increases are supported by a backlog of roughly 4,400 unfilled 737 orders. That said, most of the remaining orders are for the upcoming 737 MAX variant. Boeing plans to deliver the first MAX airplane next quarter, but it won't fully switch over to 737 MAX production until late 2019 or 2020. Thus, if too many customers want to switch from the 737 NG to the 737 MAX, it will disrupt Boeing's production plan. United changes its plans This explains why so many investors were concerned when United Continental converted a slew of orders from the 737 NG to the 737 MAX. United had ordered 65 737-700s earlier in 2016. However, CEO Oscar Munoz overhauled his management team during the course of the year. The new leadership group decided that the 737-700s weren't really needed. United executives decided in late 2016 that the airline had ordered too many planes. Image source: United Airlines. United Airlines ended up keeping the four orders that were scheduled for delivery in 2017, but converting them to the larger 737-800 model. The other 61 737-700s -- which were set to arrive in 2018 and 2019 -- were deferred indefinitely. United hasn't even decided which version of the 737 MAX it will take. Boeing rebuilds its backlog Ordinarily, order deferrals aren't very worrisome for popular models like the Boeing 737. Airbus and Boeing both routinely take in more orders than their production capacity allows, anticipating that some customers will want to defer or cancel orders for one reason or another. That said, as of January, industry analyst Scott Hamilton observed that Boeing had "pretty much used up its over-sales margin" for the 737 following the big United Airlines deferral. This potentially raised the risk that any future deferral requests would force Boeing to alter its production plans. Yet that line of thinking assumes airlines are done with buying 737 NGs and only want state-of-the-art models like the A320neo and 737 MAX. However, both of those next-gen models have long backlogs. Airlines that need extra planes in 2018 or 2019 may have no choice but to buy an older-technology aircraft like the 737-800. Big "end-of-line" discounts can also spur sales among more price-sensitive airlines. Indeed, orders for the 737 NG are still flowing in at a steady pace. Year to date, Boeing has sold 22 737 NGs, compared to just 15 737 MAX aircraft. Thus, within a few months, Boeing has replaced more than a third of the deferred United orders in its backlog. This result is particularly impressive considering that Boeing was still sold out of 737 NG production slots (or close to it) after the United deferral. It suggests that if a few more customers choose to convert 737 NG orders from late 2018 or 2019 to future 737 MAX orders, Boeing would have no trouble lining up replacement buyers. The 737-800 and other members of the 737 NG family aren't exactly state-of-the-art anymore. Nevertheless, they are proven performers that airlines are still happy to buy -- at least if the price is right. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

Who's next on his hit list? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Mar 18, 2017 at 10:13AM President Donald Trump is on a roll. A series of tweets targeting the high cost of Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 stealth fighter jet apparently resulted in LockMart cutting $600 million off the price of a batch of 90 stealth fighters in January. It may have even had something to do with Boeing (NYSE:BA) offering the Navy a steep price cut on a deal to buy a dozen F/A-18 and EA-18G fighters in March. Now, if Boeing could just be convinced to cut the price on its Air Force One contract by a few hundred million, savings resulting from Trump's defense-spending tweet storms could soon top $1 billion. This gets us to wondering: Which big-ticket defense-spending programs will Trump target next -- and which defense companies will see their profits pinched as a result? Here are three possibilities. 1. The $14 billion supercarrier Image source: Huntington Ingalls. Huntington Ingalls' (NYSE:HII) Ford-class supercarrier seems one likely suspect -- and at $14 billion a pop, this gigantic aircraft carrier offers a big potential target for Trump's next tweet storm. Earlier this month, Trump boarded the USS Gerald R. Ford to make a speech in support of his proposal to grow the U.S. Navy to 350 ships in size, including 12 full-size nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. That's two more carriers than we currently have -- which sounds like good news for Huntington Ingalls. But here's the thing: At the same time as Trump made the case for enlarging the Navy, he also suggested that he wants all of these new ships to come with smaller price tags. "The same boat for less money, the same ship for less money, the same aircraft for less money," promised the president. "That's what we do." Unfortunately for Huntington Ingalls, it might also "do" in Huntington Ingalls' current 12.1% operating profit margin, if Trump follows through on his promise. 2. $13 billion for a submarine? Dive, dive! Image source: General Dynamics. Huntington's problems may not end at the water's surface, either. While it's the principal contractor building the Ford-class carriers, Huntington will cooperate with peer shipbuilder General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) to build the new Columbia class of ballistic missile submarines, which will replace the current Ohio class (and up until recently, it was commonly called the "Ohio Replacement Class"). According to the U.S. Navy, Columbia-class nuke boats will cost just $6.6 billion -- eventually, and assuming General Dynamics and Huntington can build them fast enough, and win bulk contracts for their construction, so that efficiencies of scale kick in. But according to the Congressional Budget Office, before that happens, the lead ship of the class -- USS Columbia -- will cost about $13 billion to build. That's bound to create sticker shock at the White House, and it could earn Huntington and General Dynamics some nasty tweets. If this results in lower prices, and reduced profit margins, it could prove especially problematic for General Dynamics, which, unlike Huntington Ingalls, earns only an 8.8% profit margin on its shipbuilding business as it is. 3. Bombs away! (and bombers, too?) Image source: Northrop Grumman. If Trump wants to find a really big big-ticket item to attack, though, he'll need to raise his sights above the horizon -- raise 'em way up, in fact, and scan the skies for Northrop Grumman's (NYSE:NOC) new B-21 "Raider" stealth bomber program. The Air Force initially laid out a goal of buying B-21s for about $550 million. So, pricing its bid at just $511 million per plane, Northrop Grumman may feel it has won itself some immunity from Trump's criticism of too-high military aircraft prices. But there are a couple of caveats I need to point out here. First and foremost, Northrop quoted its $511 million price tag in 2010 dollars -- although its bid to build the plane was placed in 2015. In today's dollars, the plane is already expected to cost closer to $558 million per unit. Additionally, this per-plane cost refers only to the cost of construction and does not include the cost of developing the B-21 in the first place. Once you add all of the costs in, the actual cost to U.S. taxpayers of building a fleet of 100 B-21 stealth bombers comes to $79.2 billion (best case), or even as much as $93 billion (my best estimate). Across a fleet of 100 aircraft, that works out to nearly $1 billion per airplane, or about 10 times the average cost that Lockheed Martin is targeting for its F-35 stealth superjet. A tempting target for a mean tweet from Trump? I think so. Northrop Grumman had better "watch its six," or its fat 13% operating profit margin could soon be at risk.

Workers at the company’s Washington state factories were informed by their union that Boeing had issued a federally required notice that “involuntary layoffs were scheduled for May.” A Boeing spokesman confirmed the 60-day notice, but declined to say precisely when it would initiate the layoffs. Boeing has been cutting staff to reduce costs since early 2016, primarily through buyouts and the attrition of executives, managers and engineering staff. The notices are the first official signal from the company that it will lay off some of the factory workers who assemble its jets. The machinists union in Seattle, which represents thousands of Boeing employees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After years of record buying, the pace of orders for Boeing’s twin-aisle jets has slowed significantly. Boeing is cutting back current-generation 777 production, its most profitable large jet, by nearly 60 percent from its peak. Boeing is adjusting its employment to account for that lost revenue. The company is also under pressure to offer better prices to airlines while promising Wall Street improved profit margins. As of last month, Boeing had 148,000 workers. About half its employees work in Boeing’s commercial aircraft unit, where the buyout offers were made. The company had already cut the jetliner unit’s head count by 9 percent in the past year.

Workers at the company’s Washington state factories were informed by their union that Boeing had issued a federally-required notice that “involuntary layoffs were scheduled for May.” A Boeing spokesman confirmed the 60-day notice, but declined to say precisely when it would initiate the layoffs. Boeing has been cutting staff to reduce costs since early 2016, primarily through buyouts and the attrition of executives, managers and engineering staff. The notices are the first official signal from the company that it will lay off some of the factory workers who assemble its jets. A person familiar with the notices said this latest round of cuts in May would affect fewer than 500 staff. The Machinists union in Seattle, which represents thousands of Boeing employees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After years of record buying, the pace of orders for Boeing’s twin-aisle jets, including its 777 and 787 Dreamliners, has slowed significantly. Boeing is cutting back current-generation 777 production, its most profitable large jet, by nearly 60% from its peak. Boeing is adjusting its employment to account for that lost revenue and is under pressure to offer better prices to airlines while promising Wall Street improved profit margins. As of last month, Boeing had 148,000 workers. About half its employees work in its commercial aircraft unit, where the buyout offers were made. The company had already cut the jetliner unit’s head count by 9% in the past year. –CNNMoney’s Chris Isidore contributed to this report.

According to the MOU, the regulator will cooperate with Boeing to enhance the efficiency and capacity of China’s airspace system as China continues to grow into one of the world’s largest and most complex aviation operating environments. Boeing will provide professional expertise to CAAC in the key fields of airspace management, flow management, aviation data, communication, navigation, surveillance, meteorology, general aviation and training. “We are focused on making sure that the airspace system does not limit growth of the airlines while maintaining the highest levels of safety,” CAAC DG-Air Traffic Management Bureau Che Jinjun said. “This MOU reaffirms our longstanding relationship with the CAAC’s Air Traffic Management Bureau and highlights Boeing’s expertise in the aviation services industry with airspace and air traffic management solutions that enhance efficiencies on a wide scale,” Boeing China president John Bruns said. “China is the largest commercial market for Boeing with tremendous growth potential. It is mutually beneficial for Boeing and the CAAC to work together to develop lasting solutions that build and enhance airspace capacity in China,” he added. CAAC’s Air Traffic Management Bureau and Boeing have other partnership cooperations that include airspace simulation projects, technical and management training and new technology initiatives. Earlier this month, China Eastern Airlines CEO Ma Xulun called on Beijing to formulate legislation for China’s air space management to meet the country’s fast-growing market demands. China’s airspace shared between Shanghai, Nanjing, Ningbo, and Hangzhou, which exceeded 150 million passengers in 2016, represents one of the busiest airspace corridors in the world.

The nominations come after months of hard-fought battles between Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the White House over staffing the Pentagon, and after the rejection of a list of names Mattis put forward that were nixed by Trump advisor Stephen Bannon, son-in-law and confidant Jared Kushner, and Mira Ricardel, who has been running the defense transition effort. The most significant nomination is longtime Boeing executive Patrick M. Shanahan to be the Deputy Secretary of Defense, essentially the No. 2 civilian official at the Pentagon. If confirmed by the Senate, he would succeed Robert Work, a widely-respected Obama administration holdover that Mattis had asked to retain until a replacement could be found. Shanahan, who has no previous experience working in the federal government, has been working on the commercial aircraft side of Boeing operations, but in the past served as vice president for both Boeing Missile Defense Systems and had a role in the company’s helicopter manufacturing division, where he oversaw several U.S. Army programs. For the deputy job, “the administration really wanted someone with industry experience,” said Mackenzie Eaglen, national security analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. One person with knowledge of the deliberations said that Mattis had wanted a deputy who could effectively argue policy differences at the White House and on Capitol Hill. But they pointed out that Trump defense transition head Mira Ricardel spent years as a Boeing executive, leading to some speculation that she pushed the Shanahan nomination. Thursday’s nominations of David Norquist to serve as the Pentagon’s comptroller and Elaine McCusker as his deputy, originated with Mattis, the source said. Though Trump has directed some barbs at the aerospace and defense giant — he criticized the cost of the new Air Force One — lately he has expressed more affinity for the firm. He ended a rally at a South Carolina Boeing manufacturing plant last month with “May God bless the United States of America, and God bless Boeing.” Having a defense executive in the number-two position may help in some respects, said Barry Pavel, former senior White House and Pentagon official under Presidents Obama and George Bush. “The deputy position is traditionally one of the key positions liaising with defense industry,” so if he has no direct government or military experience, “someone coming out of the defense industry could be an advantage in terms of running the building.” The tricky part, Pavel said, will be the day-to-running of the massive Pentagon bureaucracy. “You’re at the top of a large organization with a hefty inbox and you have to learn quickly,” Pavel said. Shanahan’s ability to do so “depends on how quickly he’ll get up the learning curve.” People close to Mattis had said he was frustrated with the blanket ban that the Trump administration placed on anyone associated with the “Never Trump” movement within the Republican national security establishment, which severely limited the pool of potential nominees. And Mattis in turn refused to accept some of the names White House staffers offered him. In a statement on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said the nominees “were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the President for nomination.” Thursday also saw the nomination of David Joel Trachtenberg, a former congressional staffer and defense official, as Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. That follows reports that Mattis withdrew his recommendation of Ambassador Anne Patterson for the job, after opposition from Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Patterson was U.S. ambassador to Egypt from 2011 to 2013 and interacted with its elected government, which had with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Earlier, Mattis had wanted to nominate Mary Beth Long, who served as assistant secretary of defense in the Bush administration, but was blocked by the White House. Trachtenberg, a former House Armed Services Committee staffer and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy from 2001 to 2003, is currently President and CEO of Shortwaver Consulting, LLC, a national security consultancy. Part of the slow roll out of nominees for the Pentagon harkens back to the failed nominations of  Vincent Viola for secretary of the Army and Philip Bilden for secretary of the Navy, after both pulled out of the running due to conflicts with their business interests. The Trump administration is now doing background vetting and financial disclosure reviews of all nominees, something that most administrations had done much earlier in their term.

It is an experience that everyone should do at least once in their life to understand what our brave airmen did sacrificing their lives and protecting our freedom. Photo by Larry Weitzman News Fly in a B-17, World War II’s most famous strategic heavy bomber By Larry Weitzman From page A1 | March 17, 2017   This weekend on March 18 and 19 at Sacramento Jet Center at Mather Airport, Madras Maiden, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress will be on display and available for rides to the public. It is an experience that everyone should do at least once in their life to understand what our brave airmen did sacrificing their lives and protecting our freedom. And sacrifice they did with about one third of all B-17s (12,732 were built) shot down during the conflict that created the greatest generation. Each B-17 carried a crew of 10 many doing double duty as gunners manning the 13.50 caliber Browning machine guns. The B-17 packed a serious wallop never mind the ability to carry up to four tons of bombs internally. On short missions and with bomb racks, it could more than double that load. While Boeing designed and built most of the B-17s, Lockheed and Douglas contributed to the effort. Madras Maiden, named for the Erickson Aviation Collection and Museum in Madras, Ore. that was named for a type of cotton. Designed by Boeing without government help in the early 1930s, it came only 30 years after the Wright Brothers.  Boeing also designed the first commercial pressurized airliner the Boeing 307 based on the B-17 platform. While about 12 B-17s are still airworthy, only one of 10 Boeing 307s built still flies. In an interesting coincidence one of the 307s made a forced landing in Madras in 1958. Howard Hughes owned a Boeing 307 personally and his airline TWA owed about five. Several Hollywood stars served in the B-17 as well as being movie stars in their own right like the John Garfield movie “Air Force, ” Gregory Peck of Twelve O’clock High, Steve McQueen in the War Lover and of course, Memphis Belle with Matthew Modine. Real stars like Clark Gable, waist gunner, General Jimmy Stewart, pilot, Gene Roddenberry, pilot, Tom Landry, pilot and Norman Lear, a radio operator actually crewed this amazing airplane during WWII. B-17s are huge. Looking out over the 104 wing and those four, big nine cylinder, 30 liter, 1,200 hp turbo and supercharged radial engines swinging props nearly 12 feet in diameter is truly awe inspiring especially listening to the sweet music they make. Goosebumps. Thrust will push you back into your seat during takeoff and climb. This particular B-17 seemed actually a bit quieter and smoother than others I have flown on. For me it was totally enjoyable, but for the real-life crews it was 6-to-8 hours of droning along in the freezing cold at 30,000 feet and then 10 or 20 minutes of sheer terror over the target. Just imagine the flak and the ME 109s attacking from every direction firing machine guns and canons, your aircraft all shot up, sometimes limping home missing parts of the fuselage, tail and wings with hopefully at least three engines still turning. Not so fast: B-17s are not fast. While having a top speed of about 290 mph, most flew missions cruising at about 180 mph, burning about 200 gallons an hour with max fuel of about 1,700 gallons, although with “Tokyo” long range tanks, it more than doubled the fuel capacity. Maximum gross weight was about 65,000 pounds and empty weight was about 36,000 pounds. Madras Maiden is set up for about 10 lucky passengers Rides are being offered for about $450 and a free membership joining the Liberty Foundation which is the supporting foundation. Each hour of flight costs about $5,000. With a membership, you get discounts to special items and your next ride is discounted to $410. Your flight is tax deductible as the foundation is a 501 © (3). Riding in a B-17 is an amazing experience. Scott Maher is the Director of Flight Operations. Plan your ride early. Call Scott at 918-340-0243 or email at [email protected] Jack Erickson is the man behind the B-17 and an aviation pioneer. His first flight was in 1952 in an 85 hp Cessna 120, The Erickson Collection has about 25 warbirds with most of them airworthy. Besides having a P-51, P-47, P-38, F4U, A26, DC-3 a PBY Catalina, the Museum has a rare Grumman Duck and an even rarer Martin Mauler AM-1 and Bellanca Aircruiser. The Mauler is surprising similar to an AD-1. Check out the website at www.Ericksoncollection.com. But Erickson made his money with the Sikorsky CH-54 and 64 heavy lift helicopters called the Sky Crane. It was recently used to fix the Oroville Dam. They were mainly used in the logging business, able to haul ten tons in a sling load. Erickson about 25 years ago, bought the type certificate meaning he owns everything about the Sky Crane. The pilots who fly the B-17 are all highly experience airline pilots. Ray Fowler who flew as Captain today not only flies for Delta, but flew F-16s in the Air Force serving four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He also flies the Museum’s P-51, P-47 and F4U Corsair. Someday Captain Fowler will have to get a real job. Erickson also has a lot of time in the same aircraft Even one of the greatest aces of WWII, Bud Anderson came out to see Madras Maiden. Anderson’s P-51 “Old Crow” is part of the collection.   A1 B17 plane A Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress will be on display and giving rides to the public.

It pumps out 1,200 hp with supercharging at just 2,500 rpm, meaning it cranks out about 2,400 pounds of torque. It swings an 11’ 7’ prop.

By Fabiola Cineas  |  March 17, 2017 at 12:18 pm comment on this post The Boeing V-22 Osprey, one of the Delco plant’s products. Image via Wikimedia Commons. As President Trump plans massive cuts across the federal government to fund defense, his new spending wish list leaves one local factory in limbo. According to the Inquirer, workers at Delco’s Boeing Corp. war helicopter factory and division headquarters may be out of jobs next year. The plant has already experienced layoffs, with the potential for more this spring, Mike Tolassi, president of the United Aerospace Workers Local 1069, told the Inquirer.  The future of their jobs is especially uncertain now because Trump’s budget, which gives the Pentagon an added $52.3 billion (a 10 percent increase) and the Department of Homeland Security a boost of $3 billion boost (an increase of more than 7 percent), calls for more Apache helicopters, which are manufactured at Boeing’s Arizona plant. On Thursday, Boeing announced that it had signed a $3.4 billion multi-year contract with the Army and an undisclosed international customer for the attack helicopters. “We’re hoping we get some money for the V-22 and the Chinook, our products here,” said Tolassi, who represents about 30 percent of the workers at Delco’s industrial plant. A spokesman for Boeing said Trump’s proposal is “an important step in the government’s effort to craft a budget,” the Inquirer says, but declined to address the Delco plant’s future. On Thursday President Trump also announced plans to nominate a Boeing executive, Patrick M. Shanahan, as deputy secretary of defense to help the Pentagon parse out how it would spend the proposed funding. Trump’s proposed budget cuts, which shift the government’s priorities, are likely to face some blockage in Congress. Follow @fabiolacineas on Twitter.

REUTERS/Joshua RobertsMore By Mike Stone WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly half of President Donald Trump's 2017 $30 billion supplemental defense budget proposal would go to buy and modernize warplanes, warships and missiles, a down payment on Trump's promises to boost military spending. Although Congress must approve the $13.5 bln request and is likely to make changes, Boeing Co would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the administration's proposal, which included $2.3 billion for 24 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet jet fighters. This is 10 more than the U.S. House of Representatives approved on March 8 in its 2017 base spending bill. The Navy will use the additional money to bolster its aging fleet of fighters, Lieutenant General Anthony Ierardi, the director of Force Structure, Resources and Assessment for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Reuters. In a Dec. 22 tweet, before he was inaugurated, Trump had suggested buying more Boeing F/A-18s, which he called "comparable" to the Lockheed Martin F-35, despite the fact that the F-35 is a stealth aircraft difficult for enemy radar to detect. The 1990s-vintage F/A-18 is does not use stealth technology. The Navy also proposed $920 million to buy six Boeing P-8 submarine-hunting aircraft. The Army requested $708 million for 20 Boeing Apache attack helicopters. Lockheed Martin is also one of the big winners in the administration's proposal. Pentagon officials said the request for additional 2017 funds would help accelerate planned acquisitions of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The Pentagon budgeted $596 million to buy five of the stealthy jets, which cost between $95 million and $123 million each, depending on the model. In the past, President Trump had complained about the "tremendous cost and cost overruns" of the F-35 program, which is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program. The Pentagon budgeted $151 million for Lockheed's THAAD missile defense and $376 million for 17 Blackhawk helicopters made by Sikorsky Aircraft, a Lockheed subsidiary. The proposal also requested $433 million to complete the third version of the DDG-51 Navy destroyer being built by General Dynamics Corp at Bath Iron Works in Maine. A General Accounting Office report published on Aug. 4 said the Navy "has not demonstrated sufficient acquisition and design knowledge" to provide an accurate estimate of the vessel's cost. The administration's supplemental request takes the base Pentagon budget for fiscal 2017 to $541 billion, analyst Robert Stallard of Vertical Research said in a report on Thursday. Congress will likely consider the request before April 28, when the current Defense Department funding expires. (This story has been refiled to correct data in paragraphs 2 and 10.)

Photo: DOUMENJOU Alexandre - Masterfilms Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Melbourne will be the first city to welcome Thai Airways International's brand new Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, the airline's first. Scheduled to commence on 16 September, Thai Airways will operate a daily Melbourne-Bangkok service aboard the Airbus A350 XWB, replacing one of the Boeing 777-200s the airline currently flies on the route. This is the precursor to a twice-daily A350 XWB Melbourne-Bangkok service when the airline takes delivery of its second A350 in September. Sydney is among the other cities slated for an A350 XWB service to Bangkok when Thai Airways expands its A350 fleet to 12 aircraft, scheduled to happen by the end of 2018. In service only since January 2015, the A350 XWB – the initials stand for Extra Wide Body – is branded the world's most advanced twin-aisle aircraft, Airbus' response to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Pay offs for passengers Thai's 3-3-3 economy-configured A350 cabin include an 18-inch (46cm) seat width, one inch more than most economy-class seats. More than half the fuselage and wings of the A350 are made from carbon composite material, which allows for higher cabin pressure, about 2000 feet lower than the standard 8000 feet, which means more oxygen, and a more comfortable passenger experience. Other pluses include the biggest overhead bins of any aircraft, allowing every passenger to stow a standard cabin-compliant case of maximum dimensions, a draught-free circulation system, 11-inch video screens on the inflight entertainment system and glowing LED lighting that enables the airline to curate its own colour scheme.  The A350 bills itself as the quietest passenger aircraft, aside from the giant A380 superjumbo. The A350 is six decibels quieter than the Boeing 787, a point the aircraft's marketing director Francois Obe was keen to emphasise to the international press hosted by Thai International at Toulouse on the delivery flight on 30 August. The A350 is also the aircraft that in its future "Ultra Long Range" configuration holds the promise of non-stop flights from Australia to Western Europe. As well as long legs, one of the factors that facilitates this is regulatory approval for the aircraft to fly on just one engine for up to six hours, three hours more than usual, allowing it to operate over long overwater routes far from landing sites that might be required in case of an emergency diversion. "In its ULR variant, the A350 is capable of taking you right around the globe with just one stop on the way," according to Obe. The A350 acquisition is part of a turnaround strategy for Thai, which lost $US700 million ($A931 million) in 2014 according to Thai Airways international president Charamporn Jotikasthira. The airline has suffered from a chaotic aircraft choice, passenger loads well below average and stubborn adherence to routes that were costing it millions of dollars every year. "2015 was the year we stopped bleeding," Jotikasthira said shortly before boarding the delivery flight from Toulouse to Bangkok. Jotikasthira has taken the broom to the airline since he came on board at the end of 2014, streamlining the fleet with less aircraft types, selling off aircraft, cutting unprofitable routes and instituting an early retirement scheme. Strategies to bring passengers back include an upgraded first and business class service, new routes such as a direct Frankfurt-Phuket service, a resumption of the service to Moscow and the revival of another to Tehran that was abandoned during the sanctions era – plus the new fleet of Airbus A350s. Jotikasthira also has ambitions to reposition Bangkok as the major hub for South-East Asia. "We're back," said Jotikasthira at a press conference at the Airbus Delivery Centre in Toulouse, and the signs are hopeful, with Thai Airways International taking the Most Improved Airline gong at the Skytrax 2016 World Aircraft Awards. Michael Gebicki travelled to Toulouse as a guest of Thai Airways.

Of the 268 AH-64E Apaches contracted to Boeing, 244 are for the US Army and 24 for Saudi Arabia. (IHS Markit/Patrick Allen) This first AH-64E multiyear contract, which was awarded by the US Department of Defense (DoD) on 15 March, covers multiyear lots 7-11 production, and comprises 268 Apaches, as well as crew trainers, ground support equipment, spares, logistics, and engineering technical services. Of the 268 helicopters, 244 are remanufactured models for the US Army and 24 are new-build for Saudi Arabia. Work should be complete by 30 June 2022. The contract is a modification to an earlier USD184.93 million DoD AH-64E production contract awarded on 21 March 2016 that covered Lot 7 production for the US Army. The completion date of that earlier award is 30 June 2017. It is not clear which branch of the Saudi Arabian military the new Apaches are earmarked for, with the Royal Saudi Land Forces (RSLF) having begun receiving 36 AH-64Es in 2014 (augmenting the 12 AH-64A/D platforms it already fielded), and the Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG) having received its 12 AH-64E-variant Apaches. The Saudi Royal Guard was looking to buy 10 AH-64Es of its own, but it has been reported that these would be rolled into the RSLF's order instead. Of these three branches of the Saudi armed forces, it is the SANG that is building up its aviation capabilities at a determined rate. The 12 AH-64Es that it has already received form part of the 1st Aviation Brigade (AB), which will be fully stood up at Khashm Al An airfield near Riyadh in May. Two more operational aviation brigades (plus one training brigade) will be formed through to 2023, by which time the SANG will have 156 aircraft in its inventory (at the standing up of the 1st AB the SANG will have received the first 48).

(GeekWire Photo / Jacob Demmitt) President Donald Trump today announced his intent to nominate longtime Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan as deputy secretary of defense, the Pentagon’s No. 2 civilian spot. Shanahan, 54, currently oversees Boeing’s manufacturing operations and supplier management functions as senior vice president for supply chain and operations. He’s the chair of the University of Washington’s Board of Regents, a UW engineering grad and a member of the Washington Roundtable. His background also includes management roles for the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 commercial airline programs, as well as work with Boeing Missile Defense Systems. During his time as vice president and general manager for Boeing’s Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia, he was responsible for all U.S. Army aviation, including the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Chinook and Apache helicopters. If the Senate confirms his nomination, Shanahan would serve under Defense Secretary James Mattis, a retired Marine general who also has Washington state roots. Mattis was born in Pullman, raised in Richland and graduated from Central Washington University in Ellensburg. Boeing was one of the first companies to feel Trump’s ire after last November’s election, when the president-elect complained via Twitter that the cost of replacing Air Force One was too high. (The true price tag has not yet been set.) Relations turned more sanguine after a series of meetings between Trump and Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, The president called Muilenberg a “good man,” and the CEO said Trump’s plans are “headed in the right direction.” In January, Mattis ordered a review of the Air Force One negotiations with Boeing. And this month, Muilenburg said at a Chamber of Commerce aviation conference that he’s had “very productive conversations” with Trump about “how we streamline requirements and certification, to get a better airplane, get it sooner, and to get it at lower cost.” Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

Trump Nominates Boeing Executive As Deputy Secretary Of Defense By Vishakha Sonawane @VishakhaNS On 03/17/17 AT 3:23 AM Close President Donald Trump on Thursday nominated senior Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan as deputy secretary of defense. The nomination appears to be a sign of eased tensions between Trump and Boeing over the latter’s Air Force One program. The announcement was made along with nominations for five other Pentagon positions that have remained vacant since Trump’s inauguration in January. Shanahan does not have military or political experience, but he is reported to be familiar with the know-how of the defense sector from the business side. The deputy secretary of defense post under former President Barack Obama was held by Robert Work. Shanahan assumed his current role as senior vice president for supply chain and operations at Boeing last April. Before that, he served as the senior vice president of airplane programs at Boeing Commercial Airplanes and managed the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 programs. Shanahan was also vice president and general manager of Boeing's Missile Defense Systems and vice president and general manager for the aerospace giant’s Rotorcraft Systems in Philadelphia. At the time, his job was to administer U.S. Army Aviation programs, including the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the CH-47 Chinook and the AH-64D Apache attack helicopter. The nomination comes just months after Trump criticized Boeing over the cost of the Air Force One 747 aircraft program and said it should be cancelled. “Well, the plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for [the] Air Force One program," the 70-year-old said in January. “And I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” However, he seemed to have mellowed his stance after meetings with the company CEO Dennis Muilenburg. The president reportedly said that he has brought down the cost of the Air Force One program.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s stock is primarily to blame for the weakness in the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, rather than market-capitalization weighted like the S&P 500 . Goldman's stock shed $3.82, or 1.5%, as a decline in Treasury yields weighed on the financial sector. That price decline is shaving about 26 points off the Dow's price. Meanwhile, Boeing Co.'s stock , up $1.62, or 0.9%, is the Dow's biggest price gainer, but is adding just 11 points to the Dow's price.

Analyst Rajeev Lalwani cut his rating to equal weight from overweight, but raised his stock price target to $190, which is 6.3% above Friday's closing price of $178.70, from $185. Lalwani said he remains upbeat on the company's earnings potential, given fundamental positives including increased aircraft orders, emerging defense opportunities, potential tax reform and economic stimulus, but its current valuation implies just a "moderate" total return. The stock has soared 15% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 5.8%.

Warren/Associated Press Pat Shanahan By Dominic Gates and Jim Brunner / The Seattle Times The White House announced Thursday that President Donald Trump has nominated senior Boeing executive Pat Shanahan as deputy secretary of defense. After a rocky start between the new administration and the aerospace and defense giant, the nomination of Shanahan, now senior vice president for supply chain and operations at Boeing, is the latest sign of an increasingly cozy relationship. Boeing offered congratulations to Shanahan in a statement that lauded his experience in management of factory operations, engineering, development and production programs and the company’s supply chain. “We fully expect his continued and strong leadership for the Defense Department as it seeks to adapt to a dynamic and challenging defense environment,” the statement added. Shanahan, 54, has no military or political experience. He is, however, familiar with defense procurement from the business side. He ran Boeing’s military rotorcraft division in Philadelphia for two and a half years, where he was responsible for the Apache and Chinook helicopter programs as well as the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor airplane. Starting in 2004, he spent nearly three years in Washington, D.C., heading the company’s ballistic missile defense program. Having begun his career in the Commercial Airplanes division, where he ran 767 and 757 programs, Shanahan returned to Commercial in 2007 to take over the troubled 787 Dreamliner program. Shanahan managed that program directly for 14 months, working to fix the early development problems that caused multiple delays. In 2008, he was elevated to senior vice president as head of all commercial airplane programs. In charge of manufacturing at Boeing’s major final assembly sites, he is credited with the smooth increases of production that followed. A year ago, new Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg appointed Shanahan to Boeing’s executive council, its top leadership group, with a new role overseeing supply chain management and manufacturing operations for the whole company. As those positions suggest, Shanahan is seen as a detailed, behind-the-scenes manager of complex operations. His more public, political role in the Pentagon will offer new challenges. In a rare appearance at an open-ended press conference during the Paris Air Show several years ago, Shanahan struggled for words on stage when pointedly questioned by a group of international journalists. In December, President Trump shocked Boeing management on Twitter when he complained about the proposed high cost of replacing Air Force One and threatened to cancel the program. Trump also threw into doubt a lucrative Boeing commercial jet order still pending with Iran. However, CEO Muilenburg met with Trump several times after the Air Force One tweet and seems to have mollified him. Trump subsequently declared victory in bringing down the price of the presidential jet program — though the proclaimed savings had already been in the works — and then spoke of possibly ordering more Boeing F/A-18s jet fighters. Last month, the president turned an invitation from Boeing to speak at its assembly plant in South Carolina for the rollout of the first 787-10 into a campaign-style rally. Calling the Boeing jetliner “an amazing piece of art,” Trump praised Boeing as a creator of American manufacturing jobs. If Shanahan’s nomination is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, he’ll be chief deputy to Defense Secretary James Mattis. Shanahan’s presence in the Defense Department would place a Boeing alum in a senior position as the Pentagon as it considers the next big defense procurement contract award. That’s the Air Force T-X jet trainer program, which seems to be down to two main contenders, one team led by Lockheed Martin and another by Boeing. However, under the ethics rules that Trump issued for his appointees in January, Shanahan will be required to recuse himself from any Boeing-related business for two years. Defense analyst Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute said that people who have transferred from the defense industry into the Pentagon in the past have generally leaned over backwards to avoid showing favoritism to their former employers. Shanahan also is a University of Washington regent, appointed by then-Gov. Chris Gregoire in 2012. A Washington state native, Shanahan joined Boeing in 1986. He graduated from the UW with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. He also holds a dual master’s degree in business administration and mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Shanahan has not been a major political donor, federal and state campaign-finance records show. The money he has given has largely gone to Democrats.

In one of them, Qatar Airways sets off a media stampede when it unveils its private suites for business class travellers, which it says will revolutionise travel. In the other corner, Emirates is showing off its new premium lounge bar in the sky and plush new business class seats for its Boeing 777s. Between them is Etihad - the third of the big state-owned Gulf carriers - and the airline is taking a select few people through its three-room ''Residence.'' This apartment with a butler costs close to $45,000 return from Sydney to London - per passenger. Both Qatar and Emirates fly from New Zealand through their respective Middle Eastern hubs and they are two airlines at the very sharp end of the premium cabin battle. One travel expert has likened it to an arms race. At a packed news conference at the ITB conference in Berlin, Qatar's chief executive Akbar Al Baker said the "QSuite" would redefine travel. It allows for four berths to be realigned by shifting screens to form a mini meeting area. Passengers can further adjust the screens to create a semi-private double bed for couples. The first of the retrofitted planes would be operating between Doha and London by June. Qatar's Boeing 777-200LRs that started flying on the Auckland-Doha route would fitted with the suites from the middle of next year. Continued below.

Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker. Photo / Nick Reed Al Baker's news conferences are must-attends and in Berlin he works the room asking his friends in the media to do away with formalities and call him Akbar ( "and please don't call me [Your] Excellency - it makes me feel 100 years old." An Airbus executive comes in for a light roasting: "I scream at him every day about why they are not delivering airplanes faster, " Al Baker says. His airline was re-launched 20 years ago and he's been at the helm during that time. "This journey has not been easy, especially when we have to compete with giants both within our region and in other regions." American carriers, which are battling all the Gulf airlines' expansion into the US, come in for a serious lashing from Al Baker. We will be in the forefront of competition and we will give them Hell. Akbar Al Baker "When you have a substandard product then you shouldn't be complaining about people that provide a high standard product. We will be in the forefront of competition and we will give them Hell." Most airlines have modernised their aircraft during the past decade and one analyst says it is cabin interiors where the battle is now being fought. About 95 per cent of the world's 3.8 billion passenger journeys are in the economy cabin, which for airlines is their bread and butter. It's premium cabin yields that can provide the big difference, if they get them right. Innovation in cabin design was vital, Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securities in Paris, told Bloomberg. "Companies with poor seats lose passengers and those with good ones keep them," he said. Flight Centre's general manager of product, Sean Berenson, said the Middle Eastern carriers in particular were slugging it out. ''They're absolutely in an arms race to produce the best product."

At Emirates' Berlin stand, the airline is displaying its multimillion-dollar revamp of the onboard lounge on its double decker A380s, which airline president Sir Tim Clark said had taken its inspiration from a private yacht cabin. While retaining the trademark horseshoe-shaped bar, the new lounge will have more seating and also feature an airier look and feel.The new bars will be rolled out from July, including in planes that fly New Zealand routes. Emirates is bigger than Qatar and has much more capacity into New Zealand, with five of the big two-deck aircraft flying in and out daily. It came out as top airline in a recent House of Travel survey of those travelling across the Tasman. While Al Baker believes the US carriers are lagging with product, they are a long way ahead of where they were just five years ago. On its transpacific routes, American Airlines has lie-flat beds in the Dreamliners it is adding to its fleet at a rapid rate, and Hawaiian Airlines now has 18 Italian-made lie-flat seats on its longhaul A330 planes, including those which fly to Auckland. Although primarily a leisure carrier, it is aiming at couples and those travelling for special occasions. Delta has also developed closed-in suites, but Qatar may beat them into the air. Other airlines flying to New Zealand have upgraded. Among them, Cathay Pacific has a completely new business class cabin in the A350s it has been flying here since October last year. Singapore Airlines has spent $465 million remodelling the cabins of its 777-300s and has said it will use the upgraded planes to cover the peak period in New Zealand. The "Next Generation" cabins aboard the aircraft feature new comforts and have first class mini-suites that the airline says are among the most spacious in the sky, and business class seats that have the industry's widest fully flat bed. Although it relies on loyalty, service and cabin innovation rather than outright bling, Air New Zealand is refreshing its 777-300s. Australasian rival Qantas has revamped business class seats in its Boeing 787 Dreamliners coming into its fleet later this year and will fly from Perth to London next year. Thai Airways says that in the highly competitive airline industry it has completed a revamp of its Business Class cabins, "placing service-based emphasis on the needs and personal preferences of each passenger, equivalent to that of a five star hotel" and offering those passengers foot, neck or shoulder massages in its Bangkok lounge. And it's on the ground where airlines are also battling it out. Video At Cathay's Hong Kong base, the airline has several lounges. One covers 3300sqm, is 100m in length, with fast and slow lanes for dining, drinking and relaxation options along the way. Air New Zealand has spent tens of millions of dollars upgrading its lounges in Auckland, and along Australia's east coast and has moved into a new Star Alliance lounge in Los Angeles. The priciest real estate in the world Aircraft cabin real estate is probably the most expensive in the world, so the airlines go through painstaking processes to get interiors right. Qantas is introducing Boeing 787 Dreamliners later this year and early next will use the plane to fly on very long haul routes. Every part of its cabin has been extensively reviewed, because of the length of time passengers will spend there. The airline's Dreamliners will have a strong premium skew, with 42 business class seats, 28 brand new design premium economy seats and 166 economy seats. The seats come from Thompson Aero Seating in Portadown, Northern Ireland, where the company enlists local residents to test trial seats by sleeping on them. Qantas business class seats for its Dreamliner fleet. Airlines seats are built to suit 95 per cent of the flying population and they then aim to make sure those outside that percentile band are comfortable. Qantas will use tri-weave fabric rather than leather on its Dreamliners as it has found the fabric breathes better on long haul flights. The finish on the aluminium and darker woodgrain laminate is all very deliberate. It has to look good while conforming to strict safety regulations, and always battling against adding weight. The seats, which will be arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration, are fitted with high-power USB chargers to meet the growing demand for rapid charging of the devices passengers are bringing on board. Qantas is also designing a self-serve bar in the business cabin, and expect a move away from anything that has the industrial galley look. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

"When the planes land from the west, they swoop low over the beach and this is a thrill for beachcombers and aviation spotters. The plane depicted here is a B777-300ER of Etihad Airways." Plane spotting: How a beginner can ID commercial jets By Karla Cripps, CNN Updated 10:34 PM ET, Thu March 16, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)"That's not an A330, it's an A320." Don't you just hate getting stuck seated next to that guy on the plane? The person who can take one look at a jet and knows right away which company manufactured it and which family it belongs to, but can also throw in some random facts about its performance. With so many online resources allowing aviation fanatics to track planes and share their favorite photos and experiences, plane-spotting has become a more alluring hobby than ever. Ready to grab your binoculars? Read More Here are some tips and tricks to get you started. The difference is in the details "Identifying an airplane from a distance is a skill that comes with familiarity and the only way to gain that is to be around airports and ogling at airplanes as regularly as one could," says Kok Chwee Sim, a Singapore based aviation photographer who began plane-spotting in the early 1970s as a child. Could Russian plane challenge Airbus, Boeing "There is of course the overall shape of the airplane to note but there comes a point where one plane looks like another. So there are other details that one could look to for clues." Where to begin? Matt Falcus, founder of Airportspotting.com and author of World Airports Spotting Guides, says it can get tricky because many airliners do indeed look similar, especially those built by Airbus and Boeing, the two main manufacturers. "However, you can start to distinguish airliners by the number of engines they have, or by whether they are a large long-haul aircraft which travel long distances, or a short/medium-haul aircraft which travel on domestic or regional flights." There are also clues in the shape of the nose, tail position, wing shape, number of doors, the landing gear, the position of the horizontal stabilizer near the tail and even the shape of the cockpit windows. Sky pioneers: The light aircraft revolution For instance, if you look at most Boeing cockpit windows, they're usually slanting upward in a V shape. Airbus windows, on the other hand, have more of a square shape. Keep in mind this isn't always the case, with Airbus' new A350 XWB featuring black sunglasses-shaped windows. Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A320 vs Boeing 737 series – These two narrow-body, twin-engine, single-aisle planes are among the most common commercial jets in the world. To an amateur, it can be difficult to spot which is which given they're very similar in size. The secret is to look at the nose and tail shape. Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A330 vs. Boeing 787 series – Again, these two wide-body twin-engine jets are similar in size but their nose shapes offer an easy hint. Another giveaway? The Boeing 787 has a jagged engine cowling, or cover, and a raked wing tip. Hide Caption 2 of 5 Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A340 vs. Boeing 777 series – Though both planes are commonly used for long-haul flights, these wide-body jets differ dramatically in appearance. The Airbus A340 has four engines, while the Boeing 777 has two. Hide Caption 3 of 5 Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A350 vs. Boeing 777 series – This pairing is to become more relevant in the coming years given Airbus stopped producing the A340 in 2011. Its successor, the Airbus A350, is a twin-engine wide-body jet airliner with a raked wing tip and a conical exhaust vent. Hide Caption 4 of 5 Photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A380 vs. Boeing 747 series – Now this one's easy. Both might have four engines but the A380 -- the world's largest passenger jet -- is a double decker while the 747 has one and a half decks. Hide Caption 5 of 5 "At night and in darkness, one could even distinguish a Boeing aircraft from an Airbus aircraft by the way the strobe -- the white light at the tip of the wing -- blinks," says Sim. Airbus wingtip strobes flash twice in quick succession, Boeing lights flash only once. So how about when it's flying above you? "As a tip, one way you can always identify Airbus aircraft when flying overhead is by looking at the center wing box area (under the aircraft in the middle)," says Airbus' Asia communications director Sean Lee. Related Article: Airliner with most seats ever unveiled "The wing box area on Airbus aircraft is square and more pronounced than on Boeing aircraft." Looking at the size of the plane will allow you to narrow it down further. Airbus and Boeing planes can be broken down into two groups -- narrow-body and wide-body. Narrow-body planes only have one aisle, wide-body planes have two. Airbus' narrow-body planes fall into the A320 family: A318, A319, A320 and A321. Boeing has the 737 and 757, each of which comes in different size models. For the wide-bodies, Airbus has the A300, A330, A340, A380 and A350 families (A300s and A340s are no longer in production). Why the sun is setting on the 747 Boeing's current roster of twin-aisle jets includes the 747, 767, 777 and 787. (Again, there are several versions of planes in each family. Confused yet?) Handy tip: The only planes with four engines in the above group are Boeing 747s, Airbus A340s and A380s. JUST WATCHED See Boeing Dreamliner built in hyperspeed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH See Boeing Dreamliner built in hyperspeed 01:15 As the photo at the top of this article shows, you can easily ID a Boeing 777 because it has three sets of main landing gear wheels. All other Boeing and Airbus planes have two-wheeled gear. How to know you're looking at a Boeing 777-300? It's longer than most single-deck planes and has five doors on each side of the aircraft. Also, you can always tell you're looking at an Airbus A350 because it's the only airliner with curly wingtips, while the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has a unique "jagged" engine covering. For more tips on differentiating between some of the most popular Airbus and Boeing planes, check out the below gallery. Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 787 Dreamliner – Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has been in commercial service since 2011. There are currently two variants -- the 787-8 and the 787-9 (pictured). Its unique jagged nacelle (engine cover) makes it easy to spot. Hide Caption 1 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A350XWB – The new generation Airbus A350XWB entered commercial service in January 2015. There are three sizes -- the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000 -- but the only one in service now is the A350-900. Plane-spotting tip: It's the only airliner with curly wingtips. Hide Caption 2 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 737 – Chances are you've flown on a 737, which has been around since 1967 and is the best-selling airplane of all time. It comes in several variants. To distinguish it from the Airbus A320, look at the nose. It's pointier. Hide Caption 3 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A320 – The A320 is one of the world's best selling aircraft thus a popular sight on runways around the world. Its forward tail is straight and flush with the fuselage, unlike its short-haul rival, the Boeing 737, which has a V connection (see previous photo). Hide Caption 4 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A330 – The wide-body twin-engine Airbus A330 is primarily used on medium to long-range flights. It has a large wing tip and a pointed nose. It comes in two sizes -- the A330-200 and the longer A330-300 -- and has been in service since 1994. Hide Caption 5 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 757 – On November 28, 2005, Boeing wrapped up the 23-year run of the single-aisle 757 passenger airplane with the delivery of the 1,050th and final plane to Shanghai Airlines. There are still hundreds of them in service though. They come in two versions -- the 757-200 and the 757-300. Hide Caption 6 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 767 – The 757 is often confused with Boeing's larger 767. Coming in three size variants, the 767 was the company's first wide-body twin-jet and took its first flight in 1981. Differences between the two Boeing families include size, nose shape and position of the front wheel. Hide Caption 7 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A340 – Only the Airbus A380, the A340 (pictured) and Boeing 747s have four engines. Unlike the Boeing 777, the A340 has a conical exhaust vent. Expect to see fewer A340s in the skies as the years pass given Airbus stopped producing them in 2011. Hide Caption 8 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 777 – The Boeing 777 family comes in two sizes -- the 777-200 and the 777-300. How to know you're looking at a Boeing 777-300? It's longer than other single-deck planes and has five doors on each side of the aircraft. Hide Caption 9 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Airbus A380 – No prizes for picking this one out of the skies. In 2007, the four-engine Airbus A380 "superjumbo" took the place of the Boeing 747 as the world's largest passenger jet, first entering commercial service with Singapore Airlines. It's the only aircraft with two decks. Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: Popular planes and how to recognize them Boeing 747 – Sadly these beautiful birds will likely become harder to spot, with Boeing recently announcing their manufacturing rate is to be halved to six a year. The world's first wide-body airline, the Boeing 747 went on to change not only aviation but the entire tourism industry. Like the A380, it's an easy one to spot -- it's the only plane with an extra half deck. Hide Caption 11 of 11 Listen to the engine "Once you start to get really good, you'll even notice the difference in sounds made by the plane's engines, says Sim. "When a plane approaches with a sound that we could not recognize, it is time to get really excited." He points to one such plane-spotting experience he enjoyed last year in Singapore. "Turned out it was an Ilyushin IL-76 of the Indian Air Force that arrived ahead of India's prime minister." Rare birds With a solid base of aviation knowledge spotters will likely start noticing planes made by other manufacturers. Bombardier and Embraer are also significant players in the commercial aviation game, with their narrow-body CRJ and ERJ series popularly used for regional flights. Related Article: Why the sun is setting on the Boeing 747 Then there are the planes that are no longer in production thus becoming increasingly rare -- making them a hot target for plane spotters. "More regularly, I am excited by a group of planes known to us as 'trijets' as well as all versions of the Boeing 747," says Sim. "These are airplanes with three engines. I'm mostly excited by the wide-bodied ones such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and the Boeing MD-11." Photos: Rare birds Ilyushin Il-62 – Entering commercial service in 1967, the Ilyushin Il-62 was the Soviet Union's first long-range jetliner. Its successor, the more fuel efficient Il-62M (pictured), came along in 1974. Want to see one take off? North Korean airline Air Koryo has a couple in its fleet. Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours tells CNN they're available for domestic charter trips and no longer fly internationally. Hide Caption 1 of 7 Photos: Rare birds McDonnell Douglas DC-10 – Flying in one of these old work horses commercially might not be an option given that Bangladesh Biman retired the last one in operation in 2013. But cargo companies like FedEx and UPS still use them, which means you've got a good chance of seeing one at an airport near you. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: Rare birds McDonnell Douglas MD-11 – This KLM McDonnell Douglas MD-11 took its final flight in 2014. It was the last carrier to operate the trijet plane on passenger flights. Like the DC-10, UPS and FedEx still have quite a few MD-11s in service though. Hide Caption 3 of 7 Photos: Rare birds Lockheed L1011 TriStar – Among the rarest of the "trijet" birds is the Lockheed L1011 TriStar. A representative of Lockheed's tech ops department told CNN the only known flying L-1011 is operated by U.S. firm Orbital Science, which uses it for airborne launches of satellite booster rockets. There are also three U.S. registered TriStars in Amman, Jordan. Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: Rare birds Tupolev-154 – This three-engine medium-range narrow-body airliner was designed in the mid-1960s. Belavia, the national airline of Belarus, was the last European carrier to operate the Tupolev TU-154 and made its final flight in 2015. For those interested in flying in one, a UK travel company is offering a North Korea charter tour in May 2016 that includes flights aboard a number of rare Russian aircraft. Hide Caption 5 of 7 Photos: Rare birds Airbus A300-600ST – OK, so this one isn't a commercial passenger jet. But considering it carries the pieces used to make them we had to include it. Your best chance of seeing one of Airbus' "Beluga" transporter planes in flight is by heading to company headquarters in Toulouse, France. More than 60 flights are performed each week between 11 sites, carrying parts for all of the Airbus programs. Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: Rare birds Boeing 747 Dreamlifter – The Boeing Dreamlifter is a modified 747-400 passenger airplane that can haul more cargo by volume than any other jet in the world. Boeing has a fleet of four Dreamlifters, which it primarily uses to transport the large composite structures of the 787 Dreamliner from partners around the world to Everett, Washington for final assembly. Hide Caption 7 of 7 Sim says that, sadly, these are increasingly difficult to see. In recent years, for instance, the passenger DC-10, MD-11 and TriStar have gone into retirement. "The only MD-11s flying are those hauling freight. There are other narrow-bodied trijets such as the Boeing 727 and the Tupolev TU-154, which also get me excited." Sim also points to Russian-built airliners from two manufacturers -- Ilyushin and Tupolev -- as being in demand among plane-spotters. Airbus Beluga: The world's strangest-looking plane "These sadly again are decreasing in numbers," he says. "From this, it sounds like my hobby is in decline. Not at all. New types such as the B787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350XWB are now flying. "Both have sleek shapes and in years to come, they too will appear in the liveries of many different airlines and I am certain I will be diligently chasing these at airports around the world." Related Article: Russian woman's remarkable mission to restore Soviet jet airliner Falcus agrees. "When I see something from my youth, such as a Boeing 727 or Douglas DC-10, or even something much older like a DC-3 Dakota, I get really excited," he says. "However, it's also great to see something ultra-modern, like the brand new Airbus A350 or Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which have amazing technology on board and can travel very long distances." Tips and gear Plane-spotting is not a hobby for those who value their creature comforts, warns Sim. "There will be many occasions when one is the only person at a spotting location, and there is every likelihood that this location is accessible by way of a long trek with no public facilities nearby," he says. "It is also very exposed to the elements." Related Article: Giant of the skies set to get even larger Not deterred? Falcus says before you head to your local airport runway it's good to have some basic equipment for plane-spotting, such as a pair of binoculars, a camera, a notebook and pen. "Using your smartphone you could download apps such as Flightradar 24, and visit websites such as Airliners.net and AirportSpotting.com," he adds. (More online resources below.) Next step: get familiar with the schedules of all the airlines flying into your local airport. "One should also keep a lookout for news of visits by government leaders or music bands," says Sim. "Such visits could mean seeing airplanes that normally are not seen at your airport." This photo of an Air France Airbus A340 flying into Princess Juliana International Airport was taken at St. Maarten's Maho Beach. Top airports for plane-spotting "There are some really good airports around the world for plane-spotting," says Falcus. Here are a few of his favorites. London Heathrow, UK: "This is one of the busiest airports in the world and you will see airlines from all corners of the globe, with one landing or taking off every minute! There are some good locations to watch aircraft at the ends of the runways." Princess Juliana International Airport, St. Maarten, Caribbean: "The beach here is at the end of the runway, so sunbathers can get blown away by big jets landing only a few meters above their heads!" St. Maarten's Maho Beach recently hooked up a live camera at Sunset Bar & Grill, a popular spot for people to sit and watch the planes take off and land. Take a look here: Mahobeachcam.com. Related Article: Boeing planes that changed the way we travel Hong Kong International: "The airport at Hong Kong is very busy, with jets coming from all over Asia, Europe and North America. It has a good viewing terrace on top of the terminal to watch aircraft from." Los Angeles International: "Spending time here is always interesting as you can see lots of aircraft come and go, and it's always busy. Not to mention the sun is usually shining, so you can take some great pictures." More specifically, the In and Out Burger is a popular hangout for spotters as you can watch the planes fly overhead. Imperial Hill at LAX is another place where many of the best spotters gather to get great photos. Toulouse, France: "This is a small airport, but it is the home of Airbus and the place where many of their aircraft are built. You can take a tour and see the aircraft being put together, and then watch them take off on their first test flights." Security concerns Plane-spotters should check with local airport police before spotting to avoid getting arrested or ticketed. Related Article: #Avgeeks: The new warriors on terror "Spotting in locations such as Singapore where the hobby is less understood, the biggest challenge is posed by the security," says Sim. "Even as one is clearly and visibly harmless near an airport, security personnel tend to insist that one moves on and not spot or photograph airplanes. "Thankfully, there are many airports in Japan, Canada, Australia, Malta and some U.S. cities such as Los Angeles where aviation spotting and photography are well accepted." Members of a spotter group at Chicago O'Hare even work with the police, FBI and TSA to help guard the facility. Top plane-spotting websites and apps If you're close enough to see the registration number, located on the side of the plane near the tail, a quick online search will give you plenty of details on the aircraft, including when it was made and by which manufacturer, which airlines have flown it and the type of engines it's fitted with. For U.S.-registered planes, head to Regosearch.com or the FAA's online plane registration database -- Registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry. By entering the plane's N-Number -- N796UA -- on the FAA's plane registration site, we learn this is a Boeing 777 manufactured in 1998 and registered to United Airlines. Flightradar24 is a website and app that offers real-time info about thousands of aircraft around the world, searchable by registration number, flight number or airline. Planespotters.net is another excellent resource that features info on airline fleets, production stats, the latest plane deliveries and photos taken by members of the airplane-spotting community from around the world. Similarly, Flightaware.com is a free website that offers live flight data and info on everything from airport delays and fuel prices to flight routes, plus aviation news and plane photos. NYCAviation.com offers plane-spotting guides for all of New York and other major U.S. airports, as well as interesting and in-depth aviation-related articles and galleries.

The White House announced nominees for six senior Pentagon jobs on Thursday, including Shanahan for deputy secretary of defense. (AP Photo/Ted Warren)   By Robert Burns The Associated Press March 17, 2017   Today’s Business stories Amazon list prices criticized Era of the 747 nears close Walmart expands online initiative David Rockefeller, last of generation in family, dies at 101 Business Highlights More Business »   WASHINGTON — The White House announced nominees for six senior Pentagon jobs on Thursday, including a longtime Boeing Co. executive for deputy secretary of defense, moving to fill out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ new team. President Trump has struggled to fill top Defense Department positions. Mattis is the only administration nominee to be confirmed at the Pentagon. Until Thursday, the administration had only announced four other nominees; two of those later withdrew. Trump’s pick for deputy secretary is Patrick Shanahan. The latest manifestation of Mattis’ struggle came earlier this week when he abandoned an effort to get White House approval for his choice of policy chief, Anne Patterson, a career diplomat who was opposed by some Senate Republicans. The White House’s nominees list Thursday didn’t include a new policy chief, but it did name a deputy policy chief. All the jobs require Senate confirmation. As deputy secretary of defense, Shanahan would succeed Robert Work, a former Marine and Obama administration holdover. Work is the only senior Pentagon official from the prior administration still in place, although others have been performing the duties of senior officials in the absence of Trump nominees. Shanahan moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing “fix-it” man in a March 2016 report on Shanahan’s promotion to his current position. He oversees the company’s global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was a central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program’s early years, the report said. Boeing’s website says Shanahan is a member of the company’s executive council, reporting directly to the chairman and president, Dennis Mullenburg. Shanahan previously was senior vice president of airplane programs from 2008 to 2016 and vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems. A Washington state native, Shanahan is currently chairman of the University of Washington’s Board of Regents. He holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

As he faces confirmation, the executive's history at Boeing will undoubtedly raise some questions about possible conflicts of interest involving his former employer. Existing close ties between the Trump administration and Boeing, one of the largest US defense contractors, could also muddy the waters. Shanahan, who is currently Boeing's senior vice president of supply chain and operations, was tapped for deputy defense secretary Thursday along with nominees for five other vacant Pentagon roles under Defense Secretary James Mattis. One is David Joel Trachtenberg, who was was selected as principal deputy undersecretary of defense. Currently CEO of national security consulting company Shortwaver, he previously served as the vice president and head of the strategic analysis division at CACI-National Security Research, a large defense contracting company that specializes in cyber analytics, counter intelligence and other services to disrupt terrorist activities. "These are all highly qualified individuals who were personally recommended by Secretary Mattis to the President for nomination," Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis told CNN. Most of Shanahan's recent job experience at Boeing lies on the company's commercial side, where he managed the 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 airliner programs. But he has also spent time running two of the manufacturing giant's defense divisions as the vice president and general manager of both Boeing Missile Defense Systems and Rotorcraft Systems. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanahan would have to pledge to recuse himself from issues involving his former employer for two years, according to an executive order pertaining to ethical commitments of executive branch appointees that Trump signed in January. Shanahan will also be expected to divest himself of Boeing-related financial interests before taking the job. Once a target of Trump's Twitter ire, Boeing has risen to significant influence inside the Trump White House. Earlier this year, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters that he has an open dialogue with the President. Trump has met with Muilenburg on several occasions since the election and the two worked together to reduce the cost of a replacement for Air Force One, according to a CNN Money report. The President also used the Boeing-produced F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet as leverage against competitor Lockheed Martin in price negotiations for 90 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters earlier this year. Mandy Smithberger, a director at the Washington-based watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, said the F-35 program is a major source of concern for possible conflicts of interest as the Pentagon continues to review ways to cut costs to the country's most expensive weapons program. If the Pentagon decides to make major cuts to the F-35 program in favor of a different aircraft, she said, that would be a situation "where Boeing can benefit substantially." And while there are federal regulations and ethical codes in place to help prevent blatant conflicts of interest, Smitherberger stressed the importance of public involvement to hold officials accountable. Trump submitted a supplemental budget request to Congress on Thursday, proposing an additional $30 billion in defense funding for the rest of 2017. Several big-ticket military priorities are highlighted in the proposal as "urgent warfighting readiness needs," including a $13.5 billion request that is partially designated to fund both the Lockheed-made F-35 and Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet. Nominating an executive of a major defense company to take a leading role at the Pentagon is not unprecedented President Barack Obama's first pick for deputy secretary of defense, Bill Lynn, was a lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon before assuming the role in 2009.

The White House said President Donald Trump intends to nominate the Boeing executive to become deputy defense secretary. (Pierre Verdy/AFP/Getty Images) March 16 AEROSPACE Boeing executive is Pentagon nominee President Trump has nominated a Boeing executive to serve as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ second-in-command, the White House said Thursday in a news release. If confirmed by the Senate, Patrick Shanahan, the senior vice president of supply chain operations for Boeing, will succeed Robert Work, who had agreed to stay on as deputy until his replacement was nominated. Although Shanahan’s recent job at the aeronautics giant was on the commercial side, he also served as vice president and general manger of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and the military rotorcraft division in Philadelphia. Trump has met multiple times with Boeing executives since he was elected, leaning on the company to reduce the cost of the replacement for Air Force One and also as leverage to do the same for Lockheed Martin’s massive F-35 program. — Thomas Gibbons-Neff PETA members gather outside the NYSE to protest as Canada Goose makes its initial public offering in New York. (Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images) ECONOMY Mortgage rates rise for second week in a row Long-term U.S. mortgage rates rose for a second straight week, posting new highs for the year. The markets were anticipating an increase in a key interest rate by the Federal Reserve, which the Fed announced Wednesday. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the rate on 30-year, fixed-rate loans climbed to 4.30 percent from 4.21 percent last week. The benchmark rate stood at 3.73 percent a year ago and averaged 3.65 percent through 2016, the lowest level in records dating to 1971. The rate on 15-year mortgages increased to 3.50 percent from 3.42 percent last week. The average fee for 30- and 15-year mortgages was unchanged this week at half a point. — Associated Press Also in Business ● McDonald’s said Thursday that it has been notified by Twitter that its account was “compromised” after it appeared to send a message calling President Trump “a disgusting excuse of a President.” The tweet to Trump from the official account for McDonald’s Corp. said it would love to have Barack Obama back in the White House. “Also you have tiny hands,” the tweet said. ● Hyundai is recalling nearly 978,000 cars in the United States because the front seat belts could detach in a crash. The recall covers Sonata midsize sedans from the 2011 through 2014 model years, and the Sonata hybrid from 2011 through 2015. Hyundai says in government documents that a fastener for a seat belt anchor may not have been fully latched during assembly. If that happens, the belts can detach. ● A federal judge in Detroit on Thursday refused to set bond for a German Volkswagen executive who was arrested in the company’s U.S. emissions scandal. U.S. District Judge Sean Cox’s decision means Oliver Schmidt will remain jailed while his criminal case moves through court. Schmid was manager of VW’s environment and engineering office in suburban Detroit. ● A Walmart supplier recalled frozen pizzas available in 11 states due to concerns about possible listeria contamination, according to the retailer and the Agriculture Department. About 6,700 pizzas with the product code 20547 sold under Walmart’s Marketside brand were affected by the recall, a representative for RBR Meat Company said Thursday. RBR recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizzas shipped to distribution centers in Utah, Washington, California and Nevada, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday. ● U.S. builders broke ground on new homes at a faster pace in February, a sign that developers expect solid sales growth this year. The Commerce Department said Thursday that housing starts rose 3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3 million. Most of the gains came from construction of single-family houses, which rose 6.5 percent. ● A financial adviser who pleaded guilty to orchestrating a $21 million Ponzi scheme was sentenced to seven years in prison. Patrick Churchville of Rhode Island was sentenced Thursday in U.S. District Court in Providence on charges of wire and tax fraud.

(Dale Erhart/Facebook) Vimy Ridge Anniversary Flight 7:48 Related Stories Snow sculpture salutes 100th anniversary of Battle of Vimy Ridge 'I still get chills': Teacher leads student trip to Vimy Memorial once more Soldier for a day: Winnipeg students prepare for centennial Vimy Ridge trip 'A soldier of their own': Veterans Affairs uses dog tags to connect kids to Vimy Pointe-Claire students travel to Vimy Ridge for battle's 100th anniversary How do you prepare for a flight? What do you make sure to pack? Comox, B.C. pilot Dale Erhart is packing six First World War replica biplanes all into one Boeing C-17 for his flight. He and his flight team will be reenacting the harrowing experience of some of the earliest pilots when they head to France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the iconic Battle of Vimy Ridge on April 9. Canadian historians consider the battle to be a pivotal moment in our history. "We want to honour our veterans and pay homage to really the birth of our nation," said Erhart, speaking during On the Island. Erhart is part of the group Vimy Flight, a team that has been training with the planes at 19 Wing Comox Airport. Once their mission is completed in France, the two Sopwith Camel "Pups" and four Nieuport scout aircraft will be loaded back into the Boeing and flown back to Canada. There they will unload again, reassemble, and fly the biplanes to Ottawa in time to perform at Canada's 150th anniversary celebrations. The flight team will be taking part in numerous activities during the celebrations overseas — Erhart said they have received numerous requests for flyovers at many locations, including Vimy. He said the real work however begins when they touch down. "Once we're on the ground we draw all the attention, and that's when we'll be able to provide the stories." Erhart said he is eager to share the experiences of Canadian pilots, many of whom only had a few hours of flight experience before strapping into the single open cockpit aircraft and flying into battle more than a century ago. A logistical challenge Earhart said the biplanes are relatively small, with most measuring only 6.7 meters across. With help from the Royal Canadian Air Force his team was able to interlock the Nieuport planes in a staggered position to make them all fit in the C-17. The replica aircraft include two Sopwith "Pups" and four Nieuport 11s. (Dale Erhart/Facebook) They then took the wings off of the Sopwith Pups and slid them under the Nieuports, cramming the fuselages behind the bigger aircraft. Earhart said there has been a tremendous amount of administrational support from the regulatory bodies involved including the French government and Transport Canada. 'Once you get into the air, it's marvelous' Erhart was an Air Canada pilot for 20 years after his military career that saw him fly numerous aircraft. After training with the biplane replicas for months in preparation for the celebration, he said piloting them is a completely different experience.  "You get into something that weighs 600 pounds, where you're combating any sort of light wind gusts and you have very low power settings ... It's a challenge," he said. "But once you get into the air, it's marvelous." Erhart said he and his team (all of whom are former military pilots) felt incredible freedom flying the planes — they had a range of visibility rarely experienced in modern aircraft.

Army and 'International' Customers Buy Apache Attack Helicopter For $3.4B By Janice Williams @manhattanjan On 03/18/17 AT 10:10 AM Close The U.S. Army is slated to receive a new fleet of Boeing's latest Apache attack helicopter after striking a deal with the American aircraft company. The sales to the Army and an unidentified international customer total $3.4 billion, but it wasn't clear what portion of that is the Army purchase. The Army will get 244 re-manufactured Apache “E” variant helicopters while the international customer will receive 24 brand new models, Boeing said in a statement Thursday. The multi-year deal, which is said to be a “significant savings to taxpayers,” is the first of its kind for the Apache “E” variant.  Boeing has sold Apache helicopters to the U.S. and 15 other countries for more than 30 years, but only seven countries outside of the U.S. have purchased the “E” model since its creation in 2011. "This agreement is great news for our Army, our soldiers, the American taxpayers, our industry partners and numerous international partners,” U.S. Army Col. Joseph Hoecherl, the project manager for the Apache deal, said. “It is a direct result of the professional dedication and diligent efforts by government and industry teammates to provide the much-needed capabilities of the world's best attack helicopter—the AH-64E Apache—at a fair and affordable price that results in year over year savings to the taxpayer. In the hands of our trained U.S. soldiers, the Apache's technologies and resulting capabilities are essential to Army operations around the globe." It wasn’t known how many years the U.S. Army and the international client were given to pay off the debt, but Boeing insisted the re-manufactured attack helicopters came at an “affordable price.” Trump has been critical of Boeing aircraft's hefty price tags, telling the company during a South Carolina rally in February that the “price is too high" for the presidential aircraft, Air Force One. The president said he would consider replacing the current Air Force One with a competitor’s aircraft manufacturer, which may potentially be Lockheed Martin. However, Trump said he would be open to using Boeing aircraft to replace the Lockheed Martin F-35s that the Army is currently using.

The bad choice of a German who joined Lufthansa as an apprentice mechanic, and had no worthwhile management experience except working in middle management within a subsidiary, raises questions about the motives of those who selected him to head PIA. Why does every government, from General (retd) Pervez Musharraf to Asif Zardari and now Nawaz Sharif’s, choose to appoint semi-literate controversial persons, whether they be a high school educated PIA pilot or this mechanic or shoe manufacturer, and expect to turn around this ailing white elephant? From the controversial swap of brand new DC-10 with the aging Boeing jumbo, to the leasing of Russian aircraft for Hajj or Umrah in the 1980s or 1990s, or Boeing and Airbus thereafter, PIA’s successive managements and their corporate planning have always paid between 60 per cent and 90 per cent more cost than the leasing rate by private airlines and other regional operators. It could only have happened in Pakistan that PIA bought Boeing 747-300 from Cathay Pacific without engines, for which the airline was paying separately per hour. Which airline would buy brand new B777 and then choose a blacklisted aircraft seat manufacturer to install seats with defective in-flight entertainment? Should alarm bells not have been raised when in 2005, PIA cancelled manufacturer recommended vendors along its network and appointed a single supplier located in a remote part of the UK only to end up being imposed with a partial ban by the EU in 2007 because of maintenance and safety issues? With no accountability, it only encouraged a corrupt political crony to appoint a single supplier for all spare parts based in Dubai resulting in half of the fleet being grounded. All this happened with approval of the board of directors, some of whom were also on the CAA governing body and aware of the leasing cost of comparative aircraft operated by private airlines. It is common knowledge that even sensitive recruitments, including pilots and engineers, are being made in violation of merit and that nepotism reigns supreme with whole families serving in the airline, compromising flight safety. I doubt whether any accountability would take place even after the interior minister’s intervention and FIA probe, because it would expose the mafia within the establishment, bureaucracy, the political elite and their cronies within PIA and CAA, who have destroyed this airline.

This is the first multi-year agreement for the Apache "E" variant. The Army will receive 244 remanufactured Apaches while 24 new ones will go to the international customer. "This agreement is great news for our Army, our soldiers, the American taxpayers, our industry partners and numerous international partners," said U.S. Army Col. Joseph Hoecherl, the Apache project manager. "It is a direct result of the professional dedication and diligent efforts by government and industry teammates to provide the much needed capabilities of the world's best attack helicopter - the AH-64E Apache - at a fair and affordable price that results in year over year savings to the taxpayer. In the hands of our trained U.S. soldiers, the Apache's technologies and resulting capabilities are essential to Army operations around the globe." Boeing builds the Apache in Mesa, Ariz. Deliveries of the "E" model began in October 2011. Seven customers outside the U.S. have ordered this variant. Including this latest version, the U.S. and 15 other countries have relied on the Apache during the past three decades. "The Apache has made a tremendous impact in the defense of the nations that have flown it for the last 37 years," said Kim Smith, Boeing Attack Helicopters vice president and program manager. "Our team understands the responsibility we have to deliver the best aircraft on time at an affordable price every day, and we are committed to maintaining that well established tradition of excellence." # # # Contact: Carole Thompson Vertical Lift Office: +1 480-891-2119 Mobile: +1 602-741-4802 carole.j.thompson@boeing.com Jerry Drelling Defense, Space & Security Office: +1 703-872-4255 jerry.a.drelling@boeing.com NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)As an experienced pilot who flies Boeing 757s for Icelandair, Commander Sigrun Bjorg Ingvadottir might seem overqualified as a cycling guide. But these days she's just as likely to be leading visitors across the wild, windswept ridges of Iceland as she is flying them across the North Atlantic. Ingvadottir is one Icelandair's 12 "stopover buddies" -- staff volunteers who give their free time to offer passengers a glimpse of Icelandic lifestyle as they pass through the island. A remote air hub It's a cool idea -- and one that's been adapted elsewhere. Read More But beyond the gimmick is a serious drive to bolster Iceland's status as a stopover destination in the fiercely competitive transatlantic aviation market. In the early days of commercial aviation, shorter flying ranges meant Iceland, halfway between Europe and North America, became an unlikely aviation hub. MORE: Best airports for a long layover Aircraft advances have diminished this role, but Icelandair has continued pushing its routes as affordable alternatives to flying directly across the Atlantic. It's also been looking for new ways of using Iceland's stunning natural settings to persuade passengers traveling through Keflavik International Airport to lengthen their stopover. And so Stopover Buddy was born. Photos: Iceland: Land of contrasts Iceland is home to more glaciers, geysers and fresh water than countries 10 times its size.

Hide Caption 10 of 10 Outdoor pursuits Anyone flying from Europe to North America with Icelandair who decides to spend some time in Iceland on their way can sign up to the Buddy program on the airline's website. Passengers choose from a range of activities -- mostly free apart from equipment rental charges -- and are then matched to an Icelandair volunteer host. Outdoor activities and sports feature prominently on the menu. There's hiking, horseback riding and fishing in the cold North Atlantic waters, but also cultural and food-related outings. So far it's been a hit. Nearly 700 Stopover Buddy requests were received during the program's debut February to April 2016 run (it's returning in the fall), with outdoor sports being the most popular activities. Enthusiastic response Air crews and other Icelandair staff have responded enthusiastically, with even the airline's CEO, Birkir Holm Gudnason, signing up. Ingvadottir, the mountain biking pilot, says she'll be volunteering again when the program restarts after several successful buddy excursions. MORE: Is marriage outdated in Iceland? "As an airline pilot I do my fair share of traveling, and wherever I go, even if it is only for a few hours, I don't like to do the standard tourist things. "I would rather experience local lifestyle as closely as possible. So, when I heard about the Stopover Buddy program, I did not need to think about it for long! "It has been very gratifying so far. We, in Iceland, are very proud of the beauty of our country, so it has been a nice experience to share a bit of it with our guests." Layover with a Local Icelandair isn't the only airline experimenting with peer-to-peer schemes. Dutch flag-carrier KLM might not have Iceland's volcanoes and majestic national parks to capitalize on, but its main hub at Schiphol international airport is barely half an hour away from the center of the buzzing city of Amsterdam. The airline's Layover with a Local app aims to offer transit visitors the chance to briefly escape the airport to perhaps join a local for a drink at one of the Dutch capital's picturesque cafes. As with Icelandair, transit passengers make up a very significant chunk of KLM's traffic. While Schiphol airport has plenty of amenities, the airline's marketing team was looking for a way to help anyone with a long enough stopover to experience the true Amsterdam. Layover with a Local allows passengers to connect with local Amsterdam residents who've registered with the app and are available when the traveler is in town. MORE: Free ride: Yellow Backie bike lifts offer new way to see Amsterdam Free drinks In order to use the app, travelers enter their name and booking code. KLM then checks if there's enough time for the layover experience. If the answer's yes, and a match for languages and interests can be found, the passenger gets a notification on their phone. Once they land at Schiphol, the app guides them toward the airport's train station -- the train ticket is included for free, as is the first round of drinks. MORE: Around Amsterdam in seven strange museums From there it's just a short hop to Amsterdam's Central Station, where they should encounter "their local," holding up a phone with the traveler's name displayed on it. The free app ensures they make it back in time for their flight by sending an alert. It's still in pilot phase until the end of June, being made available for iTunes download in the U.S., Canada and Italy, but has attracted interest from more than 3,000 people.

The key to blending in is renting a typical Dutch-style cycle, like this black, indestructible machine. Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: Amsterdam by bicycle Clog cycle – The key to definitely not blending in is renting a bicycle shaped like an uncomfortable wooden shoe. Rent this and expect scornful looks from locals and ill-concealed mirth when it accidentally gets steered into a canal. Hide Caption 11 of 11 Peer-to-peer is having a moment With the "collaborative economy" being one of today's hottest concepts, businesses around the world are keen to sprinkle themselves with some of that Airbnb or Uber-style peer-to-peer tech magic. Icelandair and KLM are leading the way in Europe with new experimental travel experiences tied into their offering, but no doubt more and more airlines will be following suit. With stopover sweeteners like this, a mid-flight break no longer has to be spent at the airport. Content by LendingTree Rates now at 3.2% APR (15 Yr Fixed). Do you qualify?

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Vowing to fight for his frozen travel ban all the way to the Supreme Court, President Trump knows Neil Gorsuch may ultimately cast the deciding vote in his favor. Senate Republicans are rushing to confirm the judge by Easter so that he can break several 4-4 ties for conservatives before the end of the term, and this could be the biggest. Gorsuch, who at 49 is the youngest nominee for the high court in a quarter century, would be pivotal in hundreds of cases over the next several decades that impact every single American. But the pending nature of the travel ban, combined with Trump’s continuing attacks on judges, raise the already high stakes of his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which begins Monday. The president and his surrogates promise Gorsuch will be as, or maybe more, conservative than the late Antonin Scalia. On the 10th Circuit in Denver, he has been a staunch critic of the regulatory state but perennially deferential to the commander-in-chief's prerogative on matters related to national security. -- As a high-ranking official in George W. Bush’s Justice Department, Gorsuch was heavily involved in defending many of the president’s most controversial post-9/11 policies. Robert Barnes and Ed O’Keefe report that, by his own account, Gorsuch “helped coordinate litigation efforts involving a number of national security matters,” including opposing the rights of Guantanamo Bay detainees to sue in federal court and working to block the release of photos of prisoners abused by U.S. military personnel in Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison. "He took an active role in developing talking points for the administration on detainees, including whether ‘enhanced interrogation’ works. ‘Yes’ is handwritten next to a typed question: ‘Have the aggressive interrogation techniques employed by the Admin yielded any valuable intelligence?’” The New York Times identifies some other notable emails Gorsuch sent while at DOJ that show how favorably inclined he is to executive power. Many more are classified or still have not been turned over for review. In Dec. 2005, Congress handed Bush a significant defeat by tightening legal restrictions against torture in a law called the Detainee Treatment Act. Soon afterward, Gorsuch emailed to a White House colleague in case he needed “cheering up” about the administration’s setback. “The email from Judge Gorsuch … linked to articles about a less-noticed provision in the act that undercut the rights of Guantánamo Bay detainees by barring courts from hearing their habeas corpus lawsuits,” Charlie Savage wrote. “The administration’s victory is not well known but its significance shouldn’t be understated,” wrote Judge Gorsuch, who had helped coordinate the Justice Department’s work with Congress on the bill. Around that time, Gorsuch visited Guantánamo for a briefing and tour: “Afterward, he wrote a note to the prison operation commander, offering a glowing review.” “He … helped draft … an op-ed published by USA Today, under his supervisor’s byline, defending President Bush’s warrantless surveillance program and his use of a signing statement to claim a right to bypass the Detainee Treatment Act’s provision banning torture.” -- Trump has attacked judges in deeply personal terms. His declaration that Indiana-born Gonzalo Curiel could not fairly adjudicate a fraud lawsuit against Trump University because his parents were born in Mexico is the most notorious example. Paul Ryan called it the textbook definition of racism. Always looking for a scapegoat, the president has pretty explicitly laid the groundwork to blame the courts after the next terrorist attack on the homeland – just as he blamed the generals when a Navy SEAL died on an operation he authorized in Yemen. He tweeted this last month after a federal judge in Washington State issued an injunction:  The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 His supporters listen to him closely and now echo Trump’s messaging. Here’s an example from a conservative site that has 100,000 Twitter followers: All it will take is one Jihadi Nut Job to get into the country courtesy of the Judges blocking Trump’s Travel Ban. #BloodOnTheirHands pic.twitter.com/P5HO818CYe— Red Nation Rising (@RedNationRising) March 15, 2017 A documentary filmmaker, who wrote a book called “Gorilla Mindset,” shared this with his 221,000 followers: The next terrorist attack will be blamed on activist judges, deep state, and the media. Trump will have unprecedented popular support.— Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) March 16, 2017 Has Trump done everything in his power to prevent terrorism? Yes. Who has worked to stop him? Exactly.— Mike Cernovich 🇺🇸 (@Cernovich) March 16, 2017 Lou Dobbs, who has a TV show on Fox Business, framed this week’s rulings as part of a broader conspiracy by the “deep state” in a post to his 1.2 million followers: Judges Part of Deep State War on @POTUS: Block lawful travel ban @CNNPolitics https://t.co/XHuqXPQM1e #MAGA #TrumpTrain #AmericaFirst #Dobbs— Lou Dobbs (@LouDobbs) March 16, 2017 Jay Bybee after delivering a lecture to University of Utah law students in 2015. (Salt Lake Tribune via AP) -- Gorsuch has made clear that he’s uncomfortable with Trump’s personal attacks on judges, including the one in Washington State who blocked the first order. But vastly more meaningful than that is whether he will be independent when legal challenges to his patron’s agenda wind up on the SCOTUS docket. If the first two months are any indication, that will happen a lot, and just because Gorsuch doesn’t like Trump’s methods or rhetoric doesn’t mean that he won’t back him up on the substance every time. Jay Bybee, who signed the so-called “Torture Memos” in 2002 that permitted “enhanced interrogation” techniques on detainees, now sits on the Ninth Circuit. In an opinion this week, he poignantly rebuked Trump: “The personal attacks on the distinguished district judge and our colleagues were out of bounds of civic and persuasive discourse — particularly when they came from the parties. It does no credit to the arguments of the parties to impugn the motives or the competence of the members of this court; ad hominem attacks are not a substitute for effective advocacy. Such personal attacks treat the court as though it were merely a political forum in which bargaining, compromise and even intimidation are acceptable principles. The courts of law must be more than that, or we are not governed by law at all.” But here’s the rub: Bybee wrote that paragraph at the very end of a 29-page dissent that took Trump’s side on all the underlying legal questions. Nothing would stop Gorsuch from doing the same. -- “Trump and his advisers can’t keep quiet — and it’s becoming a real problem,” John Wagner and Matt Zapotosky note. “In rulings halting both the first and second attempts at a ban, judges have cited comments by Trump and his close advisers as evidence of the administration’s intent to target Muslims in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution — even as lawyers for Trump insist that is not the case. … Undermining the administration’s claim of secular intent was Trump’s statement on the Christian Broadcasting Network on Jan. 27 — just before the first ban went into place — that he saw persecuted Christians as a priority in accepting refugees. And when he actually signed the measure, Trump declared: ‘This is the protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. We all know what that means.’ … The next day, a close Trump adviser, Rudolph W. Giuliani, appeared on Fox News and seemed to offer an explanation. ‘I’ll tell you the whole history of it,’ Giuliani said. ‘So when [Trump] first announced it, he said, ‘Muslim ban.’ He called me up. He said, ‘Put a commission together. Show me the right way to do it legally.’’ “In his blistering 43-page opinion issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson in Hawaii referred to those comments as well as a recent Fox News appearance by Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who said the second attempt at a ban would have ‘mostly minor technical differences’ and that Americans would see ‘the same basic policy outcome for the country.’ At Wednesday night’s rally in Nashville, Trump took aim at Watson and suggested there was little difference between the intent of his first executive order and his second. ‘The order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with,’ Trump said.” That too can and will be used against him in court. -- Perhaps someone should have Mirandized the president? Trump’s words are being used against him not just in courts of law, but they are also complicating what might have been a slam dunk confirmation process for Gorsuch. The more the president attacks judges and makes unsubstantiated claims on Twitter about things like wiretapping, the harder it is for moderate Senate Democrats to justify defecting to their base. That, in turn, makes it harder for Mitch McConnell to get the 60 votes he needs to avoid a confrontation over the nuclear option. -- A disquieting trend: Some allies and strong supporters of the president are pleading with him to begin disregarding federal court orders. These populists are doing their best to encourage Trump’s “I-alone-can-fix-it” strongman impulses. Mike Huckabee, a two-term governor of Arkansas and the father of a high-ranking White House official, posted this after the administration's most recent legal setback:  Hoping @POTUS tells Hawaii judge what Andrew Jackson told overreaching court-"I'll ignore it and let the court enforce their order."— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) March 15, 2017 Jackson almost certainly never actually said that quote, though it is often attributed to him, but he did indeed  refuse to enforce an 1832 Supreme Court decision that affirmed the sovereignty of the Cherokee Nation. His rejection of this ruling, praised by Huckabee, led directly to the Trail of Tears, in which at least four thousand Native Americans died. Breitbart News, separately, gave big play yesterday to a Q&A with an attorney named Robert Barnes, who said the president could “go full Andrew Jackson." “America’s courts only have power as long as people respect and believe and have confidence in the independence and integrity of those courts,” Barnes said. “As that gets sacrificed, courts lose power, and we may return back to a time and place where someone like President Trump needs to go back to Andrew Jackson and invoke his tradition and legacy in order to challenge judicial usurpation of the safety and security of the country. At the current time, there’s not a lot we can do without being willing to go full Andrew Jackson against the court system.” (This Barnes has no relation to the WaPo Supreme Court correspondent by the same name.) That Breitbart interview got tons of pick-up on social media. For example, this is a Trump supporter who has 300,000 Twitter followers: DO IT! Pres Trump Could ‘Go Full Andrew Jackson’ and Ignore Interference from Activist Judges#MakeAmericaSafeAgainhttps://t.co/SE2UdmBrxZ pic.twitter.com/fyM4CMxkC6— Linda Suhler, Ph.D. (@LindaSuhler) March 16, 2017 -- All this sudden talk about Jackson – specifically an episode that happened two centuries ago – is no coincidence. Trump calls himself “a big fan” of Jackson, hung a portrait of him in the Oval Office and on Wednesday visited the late president’s estate on what would have been his 250th birthday. Trump stood at the grave and raised his hand to salute Jackson as taps was played. He said it was “inspirational” and noted that he too was elected by opposing the “arrogant elites.” “They say my election was most similar to his,” Trump said. Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, said the president’s dark inaugural address about “American carnage” was inspired by Jackson. “I don’t think we’ve had a speech like that since Andrew Jackson came to the White House,” Bannon said. Trump pauses to look at a portrait of Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage, Jackson's home, in Nashville. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) “By accident or by design, Trump’s visit to the Hermitage delighted white nationalists,” Dana Milbank reports. “The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, applauded as ‘fitting’ Trump’s honoring of this ‘white supremacist extremist,’ as it calls Jackson. The group created a poster for supporters to display featuring a portrait of Jackson underneath a reference to a quote from Bannon: ‘Like Andrew Jackson’s populism, we’re going to build an entirely new political movement.’ Beneath the Jackson portrait the poster says, with adorning swastikas, ‘The new face of the Republican Party: DailyStormer.com.’ … White nationalists are attempting to appropriate Jackson the way the tea party commandeered the ‘Don’t Tread on Me’ flag, and they see Trump encouraging them. ‘The fact that he put up a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office should’ve sent a huge signal,’ white nationalist James Edwards said on his radio show, ‘Political Cesspool.’ … ‘We are in serious need of some more trails of tears just about now,’ Andrew Anglin wrote on the Daily Stormer. ‘And it’s look[ing] like Trump may well deliver in spades.’” Michael Gerson, a top speechwriter for George W. Bush, writes in his column today that Trump picked “a deeply disturbing hero” in Jackson: “He was the original, and prototypical, testostero-president. … He consistently pressed the boundaries of executive authority. Many of the Founders had been internally conflicted slaveholders. Jackson was not one for psychic struggle. … And much of Jackson’s reputation depended on being a frontier Indian fighter. This was a president who once earned the Indian nickname ‘Sharp Knife.’ In a battle against the Red Stick Creeks, Jackson set about to ‘exterminate them’ (his words). Hundreds of fighters and civilians were killed trying to flee across the Tallapoosa River. By one account, ‘the river ran red with blood.’ … Jackson was also one of the nation’s leading advocates of ‘Indian removal,’ which amounted to the ethnic cleansing of Creeks and Cherokee across the lower South… “Why discuss this ancient history (which is not really so ancient to the Cherokee)? Because Trump, in visiting Jackson’s Hermitage, has invited us,” Gerson concludes. “Jackson was wrong — badly, culpably wrong — on the largest issue of his time: the dignity and value of people of color. There is no refuge in the argument that Jackson merely reflected the values of his time. Jackson’s opponent in two elections, John Quincy Adams, viewed slavery as ‘the great and foul stain upon the North American Union.’ Henry Clay called Indian expulsion ‘a foul and lasting stain upon the good faith, humanity and character of the nation.’ And Jackson’s reputation will always bear those indelible marks.” Welcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning newsletter.

Leem Ho-young as two North Korean soldiers look on in the border village of Panmunjom, which has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War. (Lee Jin-man/Pool/Reuters) -- The Trump administration gave its strongest signal yet that it would consider taking military action against North Korea, with Rex Tillerson saying a few hours ago that “all options are on the table.” “Certainly we do not want for things to get to a military conflict, we’re quite clear on that in our communications, but obviously if North Korea takes actions that threaten the South Korean forces or our own forces, then that would be met with an appropriate response,” the secretary of state said at a press conference in Seoul. “If they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action, that option is on the table." He added that he hopes Pyongyang will respond to other pressures such as sanctions before military action becomes necessary. “Tillerson made the remarks after visiting the Demilitarized Zone that divides the two Koreas,” Anna Fifield reports. “There, he came almost face to face with North Korean soldiers standing on the other side of the yellow line that marks the border. North Korea has said that it is working on an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the United States’ mainland, and has shown clear progress in its missile program in tests over the last year. Sanctions and diplomatic engagement have failed to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. But American administrations have long considered military action unfeasible because North Korea has artillery lined up on Seoul, a city of more than 20 million people that lies just 30 miles south of the DMZ.” Syrian civil defense volunteers, known as the White Helmets, dig through the rubble of a mosque following an alleged U.S. airstrike on a mosque in the village of Al-Jineh in Aleppo yesterday. The U.S. says it carried out an air strike in northern Syria against an Al-Qaeda target but denies deliberately targeting a mosque. (Omar haj kadour/AFP/Getty Images) -- The Pentagon confirmed that U.S. forces carried out an airstrike inside Syria that killed several al-Qaeda militants, amid emerging reports that dozens of civilians were also possibly killed in the same attack. Louisa Loveluck reports: “A statement Thursday from the U.S. Army’s Central Command said it had struck a ‘meeting location’ in the northeastern province of Idlib. But local activists and a monitoring group claimed the airstrike had hit a mosque in the west Aleppo countryside next to Idlib province, killing at least 46 people and leaving dozens more under the rubble. Reasons for the discrepancy in location were not immediately clear. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring network, described the attack as a ‘massacre’ and said the dead were mostly civilians. … Separately Friday, Syria and Israel traded competing claims over an apparent Israeli attack near the western city of Palmyra in the early hours of the morning. While the Syrian military said its air [defenses] had shot down Israeli jets over what it called ‘occupied ground,’ an Israeli military spokesman said the pilots’ safety had ‘at no point’ been compromised.” John Boehner swears in Steve Stockman in 2013. (Evan Vucci/AP) -- Ex-Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) was charged with conspiring to violate federal election laws during his time in office. KPRC, the NBC affiliate in Houston, reports: “Stockman, a Tea Party favorite, .... was brought into court Thursday shackled and handcuffed. … It's a felony that could send him to federal prison if he's convicted. As Stockman stood before the judge, prosecutors alleged that the former Congressman had conspired with two former employees to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars to his personal use. ... According to the complaint, in 2011 Stockman set up a non-profit called Life Without Limits in Las Vegas. A single contributor donated $350,000 to the charity, which Stockman then allegedly funneled back to himself through donations made by his employees.” He gave up his seat to challenge Sen.

The changes would shift the burden of proof to prosecutors, forcing them to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” -- the highest legal standard – that the use of force was unjustified. The law would apply not only to shootings, but also misdemeanors, domestic violence and assault cases not involving guns. (Katie Zezima) Hours after a Florida prosecutor announced she would not seek the death penalty in any cases, Gov. Rick Scott (R) said that he will remove her from the high-profile prosecution of a man charged with killing an Orlando police officer. (Mark Berman) Oklahoma state Sen. Ralph Shortey (R) is now facing prostitution charges after he was caught in a motel room with a 17-year-old boy. Police obtained his text messages, in which he allegedly offered money for “sexual” stuff. Charges filed against the senator include soliciting the prostitution of a minor; transportation for the purpose of prostitution; and prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church. A witness, potentially the boy’s father, saw the lawmaker pick him up and called police.

(Pierre Verdy/AFP/Getty Images) PERSONNEL IS POLICY: -- The president picked a Boeing executive to serve as Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ second-in-command. Although Patrick Shanahan's recent job for the aircraft company was on the commercial side, he has also served as vice president and general manger of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and their military rotorcraft division. (Thomas Gibbons-Neff) -- Trump is expected to tap a coal lobbyist to be the #2 at the EPA. Politico reports that the appointment of Andrew Wheeler, a former aide to Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), has not been finalized but it is expected to be in the coming weeks. -- In a note to shareholders, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein noted that several alumni of the investment bank are now in top policymaking positions at the White House and Treasury Department. “We have been criticized for the fact that some of our colleagues, after long careers at the firm, have moved to work in the public sector. The charge is that Goldman Sachs is able to extract certain advantages that others cannot. In fact, the opposite is true. Those in government bend over backward to avoid any perception of favoritism,” Blankfein said in the letter. “We are proud of our tradition of leadership and public service and believe it is a core part of our culture. That is why we will continue to encourage our people to contribute to government service if they are fortunate enough to be asked.” (Renae Merle) -- One of Trump's top national security aides, Sebastian Gorka, denies reports that he is a member of – and took an oath of loyalty to – a Nazi-allied group. Buzzfeed News’ Talal Ansari and Lissandra Villa report: The Forward alleged that he is a member of Historical Vitézi Rend, a far-right Hungarian group that had ties to the Nazi party from the World War II era. "When BuzzFeed News reached Gorka by phone on Thursday, he stonewalled when asked about the report. ‘Send a request to White House press,’ Gorka [said] … Captain Gyula Soltész, a current leader in the (group), later told BuzzFeed News that Gorka is a current member. Later Thursday, in an interview with Tablet magazine, Gorka was quoted saying, ‘I have never been a member of the Vitez Rend. I have never taken an oath of loyalty to the Vitez Rend.’” -- Another senior national security official brought on by Trump said just last year that he believes Muslims are “dedicated to establishing Sharia law in Western countries” and that they want to “subjugate and humiliate” non-Muslims. The Huffington Post’s Christopher Mathias reports: “Frank Wuco ― a former radio host and veteran Naval Intelligence officer ― was hired on Jan. 20 as [Trump’s] senior White House adviser for the Department of Homeland Security … In June 2016, Wuco was asked by Breitbart News about [Pulse nightclub shooter] Omar Mateen. ‘There’s nothing radical about him at all,’ Wuco said. ‘He is a Muslim who is following the strictures of Islam and its guidance and prescriptions for violence and warfare against unbelievers.’ … Wuco has also taken a conspiratorial view of Muslims in Europe and North America, portraying them as ‘hellbent’ on taking over Western countries: ‘The assertiveness of Muslim communities in Western nations is becoming so pronounced. … you don’t even need ISIS in Sweden,’ he said in another 2016 radio interview.” Michael Flynn sits in the East Room. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) THERE IS A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Former national security adviser Michael Flynn, now a registered foreign agent for Turkey, was paid nearly $68,000 by multiple Russia-related entities in 2015, a higher amount that was previously known. Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger report: “The records show that the bulk of the money, more than $45,000, came from the Russian government-backed television network RT, in connection to a December 2015 trip Flynn took to Moscow. Flynn has acknowledged that RT sponsored his trip. The [documents] show that Flynn was also paid $11,250 that year by the U.S. subsidiary of a Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, and another $11,250 by a U.S. air cargo company affiliated with the Volga-Dnepr Group, which is owned by a Russian businessman. The cyberfirm and the airline said the payments were made for speeches Flynn delivered in Washington.” The documents were released by ranking House Oversight Committee Democrat Elijah Cummings, who sent FBI director James Comey a letter asking whether the fees violated prohibitions on retired military officers accepting payments or gifts from foreign governments. Cummings also asked for the release of documents Flynn filed to get a security clearance for his White House job, to examine whether Flynn was candid in response to detailed questions about his contacts with foreign governments. “I cannot recall any time in our nation’s history when the President selected as his National Security Advisor someone who violated the Constitution by accepting tens of thousands of dollars from an agent of a global adversary that attacked our democracy,” Cummings wrote. Sean Spicer briefs the press. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) AN ALTERNATIVE REALITY: -- Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr released a joint statement with ranking Democrat Mark Warner stating that they have not seen any evidence supporting Trump’s wiretapping claims. “Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,” they said categorically. Paul Ryan also said that he has “not seen any evidence that this has occurred.” (Karoun Demirjian) -- But then Sean Spicer said during his press briefing that Trump stands by his unsubstantiated allegations against Obama. “He stands by it,” Spicer said, adding that he believes the president will ultimately be “vindicated.” "Spicer refused to say whether Trump was relying on classified information to base his claims, and pointed repeatedly to news articles and ‘widespread, open source material,'" Philip Rucker and Abby Phillip report. "Spicer spent nearly 10 minutes reading a litany of news stories, including from conservative reporters and the New York Times, that discuss reports of inquiries into the president's campaign aides and Russian officials. (None) of the reports confirm that Trump Tower was wiretapped.” -- Spicer also repeated a claim, swirling around in the fever swamps of the far right, that Obama used the British spy agency GCHQ – the NSA's counterpart -- to surveil Trump. This prompted a very rare statement from the agency last night: “Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct 'wire tapping' against the then President Elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored." Let that sink in: A top official of the United States government, on camera and from behind a podium at the White House, accused our closest ally of spying on the president at the request of his predecessor. He did this with no evidence. -- The Telegraph reports that the U.S. has formally apologized to Britain over Spcier's comment. The London paper says both Spicer and national security adviser H.R. McMaster have personally apologized. "The apology came direct from them," a source told the paper. -- A Fox News poll finds that 66 percent of Americans think Congress should investigate Russian interference in the presidential election. About the same number also want lawmakers to probe possible connections between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Voter are split, 46-49, over whether Congress should further investigate Trump’s wiretapping claims. -- “Tonight, we know the president of the United States has no facts,” Anderson Cooper said on his show last night. “No facts to back up his startling allegation that the former president of the United States, President Obama, wiretapped him in Trump Tower during the campaign." Copies of Trump's budget blueprint priorities for Fiscal Year 2018. (Reuters/Joshua Roberts) TRUMP'S BUDGET LANDS WITH A THUD IN THE CAPITOL: -- "Some of Trump’s top Congressional allies sharply criticized his first budget, pushing back on the proposed Pentagon funding hike as 'insufficient,' and slamming other proposed cuts to federal agencies and programs," Kelsey Snell and Karoun Demirjian report: “Capitol Hill Republicans, however, did not seem terribly worried about the prospect of such a budget being enacted, stating matter-of-factly that it is Congress, after all, that controls the purse strings. ‘Presidents propose, Congress disposes,’ said Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) the former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ‘We’ve not had our chance yet.’ Rogers was one of several GOP lawmakers to dismiss Trump’s budget as a pie-in-the sky wishlist with little hope of surviving negotiations in Congress. Most Republicans gave passing support to Trump’s general goal of increasing defense spending while reducing costs elsewhere in the budget. But none would embrace the specific White House blueprint.” -- “If you’re a poor person in America, President Trump’s budget proposal is not for you,” Steven Mufson and Tracy Jan write. “Trump has unveiled a budget that would slash or abolish programs that have provided low-income Americans with help on virtually all fronts, including affordable housing, banking, weatherizing homes, job training, paying home heating oil bills, and obtaining legal counsel in civil matters. During the presidential campaign ….Trump vowed that the solution to poverty was giving poor people incentives to work. But most of the proposed cuts in his budget target programs designed to help the working poor, as well as those who are jobless, cope. And many of them carry out their missions by disbursing money to the states, which establish their own criteria. The White House budget cuts will fall hardest on the rural and small town communities that Trump won, where 1 in 3 people are living paycheck to paycheck — a rate that is 24 percent higher than in urban counties, according to a new analysis." -- OMB Director Mick Mulvaney strongly defended Trump’s budget – and the long list of controversial cuts it contains – in a White House news conference, saying every program on the cutting board is either “wasteful” or “ineffective.” Abby Phillips reports: “He stated broadly that the budget was intended to defund areas of the government that had been deemed wasteful or ineffective in the interest of being better stewards of taxpayer dollars. ‘We can’t spend money on programs just because they sound good,’ Mulvaney said. ‘That is about as compassionate as you can get.’ Faced with repeated questions about line items in the federal budget that help fund programs like … after-school educational programs for poor, rural communities; and public broadcasting; Mulvaney insisted that the cuts were targeted at programs that didn't have a track record of success. ‘The message the president sent right now is that we want to defund those,’ Mulvaney said. ‘And there are completely defensible reasons for doing that.’ Trump's budget also makes significant cuts to scientific research, especially climate change, which is the target of some of the deep cuts within the State Department. ‘We’re not spending money on that anymore,’ Mulvaney said of climate change research. ‘We consider that to be a waste of your money.’” MORE BUDGET FALLOUT: -- Trump’s proposal includes a plan to remove 30,000 FAA workers from the federal payroll. That group comprises 14,000 air traffic controllers and about 16,000 other FAA employees, many of whom work on a project called NextGen, Michael Laris reports. The program is a combination of several projects aimed at increasing the speed of air travel, saving airline fuel and accommodating a 20 percent increase in passengers in the next 20 years. The plan would also shutter federal support for Amtrak’s long-distance train service. -- The plan also proposes eliminating three airport security programs developed after 9/11, diverting the money to help fund Trump’s U.S.-Mexico border wall. (Ashley Halsey III) -- The New York Police Department said Trump’s spending plan would gut critical counter-terrorism efforts that would make the nation’s largest city less safe. From Mark Berman: “Police say the funding cuts would hit everything from intelligence analysis to active-shooter training. The blunt assessment was delivered by the top law enforcement officer in Trump’s hometown, who leads an agency tasked with defending the city against terrorism … ‘Under the president’s proposal, nearly all federal funding to the NYPD would be eradicated,’ [NYC police commissioner James P. O’Neill said]. ‘This funding is absolutely critical. It is the backbone of our entire counter-terrorism apparatus.’ O’Neill described the federal funding that would be lost as ‘essential’ to numerous aspects of the NYPD’s counter-terrorism activities, including the city’s intelligence analyst program, active-shooter training provided to tens of thousands of officers and the department’s bomb squad.” -- The U.S. Institute of Peace – which was created to help manage conflict resolution around the world, and whose staffers have been dispatched to some of the most dangerous places around the globe -- is slated for elimination. Carol Morello reports: “[The] deep spending cuts proposed for foreign aid prompted an immediate backlash across the spectrum in Congress and among humanitarian organizations and religious groups. Rep. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the cuts a ‘catastrophic mistake,’ while Rep. Edward R. Royce (R-Calif.), the committee chairman, expressed concern that cuts in diplomacy will hurt efforts to combat terrorism. Mercy Corps called the foreign aid cuts ‘reckless, dangerous and irresponsible.’” -- After school programs for 16 million kids could lose funding. (Emma Brown) -- The Meals for Wheels program would get slashed. Mulvaney said it is “just not showing any results,” drawing howls of protest from advocates. The program provides food aid to needy senior citizens who, because of physical limitations or financial reasons, have difficulty shopping for or preparing meals for themselves. (Christopher Ingraham) -- The budget disappointed leaders of historically black colleges and universities, who met with Trump last month in the hopes of securing additional funding for scholarships, technology and campus infrastructure. Rather than expanding Pell grants for low-income students, the proposal raids $4 billion from the program’s reserves. (Danielle Douglas-Gabriel) -- One potential problem ahead: firing federal workers is not nearly as easy as Trump’s proposal makes it seem. Eric Yoder and Lisa Rein report: “Laying off federal workers requires going through a formal process that can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to the workplace … Under [Trump’s] budget proposal, federal employees at many agencies may need to acquaint themselves with a lately dormant but still much-feared term: Reduction in Force. RIFs have not been used widely for decades. It is a complex process that catalogues and ranks employees based on the work they do and where, their employment status, veteran status, length of service and performance ratings. Employees in eliminated jobs in some cases may be able to displace lower-ranked employees while keeping their higher pay rates temporarily — meaning the projected savings don’t always materialize. And there are job placement rights, appeal rights and severance pay entitlements for those ultimately let go. In some cases, unions are able to bargain on behalf of their members.” -- “What a Presidential budget really represents is a wish list and a numerical expression of the President’s political philosophy,” the New Yorker’s John Cassidy explains: “’Philosophy’ isn’t a word often associated with [Trump], but this partial budget outline—the White House is promising to release a fuller version later—accurately reflects the impulses, prejudices, and slogans that animated Trump’s campaign. Indeed, his budget director has said that he saw his job as taking what Trump said on the stump and translating it into figures. In carrying out this task, Mulvaney performed a public service of sorts. Thanks to his translation, the entire world can see what America would look like if Trumpism were fully converted into practice. The country would be an uglier, less equal, less prosperous, more paranoid, more myopic, and more mean-spirited place. Its claims that it’s a role model for other countries would be besmirched, perhaps beyond redemption. And far from being rendered great again, it would be a weaker world power. In the long term, the prosperity of the country as a whole depends on it having a skilled labor force; world-beating science, technology, and arts; first-rate public infrastructure; and a clean and healthy environment. This budget, if it ever went into effect, would undercut all of these things.” House Budget Committee Chair Diane Black (R-Tenn.), joined by Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.), presides over a hearing to advance the health care bill. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) HEALTH CARE LATEST: -- The GOP proposal cleared a key hurdle, as the House Budget Committee narrowly voted to move it to the House floor and recommended a series of changes to the plan reflecting concerns from conservatives and centrists. Mike DeBonis and Sean Sullivan report: “All of the panel’s Republicans and five Democrats supported a motion to change the system of tax credits created under the plan to ensure they are ‘afforded to the population that they are intended to serve,’ an idea embraced across the ideological spectrum, including among centrists whose votes could be key. The committee voted along party lines for a pair of motions supporting additional cuts to Medicaid beyond what’s in the bill — and for a third motion endorsing a requirement that ‘able-bodied’ participants in the program work in exchange for their benefits. It remains unclear whether the Budget Committee’s nonbinding recommendations will make it into the final bill.” The panel voted 19 to 17 overall in favor of the bill, with three Republicans – Reps. Dave Brat, Gary Palmer, and Mark Sanford – voting against it. All three are members of the House Freedom Caucus. -- Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said his group is now drafting changes to the bill that they believe could garner “widespread support,” which he said could be released as soon as today. He declined to release additional details but said he was in talks with “multiple senators” about it. “We’re working very diligently to try to make sure that any amendment that we put forth has a real chance of success,” he said. -- But even as the bill made incremental progress, its overall fate remains very much in doubt. In an interview with the Portland Press-Herald, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she would not vote for the bill without significant changes: “This is not a bill I could support in its current form,” the moderate Republican said. -- “The sleeping giants of the Obamacare debate remain Republican moderates in the House,” says Paul Kane. “Arch conservatives have come to define the House Republican brand this decade, pushing the Treasury to the edge of default in 2011 [and] shutting down the government in 2013 … Now, however, [Ryan] is dealing with a different rebellious flank within the House Republican Conference ... Larger in number but softer in tone than their conservative counterparts, moderate Republicans are shaping up to be at least as big a hurdle to achieving the long-held goal of repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a more market-oriented series of policies. These Republicans are getting their share of meetings with Ryan and his leadership team, voicing their concerns about the impact specific pieces of the bill would have in their districts. They are making clear that any negative fallout from these policy moves would place their seats in jeopardy in next year’s midterm elections, a fate that Ryan understands would open the door to losing the House majority. And, of course, these moderates are making their case in a much quieter fashion than members of the House Freedom Caucus.” -- “Whom to trust when it comes to health-care reform? Trump supporters put their faith in him,” from Jenna Johnson in Nashville: “Soon after Charla McComic’s son lost his job, his health-insurance premium dropped from $567 per month to just $88, a ‘blessing from God’ that she believes was made possible by [Trump]. ‘I think it was just because of the tax credit,’ said McComic … The price change was actually thanks to a subsidy made possible by former president [Obama’s] Affordable Care Act, which is still in place, not by the tax credits proposed by Republicans as part of the health-care bill still being considered by Congress. It has been difficult for many Americans to keep up with the changes brought by Obamacare and exactly how the Republican proposal, if enacted, would affect their lives. But for Trump’s most dedicated supporters, it’s simply easier to trust the president is making things better and will follow through on his promise to provide ‘insurance for everybody’ and ‘great health care for a fraction of the price.’ McComic said she’s not worried about her disability benefits changing or her 3-year-old granddaughter getting kicked off Medicaid or her 33-year-old son’s premiums going up. ‘So far, everything’s been positive, from what I can tell,’ she said." Quote du jour: McComic says she has never trusted a president the way she trusts Trump. Referencing the work she did on his behalf in the months leading up to the election, she said her and her relatives asked themselves, "Who else would we do this for, besides Trump?" "We agreed on the Lord," she said. "We would stand here for the Lord, but that’s about it.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel talks to students yesterday in Berlin. (Michael Kappeler/pool photo via AP) THE WORLD RECALIBRATES: -- Angela Merkel will meet with Trump at the White House today after postponing her visit because of the snowstorm earlier in the week. “It's a visit that seems a clash of geopolitical poles and personalities — Trump, the maverick, shoot-from-the-hip outsider and Merkel, the bookish, calm and experienced policy wonk,” Ishaan Tharoor reports in his newsletter. “Trump stands at the forefront of a new trend in mainstream Western politics, a populist challenge to the status quo anchored in ethnic nationalism. Merkel, on the other hand, is arguably the de facto guardian of the liberal order once authored by the United States. Although a center-right politician herself, she has set about defending international institutions as well as the broader politics of integration and tolerance now seemingly under assault from Trump and his far-right European counterparts. But Merkel arrives at the White House with a message of unity and collaboration. She will bring a number of CEOs of leading German companies in tow — a pro-trade agenda Trump certainly understands — and will stress the significance of the overall German-U.S. partnership." -- “Wilders vows to be a player in forming of Dutch government despite 2nd-place finish,” by Michael Birnbaum: “The Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders acknowledged Thursday that voters denied him a chance to rule his nation. But to many Dutch Muslims, his victory was secured long before his nation’s nail-biter election. The reelected Dutch prime minister told immigrants to fit in or get out. A likely coalition partner wants to impose restrictions on refugees. A nation once known for its laid-back tolerance is now focused on its divisions. And while European leaders breathed a sigh of relief that a raucous populist had been beaten back ahead of elections this year in France and Germany, many Muslims say that Wilders’s raw racism is still ascendant. Europe has a new face, they say — and it’s that of the blond-haired bomb thrower from the Netherlands.” Sean Hannity tapes a segment for his show with Sean Spicer. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) STUFF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN OUR NEWSROOM: -- Sean Hannity pulled a gun on Juan Williams in his studio. CNN Money’s Dylan Byers reports: “Last year, after ending one of his many spirited on-air arguments with liberal contributor Juan Williams, Hannity pulled out a gun and pointed it directly at Williams … He even turned on the laser sight, causing a red dot to bob around on Williams' body. (Hannity was just showing off, the sources said, but the unforeseen off-camera antic clearly disturbed Williams and others on set.)  A Fox News spokesperson said the incident was referred to the legal and human resources departments.” "Sean Hannity has been trained in firearm safety since he was 11 years old and has a license to carry a gun in five states," the network said. "The situation was thoroughly investigated and it was found that no one was put in any danger." (Literally the first thing they teach you in gun safety classes is to never point a gun at another person!) -- IJR reporter Joe Perticone resigned in protest over disagreements “with the website’s direction,” Politico’s Hadas Gold reports. "Perticone felt as though his credibility as a congressional reporter was damaged by the actions of other writers on the millennial-focused viral news site. The last straw, sources said, was a post published earlier in the day that connected Obama’s visit to Hawaii with a Hawaiian federal judge’s ruling against Trump’s travel ban. It was retracted on Thursday afternoon. "The tension seems to lie between creating content that goes viral and becoming respected as a news outlet,” Gold writes. Meanwhile, IJR correspondent Erin McPike – the sole reporter allowed on Tillerson’s plane during his trip to Asia – has yet to file a story. An IJR spokesman said she's not filing spot stories because "she's writing a profile piece on Secretary Tillerson." As CNN’s Brian Stelter notes, that seems to be passing up a powerful opportunity. Mark Begich speaks at the Capitol in 2012. He lost reelection in 2014. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP) THE PATH BACK FOR DEMOCRATS: -- Former Alaska Sen. Mark Begich organized a three-day strategy session with 30 moderates in Denver to chart a path forward for that wing of the Democratic Party, which feels increasingly left behind by the Elizabeth Warren wing. Among the attendees: North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Georgia Assembly minority leader Stacey Abrams and Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. “Begich would not name all the participants, saying some of them preferred to keep their involvement private,” McClatchy’s Alex Roarty reports. “But Conner Eldridge, a former U.S. attorney who ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in Arkansas, said in an interview that he’d brought six former U.S. attorneys. (He declined to name them.) Ken Salazar, who served as Obama’s secretary of the interior, was also there. Salazar is considering a run for governor of Colorado next year. … Presentations included a discussion about faith, and what millennials and Generation Z – America’s youngest generation – are experiencing in the economy and politically. Joel Heitkamp, the senator’s brother and a talk radio host in North Dakota, addressed the group to discuss how the participants could engage with radio, usually the sole province of conservatives.” -- The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is paying for three focus groups in Tom Price’s old House district this week to figure out how they can best target Millennials, African Americans and swing voters in the upcoming special election. Anzalone Liszt Grove Research organized a session on Tuesday night of people between the ages of 55 and 74 who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Then Wednesday night they did a session with voters between 18 to 45 about what might prompt them to vote in an off-year election. The final group, targeting black voters, will be conducted next week by Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster who worked on both of Barack Obama's campaigns. “The 6th District is about 12 percent African American, but that number has nearly doubled in the past decade as the Atlanta suburbs have grown and diversified,” NPR’s Jessica Taylor reports. “Democrats will need those reliably Democratic voters to turn out not just for Jon Ossoff, but in November 2018, too.” SOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ: The cable news presidency continues: Trump called @TomiLahren & spoke to her for “solid 10 to 15 minutes” after watching her defend him on “Hannity” https://t.co/JB2AoweBl1 pic.twitter.com/kpJGXSvXyX— Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) March 16, 2017 Rep.

Andania, plain and sturdy, pulled into New York Harbor on April 11, 1923, after a slow journey from Liverpool, England. In a third-class cabin was a gray-eyed Irishman named Richard Michael Cawley, fleeing poverty and war. The son of a tailor from a rural village, Mr. Cawley, then 20, had come of age during a guerrilla conflict. Now, with Irish fighting Irish, he had made his way to America … He had the equivalent of $23. And though records show he did not become a citizen until 1941, a decade after he married, historians say that was typical; many Irish came to America not quite sure they would stay. He would settle in Chicago … marry a teacher; find work as a streetcar driver; and sing ballads by the piano on Saturday nights. It is a familiar American tale, except for this: Mr. Cawley’s grandson and namesake, Michael Richard Pence, is the vice president of the United States, which is in the thick of a roiling immigration debate.” HOT ON THE LEFT: “ICE Agents Now Going To Courthouses To Arrest Undocumented Immigrants,” from CBS Los Angeles: “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been going to courthouses and arresting people in America illegally, sparking outrage from prosecutors and attorneys. They worry such tactic will discourage undocumented immigrants from appearing in court to testify as witnesses for prosecutors. Criminal defense lawyer Octavio Chaidez said his client is among those taken into custody by ICE agents, who arrested him at the Los Angeles Superior Court in Pasadena. He said he had just finished a criminal court appearance with his client when four agents swooped in, confirmed his name and took his client away. ‘It was very shocking because it occurred inside of a courthouse, and the reason for the detention had nothing to do with that proceeding,’ recalled Chaidez, who would not say if his client has a criminal history.”   HOT ON THE RIGHT: “NDP Candidate Removes Post with Beyoncé Lyrics after Cultural Appropriation Accusations,” from National Review: “New Democratic party candidate Niki Ashton has deleted her social-media posts containing Beyoncé lyrics because a Twitter account attributed to Vancouver’s Black Lives Matter said that using those lyrics was ‘appropriating black culture.’ Ashton had posted ‘Like Beyoncé says, to the left. Time for an unapologetic turn to the left for the #NDP, for social, racial, enviro, and economic justice. #ndpldr’ above a meme that read ‘To the Left, to the Left …’ Now, this may seem like a harmless post. It may seem like just another politician shamelessly trying to connect with voters by demonstrating that she, like, knows things about pop culture.  But apparently not, because in response, a Twitter account attributed to Vancouver’s chapter of Black Lives Matter tweeted”: “… Appropriating Black culture is not intersectional feminism. Please delete your ‘to the left’ FB post & address the issue.”   DAYBOOK: At the White House: Trump will meet with the Republican Study Committee before holding a listening session on veterans’ affairs. Later, Trump will welcome Angela Merkel to the White House for a bilateral meeting, roundtable discussion with business leaders, joint press conference, and working luncheon. Meanwhile, Pence will join Trump at his veterans’ affairs listening session before participating in the bilateral meeting, roundtable discussion, joint press conference, and working luncheon with Merkel. Later, he’ll participate in bilateral meetings with Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solís. -- In the evening, Trump will depart the White House for Joint Base Andrews en route to West Palm Beach, Florida. He'll spend the weekend at Mar-a-Lago. In related news, the helicopter landing pad has finally been completed at Mar-a-Lago. The Sun-Sentinel’s Skyler Swisher reports: “The landing pad has passed inspection, and the building permit was closed on Monday, said Karl Swierzko, acting building official for the town of Palm Beach. The landing pad is on the western lawn of the 20-acre estate and is big enough to accommodate Marine One, the signature green chopper used by presidents, according to plans submitted to the town. A spokeswoman for Marine One would not say Thursday whether Trump will use the landing pad this weekend when he visits Mar-a-Lago. Air Force One is expected to arrive at Palm Beach International Airport about 6:30 p.m. Friday.” City Council officials restricted use of the landing pad to “business related to the presidency,” and stipulated that it can only be used during Trump’s time in office.   QUOTE OF THE DAY:  After John McCain said “the senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin” by blocking a treaty that would let Montenegro join NATO, Rand Paul fired back at his Arizona colleague on MSNBC: “I think he makes a really, really strong case for term limits. I think maybe he’s past his prime; I think maybe he’s gotten a little bit unhinged.”   NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.: -- “While we wait for the ground to melt and wear its St. Patrick’s Day green, we humans can enjoy a steady rise in temperatures despite increasing cloud cover.” The Capital Weather Gang forecasts:   “Afternoon temperatures should max out in the mid-40s to around 50. Winds thankfully are calmer than recent days, blowing around 5 mph out of the west (southwest direction, later). A quick shower is possible as we head toward sunset, with odds increasing as it turns dark.” -- Denver Riggleman, the populist candidate running as a Republican in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, announced Thursday that he is suspending his bid. “Based on business considerations, resource shortages, and family health issues, I have no other choice but to suspend my campaign for Governor effective today,” he said in a written statement. “I want to thank everyone who has supported me, and particularly those that were willing to donate to our cause.” (Laura Vozzella) -- The Whole Foods store in Glover Park voluntarily closed this week for renovation after health inspectors identified a problem with rodents – the store’s second citation for pest problems in as many months. “We will be remodeling the Georgetown store to offer our customers a fresh, new shopping experience,” a spokeswoman for the company said. Shoppers described the move as “abrupt.” (Justin Wm.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Budget plan falls short of defense hawks hopes By Gregory Hellman 03/17/17 08:30 AM EDT With Zach Montellaro and Connor O’Brien BUDGET BLUES — TRUMP PLAN FALLS SHORT OF HOPES, via Connor O’Brien and your Morning D correspondent: “President Donald Trump’s new budget proposal promises to lay the groundwork for his much-anticipated military buildup. But it is already being criticized as over-hyped. Story Continued Below “Without more money and greater detail about how it will be spent, the plan falls far short of paying for what Trump promised during the campaign, according to lawmakers and military budget experts. “The blueprint proposes $639 billion in defense spending for fiscal 2018 — or $52 billion more than the current year, a 10 percent increase. But while it boasts that it “fully repeals" spending limits imposed in 2011, the plan includes only a one-year increase — and one that is only a tad larger than what the Obama administration had laid out in its long-term spending plan. “Nor does it detail how it would allow the administration to reach its lofty goals of a larger Navy and Army, close the gap on military readiness and reduce costs.” — HAWKS STILL AREN'T FANS: Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), who chair the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, doubled down on their critique that Trump's defense topline isn't enough to pursue a major military expansion. The pair have instead advocated a $640 billion topline for national defense programs, well above the Trump’s $603 billion, which covers the Pentagon’s base budget and nuclear weapons programs under the Energy Department. "It is clear that this budget proposed today cannot pass the Senate," McCain flatly stated. "Unfortunately, the Administration’s budget request is not enough to repair that damage and to rebuild the military as the President has discussed," Thornberry said. — AND IT STILL RILES PROGRESSIVES, Connor adds: “A handful of progressive and fiscal watchdog groups today criticized President Donald Trump's proposed defense boost blueprint, citing cuts to domestic agencies and calling the increase unjustified. “‘Gutting our investments in every corner of government to pay for a spending binge at the Pentagon is beyond counterproductive,’ said Stephen Miles, the director of Win Without War. ‘Our nation's security depends on a strong economy, robust diplomacy, and our nation living its values at home and abroad. This budget does the exact opposite and makes America less safe.’" “Democrats also criticized the proposal over cuts to domestic and diplomatic agencies. House Armed Services ranking Democrat Adam Smith argued cuts to the State Department show ‘a profound lack of understanding of our approach to international engagement.’" — SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN: SUPPLEMENTAL TAKES AIM AT CAPS, Connor and Greg write: “The Trump administration is aiming to comply with strict budget laws with its proposed supplemental funding request for fiscal 2017, something that could be a dicey proposal on Capitol Hill. “Of the $30 billion the administration requested in budget supplemental unveiled Thursday, almost $25 billion is allocated to the Pentagon’s base budget, which is capped by the 2011 Budget Control Act. “The plan would require lawmakers to alter the law and effectively re-litigate a previous deal to increase both defense and domestic spending with just over six months left in the fiscal year. “At worst, this could imperil efforts to increase the defense budget for this year advocated by both the Trump administration and Republican defense hawks on Capitol Hill — and provoke a spending showdown as lawmakers scramble to avoid a late April government shutdown.” THE BUDGET BOOSTS VA, TOO: The Veterans Affairs Department would be funded at $78.9 billion under the budget, a 6 percent increase over the current year. The budget also requests legislation to extend the VA Choice Program as well as $3.5 billion in mandatory funding for it. The non-VA care program is set to expire in August. MORE BUDGET DETAILS: Trump's 62-page fiscal 2018 budget outline is here. The administration's supplemental request for fiscal 2017 is here. And additional documents from the Pentagon are here.

The last living — and probably most well known — five-star admiral in the Navy was Fleet Adm. Chester Nimitz. Name the other three admirals to hold the rank of fleet admiral, and the name the only individual to hold the rank of admiral of the Navy or "six-star admiral.” The first person to email the correct answer to Morning D (ghellman@politico.com) wins a mention in Monday’s edition. HAPPENING TODAY — TRUMP MEETS MERKEL: The president confers with German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time at the White House, and the two will hold a joint news conference. POLITICO’s Matthew Karnitschnig has a preview here. — ALSO TODAY, THE ATLANTIC COUNCIL DISCUSSES THE MIDEAST: The Atlantic Council hosts a forum on the Middle East, featuring House Foreign Affairs Committee member Rep. Adam Kizinger (R-Ill.) and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, chairman of the think tank. TILLERSON TALKS TOUGH: DIPLOMACY HAS ‘FAILED,’ The Washington Post reports: “The Trump administration made a clear break Thursday with diplomatic efforts to talk North Korea out of a nuclear confrontation, bringing the United States and its Asian allies closer to a military response than at any point in more than a decade. “Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that 20 years of trying to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program had failed and that he was visiting Asia ‘to exchange views on a new approach.’ “Soon after Tillerson’s remarks, in a sign of mounting tensions, the North Korean Embassy held an extraordinary news conference in Beijing to blame the potential for nuclear war on the United States while vowing that its homegrown nuclear testing program will continue in self-defense.” — AND ‘ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE,’ The Post adds: “The Trump administration gave its clearest signal yet that it would consider military action against North Korea, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saying Friday that ‘all options are on the table.’ “‘Certainly, we do not want for things to get to a military conflict, we’re quite clear on that in our communications, but obviously if North Korea takes actions that threaten the South Korean forces or our own forces, then that would be met with an appropriate response,’ Tillerson said at a press conference in Seoul with Yun Byung-se, the South Korean foreign minister. DEFENSE SUPPLEMENTAL — AN OCO SURPRISE: While $5.1 billion of the request falls under the war-related Overseas Contingency Operations account for operations in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere — which isn’t capped by law — the remaining $24.9 billion is specifically allocated to the Pentagon’s base budget for this fiscal year. And it would require Congress to lift the defense budget caps for 2017. Lawmakers have shown a willingness in recent years to tap the war budget to circumvent defense spending caps. Former President Barack Obama vetoed a version of the National Defense Authorization Act in 2015 that included $38 billion in war funding dedicated to base budget priorities. And the fiscal 2017 NDAA, signed in December, included several billion dollars in OCO used to restore readiness gaps in the regular Pentagon budget. But the $25 billion in base funds outlined Thursday includes a number of items popular on Capitol Hill. — AND A NEW SLUSH FUND? The supplemental also includes a request for a nearly $2 billion “Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund” that would allow the administration to obligate war funding as it sees fit. “It’s ironic that Mulvaney, who’s railed against slush funds for years, creates one,” Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told POLITICO, referring to White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina. — HERE COMES THE HARDWARE: The supplemental also proposes adding $13.5 billion in procurement for additional platforms. That includes five extra F-35s for the Air Force, 24 additional Navy F/A-18 Super Hornets, 20 more Apache and 17 more Black Hawk helicopters for the Army, 12 additional THAAD interceptors and full funding of an Arleigh Burke class destroyer. Acting Pentagon Comptroller John Roth detailed the ask in Pentagon briefing. — AND PASS THAT APPROPS BILL, TOO: Roth made clear Thursday that, in addition to the supplemental, the Pentagon still views passage of a full-year defense spending bill as a top priority. Operating on a continuing resolution beyond the April 28 deadline for the current temporary funding measure, he warned, "would be very problematic" for the department. "Our request to Congress is that they pass a full-year defense appropriations bill and that bill include these additional appropriations," Roth said. "We would find that extremely harmful to the defense program to have to live under a full year of continuing resolution." PENTAGON DEBATES MIDEAST ‘MISSION CREEP,’ writes POLITICO’s Bryan Bender: “President Donald Trump’s pressure on the military to "demolish and destroy" the Islamic State is raising anxiety inside the Pentagon that the United States could end up in another open-ended ground war, according to current and former military officials. “The U.S. has quietly sent hundreds of additional troops to Iraq and Syria since Trump took office, and is considering dispatching thousands more to counter ISIS, fight militants in Yemen and stem a Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan. But the deliberations are testing Trump’s promise to steer clear of foreign entanglements, and has his military commanders questioning whether they can maintain their meticulously drawn line between supporting local forces and leading the fight. "’How much more blood do we want to shed for Iraq?’ asked one senior officer who recently returned from the war zone.” TRUMP TAPS PENTAGON NO. 2, reports Connor: “President Donald Trump today tapped six individuals to fill senior positions at the Pentagon, including Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan to be deputy defense secretary. “Shanahan, a senior vice president for supply chain and operations at Boeing, would be the second most senior civilian official at the Pentagon. He also served as Boeing's senior vice president of airline programs and as well as vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems.” Also tapped: David Joel Trachtenberg to be principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy, David Norquist to be the Pentagon comptroller, Elaine McCusker to be principal deputy undersecretary in the comptroller's office, and Kenneth Rapuano to be assistant secretary of defense for homeland defense and global security. The president also selected House Armed Services staffer Bob Daigle, who spearheaded Chairman Mac Thornberry's acquisition reform efforts last year, to be the director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. THORNBERRY WILL WAIT ON MATTIS HEARING: While Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will make his first appearance before the Senate next week, Thornberry says he's in no hurry for the new Pentagon chief to testify on his budget. Since taking the gavel, the Texas Republican has preferred to hear from the military services before the secretary and says he's "gotten really good feedback" on the process. "I don't know exactly when he'll come, but it'll be at or towards the end," Thornberry told reporters on Capitol Hill. SEND IN THE SUBCOMMITTEES: Thornberry was joined at a Thursday press gaggle by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who chairs the HASC Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. It's the second time in as many weeks Thornberry has included a subcommittee chair to detail their work. Last week, Strategic Forces Subcommittee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) briefed reporters with Thornberry. INTEL LEADERS SHOOT DOWN TRUMP WIRETAP CLAIM, via our colleague Austin Wright: “President Donald Trump suffered the second bipartisan rebuke from Congress over his wiretapping claims in two days — and left it to his embattled spokesman, Sean Spicer, to explain that the president didn’t actually mean what he wrote. “The Republican chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday shot down Trump’s claim that former President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. “Their statement comes a day after the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee also cast doubt on Trump’s claim. “The stunning rebukes from senior Republicans are the latest sign that many in the GOP are increasingly frustrated with a president who has made a habit of hurling inflammatory insults on Twitter at his political rivals — or even his reality-television rivals — often without evidence and sometimes based on conspiracy theories.” MOSCOW PAID FLYNN $34K FOR SPEECH, Austin also writes: “Former National Security adviser Michael Flynn was paid nearly $34,000 to speak at a 2015 gala in Moscow honoring the Russian propaganda outlet RT, according to documents released Thursday by congressional investigators. “Flynn has previously acknowledged being paid to speak at the 2015 event but has not disclosed the amount. He resigned last month after just 24 days as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser after it became clear that he misled officials about the nature of his conversations with Russia’s ambassador.” NCIS ID’S 1,200 SOLDIERS ON NUDE PHOTO-SHARING SITE, reports Stars and Stripes: “Lawmakers were weighing their options [Thursday] as the number of identified members of the Facebook site Marines United grew to 1,200, including 700 active-duty and 150 Reserve Marines, according to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif). “Speier disclosed the figures from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service after a closed-door briefing to the House Armed Services Committee by Marines Commandant Gen. Robert Neller on the service’s unfolding photo-sharing scandal. Flanked by famed attorney Gloria Allred and a victim of the site, Speier also unveiled a bill criminalizing the nonconsensual posting of nude images.” Also, inside the rise and fall (and rise) of the Marines United nude-photo group: Task & Purpose WAR REPORT — FOREIGN FIGHTERS SURROUNDED IN MOSUL, reports The Wall Street Journal: “Islamic State fighters from outside Iraq are increasingly being abandoned by local militants as the group loses ground in Mosul, leaving a hardened core of extremists dominated by foreigners that is girding for a fight to the finish. “Teams of up to 10 fighters composed mainly of foreigners control individual streets in the group’s last major Iraqi stronghold, using rooftops as sniper positions and outfitting vehicles with explosives, residents said.” — U.S. DENIES MOSQUE BOMBING IN SYRIA, via The New York Times: “The United States military said that it had carried out an airstrike against a meeting of Qaeda militants on Thursday in Syria and that a number of the extremists had been killed. “The American military statement came as Syria activists reported that a mosque had been bombed and that scores of innocent civilians had been killed and wounded. “A spokesman for the United States Central Command said the American aircraft had struck a nearby building, but did not hit the mosque."

Announcement from US Air Force LOS ANGELES AIR FORCE BASE EL SEGUNDO, California—The US Air Force successfully launched the ninth Boeing-built Wideband Global SATCOM satellite aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV  Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle from Space Launch Complex 37B, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida at 8:18 p.m. EDT.  "WGS-9 launch marks an important occasion for the Wideband constellation as it is a major milestone in a 20-year partnership with Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand," said Mr. Bob Tarleton, director of Space and Missile Systems Center's Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate.   "This accomplishment is the result of the remarkable relationship with our international partners and our exemplary operations at the 45th Space Wing, 50th Space Wing, and industry," said Tarleton. "Thanks to the astounding commitment, focus on the mission, and team work, we successfully launched the next satellite in the WGS satellite constellation." This mission demonstrates the Air Force's continued commitment to deliver secure and reliable satellite communications around the globe to U.S. forces and her allies.   WGS satellites play an integral part in the strategic and tactical coordination of military operations.  With this launch, WGS-9 will significantly enhance the current WGS constellation by providing increased communication capacity and coverage.  Improving on previous WGS satellites, WGS-9 utilizes a state-of-the-art channelizer, which increases the communication capacity by approximately 45% compared to the first seven WGS satellites.  Over the next few months, Boeing will begin on-orbit testing of WGS-9 to verify performance and prepare the satellite for operational use. Ultimately, WGS-9 will be controlled by the US Air Force's 3rd Space Operations Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base.  The WGS-9 satellite will enter operations in October 2017.  With one more satellite in production, the WGS constellation is planned to have a total of 10 satellites on orbit by 2019.   Topical Tags :  Military    Agencies    Launch    Satellite Operator    Service Provider      Regional Tags :  Asia/Asia Pacific    Europe    North America             FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News University of Alberta's Ex-Alta 1 Smallsat to Dig Into Space Weather Orbital ATK Adds Their Expertise and Technologies to ULA's WGS-9 Launch Strike and a Social Movement Cause Delay at Arianespace Pressure Mounts on Australian Government to Launch Space Agency Marlink Involved in Hybrid Digital Network for Iraqi O&G Company More News Eutelsat Approves of ND SatCom's Plug 'n Play Ka-Band Terminal Enhanced RF Wireless Testing for US Government Program Supported by Quintech Electronics Mesh Test Matrix Multimedia Exchange Platform for Arab States Broadcasting Union Secures Newtec Dialog® Technology On the CABSAT 2017 Show Floor...

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Editorial: Trump low-orbit space budget clips high expectations During Florida visit Trump promises space, tech jobs Presidential candidate Donald Trump promises space and technology jobs for Central Florida. Presidential candidate Donald Trump promises space and technology jobs for Central Florida. Privacy Policy When President Trump unveiled the outline of his first federal budget proposal this past week, many analysts described it as a mixed bag for America’s space program. We’d call it a missed opportunity. There’s bad news and good news for space. While Trump proposed cutting $200 million, or about 1 percent, from NASA’s $19.3 billion budget this year, the space agency would fare much better than other non-defense agencies; the EPA, for example, is the target of a proposed 31 percent cut. The president called for canceling NASA’s mission to send astronauts to an asteroid, but preserving funding to develop the agency’s next rocket and crew vehicle. He advocated a deep cut in NASA’s Earth science programs, but maintained support for a robotic mission to Jupiter’s moon Europa. However, the president’s plan falls short of revitalizing and redirecting the manned space program after years of sluggishness and drift under President Obama. It fails to meet the high expectations Trump created last month in his first speech to Congress, when he declared, “American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.” Trump’s budget outline doesn’t take a side in the ongoing debate over whether the moon or Mars should be NASA’s next destination for U.S. astronauts. And its lower bottom line for NASA will make it harder for the agency to dig out of the rut it’s been stuck in since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. U.S. astronauts have been forced ever since to hitch rides to and from the International Space Station on Russian rockets. A NASA backed effort to support private rocketeers SpaceX and Boeing in developing the capability to carry crew to the station is behind schedule due to insufficient funding. A couple of days before the president unveiled his budget outline, the Planetary Society, a foundation dedicated to promoting space exploration, released a video letter from CEO and “Science Guy” Bill Nye with five recommendations on space for the president. One was to remain focused on a goal of sending astronauts to Mars. Another was to raise NASA’s budget 5 percent a year for the next five years. Nye asserted that funding increases at this modest level would keep the space agency on course to reach the Red Planet by the 2030s. The series of spending hikes recommended by the society would raise NASA’s budget to $24.6 billion by 2022. This total hike of $5.3 billion is puny next to the $1 trillion that the president wants to invest in rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure. And as Nye said in the video letter, NASA funding “is money that gets spent on Earth, in the United States, and supports tens of thousands of jobs across the country” — a pitch that should especially resonate with the president. Trump’s budget reflects at least one of the society’s recommendations: “Embrace commercial space.” He would continue Obama’s policy of supporting companies in developing rockets to carry U.S. astronauts to low Earth orbit, and would hand over more responsibility for the space station and satellites to the private sector. This is a smart way to free more of NASA's limited resources for more-distant missions. Trump still hasn’t named his NASA administrator. He has yet to follow through on a promise made by two aides during his campaign to reconstitute the National Space Council under the leadership of Vice President Mike Pence. He’s expected to release more details on his budget in the coming weeks. It’s possible his plans for space could become clearer, and better. Meanwhile, the focus will shift to Congress, where members draft and pass the budgets that actually become law. Congress recently approved a bill sponsored by Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson that would direct NASA to send humans to Mars in the next 25 years. It also would continue support for SpaceX and Boeing as they develop rockets to carry U.S. astronauts. It would increase NASA’s budget — though just 1 percent next year, not the 5 percent proposed by the Planetary Society. Unlike most other issues and agencies in Washington, D.C., the space program and NASA enjoy bipartisan support. Historically, investments in space have yielded scientific and technological breakthroughs and elevated America’s international prestige. In Florida, the nation’s launching pad, at least 11,600 aerospace companies with 132,000 employees contribute more than $17 billion a year to the state’s economy. Congress would be wise to build on what Trump has proposed, and make sure the space program is part of any infrastructure plan they might pass at the president’s initiative.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 18, 2017 9:13am   Comments Share: Related Ambarella And Life After GoPro Ambarella's Growth Fails To Impress, Analyst Sees 'Rough Road' Ahead Related AVAV 22 Stocks Moving In Wednesday's Pre-Market Session Earnings Scheduled For March 7, 2017 The U.S. deployment of attack drones in the tense Korean theater is a symbol of not only the role unmanned aircraft are playing in the so-called war on terror, but a sign of a rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive defense market dependent on robot warfare. Business, as they say, is booming. Jane's Defense is forecasting that the world's militaries will spend $82 billion based on a forecast of 63,000 military drones being sold in the next 10 years. “It’s a really crowded marketplace,” said Dan Wasserbly, an analyst at IHS Jane's/IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO). “Everybody makes these things now." At least 140 specific models of drone are used by the world’s defense agencies for either surveillance or to take out human and other ground targets, according to the Military Factory, with the U.S. using them heavily in Afghanistan and Iraq. Though there are philosophical arguments against using these killer robots, it’s clear drone warfare is ingrained in global defense budgets of all sizes. 2 Military Vendors Hold Half Of Drone Market The long-endurance Gray Eagle drones being deployed in South Korea are manufactured by the privately held General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., the leading military drone contractor, though some engines and armaments are provided by publicly traded companies. The Gray Eagles carry the potent, armor-penetrating Hellfire missiles produced by the Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT). General Atomics, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC), Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) account for 66 percent of the drone market, according to the defense intelligence journal C4ISTNET. It said that General Atomics’ MQ-9 Reaper — powered by a Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) engine and a Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) targeting system — accounted for more than a quarter of the defense drone market. "General Atomics is the top vendor that owns more than a third of the defense market at more than $4 billion," the journal said, quoting a study by market research firm Govin. "Northrop Grumman is a distant second with less than half of that capture. Combined, these top two vendors account for more than 50 percent of the UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] market. Textron owns 10 percent of the market, while Boeing rounds out the top four with seven percent." Anti-Drone Defense: A Growing Sector  The increased reliance on drones likely will lead to attempts by competitors to break into General Atomics lion's share of the market, said Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis for the Teal Group, a defense and aerospace analytical firm. One of the big growth sectors in the drone defense business is developing anti-drone defense systems to deal with the deluge of small drones that can be used for guerrilla warfare. The radical Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have perfected the use of drones for surveillance and is seeking to weaponize them. Wasserbly said it wouldn't be a good investment to use a missile to down a drone, since many are so cheap and small. Boeing and Northrop Grumman are developing systems for truck-mounted laser guns for the U.S. Army, Wasserbly said. The nonprofit Battelle Memorial Institute makes the “DroneDefender,” which shoots radio frequencies to confuse enemy drone’s GPS systems. “It looks like a really impressive rifle,” Wasserbly says. The Teal Group's Finnegan said drone counter measures are vital. "There's going to be explosive growth in that area," he said. "It is going to be huge." Billions At Stake The Teal Group's latest study estimates that military unmanned aircraft will rise from a $2.8 billion business in 2016 to $9.4 billion in 2025. The civilian, local government and commercial side has perhaps even more potential, with Teal forecasting the $2.6 billion in sales last year reaching $10.9 billion by 2025. Business Insider predicted overall U.S. drone revenues — both military and commercial — would reach $12 billion by 2021 compared to $8 billion in 2015. Like any other sector, there are risks. The Motley Fool picked AeroVironment Inc.(NASDAQ: AVAV) among the four of the best drone stocks last year, but sales soon plunged. Another pick, Elbit Systems Ltd. (NASDAQ: ESLT) was up more than 37 percent from a year ago and another, Ambarella Inc. (NASDAQ: AMBA) was up more than 48 percent from a year ago. The degree to which a reliance on aerial robots will render existing manned systems obsolete is unclear. Though drones have replaced some attack helicopters, Wasserbly said unmanned systems are more “supplemental” to global defenses. The U.S. military has for years used unmanned vehicles and vessels to combat mines, and advanced robotics in those areas are expected to also grow. "Unmanned military ground, sea and air vehicle technology is evolving rapidly and we are seeing strong growth across all three sectors over the next five to ten years," said Derrick Maple, principal analyst for unmanned systems at IHS Jane's.

( Source: Youtube) Elon Musk’s SpaceX won its second-ever launch contract from the U.S. military by underbidding an alliance of defense industry giants. Cost was a determining factor in awarding the $96.5 million contract to Space Exploration Technologies Corp., Claire Leon, the Air Force’s launch enterprise director, said on a conference call Wednesday. The company will launch an Air Force GPS satellite on an upgraded Falcon 9 rocket sometime in 2019.

Musk’s Falcon 9 rocket won U.S. Air Force certification for national security space missions in May 2015, breaking a lock long held by ULA. Contracts for military launches include satellites that let troops communicate on battlefields and are estimated to be valued at about $70 billion through 2030, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. With the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, SpaceX has a $1.6 billion contract to resupply the International Space Station and a second pact valued at as much as $2.6 billion to transport crews to the orbiting lab. The closely held company expects to launch a commercial satellite early Thursday and to launch its first “flight proven” rocket — one that has been flown and recovered on land or at sea — later this month. Also Read: Last-second launch delay for SpaceX from NASA’s historic moon pad “SpaceX is proud to have been selected to support this important National Security Space Mission,” Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s president, said in a statement. “We appreciate the confidence that the U.S. Air Force has placed in our company and we look forward to working together towards the successful launch of another GPS-III mission.” SpaceX may bid on 13 additional launches the Air Force is preparing. The next should be awarded this summer, Leon said.

SEATTLE — Anxious questions about the future of the United States’ trade policy dominated a gathering of trade-dependent businesses Monday in Seattle. Trade policy used to be the domain of businessmen and businesswomen, attorneys, regulators and policy wonks toiling in relative anonymity. Now, widespread economic anxieties have put it in the crosshairs of national politics. Thousands of jobs and business worth billions of dollars across Washington are tied to trade. Many local employers — Amazon, Boeing and Brooks Sports, to name a few — have prospered off globalization and freer trade. With so much to gain, it is easy to find supporters for international commerce here. However, elsewhere in the state and across America, people see trade as undercutting local economies and throwing communities and families into financial chaos. That angst contributed to President Donald Trump’s election in November. Opening U.S. ports and borders to foreign goods has contributed to an exodus of manufacturing and other jobs, he claimed on the campaign trail. Trump’s harnessing of widespread economic anxiety and trade skepticism has put him at odds with many in the Republican Party, a longtime champion of trade. Like many fellow moderate Republicans, Rep. Dave Reichert, who represents much of King County, has walked a careful path — advocating for trade without running afoul of the White House. At the Washington Council on International Trade’s conference Monday, Reichert told the audience that Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a tentative trade deal with 11 other nations, was “disappointing, but it’s not the end.” Reichert, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Trade, said he expects the president to soon take up a “renegotiation (or) a re-examination” of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The deal went into effect in 1994 and substantially removed barriers to economic activity between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. Trade skeptics have long blamed it for undermining large swaths of the American economy. Scrapping or overhauling the deal was a marquis promise from candidate Trump. The president has set a clear tenor when it comes to trade. However, how his tone translates into policy is less clear. “This is a highly unpredictable … situation,” the Congressman said, pausing while he scanned the crowd. Reichert said he agrees with Trump on three points: Trade deals should be fair, should create jobs in the U.S. and should spur American exports. “I think we have a great possibility here to move things forward. It’s not going to be easy,” Reichert told The Daily Herald after speaking at Monday’s conference. The new administration is still working on how it wants to change or replace NAFTA, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said during an interview on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News Channel. Changes to American trade policy could have huge implications for Washington’s economy, which heavily relies on foreign trade. “Any time you start talking about raising tariffs, other countries are going to retaliate,” said Carl Wollebeck, who manages the Port of Everett’s marine operations. “So, yeah, I get nervous.” Many of the ships that call at the Port of Everett are bringing goods to or from South Korea, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and other nations, he said.

Toner comes to the position after working as a principal engineering manager in Microsoft’s cloud division for a year. Throughout his career, he has spent more than nine years working for the company in both the U.S. and the U.K. He also spent six years leading engineering teams at Amazon, including in AWS, and has served as a software architect for the Seattle Sounders and a mentor for the 9 Mile Labs incubator. He will drive engineering and operations strategy for Amplero, a particularly important role as the company is preparing to expand its platform. “Seattle is a hotbed for data-centric and AI technology advancements, and Amplero is no exception. They are at the forefront of the emerging artificial intelligence industry, and the work they are doing with machine learning and multi-arm bandit experimentation is completely transforming the way brands engage with their customers,” Toner said in a press release. “I am excited to join such an innovative group that is paving the way for this new category of marketing.” Marjorie Thomas.

Thomas is currently the CFO of media delivery software company RealNetworks, where she has worked for the past two years. She has also held senior financial positions at Intuit, Sony Electronics and Hewlett Packard. As the Puget Sound Business Journal reports, the job listing for the CFO position details a plan to double the headcount of the Allen Institute in a surge of growth. “We are fortunate to have such an experienced, accomplished and visionary business leader join our executive team,” Allen Institute CEO Allan Jones said in a press release. “I look forward to working with Marjorie as the Institute continues to accelerate foundational research and make a transformational impact on science around the world.” Maria Karaivanova. (Madrona Photo) — Madrona Venture Group announced the addition of two new employees: Maria Karaivanova joins the firm as a principal, and Alice Ryder will serve as the company’s director of investor relations. Karaivanova joins the company from Bay-Area IT services provider Cloudflare, where she spent five years leading business development. She also has past experience at Intel and Boeing. She will use that technological expertise to evaluate investment opportunities, focusing on enterprise and security. Alice Ryder.

She has also held leadership positions at Expedia and Clearwire. She will work with Madrona investors and continue to build out the firm’s C-suite program, which connects C-level leadership with Madrona portfolio companies. “Both Maria and Alice embody what we look for at Madrona, experts in their field who have a passion for working effectively with entrepreneurs and innovative ideas,” said Tim Porter, managing director, Madrona. “While they have been on board just a short time, each of them has already made meaningful contributions, and we are looking forward to working together in the coming years.” Ryan Windham. (Cedexis Photo) — Portland-based Cedexis — a well-funded startup that manages the transfer of things like app data, video, and other content — announced the promotion of Ryan Windham to CEO. Windham was previously Cedexis’ VP of product and strategy, prior to which he spent three years in leadership and executive roles at F5 Networks. Cedexis’ current CEO, Scott Grout, will become the company’s executive director. “A window of opportunity has opened for Cedexis, and I, along with the company, plan to move quickly and assertively to meet the challenge. Today’s DevOps teams are looking for truly cloud-native solutions to ensure reliable, efficient, and massively scalable application delivery for modern application architectures; Openmix provides exactly the platform to meet that need. We truly are in the right place at the right time and I look forward to leading the charge for the great change ahead at Cedexis,” Windham said in a press release. Don Antonucci. (LinkedIn Photo) — Don Antonucci, previously the president of Seattle-based healthcare provider Regence Blue Shield, announced this week that he is leaving the company to serve as the chief business development officer for San Francisco-based digital healthcare company 10xHealth. Antonucci had been a leader in various Regence branches for seven years. At 10xHealth, he will oversee business development for a young cloud-based digital health service that focuses on bringing down healthcare costs for its customers. “Today’s insured healthcare markets are ripe for transformation because premiums are too high and too much healthcare is suboptimal,” Antonucci said in a press release. “Poor outcomes, wasteful workflows and high error rates account for at least 30 percent of what we do in healthcare and as much as 70 percent of what we spend. I believe the adoption of 10xHealth’s advanced IT and risk management solutions will enable the nation’s most innovative health insurers to lead their markets with a ‘best care – best cost’ competitive position and accelerate their growth in share, revenues and earnings. Having the opportunity to join the team and help scale the adoption of these advanced solutions is something I wanted to be a part of.” Paul Farmer.

In initial tests, the company achieved 58 kilowatts of power but expects its laser to reach its full potential by the time of its delivery in the next few months. The laser is what the company calls a “combined fiber” laser beam, bringing together individual lasers to form a single, stronger beam. Lockheed has been testing it at an installation in Bothell, Wash., and plans to ship it to an Army installation in Huntsville, Ala., in the next few months.   “We’re really at the dawn of an era of the utility of laser weapons,” said Robert Afzal, senior fellow for laser and sensor systems at Lockheed Martin. The Army’s specialized military vehicles “can now carry something which is small enough and powerful enough for what we believe will be militarily useful.” Multiple military agencies and defense companies have been working on laser weapon capabilities. In 2014, Boeing published a video of its 10-kilowatt laser destroying a mortar in flight. Proponents say lasers could be cheaper than traditional munitions systems because they don’t require expensive projectiles and they don’t need to be reloaded. That could make the system useful in taking down airborne adversaries, such as off-the-shelf drones. The idea of an off-the-shelf drone fleet commanded by a non-state entity presents new challenges for a global military establishment that has focused for centuries on war with other governments. For example, Gen. David Perkins said this week that a U.S. ally had taken down an adversary’s off-the-shelf quad-copter — which can be purchased online for a few hundred dollars — with a multimillion-dollar Patriot missile. Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said: “That’s $3 million to shoot down a three-or-four-hundred-dollar drone. . . . What if you could do that with a beam of light that costs a buck?” More powerful projectiles such as Hellfire missiles are also more likely to cause collateral damage, making them less practical in certain situations. Proponents say laser weaponry could be more precise and ultimately more effective against small airborne targets. Lasers “hit targets at the speed of light, they cost almost nothing per shot, and they have an almost unlimited number of times they can be used,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the nonprofit Lexington Institute, which receives funding from defense firms including Lockheed Martin and Boeing. “A medium-sized laser should be able to take out any number of drones in a very short period of time because they are so fragile.” The Navy has already deployed a ship-based laser that it says is ready for combat use, but the Army faces a unique set of challenges. To protect American soldiers from low-budget drone fleets, the Army would need a highly mobile laser that can sit on the back of a truck. The agency would have to find a way to carry enough battery power to fire continually without the truck overheating. Such a large power source isn’t a problem if it’s stationary on a ship or military installation, but moving it around the battlefield might be difficult. With the 60-kilowatt laser announced this morning, Lockheed says that it has reached that goal and that the weaponry is ready to be deployed. “In terms of the maturity of this technology to be field-able on an Army vehicle, this technology is ready for that,” Afzal said. The company said its initial testing showed the laser to be near physical limits for accuracy and reasonably energy-efficient, directing 43 percent of electricity used to power it directly into the laser itself, helping it deal with the mobility problem. The system is designed to be a low-weight solution that sits on a ground-based vehicle called a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), essentially a truck designed for carrying large artillery.  The Army already has laser weapons it is testing, but Lockheed’s laser may have advantages in power and portability. The 60-killowatt laser has its origins in the Defense Department’s Robust electric laser initiative, which started in 2010 and ended when a 15-kilowatt laser was developed. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, has its own initiative to create a turret-based laser that can fire downward from an aircraft. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/03/16/lockheed-martin-says-it-is-ready-to-hand-over-laser-weapon-to-u-s-army-for-testing/?utm_term=.624fbc423c6b Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

This results in dramatically faster large-scale analytics and transactions without significantly increasing development and management overhead. Get the GridGain White Paper. A Dun & Bradstreet database, 52 GB in size and containing more than 33.6 million records with very specific details, has been exposed. Cybersecurity researcher Troy Hunt, who received the database for study, on Wednesday confirmed that the records already were organized and developed as if intended for distribution to a potential client. The database belonged to NetProspex, a firm purchased by Dun & Bradstreet in 2015 for US$125 million, ZDNet confirmed. NetProspex had compiled the database -- which included personal information including names, job titles, job responsibilities and work email addresses and phone numbers -- for e-marketers, by all accounts. It presumably was meant as a tool to target customers via email campaigns and other communication methods. It is the type of data that can be purchased by clients and broken down either via bulk email addresses, or by specific records such as by company or industry. No highly sensitive personal information was included in the records, however, according to Dun & Bradstreet. "Based on our analysis, it is our determination that there has been no exposure of sensitive personal information from, and no infiltration of, our system," a Dun & Bradstreet spokesperson said in a statement provided to the E-Commerce Times by company rep Deborah McBridge. "The information in question is data typically found on a business card," the spokesperson added. "As general practice, Dun & Bradstreet uses an agile security process and evaluates and evolves security controls to protect the integrity of our data. Generally, our legal agreements do require our customers to safeguard and maintain the confidentiality of the data they receive." <a href="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=45628437ae&amp;cb=14900842521323" ><img src="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538762537&amp;cs=45628437ae&amp;cb=14900842521323" border="0" alt="" /></a> Devil in the Details The database includes information only on Americans, Hunt found. California has the highest representation with more than 4 million records, followed by New York with 2.7 million, and Texas with 2.6 million records. That is in line with the population breakdown of the United States in general. The database is quite diverse, including information on organizations in the government and military sectors, as well as individuals in the commercial sector. The database includes details on more than 100,000 individuals working for the Department of Defense, and more than 88,000 employee records from the United States Postal Service. There are more than 76,000 records from the United States Army and United States Air Force combined. On the corporate side, the database includes records from several large-scale businesses, including AT&T, Boeing, Dell, FedEx, IBM and Xerox, as well as Walmart, CVS Health Corporation, Wells Fargo Bank, Citigroup and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. Ohio State University is one of the centers of higher education listed by Hunt, with 38,705 of its employee records turning up in the database. Digital Commodity How the information was stolen isn't yet clear, but it doesn't appear that great sophistication was required, which is in itself worrisome. "The D&B breach shines an uncomfortable light on a common fact of modern life -- that companies of most every sort consider personal customer information to be a valuable commodity," said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "Once consumers provide information to businesses and other organizations, they have virtually no control over how it is handled, and few options when it is mishandled," he told the E-Commerce Times. "This hack shows that these types of databases are the low-hanging fruit for hackers," said Pierre Roberge, chairman of Arc4dia. "This wasn't a very technical hack, and there probably isn't a lot of money that will be made from it, but for some hackers this is enough so that they can eat and live," he told the E-Commerce Times. Going Into Crisis Mode Companies have been challenged to come up with effective responses to data breaches, cyberattacks and other hacks. "Organizations that have been hacked or breached would do well to address the situation with full transparency," noted King. "In fact, Yahoo's situation is an exemplar of the bad tidings that can occur for a company and its shareholders when lack of transparency is the rule," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Though Dun & Bradstreet insisted that no personally identifiable information was exposed, reports that the database includes people's first and last names, their job titles, email addresses, and the organizations they work for suggests otherwise," King said. "The company would do well to get out in front of this or risk suffering long-term damage. " Threat Level Compared to recent cyberattacks and security breaches, this leak could rank more as an annoyance than as a grave security concern. "This isn't voter data rolls, or very personal information such as what we saw in the Office of Personnel Management or healthcare breaches," said Eric Hodge, director of consulting at security research firm CyberScout. "However, it could be a great first step for identity theft," he told the E-Commerce Times. "The information can make it more convenient for criminals, but this information is already out there and could be picked off LinkedIn or Facebook," added Hodge. "The bigger worry from this is that it casts a light on the global state of cybersecurity," observed Arc4dia's Roberge. "It might not be very sensitive, but it shouldn't end up on the black market so easily," he said. Follow-Up Attacks Identity theft is the biggest potential concern resulting from an attack like this one, but unlike the OPM breach, which included Social Security numbers, home addresses, and in many cases fingerprints, the information leaked here is less significant on a personal level. "This is in the 'oh great, I'm going to get more spam' -- but anyone who thinks their information was breached should be more aware," cautioned Hodge. "I'd suggest checking credit card bills more closely, checking credit scores, and generally being vigilant," he said, even though "this isn't the type of breach that should be cause for huge alarm." Still, enterprising hackers could use corporate email addresses in dangerous ways. "The challenge with a breach of this nature is that it provides a lot of raw material for nefarious attackers to craft very convincing phishing or social engineering campaigns against decision-makers in corporations," said Dwayne Melancon, vice president of products at security and compliance firm Tripwire . "Organizations should warn executives," he told the E-CommerceTimes, "and educate them on the warning signs of business email compromise schemes." Mind of the Marketer The thieves apparently meant to sell the database to unscrupulous marketers. "This does cast the spotlight inside the seamy underbelly of what you agree with when you check on agreements to use your personal information," noted CyberScout's Hodge. "This information is what is considered acceptable to share when you check the box on agreements without reading the fine print," he added. "It will open the eyes to what you give in the way of information to reputable companies, and this is good illustration of the reality of how this information is then shared."

Summing up all the acquisitions since 2005, the airlines' fleet will reach 530 in all, said Rahul Bhatia, founder and group managing director of Interglobe Aviation, which operates the Indigo brand of airlines. Bhatia, who was addressing a convocation meet at Institute of Management Technology (IMT), 35km from the city, said Indigo began with 100 aircraft in 2005. At that time, other players in the industry thought it was a suicidal move. "The industry was of the view that Indigo was a late entrant in the business and starting with a huge acquisition of 100 aircraft would be a disaster. This was the biggest acquisition in the history of commercial aviation," he said. "The decision paid off. Soon, order books of both Boeing and Airbus were bursting at seams. Rapid deliveries, on the other hand, gave Indigo the chance to jump the queue in the market," said Bhatia. "After acquiring 100 A320 aircraft in 2005, an order of 180 A320 NEO family planes was placed in 2011, followed by 250 in 2014,. The deliveries will continue till 2027," he said. It took more than two years for Indigo to fly after it got approval from the Indian government. However, the company knew that the opportunity in Indian skies was not running away. Kamal Nath, IMT president and Congress MP from Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh, asked the passing out management graduates to gear up for the changing world order. "There is a new wave of nationalism taking over the world. This may initially seem irrelevant for a business graduate. However, the new government in the US is likely to have a severe impact on the Indian IT industry," said Nath. "Globalization which used to be the buzzword so far is now being replaced by nationalization. The countries which were champions of globalization are now the champions of nationalism. Examples like Trump, Brexit and the extended win of right-wing parties show the growth of nationalist protectionism in the world," said Nath. IMT director Subhajit Bhattachjaryya said, "The highest pay package bagged by an IMT student in the 2017 campus selection stands at Rs17 lakh per annum. This is higher by Rs2 lakh as compared to the peak package of last year. The average package offered to the students has gone up by Rs50,000 at Rs7.5 lakh a year in 2017." This year, 278 students got campus offers as against 360 in all. More offers are expected in the coming month," he said.

Revenue increased 2% to $11.3 million in the three months ended January 31, 2017, as compared to $11.1 million in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  The increase in revenue reflects an increase in Professional Services revenue of 5% and a decrease of 3% in Aerospace Products revenue.  Butler National Corporation continues to drive growth in international markets and through the development of new supplemental type certificates.  This includes significant efforts in South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Third quarter fiscal 2017 resulted in a net income of $14,000 compared to a net income of $102,000 in the third quarter fiscal 2016.  The decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in operating income in both Aerospace Products and Professional Services.  Butler National Corporation is working to exceed previous revenue levels while continuing to focus on our margin expansion initiatives, including efficiencies in our implementation and operational processes and controlling expenses. During the three months ending January 31, 2017, we invested approximately $434,000 in projects focused on the development and acquisition of new products.  We feel this expenditure for design and development engineering, testing, and certification of new products is required to grow Aerospace Products and help stabilize our long-term revenue and enhance our profits. We are excited about the future and are striving for a successful fourth quarter to end fiscal 2017. Management and all employees are focused on the development of new products, execution of our numerous business development opportunities as well as increasing revenue while managing costs. We believe we are positioned for the future as we focus on serving the needs of our customers and enhancing shareholder value," commented Clark D. Stewart, President of the Company.  Business Segment Highlights Professional Services: Revenue from Professional Services increased 4% for the three months ended January 31, 2017 to $7.2 million compared to $6.9 million in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Costs of Professional Services increased 11% for the three months ended January 31, 2017 to $4.7 million compared to $4.3 million in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Costs were 66% of segment total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2017, as compared to 62% of segment total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Expenses increased 8% in the three months ended January 31, 2017 to $2.5 million compared to $2.3 million in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Expenses were 34% of segment total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2017, as compared to 34% of segment total revenues in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Operating income from Professional Services was a loss of $13,000 in the three months ended January 31, 2017 compared to an operating income of $275,000 in the three months ended January 31, 2016. Aerospace Products: Revenue from Aerospace Products decreased 3% to $4.1 million in the three months ended January 31, 2017, compared to $4.2 million in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Costs of Aerospace Products decreased 3% in the three months ended January 31, 2017 to $3.0 million compared to $3.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Costs were 73% of segment total revenue in the three months ended January 31, 2017, as compared to 73% of segment total revenue in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Expenses decreased 1% in the three months ended January 31, 2017 to $973,000 compared to $979,000 in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Expenses were 24% of segment total revenue in the three months ended January 31, 2017, as compared to 23% of segment total revenue in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Aerospace Products had an operating income of $135,000 in the three months ended January 31, 2017 compared to an operating income of $167,000 in the three months ended January 31, 2016.  Costs related to Professional Services and Aerospace Products include the cost of engineering, labor, materials, equipment utilization, control systems, security and occupancy.  Expenses related to Professional Services and Aerospace Products include marketing and advertising, employee benefits, depreciation and amortization, and general, administrative and other expenses.

In initial tests, the company achieved 58 kilowatts of power but expects its laser to reach its full potential by the time of its delivery in the next few months. The laser is what the company calls a “combined fiber” laser beam, bringing together individual lasers to form a single, stronger beam. Lockheed has been testing it at an installation in Bothell, Wash., and plans to ship it to an Army installation in Huntsville, Ala., in the next few months.   “We’re really at the dawn of an era of the utility of laser weapons,” said Robert Afzal, senior fellow for laser and sensor systems at Lockheed Martin. The Army’s specialized military vehicles “can now carry something which is small enough and powerful enough for what we believe will be militarily useful.” Multiple military agencies and defense companies have been working on laser weapon capabilities. In 2014, Boeing published a video of its 10-kilowatt laser destroying a mortar in flight. Proponents say lasers could be cheaper than traditional munitions systems because they don’t require expensive projectiles and they don’t need to be reloaded. That could make the system useful in taking down airborne adversaries, such as off-the-shelf drones. The idea of an off-the-shelf drone fleet commanded by a non-state entity presents new challenges for a global military establishment that has focused for centuries on war with other governments. For example, Gen. David Perkins said this week that a U.S. ally had taken down an adversary’s off-the-shelf quad-copter — which can be purchased online for a few hundred dollars — with a multimillion-dollar Patriot missile. Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said: “That’s $3 million to shoot down a three-or-four-hundred-dollar drone. . . . What if you could do that with a beam of light that costs a buck?” More powerful projectiles such as Hellfire missiles are also more likely to cause collateral damage, making them less practical in certain situations. Proponents say laser weaponry could be more precise and ultimately more effective against small airborne targets. Lasers “hit targets at the speed of light, they cost almost nothing per shot, and they have an almost unlimited number of times they can be used,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the nonprofit Lexington Institute, which receives funding from defense firms including Lockheed Martin and Boeing. “A medium-sized laser should be able to take out any number of drones in a very short period of time because they are so fragile.” The Navy has already deployed a ship-based laser that it says is ready for combat use, but the Army faces a unique set of challenges. To protect American soldiers from low-budget drone fleets, the Army would need a highly mobile laser that can sit on the back of a truck. The agency would have to find a way to carry enough battery power to fire continually without the truck overheating. Such a large power source isn’t a problem if it’s stationary on a ship or military installation, but moving it around the battlefield might be difficult. With the 60-kilowatt laser announced this morning, Lockheed says that it has reached that goal and that the weaponry is ready to be deployed. “In terms of the maturity of this technology to be field-able on an Army vehicle, this technology is ready for that,” Afzal said. The company said its initial testing showed the laser to be near physical limits for accuracy and reasonably energy-efficient, directing 43 percent of electricity used to power it directly into the laser itself, helping it deal with the mobility problem. The system is designed to be a low-weight solution that sits on a ground-based vehicle called a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), essentially a truck designed for carrying large artillery.  The Army already has laser weapons it is testing, but Lockheed’s laser may have advantages in power and portability. The 60-killowatt laser has its origins in the Defense Department’s Robust electric laser initiative, which started in 2010 and ended when a 15-kilowatt laser was developed. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, has its own initiative to create a turret-based laser that can fire downward from an aircraft. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/03/16/lockheed-martin-says-it-is-ready-to-hand-over-laser-weapon-to-u-s-army-for-testing/?utm_term=.624fbc423c6b Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

The robotic plane will break its mission-duration mark of 674 days if it remains in orbit until March 25. But, as little is known about the craft’s activities or plans for landing, it’s unknown if it will hit this milestone. Scroll down for video  One of the most mysterious craft ever to be flown by the US military has been in orbit for 500 days. The X-37B space plane, an experimental program run by the Air Force, launched atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on May 20, 2015. Pictured is an artist's impression THE X-37B MYSTERY The U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane has flown three previous secret missions to date. Each time it has carried a mystery payload on long-duration flights in Earth orbit. The spacecraft looks similar to Nasa's space shuttle but is much smaller. The X-37B is about 29ft (8.8m) long and 9.5ft (2.9 m) tall. It has a wingspan of just less than 15ft (4.6 m). At launch, it weighs 11,000lbs (4,990kg). The craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to Earth. While its main mission payload is a mystery, Nasa has revealed it has a materials experiment aboard. The Planetary Society is tagging along with a solar-sail demo.  Ten CubeSat nanosatellites are also taking a piggyback ride into orbit.  The mission-duration mark was established in October 2014, and is now just eight days way. Previously X-37B flights have been known to land at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and recent plans to consolidate launch and landing activities could mean vehicles touch down at the Shuttle Landing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, Space.com reports. But, where and when the mysterious space plane will really land remains a mystery. ‘The landing date will be determined based on the completion of the program’s on-orbit demonstrations and objectives for this mission,’ Capt Annmarie Annicelli, an Air Force Spokeswoman, told Space.com. ‘While the program has the capability to land at either KSC or Vandenberg, the landing location is determined by a variety of factors.’ The X-37B space plane, an experimental program run by the Air Force, launched atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket on May 20, 2015. It's said to be one of the most mysterious craft ever to be flown by the US military.  Last month, experts claimed it may be about to finally return to Earth - almost two years later.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Netflix will AXE its five-star rating system next month in...

Share this article Share 73 shares 'The historic Shuttle Landing Facility at the Florida spaceport is preparing to once again host an end of mission landing as the Air Force's X-37B mini spaceplane prepares to return from a near two year mission on orbit,' nasaspaceflight.com said in February. However, the Air Force claimed the movement was simply a test exercise, meaning the mission continues. There is no official word on exactly how long this one will stay up, although report suggest it will return to Earth later this year  'The X-37 is still on-orbit.  'The program is conducting a regularly scheduled exercise this week,' said Capt. Annmarie Annicelli, media operations officer at the Pentagon's Air Force Press Desk.  Nasaspaceflight.com says even if there is a test, the landing equiment has been left in place for a possible landing. While some details of its payload have been revealed - we still do not know exactly what's on board.  Theories have ranged from it being a space bomber, to a clandestine probe on a mission to 'take out' spy satellites.  United Launch Alliance's 206ft Atlas V rocket launched the space plane from Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral last May. Theories have ranged from it being a space bomber, to a clandestine probe on a mission to 'take out' spy satellites. Pictured is the Atlas V rocket carrying the mysterious payload moments (left) after launch last year, and just before (right) TOP 4 CONSPIRACY THEORIES  The space plane is a spy plane: The leading theory appears to be that the unmanned space plane is a shuttle-shaped surveillance vehicle.  It could be a space bomber: This is the least likely theory, according tot Seven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. He claims the US doesn't need this capability.  It is on a mission is to 'take out' satellites: This activity would be easily traceable, making it unlikely to stay a secret.  The X-37B deploys spy satellites: Instead of destroying them, the theory suggests that the space plane's orbit matches up to where deployed satellites would work best for spying on other countries. The mystery vehicle, essentially a technology test bed, is designed to orbit the Earth and then land like one of Nasa's old shuttles. According to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth orbit, between 110 (177km) and 500 miles (800km) above earth. By comparison, the International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles (350km).  While its main mission payload is a mystery, Nasa has revealed it has a materials experiment aboard, while the Planetary Society is tagging along with a solar-sail demo.   Called LightSail, it uses a propulsion system that uses the pressure of photons from the sun, a technique known as solar sailing.  Nine other CubeSat nanosatellites are also taking a piggyback ride into orbit.  The space plane - one of two of the same design - is operated robotically, without anyone on board, and is reusable. It is 29ft (8.8m) long — about one-fourth the size of a Nasa shuttle. The longest X-37B flight lasted about 675 days; touchdown was last October. There is no official word on exactly how long this one will stay up, although report suggest it will return to Earth later this year. When the plane does return, it will land in Nasa's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. Like a shuttle, X-37B is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft. The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite A former KSC space-shuttle facility will enable the Air Force 'to efficiently land, recover, refurbish and relaunch the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV),' Boeing representatives told Space.com. In an unprecedented disclosure, last year the Department of Defense did reveal some details about the X-37B's main mission. '[We] are investigating an experimental propulsion system on the X-37B on Mission 4,' Captain Chris Hoyler, an Air Force spokesman, told Space.com.  'The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office will also host a number of advance materials onboard the X-37B for Nasa to study the durability of various materials in the space environment,' Hoyler added.  He added the vehicle's mission 'cannot be specified' but that it will enhance 'the development of the concept of operations for reusable space vehicles'. The US Air Force's top secret X-37B space plane was caught on camera last year by a team of amateur astronomers. South African astronomer Greg Roberts captured this of the space plane in two-second–long exposures just a few weeks after launch An infrared view of the X-37B unmanned spacecraft landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The purpose of the U.S. military's space plane is classified Spaceflightnow.com revealed more details of the flight, which is described as a 'hall thruster electric propulsion test.' It is intended to improve performance of the units onboard Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) military communications spacecraft, officials claim. AEHF satellites' Hall thrusters are 4.5-kilowatt units that use electricity and xenon to produce thrust for moving satellites in space. The benefit of using electric propulsion is that its xenon fuel weighs much less than traditional hydrazine. This technology could help in the development of technologies to control satellites with better accuracy.  The X-program has bounced between several federal agencies, Nasa among them, since 1999. The plane has been in space for a total of 674 days, far more than its two previous flights which lasted 225 and 469 days However, experts claim that refining an advanced manoeuvring thruster is probably just a small part of the vehicle's true mission set.  One leading secrecy expert previously told DailyMail.com the drone is 'very likely' be used to test technologies that will increase spying capabilities of the US. 'The US government has a bottomless appetite for sensitive information,' said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. 'As powerful as our intelligence satellites may be, they also have their limitations - most notably the limitations imposed by their orbital parameters. 'It's conceivable that a spy plane would introduce new versatility into overhead reconnaissance.'  One secrecy expert has told DailyMail.com that the drone (artist's impression ) is 'likely' to be a spy plane. The program's first mission launched in April 2010 and landed in December that year The X-37B space drone, otherwise known as the Orbital Test Vehicle, is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft.  The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite. The X-program has bounced between several federal agencies, Nasa among them, since 1999. The program's first mission launched in April 2010 and landed in December that year. The second space plane took off on March 2011 and came back to Earth in June 2012.

In his supplemental budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2017, President Trump asked for $5.1 billion to fund combat operations overseas, mainly to "end the threat ISIS poses to the United States." Of that, $2 billion would be in a "flexible" fund to be used as needed to combat ISIS. It comes as Trump's Pentagon considers deploying up to 1,000 more U.S. troops to help retake the terrorist group's de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria. The supplemental budget allocates an extra $1.1 billion for the war in Afghanistan for what remains of the 2017 fiscal year. The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John Nicholson, told the Senate last month that "several thousand" more U.S. troops are needed to break the stalemate against the Taliban. The 2017 request also asks for more funding for infrastructure projects, including at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba, which is currently holding 41 detainees. "It doesn't seem like we are going to close it anytime soon," the acting Pentagon comptroller, John Roth, told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday. The rest of the supplemental funding, $24.9 billion, would go toward "urgent warfighting readiness needs," to address shortfalls for troops' training, equipment, munitions and modernization, according to Trump's letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan. That amount includes $13.5 billion to build and modernize additional Army Apache and Blackhawk helicopters, F-35 and F/A 18 fighter jets, tactical missiles and unmanned aircraft. Defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who make the aircraft, would be big beneficiaries of this proposal. "The request is a first step in investing in a larger, more ready, and more capable force," Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a letter to Congress. According to the proposal, this spending would be partially offset by $18 billion in cuts to non-defense programs, although the White House did not specify where they would be made. The plan asks Congress to raise the defense spending cap for the 2017 fiscal year by $25 billion, to $576 billion. The supplemental budget would cover the coming months until Sept. 30, when fiscal year 2017 ends. Trump's proposed budget for the 2018 fiscal year, which was also released on Thursday, boosts military spending by $52 billion and designates $4 billion for the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. It would go into effect on Oct. 1. The proposal drastically cuts funding for the State Department and foreign aid, and domestic budgets for education, health, agriculture and environmental programs. Trump's proposed budget outlines the military buildup he touted during his presidential campaign, including rebuilding the Navy. However, it does not placate defense hawks in Congress, who say the $52 billion boost for 2018 is not nearly enough to fix what they describe as a critical, and rapidly growing, readiness crisis. "It is clear to virtually everyone that we have cut our military too much and that it has suffered enormous damage," House Armed Services chairman Rep. Marc Thornberry, R-Texas, said. "Unfortunately, the administration's budget request is not enough to repair that damage and to rebuild the military as the president has discussed." But he said he was pleased with the supplemental request for 2017, telling reporters that it was "more than I expected." "It is needed and will give us a head start on improving readiness and replacing old equipment. But, it is only one step," he said. Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who served under President Barack Obama, said on Thursday that a sudden, massive boost makes it more difficult for the Pentagon to plan defense spending and might be unsustainable. "I don't like defense spending that goes on a roller coaster ride, where one year it goes up dramatically by $54 billion and then next year, as a result of sequester or some crazy across the board cut, it's dramatically cut," he told Bloomberg. He also said he disagreed with cutting State Department and foreign aid programs, which many military leaders have argued prevent unnecessary military spending in the long run. "I believe like Jim Mattis does, that if you're not going to provide foreign aid or help our diplomatic effort in dealing with other countries, then the bottom line is you have to buy more bullets," he said. "It doesn't make a lot of sense." Discuss Print Posted in Mcclatchy, National and World on Friday, March 17, 2017 12:00 pm. Welcome to the site! Login or Signup below.

Pacific Hyperloop begins campaign to make it so by Alan Boyle on March 17, 2017 at 5:30 amMarch 16, 2017 at 11:16 pm Comments  51 Share  49.5k Tweet Share  712 Reddit Email An artist’s concept shows a Hyperloop pod parked at a transit station. (Hyperloop One Illustration) A fledgling venture called Pacific Hyperloop is kicking off its effort to win support for a high-speed transit link between Seattle and Portland, using the Hyperloop system envisioned by SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk. The plan calls for creating a network of tubes capable of zipping passengers from the Jet City to the Rose City in 15 minutes, thanks to pods that travel at the near-supersonic speed of 760 mph. Pacific Hyperloop is among 35 semifinalists in the Hyperloop One Global Challenge, a contest set up by California-based Hyperloop One for proposals to set up transit networks in various regions of the world. The semifinalists include 10 other teams from the United States, plus international groups proposing high-speed links in locales ranging from Vancouver, B.C., to China and India. “We will be giving our finalist presentation on April 5th and 6th in Washington, D.C., in front of Hyperloop One and government officials,” Richard Kim, Pacific Hyperloop’s director of marketing and public relations, said in an email to Geekwire, “If/when we become a finalist, Seattle and Portland will be the starting grounds for Hyperloop’s innovation and prominence.” The group, founded by University of Washington students, is just getting off the ground. One of the founders, M.B.A. student Ahmed ElAyouti, has eight years of experience at Boeing. Another founder, Charlie Swan, was part of the UW Hyperloop team that competed in a contest organized by Musk and SpaceX in California. Pacific Hyperloop is consulting with advisers from the Cascadia Center and the Washington State Transportation Center, but it hasn’t yet picked up backing from regional officials or investors. When Musk came up with the Hyperloop concept in 2013, he saw it as a means to get from the Bay Area to L.A. in a little more than 30 minutes for $20. But he left the job of commercializing the concept to others, including Hyperloop One. Musk currently has no role in any of the commercial ventures. Hyperloop One is aiming to begin operations in the United Arab Emirates by as early as 2020. The company raised $160 million as of last October, and is said to be hunting for tens of millions of dollars more. Just last week, Hyperloop One showed off pictures of its progress on a 0.3-mile-long test tubeway in the Nevada desert. The global challenge may help the company focus in on promising candidates for future expansion. In its online pitch, Pacific Hyperloop emphasizes the Seattle-Portland corridor’s prominence in technological innovation, led by such companies as Microsoft, Boeing, Expedia, Starbucks, Nike and Amazon. “We have a booming tech industry and a forward-thinking government that is known for pushing the envelope,” the group says. “Hyperloop makes sense in the Pacific Northwest.” Pacific Hyperloop also referred to the region’s traffic challenges. “Seattle and Portland are known for having some of the worst traffic in America (No. 4 and No. 7 respectively),” the group notes. “Implementing Hyperloop would not only alleviate traffic on highways for others, but also create a consistent and reliable commuting experience that would not be affected by factors like car accidents or crazy weather.” The group is calling on regional residents to register their support for the Hyperloop concept by signing its online petition at Change.org.

(Courtesy of Pacific Hyperloop) For decades, transit issues have been a tough nut to crack for the Seattle region, but recently there have been signs of movement: Last year, voters approved a $54 billion ballot measure to expand the region’s transit infrastructure over the next 25 years. Civic leaders have also talked about developing a high-speed rail system (or dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles) in the Portland-Seattle-Vancouver corridor. Tom Alberg, co-founder and managing director of Seattle’s Madrona Venture Group, has come to favor autonomous vehicles over high-speed rail. “I have always been attracted by the idea of one-hour or less rail service with Portland and Vancouver, B.C., but increasingly question its financial feasibility, particularly now that autonomous vehicles (autos, buses, vans and trucks) will provide a cost-effective alternative in a shorter time frame,” he told GeekWire. “Autonomous vehicles provide service directly from your office or home to your exact destination without having to transfer at a station and, although slower than high-speed rail, will provide a comparable comfortable experience where you can work, be entertained or relax,” Alberg explained in an email. It’s by no means a sure thing that Pacific Hyperloop will be making 15-minute trips from Seattle to Portland a reality anytime soon, even if it moves forward in the Hyperloop One Global Challenge. But the added attention should get the region’s residents thinking deeper – and perhaps eventually, moving faster.

SES-15 is the first SES hybrid satellite to be launched and is equipped with 16 Ku-band transponders (36MHz equivalent) as well as a 10 GHz high throughput payload. The all-electric satellite will operate at the new orbital position of 129 degrees West and will serve North America, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. SES-15 is the first of three hybrid wide beam and HTS satellites, delivering optimized and flexible global coverage for major global IFC/IFE providers who have made significant, long-term pre-commitments. The satellite will also enable other traffic intensive data applications such as government, VSAT networks and maritime.

request for procurement of 18 Super Hornet aircraft from US The Government of Canada has issued a letter of request (LOR) to the US for the procurement of Boeing-built Super Hornet fighter aircraft for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). The RCAF is planning to acquire the aircraft through an open competition to replace its existing CF-18 fleet. The LOR follows months of negotiations between the Canadian government, US government officials and Boeing. Canadian Minister of National Defence Harjit S. Sajjan said: “Today’s announcement shows important progress toward getting the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces the equipment they need to protect Canadians and Canadian values around the world. “We will assess whether an interim Super Hornet fleet purchase will help ensure Canada remains a credible and dependable ally for many years to come.” Canada is planning to purchase 18 Super Hornet aircraft for an interim period, until the permanent replacement for CF-18 arrives. The 30-year old CF-18 fighter aircraft fleet of the country has reduced from 138 to 77. "The policy requires potential suppliers to make investments in Canada equal to the value of their contract." Canadian Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Navdeep Bains said: “The application of the Industrial and Technological Benefits Policy will ensure that the potential acquisition of 18 new Super Hornet aircraft will result in economic benefits for Canadians. “The policy requires potential suppliers to make investments in Canada equal to the value of their contract.” The F/A-18 Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet that is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier, Boeing said.

Any problems with taxi trials may alter the schedule, Petitcolin said in an interview in Paris. The Chinese C919 aircraft will be powered by the LEAP engine, made by CFM International, an equal joint venture between Safran and General Electric Co. China is developing the 168-seat plane with ambitions of eventually challenging the duopoly of Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. in the global aviation market. The passenger jet project is part of an ambitious plan by President Xi Jinping to modernize China’s manufacturing. The government has identified aerospace among sectors that could help accelerate the process. To read about President Xi’s dream for China, click here The chief engineer at COMAC, as the state-owned aircraft maker is known locally, said in October that the plane would take off by early 2017 at the latest after at least two delays since 2014. COMAC counts as many as 16 global corporations as suppliers, including GE and Honeywell International Inc., and has set up at least 16 joint ventures for avionics, flight control, power, fuel and landing gear. COMAC estimates the market potential for the plane at as much as 650 billion yuan ($96 billion). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Boeing executive is pick for Pentagon’s No. 2 print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 3000911 false Patrick Shanahan, President Donald Trump's pick for deputy secretary of defense (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, file) Click here to enlarge image Boeing executive is pick for Pentagon’s No. 2 By Robert Burns / The Associated Press Published Mar 17, 2017 at 12:02AM WASHINGTON — The White House announced nominees for six senior Pentagon jobs Thursday, including a longtime Boeing Co. executive for deputy secretary of defense, moving to fill out Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ new team. President Donald Trump has struggled to fill top Defense Department positions. Mattis is the only administration nominee to be confirmed at the Pentagon. Until Thursday, the administration had only announced four other nominees; two of those later withdrew. Trump’s pick for deputy secretary is Patrick Shanahan. The latest manifestation of Mattis’ struggle came earlier this week when he abandoned an effort to get White House approval for his choice of policy chief, Anne Patterson, a career diplomat who was opposed by some Senate Republicans. The White House’s nominees list Thursday didn’t include a new policy chief, but it did name a deputy policy chief. A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, said Mattis recommended all six of the nominees to the White House. Each requires Senate confirmation. As deputy secretary of defense, Shanahan would succeed Robert Work, a former Marine and Obama administration holdover. Work is the only senior Pentagon official from the prior administration still in place, although others have been performing the duties of senior officials in the absence of Trump nominees. Shanahan moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing “fix-it” man in a March 2016 report on Shanahan’s promotion to his current position. He oversees the company’s global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was a central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program’s early years, the report said. Boeing’s website says Shanahan is a member of the company’s executive council, reporting directly to the chairman and president, Dennis Mullenburg. Shanahan previously was senior vice president of airplane programs from 2008 to 2016 and vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems. A Washington state native, Shanahan is currently chairman of the University of Washington’s Board of Regents. He holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 16750689 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Dan Coats has been sworn in as the nation’s top spy chief. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office after the Senate voted Wednesday to confirm Coats’ nomination by a vote of 85-12. Coats will be President Trump’s top intelligence official overseeing 16 other intelligence agencies. Coats will be the fifth person to serve as director of national intelligence, a job the U.S. created after the 9/11 attacks. He succeeds James Clapper, who retired just before Trump took office. 2No criminal charges: Federal and state prosecutors who have been conducting separate investigations into Mayor Bill de Blasio’s campaign fundraising practices said on Thursday that they would not be bringing criminal charges against him or his aides. However, the mayor did not escape unscathed. The state prosecutor, the Manhattan district attorney, criticized de Blasio, saying his effort to help state Democrats appeared to violate the intent and spirit of the law. The federal inquiry involved a broad examination of whether de Blasio or his administration or campaign aides exchanged favorable city action for donations to his 2013 campaign or his now-defunct political nonprofit. 3 Pentagon No. 2: The White House announced Thursday that President Trump has nominated senior Boeing executive Pat Shanahan as deputy secretary of defense. After a rocky start between the new administration and the aerospace and defense giant, the nomination of Shanahan, now senior vice president for supply chain and operations at Boeing, is the latest sign of an increasingly cozy relationship. Shanahan, 54, has no military or political experience. He is, however, familiar with defense procurement from the business side. If Shanahan’s nomination is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, he’ll be chief deputy to Defense Secretary James Mattis. 4Lawmaker surrenders: Oklahoma prosecutors on Thursday filed child prostitution charges against a Republican state senator after police found him in a hotel room with a 17-year-old boy. Ralph Shortey, 35, surrendered to authorities on charges of engaging in child prostitution, transporting a minor for prostitution and engaging in prostitution within 1,000 feet of church. His bond was set at $100,000. The age of consent in Oklahoma is 16, but Oklahoma’s prostitution statute applies to any person under 18 years old. 5Pastor charged: The Rev. Rowland Foster, a pastor in a fundamentalist Christian sect in Mechanicsburg, Pa., that rejects doctors and drugs, has been charged in the death of a child — his own granddaughter — from medical neglect. The novel prosecution is raising hopes among some advocates that it might spur change in a church that has resisted it. Faith Tabernacle Congregation has long told adherents to place their trust in God alone for healing. As a result, dozens of children, mostly in Pennsylvania, have died of preventable and treatable illnesses.

Leading indicators and consumer sentiment readings were both strong. Among the sectors, financials weighed while utilities and industrials were showing the best gains. WTI crude oil for April delivery settled at $48.78 a barrel, up just 3 cents on the day, but up 0.6% for the week. April gold added 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,230.20, and up 2.4% for the week. Equities were headed for a higher close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.02% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.03%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.09%. Stocks traded very near the break-even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could finish with either a small gain or a small loss for any or all of the indexes. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Friday was McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) which traded up 1.16% at $129.47. The stock’s 52-week range is $110.33 to $131.96. Volume was roughly 30% above the daily average of around 3.5 million shares. The company had no specific news. United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) traded up 1.09% at $113.58. The stock’s 52-week range is $96.89 to $114.44. Volume was about 20% above the daily average of around 2.9 million shares. The company had no specific news Friday. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) traded up 1.06% at $180.08 The stock’s 52-week range is $122.35 to $185.71. Volume was about equal to the daily average of around 3.4 million. The company scored orders valued at more than $3 billion for its Apache attack helicopters. Adding to the joy was the announcement that a U.K. investigation into allegations of corruption from arch-rival Airbus has been expanded into France. 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) traded up 0.75% at $191.74. The stock’s 52-week range is $163.05 to $192.14, and the high was posted this afternoon. Volume was about 40% above the daily average of around 1.8 million shares. The company announced a $2 billion acquisition of the personal-safety unit of Johnson Controls. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 21 are on track to close higher Friday and 9 are set to close lower.

"I think it's important that China continues to open itself and widens the door if you will," said Cook, speaking at the government-sponsored China Development Forum. Cook's comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China, with protectionist rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump sparking concern of increased trade friction between the two countries. "The reality is countries that are closed, that isolate themselves, it's not good for their people," said Cook, in a rare public speech. Apple said on Friday it will set up two new research and development centres in Shanghai and Suzhou in China.It has pledged to invest more than 3.5 billion yuan ($508 million) in research and development in China. Apple has been singled out in Chinese media as a potential target for retaliation in the event of a trade war. The Global Times warned last November if Trump triggered a trade war with China, Beijing would then target firms from Boeing to Apple in a "tit-for-tat" approach.

The draft budget requested substantial cuts to 15 federal agencies while boosting funds for three. Read: Trump’s Budget Plan Increases Funding To Combat Immigration, Hurts Local Law Enforcement After the Treasury Department, a major financial industry regulator, saw its proposed funding reduced to its lowest level in more than two decades, the share prices of several of America’s biggest banks spiked, only to drop substantially in value Friday. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) shot up 0.8 percent in the first half hour of trading Thursday, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rose 0.7 percent and both Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) jumped 0.6 percent over the same thirty minute period. All four fell substantially Friday, closing at, respectively, $24.96, $243.90, $58.66 and $90.66.   Compared to the megabanks, defense firm shares saw an inverse movement amid news that the proposed budget increased military spending by nearly 9 percent to its highest level since 2012. Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) dropped 1.5 percent Thursday, while fellow defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), Boeing Co. (BA), Raytheon Co. (RTN) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) fell by between 0.5 and 0.9 percent, only to skyrocket to a full recovery by market close on Friday. The sudden drop may have been a result of shattered expectations for military spending, as defense hawks in Congress such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona criticized the budget proposal. Read: Defense Company Stocks Rise After New Spending Plan Announced From Trump Administration Ahead Of Address Before Joint Session Of Congress In the hours after news surfaced that the Environmental Protection Agency would see nearly a third of its funding slashed, drawing its budget down to the lowest level in history, major corporate polluters saw temporary share price gains. Alcoa Corporation (AA) and German pharmaceuticals firm Bayer AG (BAYN.DE), two of the world’s top air polluters, according to the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute, saw respective share price growth of 1.6 percent and1.3 percent in the aftermath of the budget proposal’s release Thursday. Both fell back toward their pre-budget levels by Friday afternoon, with Alcoa finishing the trading day at $34.96 and Bayer hitting $106.85 by market close. One of the oil and gas sector’s top methane emitters and the former and only workplace of Rex Tillerson, Trump’s appointee for secretary of state, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) saw a modest increase of a third of a percent in the wake of the budget release, only to level off Friday for a market close of $82.

Its most important targets are things that Trump and his followers resent— James Surowiecki (@JamesSurowiecki) March 17, 2017 Bloomberg: Four Republican Governors Come Out Against Obamacare Replacement Plan Four Republican governors told top lawmakers in the U.S. House and Senate that they oppose the current GOP plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and that they want Congress to preserve an expansion of the Medicaid health program for poor Americans. In a letter Thursday, governors from Ohio, Nevada, Michigan and Arkansas wroteSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan and said the legislation the House is considering “does not ensure the resources necessary to make sure no one is left out, and shifts significant new costs to states.” They said the bill “does not meet” goals set out by President Donald Trump about state flexibility and making sure people are covered. x The most dangerous thing about DJT's coalition may be their belief that a border wall will make them safer than a well-functioning CDC— Conor Friedersdorf (@conor64) March 17, 2017 Ariel Edwards-Levy/HuffPost: Almost No One Likes The New GOP Health Care Bill And many people hate it. Americans are more likely to hate the GOP’s proposed health care bill than they are to even tepidly support it, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. The top-line numbers alone aren’t good for the bill’s proponents: The public opposes the bill released by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and backed by President Donald Trump by a 21-point margin ― 45 percent to 24 percent ― according to the survey, with 31 percent unsure. The GOP plan also is on the wrong side of a significant gap in intensity, with just 5 percent strongly favoring the bill, and 32 percent strongly opposed. Leading the charge are voters who supported Hillary Clinton, nearly three-quarters of whom say they strongly oppose the bill. Seventy-nine percent expect that it would be worse than Obamacare, with 53 percent saying it would make things worse for them personally. Democrats are already counting the issue as a potential campaign vulnerability for the GOP. “The data shows that Democrats are well positioned to win back [Obama/Trump voters] in 2018 and 2020, particularly thanks to the debate over the controversial Republican healthcare plan to repeal the ACA,” the progressive group American Bridge argued in a polling memo released this week. Internal surveys for the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA found that Obamacare was a more “potent” topic than the fight over the Supreme Court, the group told CNN. x US reporters shocked when this German reporter asked #Trump: "Why do keep saying things you know are not true?" pic.twitter.com/dm79kI7RHe— Brent Goff (@brentgofftv) March 17, 2017 Vox: In these 105 counties, Planned Parenthood is the only full-service birth control clinic HHS Secretary Tom Price wanted to see a list of counties where Planned Parenthood is the only option for women who need subsidized birth control.

It turns out Ryancare makes EVERYONE'S premiums more expensive even young people in 2026.https://t.co/z8Pu5UCoty pic.twitter.com/CFzmMHZ8KT— Andy Slavitt (@ASlavitt) March 16, 2017 Philip Klein/WashExaminer: Frustrated conservatives are complaining that Congressional leadership isn't being straight about the latitude that exists to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is quickly turning the GOP's intraparty healthcare policy debate into a battle over the complex procedural rules governing the Senate. At issue is a process known as reconciliation, which allows certain bills to pass through the Senate with a simple majority (rather than the typical 60 votes) as long as all of its provisions meet a certain series of tests, which were spelled out decades ago in a rule named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd. Republican leaders have emphasized that they are working hard to get the best bill that they can through the Senate given the limitations, but conservatives argue that the current House bill favored by Speaker Paul Ryan doesn't go far enough in fully repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a true free market alternative. And they say the authors of the legislation are hiding behind the vagaries of the reconciliation process to justify some of the policy decisions that have angered conservatives. x Want to #SaveACA?

They couldn’t stop another overdose Here in Huntington, population 49,000, health officials estimate a staggering 1 in 4 residents is dependent on opioids, from squalling newborns shaking with withdrawal symptoms to powerful lawyers immobilized by addiction. It’s so bad that the mayor carries around a naloxone injector in case he encounters an overdose victim. The city has tried setting up a needle exchange, hiring a drug czar, even suing the drug companies that brought pain pills to the state of West Virginia. None of those tactics have stopped the epidemic. “There doesn’t seem to be enough emphasis on what we’re losing,” John Wilson said, fighting the tears falling down his face. OTOH, Vann R.

To those who object to deep cuts in those programs, Mick Mulvaney, the president’s budget director, had a blunt message on Thursday: What did you expect? He said that after-school programs had failed to help children in schools, that housing programs were “not well run,” that government health research had suffered “mission creep” and that grants to local communities “don’t do any good.” x icymi, don't get @aaronecarroll mad https://t.co/zLRViCDGX5— Greg Dworkin (@DemFromCT) March 17, 2017 James Pethokoukis/The Week: What would a failed Trump administration look like? It certainly doesn't need to involve President Trump's impeachment and removal from office. Rather, imagine this: As the 2018 midterm elections approach, Trump's only accomplishment is starting construction on the southern border mega-wall. No ObamaCare replacement. No big tax cut. No big infrastructure plan. And millions of American voters are starting to consider that handing total power in Washington to a party led by a short-attention-span novice was a cosmically bad idea. It hardly seems like a far-fetched scenario right now. First, repealing and replacing ObamaCare, the GOP's top priority, was just dealt a hammer blow by the Congressional Budget Office. Conservative Republicans will surely focus on the CBO finding that the American Health Care Act would reduce projected debt by $300 billion and cut taxes by $900 billion over a decade. But the more relevant numbers to many Americans will be the 14 million people losing health insurance coverage next year and the 20 percent rise in insurance premiums if the bill becomes law. Republicans may quibble about details and degree, but the CBO forecast is almost certainly correct directionally. Priority two doesn't look a whole lot healthier. The GOP plan to deeply cut tax rates depends on the blueprint's controversial and deeply confusing border-adjustment provision, where imports would be taxed but exports wouldn't. Not surprisingly, the plan has split GOP business backers depending on whether they export goods (like Boeing) or import them (like Walmart). Dropping this provision — as seems highly probable — would blow a trillion-dollar revenue hole in a plan already counting on aggressive growth forecasts to avoid hemorrhaging red ink. x .@FreedomCaucus chairman: Despite changes, GOP healthcare bill doesn't have the votes https://t.co/QWbB9FkFCG— Scott Wong (@scottwongDC) March 17, 2017 x NEW CBO-DERIVED ESTIMATES: Coverage losses under the House bill by congressional district and coverage type. https://t.co/7gZu3wGQo5— Topher Spiro (@TopherSpiro) March 17, 2017 Alex Roarty/McClatchy: Centrist Democrats struggle to draft a survival strategy It was a secret meeting about an existential crisis. Gathered behind closed doors in a Denver hotel, 30 conservative Democrats plotted a potential path forward for their party – an effort to devise a strategy that might help them avoid total annihilation in red states across America. These political moderates had been called together by former Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, and they showed up out of fear that their party is growing more liberal by the day, and less interested in their centrist positions. x .@NPR is whipping the health care vote. https://t.co/XZvO5YUqQ1— Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) March 17, 2017 I think the time to offer a Democratic fix to ACA has not arrived yet. I’d rather throw them an anvil while they are floundering. But for later: Pending  Horizon blog: No, really: Democrats should offer an ACHA alternative Some people on the left are rightly mocking Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) for saying Democrats who don't like the Republican Obamacare repeal-and-replace plan should put forward their proposal. After all, the Democrats' already did: it is the current law. But this is a good chance to highlight differences and drive home the problems with Trumpcare. While the ACA has gotten marginally more popular during this repeal fight, polling shows almost no one thinks the law is perfect, and most want to see it significantly improved. Democrats could quickly and easily put out a package based on already-scored ideas that would reduce premiums, increase coverage, and lower the deficit. It would do all the things Trump promised to do during the campaign but is now planning do the opposite of with his current repeal-and-replace plan. x CNN/ORC poll: Americans break with Trump on immigration policy @henryolsenEPPC @CNNPolitics https://t.co/gnTTtzDd7b— (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) March 17, 2017 336 Comments Share this article 141 141 141 336 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

(COL) Recent Posts: Here’s How You Can Invest In The World’s Most Innovative Country: Switzerland (EWL) Why Microsoft Corporations’s Dividend Payments Could Double Within 5 Years (MSFT) The Best ‘Trump Trade’ Right Now is Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL) View All Posts Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL) might not be as popular as Boeing Co (BA) or Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), but the company’s roots can be traced back to WWII and the venerable P-51 Mustang. In the ’60s, it produced the Apollo spacecraft that put Neil Armstrong on the moon. By the late ’70s, it was commissioned to spearhead NASA’s Space Shuttle program, starting with “Challenger,” and eventually building four other orbiters that made hundreds of trips into outer space. The GPS systems used by so many of our electronic, automotive and aviation products might not even exist without Rockwell-Collins. Its “Navstar” GPS satellites were among the first commissioned by the Pentagon. By many measures, it has produced some of the most impressive and influential aerospace and communications technology of the 20th century. And even after several mergers and acquisitions, and an eventual spinoff in 2001, Rockwell-Collins is still an aviation, defense and technological force to be reckoned with. But this is more than just a company with an impressive lineage. It is the “best-in-breed” for its sector, heavily integrated into aerospace, defense, infrastructure and even rail. Growth in these sectors equals earnings growth for COL. Given President Trump’s effect on consumer and defense stocks, and his expected $54 billion increase in defense spending alone, I’d expect Rockwell-Collins to be highly valued like many of its peers and trading at new all-time highs, but shares still have a little way to go before hitting either benchmark. And even though Rockwell’s shares have rallied since Trump’s election, there’s still a disconnect between its valuation and that of its peers. 7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017 This disconnect is likely because Rockwell sells direct to companies like Boeing and Lockheed, instead of directly to the government. So when investors are researching top defense contractors, Rockwell’s name isn’t the most readily apparent. As more the popular trades get crowded, the information will trickle down To get an idea of value, Rockwell’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 17.24 is 43% lower than its industry average (Bloomberg). Its ratio is also lower than both Boeing’s and Lockheed Martin’s, even though its income streams are quite diverse. Oddly, the opposite tends to be the case when you look at other similar supplier-versus-end seller examples such as Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and its supply chain companies.

Sun was reacting to annual trade policy agenda sent to Congress by the new US government implying that America is not bound by World Trade Organisation (WTO) decisions. The new US policy will also strictly enforce its trade laws, which include a “safeguard” provision that allows the Washington to unilaterally impose relief “if increasing imports are substantial cause of serious injury to a domestic industry,” state-run Global Times reported. US President Donald Trump, who made some tough statements against China before and after his election, branded Beijing as a currency manipulator to gain unfair advantage from exports and even threatened to impose 45 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods. China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, told media last week that China and the US are interdependent, and bilateral trade relations affect not just the two countries but the world. “Many Americans and their Western friends think that China has to rely on the US. I think they are partially right. But the US has to rely on China as well,” Zhong said. The report said the new US document asserts that “Americans are not directly subject to WTO decisions,” and that the US will defend its national sovereignty over trade policy and use all possible sources of leverage to encourage other countries to open their markets to US exports of goods and services. Zhong said China receives 26 per cent of Boeing airplane orders, 56 per cent of US bean exports, 16 per cent of automobile exports and 15 per cent of integrated circuit exports. China-US trade reached USD 519.6 billion in 2016, representing 207 times that of the 1979 amount, when diplomatic relations started, he said. However, the balance of trade is heavily tilted in favour of China as US exports amount to about $100 billion. “A trade war is not in the best interests of the two countries and peoples because a trade war only does much more harm than good,” Zhong had said.

EDT March 17, 2017 The Air Force's WGS-9 communications satellite was lifted atop a United Launch Alliance Delta IV rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 37. (Photo: United Launch Alliance) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Space Coast viewers could be in for a treat Saturday with a powerful Delta IV rocket's planned twilight blastoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The 217-foot United Launch Alliance rocket is targeting liftoff at 7:44 p.m., about 10 minutes after sunset, and will receive an extra boost from four solid rocket motors attached to the first stage. “It’s a good time for a launch,” said Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, commander of the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing. “That dusk time is beautiful, and then to have the four solids on, it’s a show.” If the launch of a heavy military communications satellite occurs on time, the rocket will bolt from Launch Complex 37 with more than 1.8 million pounds of thrust. As it climbs over the Atlantic Ocean, the trail of exhaust from the solid boosters will catch the fading sunlight and turn bright white as it streaks through a darkening sky, perhaps through colorful clouds. “With four solids, if you’re there in the local area, it’s going to be a pretty amazing experience with the sound and the vibration and the acoustics from the vehicle lifting off,” said Laura Maginnis, ULA’s vice president for government satellite launches. “For those viewing at the launch site, it will be a pretty powerful sight and pretty quick off the launch pad with those solid motors.” The launch window extends to 8:59 p.m., so a twilight launch could turn into a night launch if any issues crop up during the countdown. Weather doesn’t figure to be a factor, with the Air Force’s 45th Weather Squadron predicting a 90 percent chance of favorable conditions. A backup launch opportunity is available Sunday evening, if necessary. Flying on top of the rocket is the Air Force’s ninth Wideband Global Satcom satellite, or WGS-9, the latest addition to a constellation forming the Defense Department’s highest capacity space-based communications network. The $424 million satellite, built by Boeing, was bought by five international partners who gained access to the network: Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The mission was delayed from March 8 to fix an engine issue found during pre-launch inspections. Before the delay, the Air Force was promoting the flight as the “Super Bowl of launches,” a showcase event helping to kick off yearlong celebrations of the service’s 70th anniversary. The Delta IV's nose cone is painted with the Air Force’s 70th anniversary "Breaking Barriers" logo, along with mission artwork featuring the partner countries’ flags. Hundreds of guests including international partners and the head of Air Force Space Command had been expected to attend the launch, which coincided with an Air Force conference in Orlando. The delay scrapped those plans. Fewer VIPs may be in attendance, but the Space Coast can still look forward to an eye-catching launch.

Weapon manufacturing giant Lockheed Martin says it has finished a 60-kilowatt laser system that will be handed to the Army for further testing. First tests on the tank saw it reach 58 kilowatts of power but bosses at Lockheed believe it will fulfil its full potential in the next few months as development continues. The “combined fibre” laser beam uses several lasers to form a larger, stronger beam.  © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Lockheed Martin Lockheed has been testing the new mega weapon, that experts believe will change the face of warfare, in Washington state. Now it is expected to transport the tank to an army base in Alabama. Robert Afzal, senior fellow for laser and sensor systems at Lockheed Martin, said: “We’re really at the dawn of an era of the utility of laser weapons.” © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Lockheed Martin He added that special vehicles “can now carry something which is small enough and powerful enough for what we believe will be militarily useful.” Boeing has also been testing similar weapons and shared a video in 2014 of a 10-kilowatt laser destroying an airborne mortar. Military experts are particularly excited about the developments because firing laser weapons will cost a fraction of the price of firing traditional weapons, be more accurate and will not require reloading. © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Lockheed Martin Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, described a recent incident in which a US ally had used a multimillion-dollar Patriot missile to destroy a quad-copter similar to those easily bought in toy shops. He told the Washington Post: “That’s $3 million to shoot down a three-or-four-hundred-dollar drone. . . . What if you could do that with a beam of light that costs a buck?”  The US army is already testing other laser weapons, however the latest Lockheed design is thought to be more powerful and portable.

NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks finished modestly lower Friday as worries about international trade hung over the first meeting between President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. At a White House press conference with Merkel, Trump denied he was an isolationist, but pledged to fight for “fair” trade with Germany and other countries. Merkel said she favored “win-win” trade agreements. Meanwhile, finance ministers and central bankers from major economies were looking for reassurance from US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the G20 meeting in Germany, following Trump’s tough rhetoric. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a quiet session down 0.1% at 20,916.68. The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.1% to close at 2,378.21, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index was essentially flat at 5,901.00. Large gainers in the blue-chip index included Boeing and McDonald’s, while banks JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs both declined. Amgen slumped 7.0% after it released clinical data that showed its Repatha drug, in concert with other treatments, reduced the chance of a major cardiovascular event by 20 percent. Analysts said the finding was solid, but a bit underwhelming given lofty expectations for the drug. Tiffany rose 3.0 % after reporting a three percent decline in fourth quarter net income to $158 million that translated into $1.45 per share, beating expectations by seven cents. Adobe Systems advanced 4.1% as it reported a 36.3% rise in first-quarter earnings to $398.4 million on record revenues thanks to growth in cloud-oriented software.

(Daily Breeze staff file photo) By City News Service Posted: 03/17/17, 4:49 PM PDT | Updated: 3 days ago # Comments Runway maintenance work at LAX next week will force planes coming from the east to land over Inglewood and other communities directly east of the airport in the early morning hours. The work originally was scheduled for earlier this week, but was rescheduled for March 20 and March 22 due to low-visibility weather conditions, according to Los Angeles World Airports, which operates LAX. Usually, LAX shifts to “over-ocean operations” from midnight to 6:30 a.m. During those hours, planes approach the airport from over Santa Monica Bay, instead of lining up over eastern L.A. County to land in an east-to-west direction. That leaves air controllers with the delicate balance of planes both taking off toward the ocean, and coming in from the ocean at the same time. LAWA said the usual nighttime noise reprieve will not happen on those two nights, when all planes will be coming in from the east from midnight to 6:30 a.m. The southernmost runway, called 25 Left/7R, is being closed for maintenance. The largest jet planes — Airbus A380s and Boeing 748s — cannot take off on the southern pair of runways. And the FAA will not allow the big planes to take off in the same direction as arriving flights using the northern runways. That means the entire airport will operate in an east-to-west traffic flow all night, LAX officials said.

Weapon manufacturing giant Lockheed Martin says it has finished a 60-kilowatt laser system that will be handed to the Army for further testing. First tests on the tank saw it reach 58 kilowatts of power but bosses at Lockheed believe it will fulfil its full potential in the next few months as development continues. The “combined fiber” laser beam uses several lasers to form a larger, stronger beam.

Now it is expected to transport the tank to an army base in Alabama. Robert Afzal, senior fellow for laser and sensor systems at Lockheed Martin, said: “We’re really at the dawn of an era of the utility of laser weapons.” Experts say the weapons will be capable of cheaply and accurately destroying drones (Photo: Lockheed Martin) Initial tests have proven successful (Photo: Lockheed Martin) He added that special vehicles “can now carry something which is small enough and powerful enough for what we believe will be militarily useful.” Boeing has also been testing similar weapons and shared a video in 2014 of a 10-kilowatt laser destroying an airborne mortar.

(Photo: Lockheed Martin) Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, described a recent incident in which a US ally had used a multimillion-dollar Patriot missile to destroy a quad-copter similar to those easily bought in toy shops. He told the Washington Post : “That’s $3 million to shoot down a three-or-four-hundred-dollar drone. . . . What if you could do that with a beam of light that costs a buck?” The US army is already testing other laser weapons, however the latest Lockheed design is thought to be more powerful and portable.

Trump Onslaught on International Law and Institutions More Masthead About Lawfare Comments Policy Subscribe to Lawfare The Job Board Calendar Today's Headlines and Commentary Today's Headlines and Commentary By Jordan Brunner Friday, March 17, 2017, 3:09 PM Google+ Reddit LinkedIn In a rare public comment, U.K. signals intelligence agency GCHQ said that the allegations made yesterday by Press Secretary Sean Spicer that the agency spied on President Trump at the request of President Obama were “nonsense,” and “utterly ridiculous,” the Guardian writes. While the Telegraph reported that both Spicer and National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster made a “formal apology” over the unfounded allegations, which derive from an opinion segment shown on Fox News, and the BBC wrote that the administration simply “agreed not to repeat” the claims any further, Spicer told U.S. press this afternoon that he did not apologize and that, “I don’t think we regret anything.” During a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Trump doubled down on his claims that he had been wiretapped on the orders of President Obama, joking to Merkel that, “as far as wiretapping by this past administration, at least we have something in common” in an apparent reference to 2013 revelations that the NSA tapped Merkel’s phone calls. In the first meeting between the two leaders, Trump appeared to refuse Merkel’s offer of a handshake. The Wall Street Journal writes that even after a bipartisan statement to the contrary by the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Trump continues to stand behind his claim that he was the target of surveillance by the previous administration. According to Spicer during a news briefing yesterday, Trump “stands by” his claim, even as Senators Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Mark Warner (D-VA) issued a joint statement saying they see “no indications,” that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance. The statement follows one by Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) and ranking member Adam Schiff (D-CA) of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence saying that there is “no evidence,” that Trump’s claim is true. The New York Daily News reports that a laptop computer containing floor plans for Trump Tower, information about the Hillary Clinton email investigation, and other national security information was stolen from a Secret Service agent’s vehicle in Brooklyn yesterday. Police have been frantically searching for the computer since it was stolen from the agent’s vehicle, which was parked in their driveway.   Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that Washington’s policy of “strategic patience” with North Korea was at an end, and that preemptive military action “is an option,” according to CNN. Tillerson stressed that the United States did not seek a military conflict, but would carry out a strike if sufficient provoked. The Wall Street Journal adds that on the heels of Tillerson’s comments, Trump tweeted “North Korea is behaving very badly. They have been “playing” the United States for years. China has done little to help!” Tillerson also stated that countries like China could do more on the subject of sanctions to pressure North Korea and called China’s apparent economic retaliation against South Korea in response to the deployment THAAD missile defense system “inappropriate and troubling.”   Among those retaliatory actions include that the Chinese government’s move to shut down 23 stores in China belonging the South Korean conglomerate that agreed to allow its golf course to be used for the THAAD system, CNN Money informs us. While China said that the closures were due to fire code violations, they come just days after Beijing promised that hosting the THAAD system “could turn into a nightmare” for the conglomerate. IHS Janes reports that Russia has announced its deepest defense budget cut since the 1990s. Figures released by the Russian Federal Treasury confirm that the cut is 25.5%, and follows an extended period of large increases at the average rate of 19.8% per year since 2011. Foreign Policy writes that the Trump budget embodies the administration’s nationalism as it calls for a bolstering of military spending and border security while gutting funds for diplomacy, foreign aid, and most of the federal government, specifically scientific research. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said that the cuts to international programs may backfire on the administration, as it might undermine its efforts to pursue cost-cutting reforms at the U.N. The budget as laid out right now will be a heavy lift for the Trump administration even in a GOP Congress according to the New York Times, as many Republicans have expressed concern over specific cuts, and the Hill tells us that Senator Lindsey Graham (R-N.C.) has called it “dead on arrival,” and  Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has said it cannot pass the Senate. Foreign Policy tells us that after months of discord between the White House and Defense Secretary James Mattis over key posts within the Pentagon, the Trump administration has finally nominated six civilians to fill the slots. The most significant nomination is that of Boeing executive Patrick M. Shanahan to be the deputy secretary of defense. Shanahan, who would replace widely-respected Obama holdover Robert Work if confirmed, has no experience in government but brings industry experience, which the White House reportedly valued. Other nominations include David Norquist to be the Pentagon’s comptroller, Elaine McCusker to be Norquist's deputy, and David Joel Trachtenberg, a former congressional staffer and defense official, as Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. The Journal informs us that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was paid more than $50,000 by Russian companies shortly before he became a formal adviser to Trump during his presidential campaign and while he continued to hold a top-secret level security clearance. The documents showing the financial transfer come just over a month after Flynn was forced to resign for contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and as investigations continue into connections between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The Times adds that one of the companies Flynn was paid by, Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, “has long been suspected of having ties to Russian intelligence services.” The New York Times writes that one of the hackers indicted in the Yahoo email theft, Dmitry A. Dokuchaev, has been accused by the Russian government of being a double agent for the United States. But the U.S. government says he doubled as a cyber criminal while he was working for the Russian intelligence service FSB. Dokuchaev was arrested four months ago in Russia, and faces 20 years in prison for suspicion of having passed information to the United States, potentially related to the Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election. The Times reports that the U.S. military has denied reports by Syrian activists that scores of innocent civilians had been killed and injured as a result of an U.S. airstrike. Colonel John J. Thomas, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said that a U.S. airstrike targeted and destroyed a building nearby a mosque that was hosting a meeting of al Qaeda militants. But local activists and the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights said that 42 people had been killed and that rescuers were still sifting through the rubble of the mosque, with pictures posted on Twitter of what looked to be fragments of a U.S. Hellfire missile amongst rubble. At least 31 Somali refugees were killed in a helicopter attack on a refugee boat off the coast of Yemen, Reuters writes. It is not clear who carried out the attack. The Times of Israel tells us that the Israeli Air Force shot down an incoming anti-aircraft Syrian missile with an Arrow defense battery early this morning, in the first reported use of the advanced system. The use of the defense system was as a result of Syria firing at Israeli fighter jets, who were conducting strikes against positions in Syria against a Hezbollah weapons convoy. While most of the anti-aircraft missiles missed their target, one had to be intercepted before it caused any damage. Ibrahim Suleiman Adnan Adam Harun, a Saudi-born man, was convicted yesterday of participating in the 2003 attack in Afghanistan that killed two U.S. servicemen and plotting to bomb a U.S. embassy in West Africa, according to Reuters. A jury found Harun guilty on all counts after only two hours of deliberations. Harun was not present at trial: since being extradited from Italy in 2012 he has demanded a military trial befitting a “warrior,” and has refused to meet and discuss the case with his defense lawyers.   ICYMI: Yesterday, on Lawfare Peter Margulies examined the Hawaii court’s injunction against President Trump’s refugee ban and highlighted the flaws in Maryland court's injunction. Robert Loeb argued that there was never a national security need for the travel ban. Jane Chong analyzed whether § 1373 of the Immigration and Nationality Act unconstitutionally commandeers the states.   John Bellinger commented that the Alien Tort Statute case Doe v. Nestle has been dismissed again. Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen described what the late Thomas Schelling could tell us about cyber coercion. Charley Snyder and Michael Sulmeyer presented the effects they believe that Justice Department’s indictment of Russian hackers will have. Alex Loomis recounted the presentation of witnesses who collected and were custodians of evidence from the Cole bombing at the 3/13 session of this week’s military commissions. Nora Ellingsen discussed the continued testimony on the Cole bombing in her coverage of the 3/14 session of this week’s military commissions. Benjamin Wittes and Quinta Jurecic asked what happens when the judiciary doesn’t trust the president’s oath.

By Eli Clifton / LobeLog March 16, 2017 Print Comments Protesters outside of AIPAC conference at Washington DC Convention center, 23 May 2005. Photo Credit: Carolmooredc (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons This article is reprinted, with permission, from Lobelog.com. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has been noticeably quiet about the Trump administration’s slowness to denounce the spike in anti-Semitic attacks and bomb threats, its nomination of an ambassador to Israel who described J Street as “worse than kapos,” and its ties to ethno-nationalists like White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior adviser Stephen Miller. But AIPAC has done more than just tolerate the U.S. tilt toward extreme and often xenophobic views. Newly released tax filings show that the country’s biggest pro-Israel group financially contributed to the Center for Security Policy, the think-tank that played a pivotal role in engineering the Trump administration’s efforts to impose a ban on Muslim immigration. In 2015, AIPAC launched a 501c4 advocacy group, Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran (CFNI). Expected to spend $20 million in July and August 2015, the group was “formed with the sole mission of educating the public ‘about the dangers of the proposed Iran deal,’” spokesman Patrick Dorton told The New York Times. The Times reported that the $20 million budget would go to ad buys in as many as 40 states as well as other advocacy. Indeed, the group’s filing (viewable here) show that the AIPAC spin-off paid $18 million for “media related expenses,” $8.35 million for “phone program expenses,” and $58,200 for “survey expenses.” Shortly after the group launched, my colleague Ali Gharib and I noticed that the group’s website featured two items promoting an exiled, ex-terrorist Iranian opposition group, the Mojahedin-e Khalq (MEK). CFNI even used b-roll footage from a press conference held by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), which the State Department deemed the MEK’s “political wing” (earning it a corresponding terrorist designation until the MEK was delisted as a terrorist organization in 2012). After we reached out for comment, AIPAC’s anti-Iran deal advocacy group scrubbed their website of the MEK related materials, seemingly acknowledging a PR misstep. But the b-roll footage remained in their television commercials and on YouTube. AIPAC’s flirtation with extreme groups appears to have gone even further than borrowing footage from the MEK. Tax disclosures reveal that CFNI contributed $60,000 to “Secure Freedom,” a donation to a group with the tax-id number 52-1601976. That tax-id number belongs to Center for Security Policy, a hawkish think tank largely devoted to advocating for greater defense spending (it received funding from Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Raytheon, and General Electric) and pushing completely unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about American Muslim and Muslim Brotherhood infiltration of the U.S. government. The contact address for the contribution was a residential address in New Orleans belonging to Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) staffer Marsha Halteman. Halteman did not respond to questions about why her address appeared beneath the donation. CSP is headed up by anti-Muslim conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney who baselessly claimed that Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, and former George W. Bush appointee Suhail Khan were part of a Muslim Brotherhood plot to infiltrate the U.S. government. He also asserted that the Missile Defense Agency logo “appears ominously to reflect a morphing of the Islamic crescent and star with the Obama campaign logo” and helped launch an interfaith group to support Trump’s anti-Muslim agenda. Gaffney and Trump aide Kellyanne Conway played a pivotal role in bringing about the administration’s efforts to ban immigration from seven (and now six) Muslim-majority countries. In 2015, Gaffney commissioned Conway’s firm to produce a poll about Muslim attitudes. Released in June 2015, the poll found that 51% of Muslims agreed that “Muslims in America should have the choice to being governed according to Shariah,” among other findings. But the poll’s methodology was deeply flawed, relying on an opt-in online survey which industry experts consider unreliable. Conway’s own firm later admitted the data was not “statistically representative of the entire U.S. Muslim population.” None of that stopped Trump from citing the poll as his justification for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on,” on December 7, 2015. It’s possible that the funds went to support CSP’s advocacy opposing the Iran nuclear agreement. Nonetheless, AIPAC’s willingness to partner with an organization whose president, Frank Gaffney, was denounced by the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Conservative Union (which briefly banned him from their events after he accused political opponents of being part of a Muslim Brotherhood conspiracy) raises serious questions about AIPAC’s commitment to fighting bigotry, discrimination, and, in particular, Islamophobia. Neither AIPAC nor CSP responded to requests for comment.

Michael O'Hagan  New York National Guard ✔ ✗ Subscribe 13 MARINE BASE HAWAII--When NASA’s Orion spacecraft returns from its missions beyond the moon, the crew module will splash down in the ocean just like the Apollo capsules that took men to the moon and back in the 1970s. The space agency needs to make sure the rescue support equipment for the Orion crew module is practical, so NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory and the Department of Defense Human Space Flight Support Office turned to the New York National Guard’s 106th Rescue Wing to help test it out. From February 27 - March 10, 43 members of the wing teamed up with the Hawaii Air National Guard’s 204th Airlift Squadron to practice using the equipment NASA designed to support the crew following deep space missions. Pararescuemen from the 106th Rescue Wing’s, 103rd Rescue Squadron jumped from the C-17s flown by the Hawaiian Air Guard with the NASA gear configured on a rescue boat and practiced inflating it and working with it while floating in the Pacific Ocean. “That’s the major objective; how do we get that stuff into that boat and make it fly out of the plane and land on the target appropriately?” said Brent Maney, a former Air Force pararescueman who now works with the Human Space Flight Support Office. The Human Space Flight Support Office coordinates military support to the space program. A key piece of the “stuff” on the rescue boat is an inflatable platform known as a “front porch”. The front porch is designed to attach to the capsule and provide a stable area where astronauts can shelter and receive medical attention if necessary following the splashdown of their spacecraft when pararescuemen are called in. NASA has one prototype front porch platform which the New York Air Guardsmen tested in the waters off Marine Corps Base Hawaii. The New York and Hawaii Air National Guard conducted nine jumps during three flights to test out the NASA support equipment. Two boats—known as a “hard duck” to pararescuemen because they are dropped inflated and fully loaded—were accompanied out of the Hawaiian Air Guard C-17 by six jumpers. Each team included 103rd Rescue Squadron pararescuemen and Combat Rescue Officers, as well as pararescuemen of 88th Test and Evaluation Squadron, a unit which tests and develops rescue systems and equipment. Each boat was fully loaded with rescue gear and a motor. The front porch itself weighed in at about 350 pounds. That boat was first out of the plane on each flight. The 106th Rescue Wing had already planned to send a team from the 103rd Rescue Squadron to Hawaii to participate in the Hawaii National Guard’s annual Sentry Aloha air defense exercise. NASA took advantage of the scheduled event to use the Airmen’s expertise to test the rescue gear, said Tim Goddard, the flight lead for NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab, who designed the equipment. The Neutral Buoyancy Lab trains astronauts in spacewalking procedures in a 6.2 million gallon swimming pool where they simulate a weightless environment. Training on employing the Orion capsule floatation systems was done there as well. Initial tests of Orion recovery systems were conducted by Navy divers and ships. But the spacecraft might have to land someplace where the recovery ships aren’t, so NASA also needed to test the ability of the equipment to be dropped from a plane during a “contingency” rescue, Goddard explained. “It’s the first time we have ever done it air dropping,” Maney said. “Because of its size and weight, we need to see how it handles.” “The PJs (pararescue jumpers) drop these boats all the time, but they haven’t dropped these boats with this equipment in them. So they’ve got to figure out how this large front porch fits into that boat along with all the gear the guys normally carry on a rescue mission,” he explained. During an actual mission, the pararescuemen and the C-17 crew would work together to drop the team near the floating Orion crew module, which looks like a larger version of the gum-dropped shaped Apollo capsule. For these missions the Airmen aimed at a float made up of Crew Module Uprighting System floatation bags. Five of these airbags, which look like beachballs, inflate when the Orion crew module splashes down to keep the capsule from floating nose down in the ocean. To make the target easier to find, a Jetski circled the target floats. Once the jumpers hit the water they manned their boats, approached the target and inflated and deployed the front porch. Goddard and Maney observed and evaluated each mission. For the 103rd Rescue Squadron Airmen, the mission in Hawaii was a return to manned spaceflight support missions like those the 106th Rescue Wing conducted during the years NASA flew the Space Shuttle. The New York Air Guardsmen provided on call rescue support during 109 Space Shuttle launches from the Kennedy Space Center. ‘It’s great to be here making history, with NASA returning to the manned space program,” said Lt. Col. Kerry McCauley, the commander of the 103rd Rescue Squadron. “We are excited to be part of it, to build the tactics, techniques and procedures that are going to return us to manned spaceflight personnel rescue in the future,’ McCauley added. Major Sean Boughal, of the 103rd Rescue Squadron, saw the opportunity for the pararescuemen to turn their scheduled Sentry Aloha training into a joint training opportunity with NASA, the Human Spaceflight Office and the 88th. This was a great way to accomplish already scheduled training and at the same time take first steps in building relationships with NASA and the Human Spaceflight Office, Boughal said. But it’s not just NASA’s Orion spacecraft that could require help from Air Force pararescue teams. Both Boeing and the SpaceX company are developing their own, commercially launched space vehicles. The hope is that the equipment tested in Hawaii could be used to support those space vehicles as well, said Major Christopher Slauson, the Chief of the Human Space Flight Support Office’s commercial crew division. “We’re practicing worldwide contingency rescue… what we’re doing right now is building blocks not only for commercial crew but for any human spaceflight program that requires worldwide contingency rescue,” he explained. Air Force pararescue teams have been involved in spacecraft rescue since the early days of the Mercury program starting in 1958, Maney said. Pararescue jumpers are trained in survival, medical procedures and even infiltration so they had the skills needed to rescue an astronaut. In March 1966 the Air Force pararescuemen were called into action when the Gemini 8 spacecraft, piloted by moonwalker Neil Armstrong, experienced a critical failure and had to make an emergency reentry near Okinawa. The original recovery zone was in the Atlantic. Three pararescuemen jumped into the ocean from a C-54 just after the spacecraft splashed down, affixed a floatation collar and stayed with the two astronauts on board Gemini 8 until a Navy ship arrived. The fact that astronauts may have to land in the open ocean and not where planned, is what required the Human Spaceflight Support Office and 88th Test and Evaluation Squadron to get NASA and pararescuemen involved in the testing and evaluation process Goddard said. “The key thing I am looking to get from this operation, from the New York Air National Guard, is their expertise in rescue in open water environment,” explained Goddard. “NASA doesn’t currently have a lot of that expertise.” He wanted the pararescuemen to work with the prototype equipment so he can take their suggestions and incorporate them into them into the final design of the gear, Goddard added. “So when they get the real hardware, on the actual day, it’s the hardware they’ve helped develop, they’ve tested and they’ve practiced on, “Goddard said.

News Business Business Comment Car insurance: Economists debunk industry claims whiplash crackdown will result in lower premiums If the Government really wants to help motorists it should ask the competition watchdogs to take a fresh look at insurers   James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Friday 17 March 2017 16:22 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Insuring against this will not get cheaper as a result of whiplash crackdown, say economists There are two explanations for the sharp rise in bills faced by motorists courtesy of their insurance companies.  If you believe the likes of me, it’s because they want to make more money (as much as £700m a year but see below) and their executives want bigger bonuses.  If you believe the insurers it’s down to a wave of dodgy whiplash claims that have made life impossible for their poor, cash strapped, industry, forcing them to pass on the cost.  Read more Car insurance to rise £75? Don't believe the hype Top tips for saving money on car insurance Confused.com says car insurance soaring, industry tries to shift blame In its infinite wisdom, the Government has bought into the latter, despite the fact that it is based more on hot air than on hard evidence.  Currently going through Parliament is a "reform" package courtesy of the Ministry of Justice that will severely limit the compensation available to victims of road accidents, and effectively deny them legal help to boot because claims will increasingly be pushed into the small claims court. Capital Economics, a respected City firm, has now provided some much needed support to those of us attempting to debunk the industry’s claims, and it is based upon hard evidence Capital says that it is commonly believed that motor accident rates have fallen as personal injury claims have risen. It’s view on that: “This is a false impression. The downward trend in motor accidents recorded by the police reflects the reduced likelihood of an incident being reported rather than of reduced incidents overall.  A key contributing factor to this is the decline in the number of police traffic officers.” So much for economists equivocating.  But there’s more. How about the issue of insurers blaming rising motor insurance premiums on personal injury claims?  “There are other explanations. With the insurance business model reliant on firms generating investment returns on their reserves and capital, low interest rates following the financial crisis have been partly responsible. “It is a mistaken belief that ‘whiplash’ claims have been responsible for rising motor insurance premiums in the United kingdom in recent years.” I see. And the claim that the savings produced by the MoJ's reforms will be passed on in the form of lower premiums?  “The reality is that the industry is less competitive than they (the Government) have assumed. Instead of resulting in meaningfully reduced premiums for motorists, the reforms are more likely to boost insurers’ profits by up to £0.7 billion per annum.”  That’s right: £0.7bn in the pockets not of motorists, but of insurers. Every year.  This will not come as any surprise to those who have followed this story. Ministers have taken at face value insurers’ honeyed words that the alleged savings from their crackdown will be passed on and as a result there will be no independent monitoring of whether that is actually happening and (crucially) no sanctions if it doesn't.  Now it should be pointed out (as the Association of British Insurers no doubt will) that the report was commissioned by Access to Justice which naturally has an interest in rebutting the industry’s case.  However, you also have to bear in mind that Capital Economics wouldn’t risk its good name by producing research of dubious quality, even if that research displeased the people commissioning it. It wouldn't be long for this earth if it did that.  As someone who has read a lot of these reports, and spent far too much time writing about the insurance industry, it looks to have hit the nail on the head. And I don’t have a horse in this race.  So how do we get premiums down? Let's take a look at Capital's point about competition. Now, there might appear to be a small army of companies all battling for business. Certainly that is the impression you would receive if you made use of a price comparison website (as you should).   However, many of the quotes that appear will ultimately be underwritten by the same firm, and the underwriter is the ultimate arbiter of how much of a risk you represent and how much you will pay.  Business picture of the day 38 show all Business picture of the day 1/38 'UK Disneyland' set to open in five years in Kent - Friday March 10 It’s the news British film-lovers and thrill-seekers have been waiting to hear forever - no longer do we have to schlep across the seas to get our fix of stardust and adrenaline, for the UK is finally getting its own ‘Disneyland’. The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion. Paramount 2/38 John Lewis cuts staff bonuses to lowest in 63 years despite soaring profits - Thursday March 9 John Lewis has cut its employee bonus to the lowest level in more than 60 years despite announcing surging profits. The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market. Reuters 3/38 Philip Hammond downgrades UK economic growth for Brexit years - Wednesday March 8 The Chancellor was forced to slash his official economic growth forecasts while the Brexit talks take place, as he delivered his first Budget. Philip Hammond told MPs that Britain’s economy would grow faster than previously expected in the next financial year – by 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent. PA 4/38 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy. Reuters 5/38 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 6/38 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 7/38 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target. Getty Images 8/38 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country. Eight aquariums run by the company Sea Life are calling on visitors to spare lettuce or broccoli for their shelled inhabitants who, as a result of a shortage of some vegetables in the UK, are missing out on their favourite meals. GREG WOOD/AFP/Getty Images 9/38 Tim Cook met Theresa May and said the UK would be 'just fine' post Brexit - Thursday February 9 The chief executive of Apple has told Prime Minister Theresa May that he is “very optimistic” about the UK’s future outside of the European Union. Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 10/38 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November.

That's less likely to happen if you make it look like there are lots more insurance companies in the market than there actually are.  Competition watchdogs have already taken one look at motor insurers, and they were less than impressed with what they found.

Home Industry Challenge to Airbus and Boeing: China’s homemade C919 jet poised for first flight by end-April Challenge to Airbus and Boeing: China’s homemade C919 jet poised for first flight by end-April The Chinese C919 aircraft will be powered by the LEAP engine, made by CFM International, an equal joint venture between Safran and General Electric Co. By: Bloomberg | Published: March 17, 2017 8:08 PM A single-aisle passenger jet that is being built by the Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China is set for its first test flight by the end of next month, according to Philippe Petitcolin, chief executive officer of Safran SA, an aircraft engine maker. (PTI) A single-aisle passenger jet that is being built by the Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China is set for its first test flight by the end of next month, according to Philippe Petitcolin, chief executive officer of Safran SA, an aircraft engine maker. Any problems with taxi trials may alter the schedule, Petitcolin said in an interview in Paris. The Chinese C919 aircraft will be powered by the LEAP engine, made by CFM International, an equal joint venture between Safran and General Electric Co. China is developing the 168-seat plane with ambitions of eventually challenging the duopoly of Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. in the global aviation market. The passenger jet project is part of an ambitious plan by President Xi Jinping to modernize China’s manufacturing. The government has identified aerospace among sectors that could help accelerate the process. Also Watch: The chief engineer at COMAC, as the state-owned aircraft maker is known locally, said in October that the plane would take off by early 2017 at the latest after at least two delays since 2014. COMAC counts as many as 16 global corporations as suppliers, including GE and Honeywell International Inc., and has set up at least 16 joint ventures for avionics, flight control, power, fuel and landing gear. COMAC estimates the market potential for the plane at as much as 650 billion yuan ($96 billion). Please Wait while comments are loading...

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Tiffany – The luxury goods retailer reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.45 per share, seven cents a share above estimates. Revenue also beat forecasts. Same-store sales were unchanged, better than the 0.9 percent decline predicted by analysts. Tiffany also gave an upbeat outlook for 2017. Adobe Systems – Adobe reported adjusted quarterly profit of 94 cents per share, seven cents a share above estimates. The software maker's revenue also came in above forecasts, thanks to increasing demand for its Creative Cloud software suite. Adobe also gave a stronger-than-expected current-quarter forecast. Caterpillar – Caterpillar hired former U.S. Attorney General William Barr as outside counsel to help in connection with an Internal Revenue Service probe of its import and export practices. Valeant Pharmaceuticals — Hedge fund ValueAct Capital raised its stake in Valeant, a few days after Bill Ackman's Pershing Square sold off its Valeant stake.

ValueAct has owned varying amounts of Valeant shares since 2006.

The drugmaker said the complete response letter from the FDA came after the inspection of a manufacturing facility, and that it is working with the FDA to resolve its concerns. Apple – Apple is building two more new research and development centers in China, in addition to two it had announced previously. The four facilities are expected to open later this year. Boeing – Boeing signed a $3.4 billion government contract for its Apache attack helicopters. Citigroup – The bank issued a warning to customers about a phishing email that's been making the rounds among its customers. Canada Goose – Canada Goose is on watch for a second day, after a mixed debut. The outerwear maker's stock finished its first day of trading at $16.08, well above the IPO price of $12.78 but well below its initial trade price of $18 per share. Nokia — Nokia is splitting its Mobile Networks division in two as part of a structural change. One unit will retain the Mobile Networks name, the other will be called Global Services. KKR – The private-equity firm is buying USI Insurance Services from Canada's Onex Corp. for $4.3 billion. Texas Roadhouse – The restaurant chain's stock was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" at BTIG, based on valuation and a belief in the company's growth prospects.

The Diamond geezer has stepped away from his moneymaking ventures in Africa, returning to the City to gobble up a stockbroker alongside some royal mates from Qatar. Blimey.  Panmure Gordon is the vehicle which, we are told, will drive Mr Diamond’s ambitions back in the smoke. Strike a light, because there are going to be some fun times ahead.   Yes, thanks to the involvement of one of the world’s most famous financiers, a small London stockbroker managed to find its way to the top of everyone’s business news list on a quiet-ish Friday.  Read more Bob Diamond teams up with Qataris to buy Panmure Gordon Diamond's bid to buy Barclays Africa takes hit but don't count him out Bob Diamond’s Atlas Mara interested in Barclays Africa takeover However, while we media types got terribly excited because, well, Mr Diamond is a rare celebrity in the world of business and everyone loves celebrity, it’s doubtful that this really amounts to the return of the City’s prodigal American son as it is being portrayed.  Mr Diamond, once branded the unacceptable face of banking by Lord Mandelson, is not even quoted in the deal’s announcement. That was left to Matthew Hansen, the head of UK and Europe for Atlas Marchant Capital, Mr Diamond’s takeover vehicle.  That shouldn’t surprise anyone. You’d hardly expect the big cheese to be making bold statements about a deal valued at £15.5m struck in partnership with Panmure’s existing major shareholder, the Qatari investment bank QInvest.  After all, Mr Diamond used to make more than £15.5m for a few months work while building up Barclays Capital, better known today as Barclays Investment Bank.  This is not his attempt to cock a snook at Barclays, from which he departed as group chief executive in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal, by using Panmure to create BarCap 2.0.  I’d imagine the boys and girls at Panmure would be delighted if he turned up to the odd board meeting so one or two of the younger analysts could get his autograph. In reality, they’ll have to make do with Mr Hansen, whose deal this really is.  He and Atlas have acted chiefly because Panmure, which has had its problems, is going cheap. Even were it to be flying right now, it’s doubtful that the stock market would give it much credit.  Small brokers have never been much loved by it at the best of times. They have a tendency to cycle through owners, public and private, doing a job for smaller companies, making a good living for people who don’t much like the atmosphere at bigger places (and who can blame them).  I’d imagine Mr Diamond would derive a certain amount of personal satisfaction from Panmure stepping off that treadmill and becoming something of a force, turning into a boutique broker and investment bank with clout. But that’s as far as it goes. It could happen, and it’s far more likely to do so with the business taken off the public company treadmill by owners willing to give it a bit of love and a lot of capital.  Business picture of the day 38 show all Business picture of the day 1/38 'UK Disneyland' set to open in five years in Kent - Friday March 10 It’s the news British film-lovers and thrill-seekers have been waiting to hear forever - no longer do we have to schlep across the seas to get our fix of stardust and adrenaline, for the UK is finally getting its own ‘Disneyland’. The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion.

The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Admittedly that is the case every year, but they're getting particularly large this time around, which given Daenerys' current journey is probably terrible news for Westeros, and especially Cersei Lannister. Speaking to EW, Matt Shakman - one of four directors for Season, and a newcomer to the show - said: "The dragons this year are the size of 747s. Drogon is the biggest of the bunch - his flame is 30-feet in diameter!” As EW note, a Boeing 747 is typically 230ft long, with a 210ft wingspan. That is a LOT of firepower, which should come in handy for overthrowing the current incumbent of the Iron Throne - or for taking on the White Walkers. Hopefully this means we'll be getting plenty of dragon action this year, as the Battle of Ice and Fire approaches. The show hasn't always nailed the visual effects work on Daenerys' children, with Drogon's appearance in Season 5 episode The Dance of Dragons particularly ropey. They did look very impressive last year however, and have more money to play with this time around, as they have a bigger budget and fewer episodes. Are you excited to see bigger dragons in action?

Privacy Policy Like many kids growing up during the 1960s, I was obsessed with the American space program. I avidly followed the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, revered the astronauts, and launched my own model rockets. Pictures of space capsules adorned by bedroom wall, my schoolbooks, and my lunchbox. Then during the dreary 1970s, as NASA’s budget was decimated, all of this glory just faded away. Will today’s billionaire visionaries return humankind to the heady days of space exploration? It’s sure looking that way. Wealthy entrepreneurs aren’t waiting for Uncle Sam to rekindle space voyages; they’re launching new space ventures and making money from them. Below, I examine the best investment play on the new golden age of space. You’ve probably never heard of this company, but aerospace would be grounded without it. This week, Elon Musk’s SpaceX successfully launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a commercial EchoStar 23 communications satellite from an historic launch pad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It was the first time a commercial satellite launch occurred at the pad that once served as the sending-off spot for Apollo moon voyages. Also this week, the U.S. Air Force announced that it had awarded SpaceX a $96.5 million contract to support the launch of a next generation global positioning system satellite called GPS III. Private company SpaceX was founded by Tesla (NSDQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk in 2002, with the goal of reviving (and profiting from) space exploration. He’s not the only guy with deep pockets whose eyes are on the stars. This month, Amazon (NSDQ: AMZN) founder and CEO Jeff Bezos — a self-proclaimed “space geek” — announced that his fledgling space company Blue Origins had signed up its first customer. The satellite television provider Eutelsat will put one of its satellites atop Blue Origin’s New Glenn orbital rocket for delivery in space. The launch is scheduled for around 2021. All of these endeavors have one vital substance in common: carbon composites. Without these ultra-tough materials, the galactic ambitions of Musk and Bezos would grind to a halt. In fact, the entire aerospace industry couldn’t function. The first company on the moon… There’s one company that dominates the manufacture of carbon composites: Hexcel (NYSE: HXL). Think of Hexcel as the ultimate picks-and-shovels play. Burgeoning demand for super-sturdy composites from aerospace companies is defying today’s global economic uncertainty, positioning materials manufacturer Hexcel for market-beating growth. It’s worth noting that the first lunar footprints didn’t actually come from Neil Armstrong. That distinction belongs to Hexcel. A pioneer in the manufacture of high-performance materials, Hexcel made the composite footpads on the Apollo 11 lunar module, as well as similar components for the Mercury and Gemini space programs. Hexcel continues to dominate the composites market and is riding the accelerating shift toward these materials in a wide range of industries. SpaceX and Blue Origins are Hexcel customers. Hexcel is among the most exciting investment stories of 2017 and beyond — and I’m not just making that assertion because I’m a space enthusiast like Musk and Bezos. I know a great growth stock when I see one. Composites are polymer materials reinforced with carbon fiber, forming a strengthened combination that’s light, flexible and durable. The next decade will see an explosion in the use of composite materials, in a variety of applications that include cars, trains, planes, satellites, boats, bicycles, housing materials, sporting goods, and wind energy. Hexcel is enjoying strong tailwinds. U.S. demand for polymer composites rose roughly 15% year-over-year to $10.2 billion in 2016, with similar growth forecast for this year. The continual push for greater fuel efficiency is boosting demand for lightweight composites to replace metal parts in automotive manufacture. Meanwhile, development banks are ramping up capital expenditures in wind energy projects across the world. The purest play on the world’s growing thirst for composites is Stamford, Conn.-based Hexcel, the leading U.S.-producer of carbon fiber and by far the number one producer of aerospace composite materials. With a market cap of $4.93 billion, Hexcel maintains three divisions: commercial aerospace, space and defense, and industrial. As demand increases for these sophisticated materials for a wide variety of uses, many manufacturers lack the engineering experience and skills to move away from metal-based assembly lines, forcing them to turn to Hexcel. A manufacturing revolution… Hexcel is a leading supplier of composites for all markets but the company’s greatest opportunities for growth stem from aerospace, where the use of composites is the most significant manufacturing watershed since aluminum replaced wood in the 1920s. Hexcel is the chief composite supplier for aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE: BA), which has bet the farm on its Dreamliner 787, a composite-built passenger aircraft. Composites offer dramatic performance benefits for aircraft, including reduced weight, improved fuel burn, and better resistance against corrosion and damage. Hexcel’s materials also are found in General Electric (NYSE: GE) engines and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) fighter jets, products that are enjoying booming demand as the aerospace and defense industries surge. President Trump’s promised defense build-up will prove a boon for Hexcel. The average analyst expectation is that Hexcel’s year-over-year earnings growth will reach 5.4% this year, 15.4% next year, and 10% over the next five years on an annualized basis. Hexcel sports a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20, roughly in line with the trailing P/E for its sector of industrial goods, making this composite king a good bet for investors seeking recession-resistant, long-term capital appreciation amid an increasingly risky investment climate.

(Aaron Rosenblatt/Daily Republic) Fairfield Flying Fortress brings special history to Nut Tree By Todd R. Hansen From page A1 | March 17, 2017 VACAVILLE — The original B-17 Aluminum Overcast did not see the end of World War II, and its namesake never got into the war. But the version brought this week to Vacaville by the Experimental Aircraft Association, which came off the assembly line May 18, 1945, and declared surplus in 1946, carries with it the history of a plane that came to be known as the Flying Fortress. Fairfield’s own Ret. Col. Robert “Sully” Sullivan, 100, piloted a B-17 during such historic battles as Guadalcanal and Midway as a member of the 431st Bombardment Squadron of the 11th Bomb Group of the U.S. Army Air Corp. Sullivan flew 126 missions, including two at Midway, 95 in the South Pacific and 29 in China – almost all in the durable bomber. The China missions were in a B-29. His first B-17 was called the Yankee Doodle Jr. “(The B-17) was a real stable airplane and took a lot of punishment and still got us there,” Sullivan said in an interview last fall. He remembers returning from a number of missions with the plane riddled by flak. An EAA crew took media representatives up in the plane Thursday as a promotion for its stay at the Nut Tree Airport over the weekend, where for a fee, anyone interested can take a flight. Ground tours also will be available through Sunday, also for a fee. “This is the laboratory where we learned about high-altitude aviation,” said John Bode, who piloted the Aluminum Overcast on a 20-minute flight over Vacaville and the surrounding rural areas. Its maximum altitude during the war was just higher than 34,000 feet. The plane never exceeded 1,500 feet during the press flight, but that was high enough for An’Jurhee Simons, with Salem Media, who was singularly the most nervous passenger on the plane. “I’m getting better,” she said as the plane finally lifted off. Up until then, and especially during takeoff, she had a death grip on the seatbelt straps, her breathing was labored and, in the end, she simply sank lower into the makeshift seat and closed her eyes. Simons eventually gained enough courage to unbuckle her belt and stand, walking to the front of the aircraft where she got the pilot’s view of the area. It was worth the nerves. “To see what they see, that made it all worthwhile,” Simons said when back safely on the ground. The plane is a Boeing B-17 Model G, one of 8,860 produced. In all, there were 12,732 B-17s produced during World War II. There are 13 that are still flying, according to the EAA. And while it has the Boeing name, it was actually made by Vega Aircraft, Bode said in a preflight chat. Bode tried to paint a picture of what it must have been like to be a young man who was part of a B-17 crew during the war. Aviation was still in its infancy, and while they received the best training possible, no one had experience with the kind of long-range missions the plane was being asked to perform. It was also worth noting, Bode said, that in the early part of the war, one out of every three bombers who took off never came home – each carrying a crew of 10. The 8th Air Force, Bode said, lost more airmen than the Marines did in the Pacific Theater. Bode also made it quite clear that the people building those planes – as well as the Jeeps and trucks and tanks and all sorts of military equipment – were the women who took over the factory jobs. This particular bomber had a life as a cargo hauler, aerial mapping platform and pest control duster before it was bought and restored in 1978. It was donated to the Experimental Aircraft Association in 1983 and made over to look like the original Aluminum Overcast, which was shot down over France on Aug. 13, 1944. It has been used for these kinds of tour flights since 1994. Reach Todd R. Hansen at 427-6932 or [email protected] . More information The Aluminum Overcast will be available for flights from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Friday through Sunday. Ground tours will be available from 2 to 5 p.m. each day. For ticket prices, go to B17.org or call 1-800-359-6217.

Business Home LBoard PAS has no right to impose conditions, says Dr Mahathir Nawar Firdaws Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Trump’s budget cuts to domestic, aid programs draw Republican scorn Reuters | March 17, 2017 Conservatives have plenty to like in the White House plan, with its 10% increase in military spending next year and beefed-up funding to help deport more illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico. WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump’s first budget outline, calling for a security-heavy realignment of federal spending, drew resistance on Thursday from his fellow Republicans in the U.S. Congress as many balked at proposed deep cuts to diplomatic and foreign aid programs. Conservatives have plenty to like in the White House plan, with its 10 percent increase in military spending next year and beefed-up funding to help deport more illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with Mexico. It also takes steps to downsize government, a central goal of conservatives. But the gaze into Trump’s priorities for the next four years proved too savage for many Republicans’ taste, foreshadowing an intense battle between Congress and the White House over spending in coming months. Although Republicans control both the Senate and House of Representatives, Congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents’ budget plans. The administration asked Congress for a 28%, or $10.9 billion, cut in State Department funding and other international programs to help pay for a 10%, $54 billion hike in military spending next year. “These increases in defense come at the expense of national security,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has not hesitated to take on Trump. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who like Graham ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, leveled similar sentiments, as did some prominent Republicans in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped reporters’ questions about whether he supported State Department cuts, saying the White House blueprint was just the start of the budget process. The budget also drew criticism internationally. The French ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, warned that cutting funding of global programs could fuel instability. Election Promises The White House shrugged off concerns about the impact, saying Trump was making good on election promises. “The president said, specifically, hundreds of times – you covered him – ‘I’m going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home’ and that’s exactly what we’re doing with this budget,” Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters. Democrats, whose votes would be needed later this year to sign off on the spending bills that implement any budget blueprint given the slim Republican hold on the Senate, attacked the proposed reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and programs that benefit the poor. The White House proposal would inflict a 31%, or $2.6 billion, cut on the EPA. Some veteran Republicans, including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a White House budget chief during the administration of President George W. Bush, vowed to preserve the EPA’s Great Lakes restoration program that Trump wants to eliminate. Moderate Republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs. Lisa Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, attacked plans to cut or eliminate programs that help the poor pay heating bills, provide aid for localities to deal with wastewater and subsidize air travel in rural areas like her home state of Alaska. “We need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt,” Murkowski said. In fact, those “discretionary” programs that must be renewed annually by Congress, account for about $1.2 trillion out of a $3.9 trillion federal budget. The biggest portion of the budget – about $2.4 trillion – is for “mandatory entitlement” programs that provide Social Security retirement benefits and Medicare and Medicaid healthcare for the elderly, poor and disabled. Conservatives have been clamoring for years for reforms to those programs to save money. Trump vowed, however, to protect them as he campaigned for president last year. Trump was silent on those programs in the plan released on Thursday, but they will be included in a fuller fiscal blueprint due out in mid-May that will project spending and revenues over 10 years. It is unclear if any reforms for those programs will be part of that budget. Other discretionary cuts proposed by Trump included community development grants at the Housing Department and more than 20 Education Department programs. Funding would disappear for 19 independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting, the arts and regional programs. “Throwing billions at defense while ransacking America’s investments in jobs, education, clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Defense money for current year Trump also asked for $25 billion more for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal year, as well as $5 billion more for combat operations. A detailed copy of that request seen by Reuters showed some of the funds would be for procurement of technology such as F-35 fighter aircraft and drone systems. About $13.5 billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft, missiles and ships. It included THAAD missiles, Blackhawk helicopters and F-35s made by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as well as F/A-18 warplanes and Apache helicopters manufactured by Boeing Co (BA.N). Also for this fiscal year, Trump requested $3 billion more for the Department of Homeland Security, with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his 2016 election campaign. Congress will likely consider the supplemental request by April 28, when regular funding expires for most federal agencies. The budget outline also does not incorporate Trump’s plan for sparking $1 trillion in investments to build roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure projects. The White House has said the infrastructure plan is still to come. The planned defense increases are mainly matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the $488 billion federal deficit. Despite the proposed big cuts to the EPA and the State Department, Mulvaney said their “core functions” would be preserved. Reflecting Trump’s repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security would get a 6.8% increase, with more money for extra staff needed to catch, detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump wants Congress to approve $1.5 billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year – enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it – and a further $2.6 billion in fiscal 2018, Mulvaney said. The estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the upcoming full budget. Trump has repeatedly said that Mexico will pay for the wall. Mexico has adamantly said it will not. Since Trump took office in January, the White House has said funding would be kick-started in the United States.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents Is this the future of flying? – With airlines under pressure to slash fares and cram in ever more people without extending cabin space, passengers might soon be stacked on top of each other -- literally. This is our hellish version. Click on to see what real aviation engineers are coming up with. Hide Caption 1 of 9 Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents New Airbus patent – Airbus has offered a chilling glimpse into what the future of air travel might hold with a patent that envisages two rows of seats layered on top of each other. The patent states that the design "still provides a high level of comfort for the passengers" with seats that could be reclined 180 degrees. Hide Caption 2 of 9 Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents Airbus saddle seat – At least with the stacked-rows design passengers will actually be sitting down. Not so much with the so-called saddle seat, another Airbus patent, which would require them to assume a semi-squat position during a flight. Hide Caption 3 of 9 Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents Saddle up – The seat (our imagined version shown here), which wouldn't look out of place on a bicycle, has no headrest, with back support also in limited supply. The patent admits that the increase in the number of seats is achieved to the detriment of the comfort of the passengers. Hide Caption 4 of 9 Photos: 7 terrifying airplane seat patents Abandoned Ryanair proposal – Fully-standing spaces were proposed by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary a few years ago, although they haven't been rolled out. "We have no plans to trial or introduce standing flights," an airline spokesperson told CNN. If our rendition is even close to accurate, that's a good thing.

Its purpose is to help passengers rest during a flight by letting them lean face-forward into a cushion that has a hole to accommodate eyes, nose and mouth.

Hide Caption 9 of 9 (CNN)You know that blissful feeling when you finally sit back in your airplane seat, giddy with the anticipation of being served delectable dishes on your way to an exotic destination? Us neither. And with airlines under pressure to slash fares and cram in ever more people without extending cabin space, passengers might soon be stacked on top of each other -- literally. Airbus has offered a chilling glimpse into what the future of air travel might hold with a patent that envisages two rows of seats layered on top of each other. The patent states that the design "still provides a high level of comfort for the passengers" and seats could be reclined 180 degrees. Read More "There are myriad concerns when looking at this design, chiefly whether or not passengers would be able to evacuate in 90 seconds," says Mary Kirby, editor of Runway Girl Network aviation news website. The time frame is a regulatory requirement set out by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Kirby adds that the concept also doesn't take passengers with disability into consideration, or pregnant women who might struggle to climb to the top level. Midflight squat But at least with this design passengers will actually be sitting down. Not so much with the so-called saddle seat, another Airbus patent, which would require them to assume a semi-squat position during a flight. The seat, which wouldn't look out of place on a bicycle, has no headrest, with back support also limited. The designers are under no illusion that this would make for a pleasant traveling experience. The patent states that the increase in the number of seats is achieved to the detriment of the comfort of the passengers, but does offer these words of solace: "This remains tolerable for the passengers inasmuch as the flight lasts only one or a few hours." However, it's still a notch up from the fully standing spaces proposed by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary a few years ago. The budget airline's CEO took the no-frills concept to another level by suggesting passengers could be transported to their destination strapped in to a standing position for between $6 and $13. Ryanair seems to have abandoned the idea for now. "We have no plans to trial or introduce standing flights," a spokesperson tells CNN. The nightmare of standing flights is likely a long way off. Even so, we can't stop our imaginations. Eye to eye Those for whom flying means getting lost in a book or film while politely ignoring their neighbors probably won't enjoy the designs from Zodiac Seats France. Its Economy Class Cabin Hexagon consists of a tightly packed jigsaw of alternating backward and forward seats, making it difficult to maintain the number one rule of traveling on any form of public transport -- avoiding eye contact. Not to be outdone, Boeing has filed its share of eccentric patents, such as their "upright sleep support system." Its purpose is to help passengers rest during a flight by letting them lean face-forward into a cushion that has a hole to accommodate eyes, nose and mouth. Another cushion supports the chest and both are deployed from a backpack attached to the seat. Passengers may, however, run the risk of looking like they've overindulged in inflight alcohol. All in your head? If the grim reality of air travel is too much to handle, why not escape your surroundings with the help of a sensory helmet? The Airbus-patented headwear could isolate passengers from sound, sight, smell -- or all three at once -- for a more pleasant and relaxing journey. Presumably this would come in handy if the person in front has lowered the back of their seat and the baby next to you has just had an accident. The science fiction-like helmet would fit in with the company's vision for the airplane of the future, which might look like a donut if Airbus has its way. The patent for its futuristic-shaped aircraft looks like the plane is hoisting the popular pastry on its back, complete with a hole in the middle. According to Airbus, this configuration can fit more passengers and distribute cabin pressure more evenly. JUST WATCHED Would you ride in a 'flying doughnut'? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Would you ride in a 'flying doughnut'? 03:00 (Un)real prospects Fliers can breathe a sigh of relief when it comes to some of the more outlandish patents -- they'll likely never see the light of day. Airbus says that its latest stacked seats design is just one of several hundred they publish each year. "We do this to protect our ideas, but many of these never actually develop beyond concept stages," says Robert Gage, head of media relations for Airbus in the United Kingdom. "This is all part of intellectual property strategy at play -- the seat and aircraft makers are trying to cover themselves for the future, which is unknown, and the regulations of the future which are also unknown," says Mary Kirby. However, Kirby says that airlines' trend toward stripping their service to the bone is pushing the boundaries of what travelers will accept. "Passengers are really starting to get more vocal," she says. "You do wonder when we will reach the tipping point and it gets so uncomfortable that there's going to be serious backlash."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Science Image Source: NASA Space Station astronauts celebrate St. Patrick’s Day with gorgeous night shot of Dublin Mike Wehner @MikeWehner March 17th, 2017 at 6:15 PM Share Tweet Here on Earth, most people celebrate St. Patrick’s Day by heading down to their local watering hole for a pint of Guinness or maybe a couple glasses of green beer. Up on the International Space Station, however, such a thing just isn’t possible, but that doesn’t stop them from recognizing Earthen traditions all the same. NASA Commander Shane Kimbrough and ESA pilot Thomas Pesquet took the opportunity to peer down from their perch some 200-odd miles above the surface to catch a glimpse of the city that is probably partying harder than anyone tonight: Dublin, Ireland. Don't Miss: Yet another new Galaxy S8 feature was uncovered that no iPhone can match “Dublin at night,” Pesquet tweeted, along with a photograph of the sight. “Always a great city to visit with a fantastic atmosphere.” Kimbrough later tweeted his own greeting, saying “Enjoy the #StPatricksFest Parade down there!” Dublin at night. Always a great city to visit, with a fantastic atmosphere 🇮🇪 https://t.co/UHDEIQINjG pic.twitter.com/nbp7AQ9Ofl — Thomas Pesquet (@Thom_astro) February 12, 2017 The photo is absolutely fantastic, and it was snapped at a high enough resolution to make out individual city streets. The center, downtown area is the brightest of all, and is undoubtedly filled with many revelers as the shot was taken. You can view the image in its full resolution on the NASA site here. The International Space Station, which makes about 15 orbits per day around our planet, is potentially nearing the end of its lifespan. It was originally launched in the late 1990s and has seen many repairs and upgrades since then.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday March 21, 2017 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Launceston Airport upgrade begins Zona Black@zeeeblack 18 Mar 2017, noon A $2 million redevelopment will change the way passengers pass through security screening. REVAMP: Artist's impressions show the new boards that could be part of the Launceston Airport departures lounge. Work has begun on the latest development at Launceston Airport. When it is completed, the airport will boast a new security screening area, which the airport’s general manager said will help to improve service punctuality. The $2 million project will see the security screening area moved to sit adjacent to the existing airline check-in desks. The move will mean that passengers will be able to pass through security before entering the dining and shopping area. General manager Paul Hodgen said the relocation would go a long way to easing screening and boarding congestion. “Now, people are waiting for when their plane arrives, and then rush through security, causing congestion,” Mr Hodgen said. “[The new process will] also have punctuality benefits to the airlines.” Mr Hodgen said airport management was also exploring further revamps for its shopping and dining area, which already underwent a transformation last year. He said they were investigating installing departure boards, similar to those in the new domestic terminal at Melbourne’s Tullamarine Airport, which give time indications as to when gates will open for boarding. While work has already begun, passengers won’t notice anything major until the winter months. Mr Hodgen said he expected that the security screening work would take place about August, after the peak season for the airport had passed. Traditionally, airlines tend to drop off any extras services or flights that they may have introduced over summer, around this time of year. However, Mr Hodgen said, some airlines had not only kept the services running, but added more. Virgin Australia, he said, look to be adding additional services on Melbourne and Brisbane routes throughout April, especially around Launceston AFL games, and the V8 Supercars Tasmanian round at Symmons Plains. Qantas is also upgrading some of its services from the smaller Dash 8s to Boeing 717s, to cope with extra traffic on three dates in April. There is more development in store for the airport, with a tender to be awarded shortly for works to upgrade the taxi rank area. The tender for the $2 million development was awarded to Vos Constructions.

Up on the International Space Station, however, such a thing just isn’t possible, but that doesn’t stop them from recognizing Earthen traditions all the same. NASA Commander Shane Kimbrough and ESA pilot Thomas Pesquet took the opportunity to peer down from their perch some 200-odd miles above the surface to catch a glimpse of the city that is probably partying harder than anyone tonight: Dublin, Ireland. Don't Miss: Yet another new Galaxy S8 feature was uncovered that no iPhone can match “Dublin at night,” Pesquet tweeted, along with a photograph of the sight. “Always a great city to visit with a fantastic atmosphere.” Kimbrough later tweeted his own greeting, saying “Enjoy the #StPatricksFest Parade down there!” Dublin at night. Always a great city to visit, with a fantastic atmosphere 🇮🇪 https://t.co/UHDEIQINjG pic.twitter.com/nbp7AQ9Ofl — Thomas Pesquet (@Thom_astro) February 12, 2017 The photo is absolutely fantastic, and it was snapped at a high enough resolution to make out individual city streets. The center, downtown area is the brightest of all, and is undoubtedly filled with many revelers as the shot was taken. You can view the image in its full resolution on the NASA site here. The International Space Station, which makes about 15 orbits per day around our planet, is potentially nearing the end of its lifespan. It was originally launched in the late 1990s and has seen many repairs and upgrades since then. The station’s final days were originally estimated to fall somewhere in 2020, but Boeing, the craft’s principal contractor, has discussed with NASA the possibility of keeping it alive through 2028. The Trump administration’s various cuts to NASA funding could potentially impact that, as could many other factors.

(Photo: Reuters) At least 31 Somali refugees are dead after the boat they were traveling in from Yemen to Sudan was attacked by what might have been a U.S.-made Apache helicopter. International Organization for Migration (IOM) confirmed "dozens of deaths and many dozens of survivors brought to hospitals." A local coastguard officer told Reuters that "the refugees, carrying official [United Nations Refugee Agency] documents, were on their way from Yemen to Sudan when they were attacked by an Apache helicopter near the Bab al-Mandeb strait." If the reports are true, Yemen Peace Project director of policy and advocacy Kate Kizer noted online, the Apache helicopter "likely was U.S. sold, #Saudi manned (last sale last fall)." Refugees reportedly killed by Apache helicopter. If true, likely was US sold, #Saudi manned (last sale last fall): https://t.co/DqOptXFmJo https://t.co/FZLpnh7Qrc — (((Kate Kizer))) (@KateKizer) March 17, 2017 Journalist Samuel Oakford wrote: Local reports suggest attack was carried out by Saudi-led Coalition helicopters. Could be UAE. US also present. https://t.co/5zN258I7T1 — Samuel Oakford (@samueloakford) March 17, 2017 Middle East Eye reported: "Photos from the scene showed bodies of men, women, and children laid out on the ground at a small harbor, covered in pieces of colored fabric." The outlet added: It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack, although the Saudi-led coalition is known to fly Apache helicopters near the strategic Bab al-Mandeb strait, which connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and carries millions of barrels of oil per day. Local news site Aden al-Ghad reported that jets from the Saudi-led coalition—which has led a ground and air campaign against Houthi rebels since March 2015—had "intensified its strikes" in Hudaida on Thursday. "Coalition planes launched dozens of strikes on coastal areas of Hudaida, in support of advances by troops on the ground," a local source told the site, which is known to be opposed to the Houthi rebels. The Guardian further reported: There was no immediate comment from the coalition. Saudi Arabia, which is leading a coalition in the war in Yemen, has U.S.-built Apache A-64 Longbow attack helicopters. The kingdom's Al-Madinah class frigates, one of which was damaged in an attack by a Houthi militia in January, are also capable of carrying a single helicopter. Other naval forces operating in the area are also equipped with helicopters, including the U.S. military. The U.N. Refugee Agency said it was "appalled" by the incident. "As conditions in Yemen deteriorate as a result of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis, refugees and asylum seekers are increasingly fleeing onwards, following established migratory routes, including across the Red Sea to Sudan with the intention of heading onwards to Europe," said agency spokesman William Spindler. "This tragic incident is the latest in which innocent civilians, including Yemenis,  refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants, continue to suffer and disproportionately bear the brunt of the conflict in Yemen." UPI reported Thursday that Boeing just this week "received a $3.2 billion contract modification to support the U.S. Army's foreign military sale of Apache helicopters to Saudi Arabia." The U.S. has already sold dozens of Apaches to Saudi Arabia, along with billions in additional arms. On Tuesday, Amnesty International urged the Trump administration to halt future sales immediately.

Steve Stockman (R-TX) received significant business support, despite a record of far-far-right extremism. Then-Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) at a 2014 hearing. CREDIT: CSPAN2 As a Newt Gingrich revolutionary in 1995–1996, freshman Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) earned the moniker “Congressman Clueless” from Texas Monthly. The magazine noted that his “harebrained ideas and headline-making gaffes have made him the laughingstock of his own party.” After losing re-election, he returned to Congress in 2013 and proceeded to again provide a non-stop barrage of extremist comments. Still, business PACs showered him with tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. On Thursday, Stockman was arraigned in federal court on felony charges of conspiring to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars in charitable donations for his own personal use. Told by the presiding judge that he would need to have counsel by 2 p.m. on Friday, Stockman observed, “I’ll have to hustle with that.” “Yeah, you will,” the judge responded. “These are serious charges.” Stockman’s first term in Congress was notable for his headline-grabbing claim that the federal government “executed” Branch Davidian cult members who actually died after cult leader David Koresh set his compound ablaze rather than surrendering to the FBI. “These men, women and children were burned to death because they owned guns that the government did not wish them to have,” Stockman wrote in Guns and Ammo magazine. He also authored a 1995 bill to force an investigation into whether Alfred Kinsey’s landmark 1948 and 1953 reports on human sexuality “are erroneous, wrongfully obtained by reason of fraud or criminal wrongdoing… or both.” The NRA endorsed Stockman in 2012. CREDIT: Steve Stockman 2012 campaign blog. When he ran again in 2012, he had not moderated at all. He boasted of endorsements from some of the most far-right fringe members of the GOP and the Constitution Party including Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and Louie Gohmert (R-TX), the Gun Owners of America, Ted Nugent, and Citizens United — but also “mainstream” organizations like the National Rifle Association. The National Federation of Independent Business even spent a few hundred dollars in support of his candidacy. Once again, his extremism was on immediate display after he was re-elected. He brought Ted Nugent as his guest to the president’s State of the Union address. He mocked climate science as “global wobbling” and “the new fad thing.” He mocked a female colleague’s outfit. He said that people on food stamps are too self-indulgent to buy healthy meals, told a reporter that if he admitted he likes ceramics the public would “think I’m a fag for sure,” and tweeted that the Boston Marathon bomber “though [sic] he could escape in a backyard boat after hearing Gore speak on global warming.” He claimed that Obama was “trying to flood Texas with illegals to make it into a blue state.” Though he again became a national laughingstock over his second term in the House, that didn’t stop Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Halliburton, and Phillips 66, Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the National Association of Realtors, AT&T, Comcast, Bayer, Boeing and Lockeed Martin, Altria, and a host of other corporations from kicking in $1,000 or more in PAC contributions toward what they likely assumed was his re-election. In December 2013, he unexpectedly opted against seeking re-election and challenged Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) in a quixotic and unsuccessful GOP primary. Since his overwhelming 2014 defeat, Stockman has continued to demonstrate his judgment in full view of the world: Now, if convicted, he could face time in federal prison. And the corporate PACs that bankrolled his political career will likely take no responsibility for their role in putting him and many more who share his fringe ideology into public office.

Global warming due to air pollution has become a major issue due to various gasses emitted by different modes of transport. Scientists around the world are working towards solving this issue. Such pollution levels are a constant threat for civilization and so big names like NASA are working towards a greener future generation. NASA’s recent study showed that jet planes powered by biofuels emit up to 50-70 percent less pollution; helping to progress towards less polluted air travel. Pollution caused by Jet Engine Emissions Typically, laymen believe that emissions of jet engines causes such humongous level of pollution. However, the truth is not limited to just the emissions; but also includes pollution caused by the condensation trails. To explain it in a simpler way; soot particles emit out of the engine along with the water vapor; which forms ice crystals at such high altitudes. The long and white trails of ice crystal concentrations; seen in the skies are a result of this. Moreover, it takes time to dissipate; thereby forming cirrus clouds in the layers of atmosphere. The fur type white clouds that you witness from an air plane is actually a blanket of such cirrus clouds; adding up to the global warming by increasing temperature in the air by 10 degree Celsius, beneath these clouds. Since it is said that biofuels decrease the formation of such contrails; it can help reduce the levels of global warming considerably. Study on Biofuel emissions by NASA Journal Nature published the study and findings by NASA and its team of researchers. According to reports, NASA has created a strong team by gathering researchers from Canada and Germany. As a matter of fact, jet engines emit almost 800 million tons of CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) in the atmosphere, during the course of travel. This damages the layers of the atmosphere at unimaginable levels. NASA reportedly carried out various tests to address these issues; out of which biofuels and their usage in jet engines showed positive results. The tests were done at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Center, in California. A DC-8 was flown out of Armstrong Flight Center by NASA which used different fuels for each trip. The DC-8 was surrounded by three planes at the distances of around 250 meters; which monitored it and collected samples of the exhaust fuel for testing. This fuel is made of a mixture of hydro-processed esters and fatty acids extracted from camelina plant oil. The series of tests showing positive results was a part of ACCESS – Alternative Fuel Effects on Contrails and Cruise Emissions Study. NASA working towards the Future of Biofuels At the Sea-Tac, Boeing, Alaska Airlines and Port of Seattle have partnered to work towards the availability of Biofuel for almost every flight. On the other hand, NASA and its team of researchers will continue their studies in the direction of developing Biofuel for jet engines and different aircrafts. Undoubtedly Biofuel has many potential benefits, but it’s still a long way to be able to see its usage on a regular basis.

The proposals were part of a $30 billion supplemental request to Congress to add more money to the Pentagon's budget during the government's ongoing fiscal year, which began under the Obama administration and ends in September.It includes plans to crank up U.S. funding for the fight against Islamic State militants for items like high-tech bombs and defences against insurgents' drones, bringing overall spending on the campaign to the highest level yet, the Pentagon said."This will likely be our largest request," Roth said.One analyst called the $2 billion flexible spending request a Pentagon "slush fund," and many lawmakers were expected to be reluctant to loosen oversight over how the Pentagon spends money.What Trump's additional funding might mean for America's evolving war strategy against Islamic State in the coming months was not immediately clear. But the request comes as U.S.-backed forces in Iraq and Syria are entering a critical phase in their campaign to retake Islamic State's two biggest cities of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. Trump's administration is weighing deployment of more U.S. troops.The heads of the top U.S. congressional committees that oversee the Pentagon have criticized Trump's 2018 budget request, saying even more money was needed."It is clear to virtually everyone that we have cut our military too much and that it has suffered enormous damage," said Republican Representative Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee. Todd Harrison at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington questioned whether Trump's budget wish list could muster enough support among Democrats, whose votes would be needed to sign off on the spending bills given the slim Republican hold on the Senate. MORE CASH FOR GUANTANAMO Trump said during the election campaign that he not only wanted to keep the Guantanamo Bay detention centre open but "load it up with some bad dudes."Trump's $5.1 billion "overseas contingency operations" request included a provision for $1.1 billion in additional funds for a range of Pentagon projects, including "planning and design of construction projects in support of Detention Operations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."The prison, which was opened by Republican President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. Obama reduced the inmate population to 41, but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail.The 2017 request would also hike spending for the broader Defense Department over the next six months, with $24.9 billion more sought to "readiness needs" after years of complaints over congressionally imposed spending caps.Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of that proposal. Some $13.5 billion would be spent on more military hardware, including five F-35 warplanes as well as Army Blackhawk helicopters made by Sikorsky Aircraft, a Lockheed subsidiary. Trump also wants 12 interceptors for the THAAD missile defence system. The United States is now deploying THAAD in South Korea in response to North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear tests.Boeing (BA.N) would also gain with $2.4 billion for an additional 24 of its F/A-18 E/F jet fighters. A further $7.2 billion would pay for things like military training, cyber and intelligence capabilities and support for weapons systems.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights Aviation "geek" lists five places worth a visit Chuck Yeager of "Right Stuff" fame parties at Edwards AFB Arizona's Boneyard: Where military planes go to die Seattle has first jet-powered Air Force One, last Concorde (CNN)I'm not an aviation geek. Am I? The other day, somebody asked me which five aviation destinations I'd like to check off my bucket list. Like millions of others, I've already hit some of the must-see stunners: the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum and Pensacola's Naval Aviation Museum, Ohio's National Museum of the USAF and Patriot's Point in Charleston, South Carolina. Here's the thing -- aviation museums and other sites let us mere mortals approach the impossible. We get to see, and sometimes touch, historic artifacts that were designed to move at blazing fast speeds. For most of us, it's the closest we can come to catching a lightning bolt. Some of the most complicated and formerly top secret machines ever imagined have become monuments to motion in communities across America. The places where these machines were born and pushed to their limits have become hallowed ground. How can you not want to check them out? Read More How can you NOT want to sit inside the supersonic airliner that made the last flight of the Concorde? Or see the spy plane dubbed the world's fastest "air-breathing" production aircraft? Or fly over the "boneyard" where military aircraft go to die? Or hang out where the "Right Stuff" flyboys risked death to break the sound barrier? Hmmm ... this all doesn't sound too geeky. Does it? For the record, I'm offering three possible signs you may be an aviation geek: 1. The photo snap. When I'm at the airport waiting to board, I often will snap a photo of my airliner through the gate window. I still don't know exactly why I do that. Maybe it's because every aircraft is unique. They come off the assembly line after years -- sometimes decades -- of painstaking research and development. Then, each one gets a tracking number and is closely followed throughout its career. There are apps and websites dedicated to tracking commercial airliners. Here's one that tracks aircraft flown by Delta Air Lines and dozens of other carriers. 2. ID please. When I board a plane, I look at the ID information engraved inside the aircraft door. Often times, etched into that metal plate, is the aircraft model and its date of birth. Great, now I know how old my plane is. Essential information. Oops, I'm holding up the line to board because I'm staring at the edge of the door. Sorry. That's not really that geeky. Is it? 3. Watch 'n' gawk. Finally, don't tell anybody, but I've been known to visit small airports just to watch planes take off and land. This kind of behavior might be considered unusual, especially by those working in law enforcement. And now for the five must-sees: Aerospace capital One place I've been meaning to get to for a while now is Edwards Air Force Base in California. The region around Edwards is kind of a magnet for aviation geeks. Some folks call it America's aerospace capital. In the high desert about an hour's drive north of Los Angeles, the area is packed full of aviation history. It's a world punctuated by the occasional sonic boom, where some of America's most sophisticated and secret aircraft were developed including the stealthy F-117 Nighthawk, the F-104 Starfighter and the spy planes U-2 Dragon Lady and SR-71 Blackbird. But most of all, the skies over Edwards became a deadly crucible that forged test-pilot greats such as Chuck Yeager. For the few who don't know, Yeager's the first human to fly above Mach 1, the speed of sound. "We'd been working our tail off on the airplane," Yeager told me during a phone interview. "When we did get it above Mach 1, obviously it made us very happy because we'd done something the rest of the world had been trying to do for years." Yeager pulls no punches about space travel But Yeager and his team were ordered to keep the news quiet. Don't celebrate, they were told. It's classified. After the word leaked, "we started to celebrate somewhat," enjoying good times at a local test pilot watering hole. The Happy Bottom Riding Club and its owner, a woman stunt pilot named Pancho Barnes, gained fame in the film "The Right Stuff." Six decades later, the celebrating continues at Happy Bottom -- at least at what's left of it. Destroyed by fire long ago, Yeager showed up at the building's ruins recently for an annual party thrown by locals to honor Pancho and the Cold War test pilots. "They fix it all up and get some platforms and have a barbecue and most of the base comes out," Yeager said. "You go out there and you look at the swimming pool and you think back over the years and you think about Pancho and her husband, Mac McKendry, and some of the people who used to come out there. When I was flying the X-1, I was only getting $260 a month. The way we looked at it, duty was our guideline. That's the way we all flew in the military." See Yeager at Happy Bottom Visitors at Edwards are not allowed access to the Happy Bottom ruins, a base spokesman said. But free tours of other areas of the base are available -- by appointment only -- twice a month. Highlights include the Air Force Flight Test Center Museum, the food court and gift shop at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center and a "windshield tour" near the flight line where F-16s, KC-135s, F-22s, F-35s, B-1s or C-17s might be visible, said the spokesman. The Air Force Flight Test Center Museum features a full size replica of Yeager's plane (the real one hangs in the Smithsonian) and actual aircraft that made the region famous. In nearby Palmdale, locally developed and tested aviation gems can be found at The Joe Davies Heritage Airpark. Then there's the dream factory of aviation geeks: Skunk Works. It's the official nickname of Lockheed Martin's Advanced Development Programs. Entire books have been written about this facility, which gave birth to the Blackbird and other historic aircraft. Nowadays, behind Skunk Works' highly secure perimeter, engineers reportedly are working on the aviation wonders of tomorrow, including a lightweight cargo plane called the X-55A and a bizarre, blimp-like airship called the P-791 Hybrid Air Vehicle, which has special technology that allows it to take off and land just about anywhere. Check it out here No public tours are available, but aerospace blogger Steve Harris posted some juicy details about his private visit to Skunk Works. For those who can't get in, Harris told me he only got to see "about 15 or 20 percent of what they could show us. Everything else is something that we don't even know exists." Outside the property, you can see Skunk Works' "big, giant, white, box-of-a-building" easily. The Skunk Works small gift shop is open to the public about a mile or so down the road. Geeky? Perhaps. Boneyard Next, I'd have to travel from the birthplace of aviation icons to the place where they go to die. That would be a hunk of desert near Tucson, Arizona, known as "The Boneyard." The Air Force calls it 309 AMARG -- The 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (formerly known as AMARC). It's basically the Pentagon's 2,600-acre parking lot for about 5,000 retired military aircraft. It's sort of like a classic-car junkyard where all the town gearheads want to hang out and pull parts for their customized vehicles. The place where dead airplanes come back to life Access to this place is restricted, but nearby Pima Air & Space Museum offers tours of the Boneyard and -- for geeks with deep pockets -- several companies at Tucson's airport sell scenic Boneyard flyovers, says Chris Slack, who runs Boneyard website amarcExperience.com. Geek bonus: The Boneyard served as a scene location for the 2009 film "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen." I'd definitely hit Pima Air & Space, by the way. It's got 300 choice aircraft -- like several Soviet-designed MiG fighter jets, a Blackbird and an F-111 Aardvark, the first Air Force jet with "swing wings." Fast and last Seattle's Museum of Flight has some real beauties, including a unique Blackbird variant called the M-21. This particular Blackbird was able to launch unpiloted drones that were used for independent intelligence gathering. Geek trivia: Although it was developed in the 1960s, the Blackbird still holds the record as the fastest "air-breathing" jet plane in history with a velocity more than 2,100 mph, three times the speed of sound. What else does the Museum of Flight have? Something for aviation geeks AND politics geeks: a Boeing 707-200 that served as the first jet-powered Air Force One. This is kinda cool: parked outside the museum is the last supersonic Concorde jetliner to make a commercial flight. It's really not that geeky -- OK? This thing is the world's fastest jetliner for God's sake. We're talking about cruise speeds above 1,000 mph, compared with regular airliners, like Boeing's new 787, that poke along at under 600 mph. Tail-dragger Here's something a suspected aviation geek could do during a quick layover at Dallas-Fort Worth International: check out a painstakingly restored 72-year-old DC-3 airliner. The Flagship Knoxville, the shiny silver centerpiece of American Airlines' C.R. Smith Museum, is about a 10-minute cab ride south of DFW. As everyone who's boarded one knows, the DC-3 is a tail-dragger. The plane's tail is designed to sit on the ground, so when you step aboard the aircraft you find yourself on a steep incline. It reminds you how far commercial aviation has come. Meal carts? Nah, not for DC-3 "stewardesses." They carried meal trays one-by-one to each of the plane's 21 passengers. That must have been fun during turbulence. Hands-on More old-school aviation geekiness: I need to visit Florida's Fantasy of Flight, about 45 minutes southwest of Orlando. This place features World War I and II-era aircraft, and its website says it's the only attraction in the world that offers daily aerial demonstrations. For a price, pilots will take passengers for short flights on vintage aircraft. Not daring enough? For daredevils, a pilot will take you up in a Boeing Stearman PT-17, which has duel controls. The pilot will let you take the controls and fly the plane. Am I interested? Um, yes please. Geeky? So what. Sign me up.
