Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. (Wade Spees/The Post And Courier via AP) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant have rejected an effort to unionize, maintaining Southern reluctance toward unionization and setting up a picture-perfect stop for President Donald Trump, who visits the facilities this week. Vote totals weren't immediately available Wednesday, but the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers' lead organizer said it's "the workers who dictate what happens next." National Labor Relations Board rules require workers wait a year before another union vote. Wednesday's balloting came just two days before Trump was slated to make the first visit by a sitting president to the sprawling North Charleston complex, where Boeing makes the 787 Dreamliner. On Friday, Trump is coming to town for the rollout of the first 787-10 model. The presidential visit marks a photo finish for Boeing, which for weeks vigorously campaigned against the Machinists' effort. Billboards, radio and television ads blanketed the Charleston area, arguing to employees why they should not surrender their rights to the union. In its campaign, Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized — a tactic that often surfaces when collective bargaining efforts arise — perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. Trump himself engaged with the company during the presidential campaign, blasting Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the union would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold in the state. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in the state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

THE DAY AHEAD Home construction, jobless benefits, mortgage rates WASHINGTON (AP) — The Commerce Department reports on U.S. home construction in January. The Labor Department will report on the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits last week. Freddie Mac reports on this week’s average U.S. mortgage rates. It will also issue quarterly results before the opening of trading on Wall Street. TRUMP-LABOR SECRETARY Puzder withdraws nomination to be Trump’s labor secretary WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s nominee for labor secretary abruptly withdrew his nomination Wednesday after Senate Republicans balked at supporting him, in part over taxes he belatedly paid on a former housekeeper not authorized to work in the United States. Fast-food executive Andrew Puzder issued a short statement abandoning the effort, saying he was “honored to have been considered by President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Labor.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer declined to comment on possible replacements, but said late Wednesday that the White House had seen the writing on the wall. Labor groups and advocates had criticized Puzder’s comments about replacing fast-food workers with robots and his opposition to significant wage hikes. But industry executives and franchisees saw him as a figure who would have championed their interests in the government. BOEING-UNION VOTE Boeing workers maintain South’s anti-unionization history NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing’s South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren’t immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker’s campus. YELLEN-CONGRESS Yellen defends Fed independence, banking regulations WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen defended the central bank’s independence Wednesday from Republican lawmakers who are pushing for major changes in how the central bank operates and how regulators oversee the nation’s banking system. During a hearing that stretched over four hours, GOP lawmakers repeatedly challenged Yellen’s handling of the economy and her leadership in implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, a measure that President Donald Trump and Republicans have vowed to overhaul. On monetary policy, Yellen repeated the testimony she delivered on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee. She indicated that the Fed, which has implemented two modest quarter-point interest rate hikes over the past two years, is likely to accelerate increases this year if the labor market remains healthy and inflation continues to move toward the Fed’s 2 percent target. RETAILERS-TRUMP Trump tells retail CEOs people will ‘love’ his tax plan WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump met Wednesday with the CEOs of large retailers like Target and Best Buy, who have a built-in concern: They’re worried about a possible border tax on imported goods. The president has provided scant details about his own tax overhaul, but said people will “love” his planned tax reforms. He assured retail CEOs Wednesday that tax rates would be lowered and simplified in a “massive” plan that “will be submitted in the not too distant future.” Retailers called the hourlong meeting positive and productive, though they offered few details. HEALTH CARE SPENDING US report: Trend of rising health care spending back to stay WASHINGTON (AP) — Government experts say the nation’s problem with rising health care spending is back and here to stay. Wednesday’s report from nonpartisan experts at Health and Human Services concludes that health care spending will claim a growing share of national resources for the foreseeable future, regardless of what President Donald Trump and Congress do with the Obama-era health law. Health care will grow at an annual average of 5.6 percent from 2016-2025, outpacing expected economic growth. Now $3.5 trillion, the nation’s health care tab will increase to nearly $5.5 trillion in 2025, accounting for about one-fifth of the economy. That puts a squeeze on other priorities, such as infrastructure improvement. Accelerating spending is due to fundamentals such as rising prices for treatments and services, as well as an aging population. INSURERS-COLLAPSING DEALS No Valentine’s Day love: 2 big insurance deals appear off UNDATED (AP) — It was a rough Valentine’s Day for the U.S. health insurance industry. One giant merger was abandoned, another is threatened by infighting, and a major insurer announced it will stop selling coverage on public exchanges in 11 states. Both merger deals had already been rejected by federal regulators and judges, but the companies were considering appeals to those decisions. Now they both appear to be off. Aetna said it was abandoning its planned $34 billion purchase of Medicare Advantage provider Humana early Tuesday. Then, later in the day, Cigna said it is suing Anthem to kill a $48 billion acquisition bid. The collapse of one deal and the uncertain future of the other could hurt shoppers on the exchanges next year by leaving them with even fewer options and potentially higher prices. MARTIN SHKRELI-HARVARD Fire alarm, protests disrupt ex-pharma exec Shkreli’s talk CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — A fire alarm and student protests have disrupted indicted former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli’s (SHKREL’-eez) appearance at Harvard University. The former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals was invited by the Harvard Financial Analysts Club to discuss investing at the Wednesday night event. But a few minutes before it started, someone pulled a fire alarm and police evacuated the building. When the event did begin, protesters kept interrupting Shkreli’s presentation, chanting and calling him names before walking out. Shkreli was criticized after his company purchased a drug used by AIDS and cancer patients to fight parasitic infections and hiked up the price. He’s free on $5 million bail pending his federal securities fraud trial in an unrelated case. He has pleaded not guilty. Shkreli also is scheduled to speak Thursday at UMass-Boston. YAHOO-CYBERSECURITY Yahoo issues new security warning to users LONDON (AP) — Yahoo is warning users of potentially malicious activity on their accounts between 2015 and 2016. It’s the latest development in the internet company’s investigation of a mega-breach that exposed 1 billion users’ data several years ago. It’s not clear how many users were affected by the malicious activity, which involved the use of forged cookies — strings of data which can be used to allow people to access online accounts without re-entering their passwords. Yahoo said in a statement issued Wednesday that its investigation “has identified user accounts for which we believe forged cookies were taken or used. Yahoo is in the process of notifying all potentially affected account holders.” The company declined to say how many people were potentially affected. AMERICAN GIRL-BOY DOLL American Girl to sell its first-ever boy doll NEW YORK (AP) — For the first time in its more than 30-year history, American Girl will sell a boy version of its pricey dolls. The 18-inch “Logan Everett” doll will go on sale this week. American Girl, which is owned by Barbie maker Mattel Inc., says Logan is a drummer and will come with a doll-sized drum kit. It’s the latest move by Mattel to be more relevant to iPad-playing kids and their parents. A boy appeared in a Barbie commercial for the first time two years ago. And Barbie got a major makeover last year, giving the iconic doll several ethnicities and body shapes. To boost sales, Mattel began selling American Girl dolls in Toys R Us stores late last year. Sales of the brand rose 4 percent during the last three months of 2016.

NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. >> Production workers at Boeing’s South Carolina plant voted today not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren’t immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. “Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next,” Evans said. “We’ve been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better.” The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker’s campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states’ lack of union presence, it’d it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state’s minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. “It is an economic development tool,” Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. “We’ll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina.” At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren’t unionized or haven’t experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers’ efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company’s board of directors, Hirsch said. “Boeing is very, very different,” Hirsch said. “No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union.” Boeing didn’t threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. “Costs are out of control,” Trump tweeted in early December. “Cancel order!” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina’s former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina’s labor department, the governor played up Templeton’s union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to “fight the unions” at Boeing. “They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can’t deliver it,” Templeton said. Asked earlier today about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn’t feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. “I think we’re doing just fine without a union presence,” he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump’s visit, the first by a sitting president to the company’s North Charleston facilities. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event,” she said.

Photographer: Bryan R. Smith/Pool via Bloomberg Days before taking office, President-elect Donald Trump made two surprise calls to the Air Force general managing the Pentagon’s largest weapons program, the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 jet. Listening in on one of those calls was Dennis Muilenburg -- the CEO of Lockheed’s chief rival, Boeing Co. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the $379 billion F-35 program as “out of control,” made the highly unusual calls to Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan on Jan. 9 and Jan. 17, according to two people familiar with the matter. Muilenburg, whose company makes a fighter jet Trump has suggested might replace some of one F-35 model, was in the president-elect’s New York office for a meeting during the second call. He appeared caught off-guard but heard at least Trump’s end of the call, according to the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing sensitive information. After speaking with Trump, Bogdan wrote two three-page memos, titled “phone conversations with President-Elect,” dated Jan. 10 and 18th and stamped “For Official Use Only,” to limit distribution. They outlined Trump’s questions about the capabilities of Boeing’s Super Hornet fighter and how it might compete against Lockheed’s F-35C, said the people. About a dozen Pentagon officials were alerted to the calls after they occurred, the people said. ‘It Creates Chaos’ Since winning election, Trump has stressed his experience in real estate as evidence he can get taxpayers a better deal on expensive Pentagon programs. Boeing, too, faced Trump’s wrath when he criticized potential spending on a new version of the Air Force One presidential airplane. But Trump’s calls to a uniformed program manager to discuss a contract that was competed 16 years ago were unprecedented and potentially disruptive, said a defense analyst. “When a president ignores the chain of command by going directly to a program manager, it creates chaos in the system,” said Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute in Arlington, Virginia, who’s followed the F-35 program since Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contract in October 2001. “Behavior that looks decisive in the business world can unhinge a military organization that depends on order and discipline,” said Thompson, who also consults for Lockheed. Following his Jan. 17 meeting with Trump, Muilenburg said he “made some great progress” in his talks with the president-elect. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters at Trump Tower in New York. Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an e-mail, “I have nothing to add to what Mr. Muilenburg said to reporters after” his Trump Tower meeting on the 17th. Congressional Hearing Lockheed declined to comment. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Bogdan’s spokesman, Joe DellaVedova, declined to answer any questions about the calls or provide the memos, which Bloomberg has requested under the Freedom of Information Act. Bogdan may be asked about the calls when he testifies on the F-35 program Thursday before a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee. He first met Trump Dec. 21 at his Palm Beach resort during an official visit by 11 military officers. Trump has shaken the defense industry -- and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice -- with his frequent Twitter posts about business issues ranging from the F-35 to sales of his daughter Ivanka’s brand at Nordstrom Inc. stores. Trump’s phone calls to the Pentagon came after a December tweet: “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Different Capabilities There’s probably not much Boeing could do to make its jet comparable to the F-35. The two aircraft have different capabilities and mission requirements. Moreover, in an effort to drive the fighter’s costs down, the F-35 has been marketed to allies around the world, with production and maintenance contracts spread from the U.K. to Australia. The U.S. Air Force, which plans to buy 1,763 of the F-35A model jets, would not fly Boeing’s minimally stealthy “fourth-generation” Super Hornet, which is designed for aircraft carrier operations. As a so-called fifth-generation fighter, the F-35 is stealthier and is equipped with more advanced radar, sensors and communications systems. Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up The Navy version of the F-35 is easier to target because it’s not scheduled to be operational until August 2018 at the earliest. The service plans to buy only 260 carrier models of the plane; the Marine Corps will buy 80 of the Navy model and 340 of a version capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings, according to the Congressional Research Service. Lockheed has delivered 26 of the Navy jets to date, with four more on order, according to spokesman Mike Rein. Pentagon Review Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said in an e-mail that “Trump seems to really like interfering in the requirements process” but “hopefully, he realizes that the Super Hornet/F-35 battle only impacts a very small part of the F-35 program.” Nevertheless, Trump is not the first person to suggest that the F/A-18E/F could replace some F-35s. The Pentagon’s first Quadrennial Defense Review in May 1997 said that “should Joint Strike Fighter development be delayed additional F/A-18E/Fs” beyond planned quantities “may be added later as appropriate to sustain planned forces.” Defense Secretary James Mattis in a memo last month translated Trump’s tweet into action when he asked Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work to oversee a review that “compares F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assesses the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements (an advanced Super Hornet) can be made in order to provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative.” Under current plans, the Pentagon is scheduled to increase overall purchases of the F-35 in the coming fiscal year to 70 from 63 this year. Purchases would grow to 80 aircraft in fiscal 2019, and there’s a pending “block buy” of 450 aircraft after that. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Picture: REUTERS Chicago/Dallas/Washington — After a rocky start, Boeing CE Dennis Muilenburg appears to have gained the ear of President Donald Trump. The US aircraft manufacturer was among Trump’s first post-election corporate targets, and a tweet about soaring Air Force One costs briefly tanked the firm’s shares in December. But the Twitter tirade also gave Muilenburg an opening to press the case of the largest US exporter — and the 1.5-million jobs at its jet-equipment suppliers — in meetings with Trump. The CE’s entreaties seem to have worked. Trump has emerged as a booster for Boeing’s F/A-18 fighter jets and voiced support to legislators for a key Boeing initiative: reopening the US Export-Import Bank for major deals. Trump will attend an event at Boeing’s South Carolina factory on Friday showcasing the newest 787 Dreamliner where he is expected to make an announcement about the federal export credit agency. "The supply chain for Boeing doesn’t just run through the state of Washington," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies. The Ex-Im Bank is "a door opener". Donald Trump tweet reignites the Boeing vs Lockheed dogfight Supporting the lender would put Trump at odds with some Republicans, who view the bank as providing corporate welfare. Boeing Bank Ex-Im has been dubbed the "Bank of Boeing" for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by airlines unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it has been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10m because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a Senate committee since 2015. Trump was committed to re-establishing a quorum on the bank’s board, US Senator Heidi Heitkamp said. That is needed to allow the bank to lend more as it faces a backlog of as much as $30bn in projects. Boeing and General Electric have argued without the financing, they would face a competitive disadvantage against companies in Europe, Canada, Brazil, China and Russia, who do not face similar restrictions. Boeing had lost or faced delays on three commercial satellite sales because of the lack of export credit, said Kate Bernard, a spokeswoman for the manufacturer.

Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

By DougCameron Workers at Boeing Co.’s large plane-making facility in South Carolina on Wednesday voted against joining a union in a move that could affect where the company manufactures future aircraft models. Seventy-four percent of the nearly 3,000 hourly staff at Boeing’s plants around Charleston, which assemble 787 Dreamliner jets and other parts, voted not to recognize the International Association of Machinists, Boeing BA, +0.47%   said in a statement. The hard-fought campaign drew criticism from both sides for the tactics employed to sway workers. The Charleston plants are the sole assembly facility for the new 787-10, the largest member of the Dreamliner family, which is set to be rolled out Friday at a ceremony attended by President Donald Trump.

According to a company statement, more than 2,000 of the nearly 3,000 Boeing workers at the plant eligible to vote in the closely watched election voted against the union, and only a bit more than 700 members voted yes. "We will continue to move forward as one team," said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina. "We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team." Manufacturers have been drawn to the South because the region is strongly anti-union. Less than 2% of South Carolina workers are union members, the lowest unionization rate in the nation. Boeing (BA) spent billions to open its North Charleston plant, arguing it needs to assure customers who buy the 787 Dreamliner, which is built there, that the plant wouldn't go on strike. Related: Trump move on Iran could cost jobs at Boeing A win would have given the Machinists, who represent most Boeing factory workers, even more leverage over Boeing in future labor talks. The loss could further encourage other manufacturers to open union-free plants in the South. The vote was seen as an uphill battle for the union, which dropped plans for a vote last year. About 40% to 50% of organizing votes fail. "Boeing management spent a lot of money to make sure power and profits remained concentrated at the very top," said Mike Evans, the union's chief organizer. The union will now have to wait at least a year to petition for another representation vote. "The IAM remains committed to getting Boeing South Carolina workers the respect, wages and consistency they deserve." Boeing's South Carolina assembly line, where workers voted Wednesday not to join the Machinist union. The plant will get additional attention this week as President Donald Trump plans to visit the plant Friday to mark the completion of the first 787-10, the newest version of the Dreamliner. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," said Robinson-Berry. Wages were a key issue in the vote. The union says South Carolina workers earn about $10 an hour less than union members at Boeing's Washington state plants. Related: Boeing pitches China facility as Trump-friendly For its part, Boeing says pay scales are driven by wages in the local market, and that the South Carolina plant already pays better than a union-represented Boeing plant in Alabama.

Results of a vote released Wednesday show workers have rejected union representation. Bruce Smith/AP Updated 10 p.m. ET The International Association of Machinists says workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant have voted not to unionize. In a video on the union's Facebook page, lead organizer Mike Evans says the workers have decided "at this time they don't need representation," and he says the IAM respects the process. He tells workers that the company should "pay attention to your issues and make Boeing a better place, not just for a few, but for everybody." Boeing released a statement saying that 74 percent of employees who voted rejected the union, adding: ""We will continue to move forward as one team," said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of BSC. "We have a bright future ahead of us and we're eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team and to developing new opportunities. "Friday we will mark the most recent incredible accomplishment in the proud history of the BSC team with the rollout of the first 787-10," said Robinson-Berry. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event." President Trump is expected to visit the plant on Friday for that event.

The IAM reports it represents 35,000 workers at 24 Boeing locations around the country." "The state has the lowest union membership rate in the country," Alexandra reported for NPR's All Things Considered. "Around Charleston, Boeing [had] billboards, T-shirts and ads criticizing the IAM.

An artist’s conception shows NASA’s Orion capsule in flight. (NASA Illustration) NASA and its commercial partners say they’re studying the possibility of sending astronauts beyond the moon years earlier than planned, by putting a crew on the first flight of the space agency’s heavy-lift Space Launch System. The NASA study, sparked in part by a desire for the Trump administration to do something dramatic in space during its first term, would consider whether such a flight could occur in 2019 or 2020. The current plan calls for an uncrewed test flight of the SLS and NASA’s Orion capsule in late 2018, known as Exploration Mission-1 or EM-1. That mission would followed by a crewed test flight called EM-2 in the 2021-2023 time frame. In a statement, NASA said acting administrator Robert Lightfoot asked Bill Gerstenmaier, the agency’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations, to assess whether the first crew could ride on EM-1 instead of EM-2. “The study will examine the opportunities it could present to accelerate the effort of the first crewed flight and what it would take to accomplish that first step of pushing humans farther into space,” NASA said. Gerstenmaier discussed the study with NASA’s commercial Orion/SLS partners at a conference today in Washington, D.C. NASA representatives declined to specify how long the study would take, but some of the reports that emerged after Gerstenmaier’s talk suggested a 30-day time frame. Boeing, Lockheed Martin on board EM-1’s current mission plan calls for sending the Orion capsule on a trajectory beyond the moon, most likely into lunar orbit, and then back to Earth. No lunar landing would be attempted. The trip would be similar to Apollo 8’s “Earthrise” mission in 1968. The current plan calls for EM-2 to go beyond the moon as well. The revised plan would force NASA and its partners to ensure that EM-1 had all the safety and life support features required for human spaceflight. That’s why EM-1 would have to fly somewhat later that currently planned. The crewed Orion/SLS flight would mark the first trip for humans beyond Earth orbit since NASA’s last Apollo moon mission in 1972. There’s another historical angle if the round-the-moon flight were to take place in 2019, in that it would come during the golden anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, NASA’s two main commercial partners in the multibillion-dollar Orion/SLS program, both said they’d look into accelerating their schedules. Boeing is the prime contractor for the SLS rocket, while Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor for the Orion crew capsule. “The possibility of NASA accelerating the timeline to put humans into the vicinity of the moon and onto Mars is exciting,” Boeing spokeswoman Kelly Kaplan said in an email. “Safety of the crew is most important, so of course there will be many factors we will consider as we assess the feasibility of adding crew to EM-1. We applaud NASA’s bold path forward in this transition time, and we’re proud to be a part of the journey to Mars.” Lockheed Martin is also on board with the study, said Allison Miller, a spokeswoman for the company’s Orion program. “We’ll look at accelerating remaining crew system designs, as well as potential technical and schedule challenges and how to mitigate them,” she said in an email. Trump’s space strategy Word of the potential schedule shift comes after weeks of speculation over how President Donald Trump and his advisers might change the focus of the nation’s space program. Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, had initially set NASA’s sights on sending astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid in the mid-2020s, followed by trips to Mars and its moons in the 2030s. Those plans have morphed over the years, and at the same time, billionaire-backed commercial ventures such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin have upped the ante. Last fall, Musk unveiled plans to send settlers to Mars in the 2020s, and Blue Origin executives said their long-term vision for spaceflight included trips to the moon and Mars as well. Some of Trump’s advisers reportedly pressed for an accelerated campaign to send astronauts on trips around the moon, and put commercial robotic landers on the moon’s surface, by 2020. One scenario even called for an “internal competition” between NASA’s traditional industrial partners and more recent market entrants such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.

Lightfoot is serving in a caretaker role – but he is regarded as one of the prospects for the official appointment, along with U.S. Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla. Speeding up the schedule for sending astronauts beyond Earth orbit carries significant risks. It would be highly unusual for humans to get on board for the first test launch of a new type of rocket. Contractors would have to shorten their time frame for testing the hardware needed for crewed flight, ranging from launch abort systems to life support systems. Keith Cowing, a former NASA employee who now runs the independent NASA Watch website, said in a posting that the schedule speed-up looked like a “Hail Mary pass” for the expensive SLS program. “To move this rather important milestone up now in the midst of dueling and ever-shifting policy directions – for no clearly articulated reason other than politics – starts to smell like launch fever to me,” he wrote.

On Wednesday, Boeing production workers will vote on whether to join the Machinists union. Bruce Smith AP/File photo i The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Workers at a Boeing plant in South Carolina have rejected an effort by the Machinists to unionize a plant. The National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday released the results of the vote. Nearly 3,000 production workers were eligible to vote in the balloting at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. For weeks, both Boeing and the union bought billboards, print ads, television and radio ads, urgings workers to vote for or against the unionization effort. The Machinists initially tried to unionize the plant in 2015 but called off that vote because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Boeing plant for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 6:30 p.m. Counting is underway for a vote that will determine if thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will be represented by a union. Ballots are being counted Wednesday evening for the vote on representation by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Nearly 3,000 workers were eligible to participate in Wednesday's voting. Union officials said they expected results later in the evening. The election comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 4:35 p.m. Voting is wrapping up for Boeing workers in South Carolina considering if they want to be unionized. Polling places were scheduled to close at 4:30 p.m. Union officials say they expect results later this evening. Nearly 3,000 workers were expected to make a decision on whether they should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 1:20 p.m. An afternoon round of balloting has begun among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want to be unionized. Polls are open for several hours Wednesday afternoon at several locations on the aviation giant's manufacturing facilities in North Charleston. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to participate in the vote determining if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union petitioned for a vote in 2015 but withdrew it because of what the Machinists called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. President Donald Trump is expected to visit Boeing on Friday for the rollout of the first 787-10 Dreamliner from the South Carolina campus. A year ago, then-candidate Trump warned during a campaign appearance that, unless he won, Boeing would soon ship all its jobs from South Carolina to China, where Boeing had agreed to open a facility. ___ 10:45 a.m. South Carolina's chief executive says Boeing's workers should reject an effort to unionize the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Gov. Henry McMaster said "there is no reason to put anyone in the middle" between Boeing and its workers. The Republican governor hasn't said much publicly about the vote, which was announced last month by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. McMaster has only been in office a few weeks, after former Gov. Nikki Haley accepted a job as ambassador to the United Nations. He was an early backer of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and is expected to join the president on Friday when he visits South Carolina for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 9:30 a.m. The morning round of voting has concluded among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. The first of two voting shifts wrapped up around midmorning at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Machinists spokesman Jonathan Battaglia says the union feels Boeing workers are "ready to make history" with the vote. Boeing came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 6:45 a.m. Voting is underway as thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant decide if they want to unionize. Polling places opened early Wednesday morning throughout the aviation giant's sprawling facility in North Charleston. A second wave of voting takes place this afternoon. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The global aviation giant came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 4:10 a.m. Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding if they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. If successful, Wednesday's balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas. And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing.

Women in science and engineering were once hidden figures. You may have seen the movie highlighting their struggles. CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) - Workers at Boeing South Carolina have voted not to unionize under the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.  According to Boeing officials, 74% of total votes cast on Wednesday were against joining the IAM.  Officials say there were 2097 votes for no and 731 votes for yes.  Both Boeing and the union spoke out about the results, and both said they’re looking ahead to the future. "The outcome is not what I was hoping for, but this is the labor movement," said  IAM lead organizer Mike Evans."It isn't easy and we will continue to do our best to help workers in the workplace." “We will continue to move forward as one team,” said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina following the vote. “We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team and to developing new opportunities." Live 5 News The vote was held under the oversight of the National Labor Relations Board and 3,000 employees were eligible to have their say.   Union spokespersons also said there were no voting irregularities. Many advertisements have been run from both sides.  Proponents said employees would get respect on the job, better wages and consistency in unionizing. "Workers at Boeing deserve to be treated fairly and they deserve to be treated with respect," Lead IAM organizer Mike Evans said when he announced the vote last month. "Over the past year and a half, management at Boeing has repeatedly failed to make improvements they promised workers. Instead, workplace policies remain inconsistent and raises remain subjective. Boeing workers deserve better than that."  Boeing wanted employees to vote no, citing expensive union dues and saying IAM   does not have the workers' best interests at heart. Saying "no” would allow workers to keep their voice and their direct working relationship with the company, according to Boeing.  "Boeing believes firmly that a union is not in the best interest of Boeing South Carolina," Boeing Vice President and General Manager Joan Robinson-Berry said at a press conference hours after IAM's announcement. "That's been our consistent position and we will never change that."  Voters marked their ballots in secret, according to the National Labor Relations Board.  RIGHT NOW: Boeing SC workers have begun casting secret ballots on whether to unionize: https://t.co/phPrdgHrc3 #chsnews #scnews pic.twitter.com/1PxjhmGAo0— Live5News (@Live5News) February 15, 2017 The ten polling locations opened at various times, according to the election notice posted on Boeing's website.  The first time the IAM scheduled a union vote at Boeing SC was in 2015.  However, union officials said they canceled the vote because of a "toxic environment."  According to officials, they came to the decision following home visits with more than 1,700 Boeing workers.  Moving forward, Boeing will roll out its first 787-10 on Friday.   “Friday we will mark the most recent incredible accomplishment in the proud history of the BSC team with the rollout of the first 787-10,” said Robinson-Berry. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event.” President Donald Trump is expected to be in attendance at the ceremony.  Copyright 2017 WCSC.

Ware   |   Feb. 15, 2017 at 6:51 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo Feb. 15 (UPI) -- Thousands of Boeing production workers voted Wednesday whether to organize, in what's seen by many as a landmark event for American workers in the South. The Chicago-based aerospace company spent billions to open the production facility in North Charleston, which assembles the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing chose South Carolina for the plant's location in part because it wanted to assure airlines that ordered the new aircraft that there is little chance of a strike. South Carolina has the fewest organized employees in the United States -- with just 1.6 percent belonging to a union. More than 3,000 Boeing workers were eligible to vote in the election. The polls closed at 4:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, and the results were expected later. The National Labor Relations Board is orchestrating the vote, which was requested by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which has more than 700,000 current and retired members. The union, which seeks to represent the Boeing workers, held a "vote yes" rally on Monday. Boeing has been running television and radio advertisements to advise workers against unionizing. "After weeks of Boeing management scare tactics, intimidation and television and radio propaganda ads, 3,000 workers at the South Carolina 787 assembly plants will have their chance to join the IAM," the union said in a news release before Wednesday's vote. "[The] rally was held [Monday] to give supporters a chance to come together and get factual answers to the lies Boeing management has been spreading." Boeing, though, has said its South Carolina workers already earn better wages than some of its union employees in the South. If the union succeeds, it will have to negotiate a contract with the aerospace company to cover the workers. If it fails, it could attempt another vote next year. President Donald Trump plans to visit the Boeing plant on Friday.

Today, the state is so heavily dependent on oil harvested from the Bakken formation that nearly a third of its exports come in the form of crude oil, shipped off to refineries in other parts of the country. Michigan's economy, for so long dependent on the American automotive industry, is still cranking out cars. Of the 10 products Michigan businesses imported most from out of state, nine are related to automobiles. Of the 15 products Michigan businesses exported across the world, 13 are automotive products, whether cars, trucks or accessories. The state's ninth-largest export in 2015: rear-view mirrors. ADVERTISEMENT That data comes from U.S. Census Bureau figures analyzed by the American Enterprise Institute, which sheds light on just how dependent some states are on their largest industries. And it offers hints about why state lawmakers act the way they do. Consider Washington, where a few years ago Democrats and Republicans joined together to give Boeing the largest single corporate tax break in American history, a deal worth more than $8 billion over four decades. Why does Boeing carry so much heft in the Evergreen State? Not only does the company employ tens of thousands of workers at factories north and south of Seattle, but completed aircraft account for almost 60 percent of Washington's exports. In 2015, Washington businesses exported $86 billion in products, according to the Census Bureau. Of that amount, slightly more than $51 billion in trade came from civilian aircraft and engine parts. By contrast, Washington exported almost $800 million in fresh apples. The largest apple-producing state in America did 64 times more business in aircraft supplies. (Boeing's reach extends into other states, too: Airplane parts account for the largest source of imports in Kansas and South Carolina, two states where Boeing operates production lines.) Alaska remains heavily dependent on fish for its export economy. The state exported just over $4.6 billion in products in 2015, almost half of which came from pollock, salmon, cod, crab and other seafood products. Nebraska's economy is also dependent on food production. In 2015, the last year for which figures are available, the state imported $202 million in live cattle; it turned those imports into its largest export, $965 million in fresh or frozen beef. And in New York, a significant portion of the export market comes from luxury goods. Among the top items the Empire State shipped overseas in 2015 were diamonds, paintings, gold, jewelry, original sculptures and statuary -- and even antiques exceeding 100 years of age.   View the discussion thread.

Women in science and engineering were once hidden figures. You may have seen the movie highlighting their struggles. CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) - Workers at Boeing South Carolina have voted not to unionize under the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.  According to Boeing officials, 74% of total votes cast on Wednesday were against joining the IAM.  Officials say there were 2097 votes for no and 731 votes for yes.  Both Boeing and the union spoke out about the results, and both said they’re looking ahead to the future. "The outcome is not what I was hoping for, but this is the labor movement," said  IAM lead organizer Mike Evans."It isn't easy and we will continue to do our best to help workers in the workplace." “We will continue to move forward as one team,” said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina following the vote. “We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team and to developing new opportunities." Live 5 News The vote was held under the oversight of the National Labor Relations Board and 3,000 employees were eligible to have their say.   Union spokespersons also said there were no voting irregularities. Many advertisements have been run from both sides.  Proponents said employees would get respect on the job, better wages and consistency in unionizing. "Workers at Boeing deserve to be treated fairly and they deserve to be treated with respect," Lead IAM organizer Mike Evans said when he announced the vote last month. "Over the past year and a half, management at Boeing has repeatedly failed to make improvements they promised workers. Instead, workplace policies remain inconsistent and raises remain subjective. Boeing workers deserve better than that."  Boeing wanted employees to vote no, citing expensive union dues and saying IAM   does not have the workers' best interests at heart. Saying "no” would allow workers to keep their voice and their direct working relationship with the company, according to Boeing.  "Boeing believes firmly that a union is not in the best interest of Boeing South Carolina," Boeing Vice President and General Manager Joan Robinson-Berry said at a press conference hours after IAM's announcement. "That's been our consistent position and we will never change that."  Voters marked their ballots in secret, according to the National Labor Relations Board.  RIGHT NOW: Boeing SC workers have begun casting secret ballots on whether to unionize: https://t.co/phPrdgHrc3 #chsnews #scnews pic.twitter.com/1PxjhmGAo0— Live5News (@Live5News) February 15, 2017 The ten polling locations opened at various times, according to the election notice posted on Boeing's website.  The first time the IAM scheduled a union vote at Boeing SC was in 2015.  However, union officials said they canceled the vote because of a "toxic environment."  According to officials, they came to the decision following home visits with more than 1,700 Boeing workers.  Moving forward, Boeing will roll out its first 787-10 on Friday.   “Friday we will mark the most recent incredible accomplishment in the proud history of the BSC team with the rollout of the first 787-10,” said Robinson-Berry. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event.” President Donald Trump is expected to be in attendance at the ceremony.  Copyright 2017 WCSC.

Updated: February 16, 2017 @ 1:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP The Latest: Boeing workers reject efforts to unionize plant Feb 15, 2017 Updated 7 hrs ago 0 NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Workers at a Boeing plant in South Carolina have rejected an effort by the Machinists to unionize a plant. The National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday released the results of the vote. Nearly 3,000 production workers were eligible to vote in the balloting at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. For weeks, both Boeing and the union bought billboards, print ads, television and radio ads, urgings workers to vote for or against the unionization effort. The Machinists initially tried to unionize the plant in 2015 but called off that vote because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Boeing plant for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 6:30 p.m. Counting is underway for a vote that will determine if thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will be represented by a union. Ballots are being counted Wednesday evening for the vote on representation by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Nearly 3,000 workers were eligible to participate in Wednesday's voting. Union officials said they expected results later in the evening. The election comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 4:35 p.m. Voting is wrapping up for Boeing workers in South Carolina considering if they want to be unionized. Polling places were scheduled to close at 4:30 p.m. Union officials say they expect results later this evening. Nearly 3,000 workers were expected to make a decision on whether they should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 1:20 p.m. An afternoon round of balloting has begun among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want to be unionized. Polls are open for several hours Wednesday afternoon at several locations on the aviation giant's manufacturing facilities in North Charleston. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to participate in the vote determining if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union petitioned for a vote in 2015 but withdrew it because of what the Machinists called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. President Donald Trump is expected to visit Boeing on Friday for the rollout of the first 787-10 Dreamliner from the South Carolina campus. A year ago, then-candidate Trump warned during a campaign appearance that, unless he won, Boeing would soon ship all its jobs from South Carolina to China, where Boeing had agreed to open a facility. ___ 10:45 a.m. South Carolina's chief executive says Boeing's workers should reject an effort to unionize the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Gov. Henry McMaster said "there is no reason to put anyone in the middle" between Boeing and its workers. The Republican governor hasn't said much publicly about the vote, which was announced last month by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. McMaster has only been in office a few weeks, after former Gov. Nikki Haley accepted a job as ambassador to the United Nations. He was an early backer of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and is expected to join the president on Friday when he visits South Carolina for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 9:30 a.m. The morning round of voting has concluded among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. The first of two voting shifts wrapped up around midmorning at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Machinists spokesman Jonathan Battaglia says the union feels Boeing workers are "ready to make history" with the vote. Boeing came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 6:45 a.m. Voting is underway as thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant decide if they want to unionize. Polling places opened early Wednesday morning throughout the aviation giant's sprawling facility in North Charleston. A second wave of voting takes place this afternoon. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The global aviation giant came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 4:10 a.m. Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding if they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. If successful, Wednesday's balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas. And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Combining the two orders would give the makers enough scale to set up a local assembly line that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been touting under his flagship ‘Make in India’ program which is designed to promote domestic manufacturing. India’s navy in January invited proposals for 57 jets for its aircraft carriers, while the air force is seeking at least 100 planes. Combined, it would become the world’s biggest fighter jet order in play. “We do anticipate that at some point of time, the naval requirement and the air force requirement might coalesce into one,” Pratyush Kumar, president of Boeing Co. in India, said at an air show in Bengaluru, where the company is showcasing its F/A-18 Hornet. “We will look at it based on numbers -- what level of Make in India makes sense.” Modi, who plans to spend $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, guns and helmets, wants India and local companies to get a share of the deals it enters into by calling on foreign manufacturers to make products locally. Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. and others have said they will produce in India if they win large contracts from the world’s biggest weapons importer. To read an article on America First versus Make in India, click here. “It will boil down to whichever contractor is offering an operational plane that is suitable for the air force and navy,” said Anurag Garg, a director of aerospace and defense at Strategy&, a Pricewaterhouse consultancy. “India is looking for a contractor who will execute maximum local production. Any contractor meeting these two requirements will stand a better chance.” Lockheed Martin, which said it will shift its entire F-16 production facility to India if it wins the deal, will leave the decision of combining the two orders to the Indian government, said Randall Howard, head of F-16 Business Development. Meanwhile, Saab is offering the air force its single-engine Gripen fighter jet. “We’ve designed it in such a way that it will be operational irrelevant of the future,” Mats Palmberg, vice president of industrial partnerships, said in an interview at the air show. India requires up to 400 single- and double-engine combat jets, defense minister Manohar Parrikar told reporters Tuesday. An order for single-engine fighters will be placed this year despite difficulties with decision-making in the sector, he said. The South Asian country began a search for new warplanes in 2007, a contest that ended with the government wanting to buy 126 Rafale jets from Dassault Aviation SA for $11 billion. With talks stalling over price and quality guarantees, the government subsequently pared the order to 36 jets. Since then, other manufacturers have been sending proposals, saying the purchase falls short of India’s plans to modernize a predominantly Russian fleet. Boeing’s F-A/18, Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Fighting Falcon, United Aircraft Corp.’s MiG-35, Saab’s Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon were originally in the contest. "The current single engine program could see about 100-plus made in India," said Rahul Bedi, a Delhi-based analyst with Jane’s Information Services. "This program alone could be worth $15 billion, considering 36 Gripen cost $4.5 billion to be made in Brazil. The 57 naval planes program will be another project and this could cost close to $10 billion." India needs to order at least 100 planes for it to be viable for Boeing to build the F-18 locally, Kumar said. Saab’s Palmberg declined to say how many planes would make local manufacturing viable, noting discussions with the government are confidential. Saab CEO Hakan Buskhe expects India to order more than 100 planes, he said in an interview on Tuesday. Roughly one-third of India’s 650-strong fleet is more than 40 years old and is set to be phased out over the next decade. The air force has only 25 active squadrons, compared to the 45 squadrons it estimates would be required to defend against a joint attack from Pakistan and China. For the navy’s aircraft carriers, India initially hoped to use the Tejas -- built locally by state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. -- but the chief of navy said in December that the aircraft wasn’t good enough and it will seek overseas deals.

(AP) -- The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Workers at a Boeing plant in South Carolina have rejected an effort by the Machinists to unionize a plant. The National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday released the results of the vote. Nearly 3,000 production workers were eligible to vote in the balloting at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. For weeks, both Boeing and the union bought billboards, print ads, television and radio ads, urgings workers to vote for or against the unionization effort. The Machinists initially tried to unionize the plant in 2015 but called off that vote because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Boeing plant for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. --- 6:30 p.m. Counting is underway for a vote that will determine if thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will be represented by a union. Ballots are being counted Wednesday evening for the vote on representation by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Nearly 3,000 workers were eligible to participate in Wednesday's voting. Union officials said they expected results later in the evening. The election comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. --- 4:35 p.m. Voting is wrapping up for Boeing workers in South Carolina considering if they want to be unionized. Polling places were scheduled to close at 4:30 p.m. Union officials say they expect results later this evening. Nearly 3,000 workers were expected to make a decision on whether they should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. --- 1:20 p.m. An afternoon round of balloting has begun among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want to be unionized. Polls are open for several hours Wednesday afternoon at several locations on the aviation giant's manufacturing facilities in North Charleston. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to participate in the vote determining if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union petitioned for a vote in 2015 but withdrew it because of what the Machinists called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. President Donald Trump is expected to visit Boeing on Friday for the rollout of the first 787-10 Dreamliner from the South Carolina campus. A year ago, then-candidate Trump warned during a campaign appearance that, unless he won, Boeing would soon ship all its jobs from South Carolina to China, where Boeing had agreed to open a facility. --- 10:45 a.m. South Carolina's chief executive says Boeing's workers should reject an effort to unionize the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Gov. Henry McMaster said "there is no reason to put anyone in the middle" between Boeing and its workers. The Republican governor hasn't said much publicly about the vote, which was announced last month by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. McMaster has only been in office a few weeks, after former Gov. Nikki Haley accepted a job as ambassador to the United Nations. He was an early backer of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and is expected to join the president on Friday when he visits South Carolina for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. --- 9:30 a.m. The morning round of voting has concluded among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. The first of two voting shifts wrapped up around midmorning at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Machinists spokesman Jonathan Battaglia says the union feels Boeing workers are "ready to make history" with the vote. Boeing came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. --- 6:45 a.m. Voting is underway as thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant decide if they want to unionize. Polling places opened early Wednesday morning throughout the aviation giant's sprawling facility in North Charleston. A second wave of voting takes place this afternoon. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The global aviation giant came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. --- 4:10 a.m. Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding if they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. If successful, Wednesday's balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas. And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Posted 16 Feb 2017 04:35 One of the Boeing aircraft prodution hangars in North Charleston, South Carolina. (AFP/PAUL J. RICHARDS) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Boeing hourly workers in South Carolina headed to the polls on Wednesday (Feb 15) to determine whether to unionise in a region of the United States historically hostile to organised labor. About 3,000 Boeing manufacturing and maintenance employees were eligible to vote in the referendum, which will determine whether they will be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The vote comes just two days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Boeing facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, for the debut of its 787-10 Dreamliner, its latest version of the fuel-efficient mid-sized aircraft. The plane is scheduled to begin commercial delivery in 2018. Boeing's investment in South Carolina was cemented with the US$1 billion purchase in 2009 of Vought Aircraft Industries, which had been a supplier to Boeing on the 787 programme. Analysts say the state's anti-union history was a factor in Boeing's investment decisions in the state. A "yes" vote by workers "could raise costs at a time when Boeing needs to get costs down," said Morningstar analyst Chris Higgins. The machinists union have argued that unionisation is a key to protecting jobs and boosting pay so that South Carolina closes the wage gap with Boeing workers in similar jobs in the state of Washington. "We think people are ready to get the respect and dignity they deserve through a union contract," union spokesman Jonathan Battaglia said. Boeing has countered that organised labour is overpromising and shifting the manufacturing operations into a union shop runs the risk of a crippling strike. The company has publicised video testimonials from employees thanking the company for making South Carolina a manufacturing centre. "A union is not in the best interests of our teammates, our business or our community," said Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Merida. Higgins said it was unlikely a vote to unionise would affect Boeing's plans for the building of the 787-10 given the status of the production. But a "yes" vote could affect future investment decisions, such as where to station the building of a mid-sized commercial aircraft that has been discussed. An announcement of the vote outcome was expected early Wednesday evening. The proceedings are being overseen by officials from the National Labor Relations Board. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Boeing said in a news release that 74 percent of the 2,828 votes cast supported the company and rejected the overtures of representation by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. "We will continue to move forward as one team," said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina. "We have a bright future ahead of us, and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team and to developing new opportunities." Union officials expressed disappointment. "We're disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation" said IAM lead organizer Mike Evans in a statement released Wednesday night. "But more than anything, we are disheartened they will have to continue to work under a system that suppresses wages, fosters inconsistency and awards only a chosen few." The vote comes just two days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Boeing facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, for the debut of its 787-10 Dreamliner, its latest version of the fuel-efficient midsized aircraft. The plane is scheduled to begin commercial delivery in 2018.

Analysts say the state's anti-union history was a factor in Boeing's investment decisions in the state. The machinists union had argued that unionization was a key to protecting jobs and boosting pay so that South Carolina closes the wage gap with Boeing workers in similar jobs in the state of Washington. The IAM blamed the result on a costly ad campaign by Boeing. The union must wait a year under federal labor laws before another vote can take place. "Ultimately, it will be up to the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. Boeing has argued that organized labor is overpromising and shifting the manufacturing operations into a union shop runs the risk of a crippling strike. The company has publicized video testimonials from employees thanking the company for making South Carolina a manufacturing center. Analysts said a vote by South Carolina to become a union shop could have hit Boeing's bottom line on the 787 plane and potentially affected future investment decisions for the plant.

REUTERS/Randall Hill This post has been updated. NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — Workers at a Boeing plant in South Carolina voted against unionizing on Wednesday, perhaps the most important trial of unions’ influence since President Trump’s win last year. After years of bitter campaigning, the International Association of Machinists failed to sway the factory’s 3,000 workers to organize in a state profoundly hostile to organized labor. Of the approximately 2,800 workers who voted, 74 percent chose not to unionize. “We are disheartened they will have to continue to work under a system that suppresses wages, fosters inconsistency and awards only a chosen few,” the machinists’ organizer, Mike Evans, said of workers at the plant in a statement announcing the defeat. The vote came just days before President Trump is scheduled to visit the plant, which is next to the Charleston International Airport and Joint Base Charleston military facility. He plans to help unveil Boeing’s newest Dreamliner 787, a massive passenger jet, on Friday. Trump’s ascendance to the White House marked a rupture in the conventional relationship between unions and politics. During the presidential campaign, he offered American workers a new prescription for the economy, fervidly opposing free trade and immigration while rejecting taxes on the wealthy and public-assistance programs that union leadership and its Democratic allies have advocated. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," said Joan Robinson-Berry, the plant's general manager, in a statement about Trump's scheduled appearance. She called the new plane an "incredible accomplishment" by the plant's staff.   Jonathan Battaglia, a spokesman for the union, said there were no immediate plans to appeal the result. The machinists would have to wait at least a year before filing a new petition for another vote. A presidential visit after the union's defeat will add insult to injury for organized labor nationwide, whose leadership endorsed Hillary Clinton in last year's election — contrary to many rank-and-file members . Trump's margin among union households was the best for a Republican nominee since President Reagan's reelection, exit polls showed. With Trump's election victory came the far-reaching authority to undermine unions. Trump can now fill two vacant seats on the five-member National Labor Relations Board, giving the powerful body a Republican majority. The board administered Wednesday's vote at Boeing. Conservative observers also believe that Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, would be the fifth justice in favor of making it vastly more difficult for unions to collect dues from workers. Slater and other observers predicted that unionization of workers for one of South Carolina's most recognizable manufacturers would have encouraged organizing at other facilities in the right-to-work state, which generally allows workers not to pay dues to or join a union even if they work under a contract that the union negotiated. While rates of membership in unions are depressed throughout the South, just 1.6 percent of workers in South Carolina belong to a union, the least of any state. Last year, unions lost about 20 percent of their members in the state, or roughly 9,000 workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "If they get a foothold in a plant that size, that may help in efforts to expand beyond that location," South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance president Lewis Gossett said before the vote. "I don’t know a single business person that wants a union to be successful there." The alliance, an industry coalition in Columbia, ran television spots opposing the union on local stations in the weeks before the vote, including during the Super Bowl. Residents say TV, radio and billboard advertising has been ubiquitous. Labor's weakness in South Carolina is partly due to intense opposition from local politicians. Former governor Nikki Haley, now Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said she opposed firms with unionized labor opening facilities in her state, even though new factories would presumably mean more work for her constituents. “We discourage any companies that have unions from wanting to come to South Carolina because we don't want to taint the water,” she said in 2014, joking that her high heels were for kicking out organizers. “It's not for a fashion statement,” she said. In a news conference Monday, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) argued that limited unionization had helped the state succeed economically. “I will leave it up to the people who are working at Boeing to decide what’s best for them,” he said. “Let me tell you what’s best for South Carolina — it's that Boeing stays here and grows. If you destroy the business model that led Boeing to come to South Carolina, we all lose.” South Carolina has enjoyed a resurgence in the manufacturing sector after years of closures and layoffs. The traditional industries of the South, textiles and furniture, were especially vulnerable to competition from overseas. Manufacturing employment in South Carolina fell from 336,000 workers in 2000 to 207,000 in 2010. That figure has since recovered to 240,000. Many economists say that limited unionization has helped the recovery along. “This is an advantage for South Carolina,” said Adam Ozimek, an economist with the private research firm Moody's Analytics in Westchester, Pa., before the vote. “It would probably erode some of that advantage if they were to change direction now.” Others argue that the cheap wages factory workers earn in South Carolina are not sustainable. “Right now, they’re clearly getting a big wage discount for being in South Carolina, and that’s one of the reasons there’s an election,” said Larry Mishel, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute in D.C. According to the union, Boeing's workers in North Charleston make 36 percent less, on average, than unionized workers building the same planes at Boeing's main facility in Everett, Wash., where workers are unionized. A spokeswoman for the company responded that wages are determined by local markets. The prospect of a raise if the union won was enticing for workers at Boeing. The firm's customers pay the same prices regardless of where the aircraft are built, argued Elliott Slater, a mechanic at the plant who supported the union. "The difference is there is more profit on the upper-end," he said. "More money needs to be dispensed toward the lower-end, because we’re the ones that actually build the plane." Others were concerned that a union could sow division. Hope Wroblewski, a manufacturing technician who said she would vote against the union, worried about being called a freeloader if the union won and she refused to pay dues, or being named a scab in the event of a strike. She said she is happy with the wages and benefits at the plant, and Boeing is paying for her to earn a degree in occupational health online from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz. After reading information from anti-union websites and law firms about incidents of embezzlement and fines for workers who crossed picket lines, Wroblewski said, she thought International Association of Machinists would look out for its own interests, not hers. Wroblewski said she did not vote in the presidential election, but she likes how Trump talks about the economy and is looking forward to the visit. She is still waiting, though, to see if Trump's new approach to addressing the needs of the working class will succeed. “You can talk all day long, but let me see what you’re going to do,” she said. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address.

Singapore Airlines' decision to order 20 777-9s represents another blow to Airbus' troubled A380 aircraft program. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Feb 15, 2017 at 11:25AM Last week, Singapore Airlines picked Boeing (NYSE:BA) over Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) for the next stage of its fleet renewal. It signed a letter of intent for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s, which should be converted to a firm order soon. Singapore Airlines will also have options for six more of each aircraft type. Boeing's win is a loss for the Airbus A350 program. Singapore Airlines is the top customer for the popular A350-900 variant, with 67 firm orders, but it hasn't ordered the larger A350-1000. Now that the carrier has a 777X order on the books, it isn't likely to pursue the larger A350 model -- let alone having any interest in a proposed stretch of the A350-1000. Singapore Airlines is the largest customer for the A350-900. Image source: Singapore Airlines. However, at least one analyst thinks that the order for 20 Boeing 777-9s could also be a death blow for Airbus' A380 jumbo jet. Let's see if there's any truth to this claim. The A380 is running out of orders The A380 jumbo jet program certainly isn't doing well. Orders have slowed to a crawl in the past few years, forcing Airbus to reduce production by more than half. Indeed, Airbus has just 110 firm orders left for the A380. In theory, that represents nine years of production at the new planned production rate of 12 per year. In reality, the situation is much worse than that. As many as 47 of the remaining orders are likely to fall through. These include 20 A380s ordered by aircraft lessor Amedeo -- which hasn't been able to line up a single customer despite years of trying -- and eight A380s ordered by Qantas that management has definitively said it does not want. Of the other 63 outstanding A380 orders, 50 are for a single customer: Middle Eastern airline giant Emirates. Yet while Emirates has been a huge fan of the A380, Airbus' jumbo jet cannot survive with a single customer. Singapore Airlines is an important A380 customer That's where Singapore Airlines comes in. Singapore Airlines became the first airline to fly the A380 in 2007. Furthermore, it is the second-largest customer for the A380 -- albeit a distant second -- with 24 total orders. Singapore Airlines ordered more A380s than any airline other than Emirates. Image source: Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines still has five A380s on order with Airbus. However, the leases for its first five A380s are expiring soon. The first expiration will occur later this year, and the carrier has already announced that it will return the plane rather than renewing the lease. Most analysts expect Singapore Airlines to return the other four as well. That would keep its A380 fleet steady at 19 aircraft. Singapore Airlines is one of the most highly regarded airlines in the world, so its fleet decisions can be influential among other carriers. As one of the first airlines to order the A380, Singapore Airlines paved the way for others to follow. If its new 777X order indicates that it is moving away from the A380, other airlines might follow its lead once again. The A380 becomes less useful The 777-9 isn't a direct replacement for the A380. Boeing says that it will hold 400-425 seats in a standard configuration, compared to 544 for the A380. (A real-world configuration for Singapore Airlines would have significantly fewer seats, though.) However, Singapore Airlines has been struggling with steep fare declines in many of its markets recently, driven by slow economic growth and overcapacity. Many analysts expect this overcapacity -- and the resulting fare pressure -- to linger. In this environment, Singapore Airlines might be perfectly happy to move away from the enormous A380. The 777-9 will be smaller than the A380, but far more fuel-efficient. Image source: Boeing. Last year, Boeing was rumored to be working on a slight stretch of the 777-9 that would boost its capacity by 30-40 seats. This would be even closer to the A380 in terms of seating capacity, with much lower unit costs -- giving carriers like Singapore Airlines even less reason to remain committed to the A380. Can the A380 find a new market? Singapore Airlines' 777X order confirms that yet another airline is becoming disillusioned with the A380. However, this had already been foreshadowed last year when the carrier announced that it would not renew its first A380 lease. Singapore Airlines isn't the only A380 operator that likes to maintain a very young fleet. As these carriers remove mid-aged A380s from their fleets in the coming years, a large supply of cheap used A380s will hit the market. This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, these used planes may cannibalize some orders for new A380s from Airbus. On the other hand, bringing the cost down could encourage long-haul low-cost carriers and other smaller airlines to experiment with the A380. That could lead to orders later on, assuming that the A380 became a profitable tool for those carriers. It's probably fair to say that the Airbus A380 is doomed as a hub-and-spoke airplane. Most A380 operators have already ordered the 777X, and they may find that those planes have plenty of capacity for their needs. However, the A380 still has an outside chance at survival if it can develop a completely new market among low-cost carriers looking to pack as many people as possible onto a single plane.

Dinesh Keskar, Senior Vice-President (Sales), Asia Pacific and India, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told BusinessLine that airlines in India have totally ordered hundreds of aircraft. These include, 75 Boeing 737 Max aircraft by Jet Airways, 155 Max by SpiceJet, 787-9 for Jet Airways, four 787-4 and three 777 for Air India. “We have always said that when it comes to wide-bodied aircraft, we are the dominant player,” Keskar said. Jet has leased four more Max, which is not part of the tally. He said Boeing continues to see strong growth for India’s commercial aviation sector. “The major factors we watch – the exchange rate, fuel price and the profitability of the airlines – are all still favourable and we remain confident in the strong growth of India’s commercial aviation sector,” Keskar said. He said Boeing expects more than 100 million passengers to fly domestically this year. According to Boeing’s 2016 India Current Market Outlook, close to 1,850 new airplanes – valued at $265 billion – will be needed in India over the next 20 years. Single-aisle airplanes such as the Next-Generation 737 and 737 MAX will continue to account for the largest share of new deliveries, while wide-body airplanes such as the 787 Dreamliner and the 777 family, make up the remainder of demand. “We look forward to delivering several more 787 Dreamliners to Air India this year, and the 737 MAX to SpiceJet and Jet Airways in 2018.” The 737 MAX family builds on the success of the Next-Generation 737, he said. The 737 MAX will deliver 20 per cent lower fuel use than the first Next-Generation 737s and the lowest operating costs in its class – 8 per cent per seat less than its nearest competitor.

According to a company statement, more than 2,000 of the nearly 3,000 Boeing workers at the plant eligible to vote in the closely watched election voted against the union, and only a bit more than 700 members voted yes. "We will continue to move forward as one team," said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina. "We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team." Manufacturers have been drawn to the South because the region is strongly anti-union. Less than 2% of South Carolina workers are union members, the lowest unionization rate in the nation. Boeing (BA) spent billions to open its North Charleston plant, arguing it needs to assure customers who buy the 787 Dreamliner, which is built there, that the plant wouldn't go on strike. Related: Trump move on Iran could cost jobs at Boeing A win would have given the Machinists, who represent most Boeing factory workers, even more leverage over Boeing in future labor talks. The loss could further encourage other manufacturers to open union-free plants in the South. The vote was seen as an uphill battle for the union, which dropped plans for a vote last year. About 40% to 50% of organizing votes fail. "Boeing management spent a lot of money to make sure power and profits remained concentrated at the very top," said Mike Evans, the union's chief organizer. The union will now have to wait at least a year to petition for another representation vote. "The IAM remains committed to getting Boeing South Carolina workers the respect, wages and consistency they deserve." Boeing's South Carolina assembly line, where workers voted Wednesday not to join the Machinist union. The plant will get additional attention this week as President Donald Trump plans to visit the plant Friday to mark the completion of the first 787-10, the newest version of the Dreamliner. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," said Robinson-Berry. Wages were a key issue in the vote. The union says South Carolina workers earn about $10 an hour less than union members at Boeing's Washington state plants. Related: Boeing pitches China facility as Trump-friendly For its part, Boeing says pay scales are driven by wages in the local market, and that the South Carolina plant already pays better than a union-represented Boeing plant in Alabama. The company emphasized the cost of union dues, about $800 a year, as well as the risk that the workers could be caught up in a strike they opposed.

Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg appears to have gained the ear of President Donald Trump. The US plane maker was one of Trump’s first post-election corporate targets, and a tweet about soaring Air Force One costs briefly tanked the company’s shares in December. But the Twitter tirade also gave Muilenburg an opening to press the case of the largest US exporter — and the 1.5 million jobs at its jet-equipment suppliers — in meetings with Trump. The CEO’s entreaties seem to have worked. Trump has emerged as a booster for Boeing’s F/A-18 fighter jets and voiced support to lawmakers for a key Boeing initiative: reopening the US Export-Import Bank for major deals. Trump will fly to Boeing’s South Carolina factory to attend an event Friday showcasing the newest 787 Dreamliner, where he’s expected to make an announcement about the federal export credit agency. “The supply chain for Boeing doesn’t just run through the state of Washington,” said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies. The Ex-Im Bank is “a door opener.” Supporting the lender would put Trump at odds with some fellow Republicans, who view the bank as providing corporate welfare. Boeing Bank Ex-Im has been dubbed the “Bank of Boeing” for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by airlines unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it’s been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10 million because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a Senate committee since 2015. Trump is committed to re-establishing a quorum on the bank’s board, US Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, said after a Feb. 9 bipartisan lunch meeting between the president and lawmakers. That’s needed to allow the bank to lend more as it faces a backlog of as much as $30 billion in projects. Senator Richard Shelby, an opponent of the bank, had blocked nominees to the board over the past two years as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. In January the Alabama Republican moved from the Banking to chair the Rules Committee, removing one hurdle for giving Ex-Im a quorum. Boeing and General Electric Co. have argued that without the financing, they would face a competitive disadvantage against companies in Europe, Canada, Brazil, China and Russia, who don’t face similar restrictions.

"The major factors we watch - the exchange rate, fuel price and the profitability of the airlines - are all still favourable and we remain confident in the strong growth of India's commercial aviation sector," said Dinesh Keskar, Senior Vice President, Asia Pacific and India Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "We see the potential for travel growth in 2017 to continue to be high in India and we expect more than 100 million passengers to fly domestically this year," Keskar spoke during a briefing organised by Boeing at the 2017 Aero India Airshow in Bangalore. According to Keskar, Boeing continues to provide the airlines in India with the most fuel efficient and capable airplanes in every market segment. "We look forward to delivering several more 787 Dreamliners to Air India this year and the 737 MAX to SpiceJet and Jet Airways in 2018," Keskar said. Earlier, Boeing's 2016 India Current Market Outlook (CMO), had shown that the country's airlines would require 1,850 new airplanes, valued at $265 billion over the next 20 years. As per the 2016 India CMO, single-aisle airplanes such as the Next-Generation 737 and 737 MAX will continue to account for the largest share of new deliveries, while wide-body airplanes such as the 787 Dreamliner and the 777 family, will make up for the remainder of demand. --IANS rv/dg (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

REUTERS/Jason Redmond    Boeing Faces Off With Labor Union In South Carolina Allison Thibault 10:55 AM 02/15/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5479281 Boeing aircraft factory workers in South Carolina are scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). The IAM has also long unionized a Boeing plant in Washington, where a strike was organized in 2008 causing the company to relocate $750 million in funding the the South Carolina plant with further investment of $1 billion to expand production. The vote in South Carolina could unionize 3,000 workers. Labor relations consultant described the vote as a “major, major win for the machinists if they got this.” A main selling point is that IAM could help bring higher wages and more consistent hours to workers at the plant. However, South Carolina has proved to be a staunchly anti-union state. One of 28 states where union membership is not required, South Carolina has the lowest union membership at 1.6 percent. New York has the highest percentage of union membership: 23.6 percent. Professor at the Darla Moore School of Business at University of South Carolina, Hoyt Wheeler, cites South Carolina’s history of cheap labor and high business class influence as a reason union are often dead out of the gate. The IAM previously tried to hold a vote in April of 2015 but canceled due to what they called “political interference” and “misinformation” among the workers. At the time, former Gov. Nikki Haley was among those strongly opposed to IAM. In her State of the State address in 2015, Haley stated that South Carolina is a “state that doesn’t want unions, because we don’t need unions.” Boeing is using the same lawyer and standard union avoidance strategy now as it did in 2015. Boeing’s social media has been portraying IAM as divisive, and has starting airing its videos on local TV stations. One video features a production manager, Daniel Mihalic, who was a unionized machinist in the Washington plant unionized by IAM, describing the tension and loss of income he experienced during a strike. Mihalic urges workers to vote no and speaks about how he struggled while on strike wondering how he was going to feed his child. Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751 in Washington, says he hates seeing the anti-union campaign and workers should have “free choice on what they want to do, being able to ask questions and not seeing intimidation.” Tags: Boeing, IAM, Nikki Haley, South Carolina Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Updated: February 16, 2017 @ 2:35 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Classifieds AP The Latest: Boeing workers reject efforts to unionize plant Feb 15, 2017 Updated 7 hrs ago NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Workers at a Boeing plant in South Carolina have rejected an effort by the Machinists to unionize a plant. The National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday released the results of the vote. Nearly 3,000 production workers were eligible to vote in the balloting at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. For weeks, both Boeing and the union bought billboards, print ads, television and radio ads, urgings workers to vote for or against the unionization effort. The Machinists initially tried to unionize the plant in 2015 but called off that vote because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Boeing plant for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 6:30 p.m. Counting is underway for a vote that will determine if thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will be represented by a union. Ballots are being counted Wednesday evening for the vote on representation by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Nearly 3,000 workers were eligible to participate in Wednesday's voting. Union officials said they expected results later in the evening. The election comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 4:35 p.m. Voting is wrapping up for Boeing workers in South Carolina considering if they want to be unionized. Polling places were scheduled to close at 4:30 p.m. Union officials say they expect results later this evening. Nearly 3,000 workers were expected to make a decision on whether they should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 1:20 p.m. An afternoon round of balloting has begun among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want to be unionized. Polls are open for several hours Wednesday afternoon at several locations on the aviation giant's manufacturing facilities in North Charleston. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to participate in the vote determining if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union petitioned for a vote in 2015 but withdrew it because of what the Machinists called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. President Donald Trump is expected to visit Boeing on Friday for the rollout of the first 787-10 Dreamliner from the South Carolina campus. A year ago, then-candidate Trump warned during a campaign appearance that, unless he won, Boeing would soon ship all its jobs from South Carolina to China, where Boeing had agreed to open a facility. ___ 10:45 a.m. South Carolina's chief executive says Boeing's workers should reject an effort to unionize the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Gov. Henry McMaster said "there is no reason to put anyone in the middle" between Boeing and its workers. The Republican governor hasn't said much publicly about the vote, which was announced last month by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. McMaster has only been in office a few weeks, after former Gov. Nikki Haley accepted a job as ambassador to the United Nations. He was an early backer of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and is expected to join the president on Friday when he visits South Carolina for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 9:30 a.m. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

The morning round of voting has concluded among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. The first of two voting shifts wrapped up around midmorning at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Machinists spokesman Jonathan Battaglia says the union feels Boeing workers are "ready to make history" with the vote. Boeing came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 6:45 a.m. Voting is underway as thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant decide if they want to unionize. Polling places opened early Wednesday morning throughout the aviation giant's sprawling facility in North Charleston. A second wave of voting takes place this afternoon. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference.

Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 4:10 a.m. Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding if they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. If successful, Wednesday's balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas. And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult.

News Trump Could Make The Ex-Im Bank Great Again For Boeing, GE Boeing may find it easier to sell 787 Dreamliners from its factory in South Carolina if President Trump approves funding for the Export-Import Bank. (Boeing) GILLIAN RICH 2/15/2017 Reprints The Export Import Bank might have full lending powers again as President Trump is expected to make an announcement about the agency at Boeing's (BA) factory in South Carolina on Friday. The federal export credit agency was closed for six months after its charter expired on June 30, 2015, before opening back up with limited authority. Boeing, General Electric (GE), Caterpillar (CAT) and other beneficiaries have been pushing for re-establishing a quorum on the bank's board allowing it to make deals greater than $10 million. Boeing shares ticked up 0.5% to 169.30 on the stock market today. GE shares inched up 0.2% to 30.35. Caterpillar shares climbed 1% to 99.02. A Passage To India — And Elsewhere In the past few years, the bank helped Boeing sell its 787 Dreamliners to India, Poland and Ethiopia, and GE sell its trains to Pakistan. Caterpillar also relies on the bank to sell its heavy equipment overseas. A Boeing spokesperson told Bloomberg that without the bank, U.S. firms are at a "significant competitive disadvantage" vs. rivals overseas like Airbus (EADSY). The bank only authorized $5 billion in financing in fiscal 2016, down from $20 billion in 2014. It was started 80 years ago in response to the Great Depression and helps facilitate foreign companies' efforts to buy U.S. goods. Boeing is the largest beneficiary, with 40% of all authorizations in 2014 going to the aerospace giant, according to George Mason University's Mercatus Center analysts, who were quoted in a Bloomberg story. Obama Wanted To Expand Democrats are the bank's biggest supporters and President Obama wanted to expand its lending limit from $140 billion to $160 billion. Trump had initially been opposed to the Ex-Im Bank but Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg may have swayed Trump as the two have had several talks after Trump blasted the costs of Boeing's Air Force One contract. Trump's support of the bank would go against Republican members in Congress who believe the bank is crony capitalism set to favor big companies with their hands in politics. Delta Air Lines' (DAL) former CEO Richard Anderson was an outspoken opponent of the bank during his time at the airline, arguing that the Ex-Im Bank helped subsidize orders to wealthy Middle Eastern carriers like Dubai's Emirates with U.S. taxpayer dollars. Airbus ticked up less than 0.3% to 17.52. Delta tacked on 2.6% to 51.17.

File photo   By Julie Johnsson, Thomas Black and Austin Weinstein WP Bloomberg After a rocky start, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg appears to have gained the ear of President Donald Trump. The Chicago-based plane maker was one of Trump's first post-election corporate targets, and a tweet about soaring Air Force One costs briefly tanked the company's shares in December. But the Twitter tirade also gave Muilenburg an opening to press the case of the largest U.S. exporter -- and the 1.5 million jobs at its jet-equipment suppliers -- in meetings with Trump. The CEO's entreaties seem to have worked. Trump has emerged as a booster for Boeing's F/A-18 fighter jets and voiced support to lawmakers for a key Boeing initiative: reopening the U.S. Export-Import Bank for major deals. Trump will fly to Boeing's South Carolina factory to attend an event Friday showcasing the newest 787 Dreamliner, where he's expected to make an announcement about the federal export credit agency. "The supply chain for Boeing doesn't just run through the state of Washington," said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies. The Ex-Im Bank is "a door opener." Supporting the lender would put Trump at odds with some fellow Republicans, who view the bank as providing corporate welfare. Ex-Im has been dubbed the "Bank of Boeing" for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by airlines unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it's been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10 million because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a Senate committee since 2015. Trump is committed to re-establishing a quorum on the bank's board, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, said after a Feb. 9 bipartisan lunch meeting between the president and lawmakers. That's needed to allow the bank to lend more as it faces a backlog of as much as $30 billion in projects. Sen. Richard Shelby, an opponent of the bank, had blocked nominees to the board over the past two years as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. In January the Alabama Republican moved from the Banking to chair the Rules Committee, removing one hurdle for giving Ex-Im a quorum. Boeing and General Electric have argued that without the financing, they would face a competitive disadvantage against companies in Europe, Canada, Brazil, China and Russia, who don't face similar restrictions. With the bank hobbled, U.S. manufacturers have been forced to turn to private banks or export credit banks from other countries where they operate to help customers finance big-ticket purchases. Boeing has lost or faces delays on three commercial satellite sales because of the lack of export credit, said Kate Bernard, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-based manufacturer. "It's put us at a significant competitive disadvantage," Bernard said. Critics argue that the Ex-Im Bank's guarantees are heavily weighted toward a few large companies and the U.S. government could potentially be on the hook if borrowers default. In 2014, 40 percent of all authorizations went to Boeing alone, according to an analysis by George Mason University's Mercatus Center. Other beneficiaries range from GE to Bechtel Group. "I don't blame companies like Boeing, Bechtel and GE for using Ex-Im or benefiting from Ex-Im," said Diane Katz, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which favors limited government. "But we don't have to give them the opportunity to do that on the backs of taxpayers." GE had contracts valued at $11 billion that required Ex-Im Bank financing in 2015, when reauthorization of the bank lapsed. The company rushed to form partnerships with export credit agencies in Canada, the U.K., France and other countries to meet those needs, said Una Pulizzi, a spokeswoman for GE. A representative of Bechtel didn't respond to a request for comment left outside normal business hours. Ex-Im Bank's quarterly default rate was 0.27 percent at the end of September, well below the mandate by Congress. The bank is also profitable, returning $284 million to the U.S. Treasury last year and $675 million in 2014 when it was fully operational. The lender estimates it supported almost 165,000 U.S. jobs in 2014. If U.S. contractors can't find Ex-Im Bank financing for U.S.-made equipment needed on an overseas projects, they will shift purchases to a country where the guarantees are available, said William Schubert, president of International Trade & Transportation Inc., which helps borrowers find government-backed credit. "When that happens, all the U.S. procurement disappears," Schubert said. "I know people who are unemployed right now because the bank is down, and that's unfortunate."

On Wednesday, Boeing production workers will vote on whether to join the Machinists union. Bruce Smith AP/File photo i The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Workers at a Boeing plant in South Carolina have rejected an effort by the Machinists to unionize a plant. The National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday released the results of the vote. Nearly 3,000 production workers were eligible to vote in the balloting at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. For weeks, both Boeing and the union bought billboards, print ads, television and radio ads, urgings workers to vote for or against the unionization effort. The Machinists initially tried to unionize the plant in 2015 but called off that vote because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Boeing plant for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 6:30 p.m. Counting is underway for a vote that will determine if thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will be represented by a union. Ballots are being counted Wednesday evening for the vote on representation by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Nearly 3,000 workers were eligible to participate in Wednesday's voting. Union officials said they expected results later in the evening. The election comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 4:35 p.m. Voting is wrapping up for Boeing workers in South Carolina considering if they want to be unionized. Polling places were scheduled to close at 4:30 p.m. Union officials say they expect results later this evening. Nearly 3,000 workers were expected to make a decision on whether they should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump visits the Boeing plant in North Charleston to join in celebrating the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 1:20 p.m. An afternoon round of balloting has begun among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want to be unionized. Polls are open for several hours Wednesday afternoon at several locations on the aviation giant's manufacturing facilities in North Charleston. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to participate in the vote determining if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union petitioned for a vote in 2015 but withdrew it because of what the Machinists called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. President Donald Trump is expected to visit Boeing on Friday for the rollout of the first 787-10 Dreamliner from the South Carolina campus. A year ago, then-candidate Trump warned during a campaign appearance that, unless he won, Boeing would soon ship all its jobs from South Carolina to China, where Boeing had agreed to open a facility. ___ 10:45 a.m. South Carolina's chief executive says Boeing's workers should reject an effort to unionize the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Gov. Henry McMaster said "there is no reason to put anyone in the middle" between Boeing and its workers. The Republican governor hasn't said much publicly about the vote, which was announced last month by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. McMaster has only been in office a few weeks, after former Gov. Nikki Haley accepted a job as ambassador to the United Nations. He was an early backer of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and is expected to join the president on Friday when he visits South Carolina for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 9:30 a.m. The morning round of voting has concluded among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. The first of two voting shifts wrapped up around midmorning at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Machinists spokesman Jonathan Battaglia says the union feels Boeing workers are "ready to make history" with the vote. Boeing came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 6:45 a.m. Voting is underway as thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant decide if they want to unionize. Polling places opened early Wednesday morning throughout the aviation giant's sprawling facility in North Charleston. A second wave of voting takes place this afternoon. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The global aviation giant came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 4:10 a.m. Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding if they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. If successful, Wednesday's balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas. And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing.

According to a company statement, more than 2,000 of the nearly 3,000 Boeing workers at the plant eligible to vote in the closely watched election voted against the union, and only a bit more than 700 members voted yes. "We will continue to move forward as one team," said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina. "We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team." Manufacturers have been drawn to the South because the region is strongly anti-union. Less than 2% of South Carolina workers are union members, the lowest unionization rate in the nation. Boeing (BA) spent billions to open its North Charleston plant, arguing it needs to assure customers who buy the 787 Dreamliner, which is built there, that the plant wouldn't go on strike. Related: Trump move on Iran could cost jobs at Boeing A win would have given the Machinists, who represent most Boeing factory workers, even more leverage over Boeing in future labor talks. The loss could further encourage other manufacturers to open union-free plants in the South. The vote was seen as an uphill battle for the union, which dropped plans for a vote last year. About 40% to 50% of organizing votes fail. "Boeing management spent a lot of money to make sure power and profits remained concentrated at the very top," said Mike Evans, the union's chief organizer. The union will now have to wait at least a year to petition for another representation vote. "The IAM remains committed to getting Boeing South Carolina workers the respect, wages and consistency they deserve." Boeing's South Carolina assembly line, where workers voted Wednesday not to join the Machinist union. The plant will get additional attention this week as President Donald Trump plans to visit the plant Friday to mark the completion of the first 787-10, the newest version of the Dreamliner. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," said Robinson-Berry. Wages were a key issue in the vote. The union says South Carolina workers earn about $10 an hour less than union members at Boeing's Washington state plants. Related: Boeing pitches China facility as Trump-friendly For its part, Boeing says pay scales are driven by wages in the local market, and that the South Carolina plant already pays better than a union-represented Boeing plant in Alabama. The company emphasized the cost of union dues, about $800 a year, as well as the risk that the workers could be caught up in a strike they opposed.

Wolfe and Darius Dixon LEAVING ON A JET PLANE: President Donald Trump will go to North Charleston, S.C., on Friday for the unveiling of the first Boeing 787-10, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Tuesday. “This visit will give the president an opportunity to celebrate a huge milestone for thousands of workers at Boeing, America’s No. 1 exporter, and the millions of American workers involved in aerospace,” Spicer said. “This trip has been months in the making. And we’re thrilled to celebrate the rollout of this amazing plane.” Story Continued Below Validate me: But first, Boeing will come to Capitol Hill, to help kick off a series of hearings on the FAA reauthorization before the House T&I Aviation Subcommittee. John Hamilton, vice president of engineering for Boeing’s commercial unit, will tell lawmakers today that in order to ensure Boeing and its employees stay globally competitive, helping other governments’ air safety bodies validate new Boeing planes as safe needs to be prioritized. Sneak peek: “This process is not meant to be a re-certification. A validation should be just that — validating that the FAA conducted the type certificate work to the standards of the foreign regulatory authority in question,” Hamilton will say, according to a sneak peek of his testimony provided to MT. But, he will add, the FAA can’t “efficiently complete these critical validation activities without support from Congress and a commitment by FAA senior leadership to make this work a priority. Type certificate validation by other governments cannot be viewed as a secondary or lower priority function of the FAA.” IT’S WEDNESDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO’s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports — and the “Eisenmeower” interstate highway system.

Follow our Spotify playlist. SPICER: INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT WILL ‘PREVENT THE NEXT DISASTER’: Spicer also said Tuesday that the problems with the Oroville Dam’s spillways are a “textbook example” of why lawmakers should pass a large-scale infrastructure bill. “Dams, bridges, roads and all ports around the country have fallen into disrepair,” Spicer said. “In order to prevent the next disaster, we’ll pursue the president’s vision for an overhaul of our nation’s crumbling infrastructure.” NO INFRASTRUCTURE VALENTINE: House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster delivered a message Tuesday that’s already clear to the transpo world: A big legislative package isn’t going to happen right away. “You’re not going to see an infrastructure [bill] in the next month or two,” Shuster said at a National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners meeting. He also mentioned that he met with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Monday. Another tidbit from Shuster: National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn will lead the White House’s infrastructure team. We already knew DJ Gribbin was picked as special assistant to the president for infrastructure. ** A message from BPC’s Executive Council on Infrastructure: Our council and partners—NGA, SIFMA, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, North America’s Building Trades Unions, NAM, Business Roundtable, and others—all agree. Fixing America’s infrastructure is a national priority. As business and industry leaders, we follow shared principles: http://infrastructurecouncil.org/coalition ** IN NEED OF SOME TLC: More than 55,000 bridges across the country are considered “structurally deficient,” according to an American Road and Transportation Builders Association review of 2016 DOT data. Of those bridges, about 1,900 are on interstates. “While these bridges may not be imminently unsafe, they are in need of attention,” according to ARTBA. The list of bridges deemed structurally deficient has only shrunk by 0.5 percent in a year. Over 40 percent of bridges nationwide are more than four decades old and, during that period of time, they haven’t undergone “major reconstruction.” ARE YOU THERE, DOT? IT’S ME, MT: Chao has been on the job for two weeks, but nary a peep has come from HQ on staff hires. We had the scoop for you on chief of staff Michael Britt, and we know former Trump campaign staffer W. Kirk Bell is DOT’s White House liaison. But tell us: Who has been hired in your office over the past few weeks? Any fellow staffers getting shuffled around or going elsewhere? Tell us what’s happening: bgurciullo@politico.com and lgardner@politico.com. ALPA: HUERTA, YOU’RE AMAZING JUST THE WAY YOU ARE: The Air Line Pilots Association’s president said Tuesday that while it is “very flattering” that Trump believes a pilot would perhaps be best in the role of FAA administrator, his organization wouldn’t go so far as to say that experience as a pilot should be a “prerequisite.” Tim Canoll told reporters that ALPA wants an FAA chief who can “collaborate with industry,” who is “an outstanding communicator” and who has a “long-term vision.” And he praised Administrator Michael Huerta, who isn’t a pilot. “I think he’s done a great job,” Canoll said. “And I believe his ability to navigate some very tricky and difficult issues and keep us focused primarily on safety — this entire world of everything going on in aviation, they haven’t lost sight that safety is their first objective.” WE’LL BE SAFE ENOUGH ONCE WE MAKE THE JUMP TO HYPERSPACE: Harrison Ford accidentally landed his private plane on a taxiway Monday at John Wayne Airport in California, NBC News reports. He flew right over an American Airlines 737 holding more than 100 passengers. Ford is on tape asking air traffic controllers: “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” The FAA is now investigating the incident. As NBC points out, Ford has been in plane and helicopter accidents before. NOT ALL (BAGS) WHO WANDER ARE LOST: Domestic airlines reporting flight data to DOT registered record-low rates in 2016 for cancellations, mishandled luggage and passengers getting bumped from flights, the department said Tuesday. Our Lauren Gardner has the breakdown: Carriers “canceled 1.17 percent of their flights in 2016, compared to 1.54 percent the previous year.” More by the numbers: Airlines “fielded 2.7 reports per 1,000 passengers about lost, damaged or delayed bags in 2016, DOT said in its latest airline consumer report, a decrease from 3.13 reports in 2015 and the lowest annual rate since the department began keeping that data in September 1987,” Lauren writes. And they also brought down the rate at which they bump passengers from oversold flights to 0.62 per 10,000 customers — the previous low was 0.72 in 2002. CARMAKERS TO STATES: HANDS OFF THE NO-HANDS WHEEL: Automakers reiterated worries Tuesday about the potential for a patchwork of state regulations on driverless cars despite federal guidance unveiled last year that aimed to prevent exactly that, our Kathryn A. Wolfe reports. Anders Karrberg, vice president of government affairs for Volvo, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that lawmakers should “encourage” NHTSA to update its policy on automated vehicles “with an explicit request that states refrain” from regulating or passing laws on driverless cars. If not now, when? Members really wanted automakers to let them know when they expect to have fully autonomous cars ready for primetime, but most weren’t ready to make predictions. Volvo was, though — Karrberg said the company is eyeing 2021. SURVEY SAYS … everything you were expecting from a poll of Metrorail riders. Maryland Democratic Rep. John Delaney conducted an online survey of Metro users over the past few weeks to get their takes on the system’s safety, service and reliability. The results? Decidedly middling. Tough love: Respondents were able to include specific feedback on their experiences, running the gamut from acknowledging the hard choices Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld has had to make (he’s “really do[ing] some good things and is making some difficult decisions for the better”) to throwing some major mid-Atlantic shade (“DC Metro is by far the worst transportation system I have ever used and that includes New Jersey”). Then there was this gem, from a forlorn rider who’s willing to open up his or her heart again — maybe: “I want to love metro again. I'm very willing and very forgiving but it's gotta actually improve for me to start the forgiveness process.” SHIFTING GEARS: Timothy Martin, who served as Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.)’s legislative director, is now at WilmerHale in its public policy and legislative affairs. (h/t POLITICO Playbook) THE AUTOBAHN: — “Sponsored signs coming to a highway near you? Not so fast.” USA Today. — “Judge gives initial OK to deal for cheating VWs.” The Associated Press. — “Why it might be harder than Trump thinks to defend the travel ban in court.” POLITICO. — “Study: Most drivers, not just young, are taking risks.” The Associated Press. — “Barra's move to sell Opel signals a deeper change at GM.” Reuters. — “How does your commute compare to others in D.C.?

Our council and partners want Congress and the administration to know: 1. Infrastructure—including transportation, energy, water and wastewater, and broadband—must be a national priority. 2. Robust, reliable, long-term federal funding is essential. 3. The U.S. should unleash the resources of the private sector as partners in addressing our infrastructure needs. 4. The U.S. should adopt policies to deliver modern infrastructure more quickly and at less cost. By following these principles, Congress and the new administration can built bipartisan support to address our critical infrastructure needs: http://infrastructurecouncil.org/coalition ** « View Archives Authors: Brianna Gurciullo bgurciullo@politico.com @brigurciullo Lauren Gardner lgardner@politico.com @Gardner_LM About The Author Brianna Gurciullo is a transportation reporter for POLITICO Pro and the writer of Morning Transportation.

By Mary-Ann Russon February 15, 2017 14:31 GMT The Boeing 737 MAX is a new family of single-aisle aeroplanes that improves on the original 737 Next Generation family that was first launched in 1994Boeing Commercial airlines love the Boeing 737, which is one of the smallest jetliners that aerospace manufacturer Boeing makes, but there are several things about the plane that could be improved, such as its fuel efficiency. Since everyone likes the size of the plane just fine, instead of designing a completely different jetliner, Boeing has focused on upgrading the 737 to make it better than before, and so the narrow-body twin-engine jet airliner Boeing 737 MAX was born. Test flights are now underway and the first new planes will be delivered to airlines from May, but for now, join IBTimes UK as we bring you everything you need to know about this exciting new jetliner. Boeing 737 MAX: Greater passenger capacity The Boeing 737 MAX is now undergoing test flights and will be delivered in May. Here's everything you need to know about Boeing's latest narrow-body twin-engine jet airlinerBoeing The Boeing 737 MAX series of planes is similar to the 737-700, -800 and -900ER, which were the bestselling members of the Boeing 737 Next Generation family. The 737 MAX 7 and the 737 MAX 8 can hold up to 172 passengers, with two more rows than the 737-700. The 737 MAX 200 can seat up to 200 passengers and the 737 MAX 9 can seat 220 passengers, because the aeroplanes come with a much longer fuselage. Boeing 737 MAX: Much more fuel efficient The drag due to friction from the airflow over the winglet is one of the main detractors from efficient airflow, but the 737 MAX winglet is designed to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiencyBoeing To make the 737 MAX much more fuel efficient, Boeing had designed a winglet that has a split tip, known as the Boeing Advanced Technology (AT) Winglet. On typical commercial jetliners that don't have winglets, the air flow over the tip of each wing is forced back when the plane is travelling at high speed, causing vortices that create lift-induced drag and lower the wing's efficiency. Boeing has designed a new winglet that features an upper aerofoil (the top part of the winglet) that provides inward, upward and slightly forward lift, while the lower aerofil (the bottom portion of the winglet) is able to generate vertical and slightly forward lift angled away from the fuselage, so the drag is reduced. With smoother airflow, 20% less fuel is needed to propel the aeroplane forward. Boeing 737 MAX: Streamlined cabin design The Boeing 737 MAX will feature larger windows, full-length sculpted sidewalls and lights that emulate the time of the day that the plane is flying throughBoeing Most single-aisle narrow body jetliners on the market can take 160 passengers, but in order to accommodate 200 seats on the 737 MAX 200, three out of eight galley trolleys have been removed, an extra cabin door has been added and the airframe is 2.2m longer than the 737 MAX's rival, the Airbus A320neo. The seats and cabin have also been designed with the new Boeing Sky Interior, which is more attractive and less bare-bones than the current Boeing 737. There are larger windows, full-length sculpted sidewalls, lights that emulate the time of day and the airline operator's colours, as well as more comfortable seats. American Airlines has announced that on its Boeing 737 MAX planes, there won't be any seatback monitors for in-flight entertainment, due to 90% of passengers bringing their own devices on flights. Instead, the carrier will offer free TV shows and movies that can be accessed via the plane's intranet and streamed directly to devices, without requiring the user to pay for a premium Wi-Fi connection. Boeing 737 MAX: Able to cope with extreme weather conditions Landing during a storm, in gale-force winds or in snowy conditions, isn't easy for most jets. When dealing with surface water on runways, larger aeroplanes such as the Airbus A380 or the Boeing 787 Dreamliner tend to cope better and generate less of a splash as they have a much larger wingspan and length than a small aeroplane. However, Boeing has completely redesigned the 737 MAX landing gear, to the extent that when tested to land in a pool containing over 3,000 gallons of water, the splash that the 737 MAX made during tests in January was much smaller than the original 737, and especially smaller than the much larger planes. Boeing 737 MAX: Lots of orders, but they won't be ready for a while Boeing has been marketing the 737 MAX for the last three years and now has 3,605 orders as of 31 December 2016. The increased demand from low-budget carriers has seen a surge in orders for the single-aisle 737 MAX. Boeing now has a total of 707 customers for the 737 MAX from at least 21 countries. However, none of the jetliners have yet been delivered – the first units will be delivered to launch partner Norwegian Air Shuttle only in May.

Tarun Shukla Jet Airways had ordered 75 Boeing Max planes in 2014. It will have a window this year to book additional slots. Photo: AFP Bengaluru: Naresh Goyal-promoted Jet Airways Ltd may order at least 50 Boeing 737 Max planes valued at about $5 billion this year to expand its market and secure spots in the aircraft supply chain, a top executive from the US aircraft maker said. Jet Airways with a 114-plane fleet has 17% of the domestic passenger market share and a sizable international presence, but it has been losing domestic market share to rivals like IndiGo, which now controls about 40% of the local market. “Jet will certainly look at a re-order for the Max. I would say minimum 50 and then you go higher than that. The reason I say 50 on the basis of growth and replacement (of Jet airways’ current fleet and orders). However, they might go beyond 50, based on what SpiceJet has done or IndiGo has done or even GoAir has done, a relatively smaller airline in operations than Jet. So, Jet may go for a higher figure but I would say 50 at least,” Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president sales, Asia Pacific and India of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Mint in an interview on the sidelines of the Aero India air show here. IndiGo has nearly 400 fuel-efficient Airbus A320neo planes on order, while GoAir recently firmed up its order of 72 Airbus A320neo planes, taking its order book to 144 aircraft. SpiceJet which had similarly ordered 42 Boeing B737 MAX planes in 2014 ordered more planes in January taking its order book to 100 planes, with options to firm up more at later date. Jet had similarly ordered 75 Boeing Max planes in 2014. It will have a window this year to book additional slots. “They have to do sometime this year,” Keskar said, referring to the supply chain. It is not to difficult to see why: There is growth and incoming competition . India has close to 450 planes in service and about 900 planes on order, indicating the growth that lies ahead. Indian airlines flew 99.88 million passengers in 2016 compared with 51 million in 2010, according to government data. Indian airlines were expected to touch 100 million passengers in 2016-17, a figure almost reached in 2016 with 23.18% growth. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) too expects India to displace the UK as the third-largest aviation market by 2026. With all other airlines inducting Airbus neos starting this year, Jet will need a compelling proportion to compete on costs. Jet fuel prices account for more than 45-55% of an airline’s revenue in India. A 4% reduction in fuel costs adds around 2% to the operating margins of airlines. Max and Neo promise as much as 20% fuel savings. Keskar also said Boeing will deliver a “wave of Max” from next year to its customers Jet and SpiceJet from the previous orders they have placed. In 2018, Boeing will deliver about 12-18 planes or about 2-3 a month from third quarter. This year, it will deliver four more Dreamliners to Air India followed by three long haul Boeing 777s in the first quarter of 2018. The Tata-Singapore Airlines’ venture Vistara is also expected to order wide body planes as it gears up for its international operations next year. “Vistara has one and half years to go. We have briefed them,” Keskar said, adding he hopes to pitch for that deal when it becomes available.

Women in science and engineering were once hidden figures. You may have seen the movie highlighting their struggles. CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) - Workers at Boeing South Carolina have voted not to unionize under the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.  According to Boeing officials, 74% of total votes cast on Wednesday were against joining the IAM.  Officials say there were 2097 votes for no and 731 votes for yes.  Both Boeing and the union spoke out about the results, and both said they’re looking ahead to the future. "The outcome is not what I was hoping for, but this is the labor movement," said  IAM lead organizer Mike Evans."It isn't easy and we will continue to do our best to help workers in the workplace." “We will continue to move forward as one team,” said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina following the vote. “We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team and to developing new opportunities." Live 5 News The vote was held under the oversight of the National Labor Relations Board and 3,000 employees were eligible to have their say.   Union spokespersons also said there were no voting irregularities. Many advertisements have been run from both sides.  Proponents said employees would get respect on the job, better wages and consistency in unionizing. "Workers at Boeing deserve to be treated fairly and they deserve to be treated with respect," Lead IAM organizer Mike Evans said when he announced the vote last month. "Over the past year and a half, management at Boeing has repeatedly failed to make improvements they promised workers. Instead, workplace policies remain inconsistent and raises remain subjective. Boeing workers deserve better than that."  Boeing wanted employees to vote no, citing expensive union dues and saying IAM   does not have the workers' best interests at heart. Saying "no” would allow workers to keep their voice and their direct working relationship with the company, according to Boeing.  "Boeing believes firmly that a union is not in the best interest of Boeing South Carolina," Boeing Vice President and General Manager Joan Robinson-Berry said at a press conference hours after IAM's announcement. "That's been our consistent position and we will never change that."  Voters marked their ballots in secret, according to the National Labor Relations Board.  RIGHT NOW: Boeing SC workers have begun casting secret ballots on whether to unionize: https://t.co/phPrdgHrc3 #chsnews #scnews pic.twitter.com/1PxjhmGAo0— Live5News (@Live5News) February 15, 2017 The ten polling locations opened at various times, according to the election notice posted on Boeing's website.  The first time the IAM scheduled a union vote at Boeing SC was in 2015.  However, union officials said they canceled the vote because of a "toxic environment."  According to officials, they came to the decision following home visits with more than 1,700 Boeing workers.  Moving forward, Boeing will roll out its first 787-10 on Friday.   “Friday we will mark the most recent incredible accomplishment in the proud history of the BSC team with the rollout of the first 787-10,” said Robinson-Berry. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event.” President Donald Trump is expected to be in attendance at the ceremony.  Copyright 2017 WCSC.

REUTERS By DiversityInc Staff / February 15, 2017 Boeing (a DiversityInc Noteworthy Company) has announced the launch of a new Nacelle and Flight-Control Surface Exchange Program. It provides airlines an integrated and economical solution, while building on Boeing’s successful history of exchange programs. Under the program, customers can exchange nacelle and flight-control surface parts that need repair or overhaul from a certified pool that Boeing maintains throughout its global network. This eliminates the need for customers to contract, schedule, manage and own or lease these parts. “Our customers have asked for more flexibility and we’ve heard them,” said Lynne Hopper, vice president of Parts Solutions. “This offering is one more example of how Boeing creates high-quality, flexible solutions that make life more convenient for our customers, allowing them to mix and match procurement approaches ranging from ownership to pooling to leasing to exchanging.” Parts distributed through the program represent all Boeing models and are updated to the latest configurations, incorporating all applicable service bulletins and airworthiness directives. Another benefit of an exchange is that customers only need to take an airplane out of service once, reducing maintenance needs. When a similar part is leased, the plane must be taken out of service for both removal and installation. Boeing is a leader in providing 24/7 support and service to the global aviation industry. Boeing’s parts portfolio is the most complete in the industry, with total stock of over 400,000 part numbers and over 10,000 parts shipped daily. In addition to its parts business, Boeing offers the industry’s largest portfolio of services, including retrofits and modifications, subscription-based maintenance programs, engineering support, crew training, route planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data analytics and software to enhance airlines and leasing company operations.

(AP) " The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Workers at a Boeing plant in South Carolina have rejected an effort by the Machinists to unionize a plant. The National Labor Relations Board on Wednesday released the results of the vote. Nearly 3,000 production workers were eligible to vote in the balloting at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. For weeks, both Boeing and the union bought billboards, print ads, television and radio ads, urgings workers to vote for or against the unionization effort. The Machinists initially tried to unionize the plant in 2015 but called off that vote because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. The vote comes two days before President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Boeing plant for the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. ___ 6:30 p.m. Counting is underway for a vote that will determine if thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will be represented by a union.

McMaster has only been in office a few weeks, after former Gov. Nikki Haley accepted a job as ambassador to the United Nations.

(Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) FindTheCompany | Graphiq Posted: Wednesday, February 15, 2017 8:03 pm | Updated: 8:30 pm, Wed Feb 15, 2017. Boeing workers maintain South's anti-unionization history Associated Press | NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Thailand Press Release News search General Business Entertainment IT Stcoks Lifestyle Telecom Energy Properties Automotive Heathcare Events ฝากข่าวประชาสัมพันธ์ A YEAR OF SUSTAINED GROWTH FOR ETIHAD AIRWAYS IN 2016 AS IT EVOLVES INTO ETIHAD AVIATION GROUP Travel and Lifestyle Press Releases Wednesday February 15, 2017 15:18 Bangkok--15 Feb--TQPR Etihad Airways carried 18.5 million guests Etihad Airways delivered another year of sustained growth in 2016, helped by new aircraft, additional frequencies and the introduction of further world-class products. The airline carried 18.5 million guests during the year, up six per cent on 2015. The airline was also part of the evolution of Etihad Aviation Group, a wider aviation and tourism business which now also includes Etihad Airways Engineering; Airline Equity Partners; Etihad Airport Services and Hala Group. The formation of Etihad Aviation Group was announced in May 2016. During the year, Etihad Airways operated more than 109,000 scheduled passenger and cargo flights spanning around 446 million kilometres and 112 destinations. Capacity, measured in available seat kilometres (ASK), grew by nine per cent and passenger traffic, measured by revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), rose by eight per cent. The average load factor held steady at 79 per cent. Etihad Airways' fleet of 119 aircraft is one of the youngest and most environmentally-friendly in the industry, with an average age of 6 years. During the year, the airline took delivery of 10 aircraft: three Airbus A380s, five Boeing 787s and two Boeing 777-200 cargo freighters. An additional 12 aircraft are set for delivery in 2017, including nine Boeing 787s, two Airbus A380s and one A330-200 freighter. Etihad holds the strongest credit rating in the aviation industry (A by Fitch), demonstrating the strength of its successful business model which is widely acknowledged by the international financial community. James Hogan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Etihad Aviation Group (EAG), said: "2016 saw sustained growth in a very tough business environment. This is where Etihad Airways' superior products and services show their true value and where the strength of the EAG business model comes into effect through its diversity of businesses, cost effective synergies and global spread of risk. Most importantly, in 2016 we were able to introduce our new Group structure, which positions this business for long-term growth and development." Etihad Airways launched Venice in Italy, Rabat in Morocco and Sabiha Gokcen in Turkey as new destinations in 2016. The much-admired Airbus A380 began serving Mumbai and Melbourne, and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was deployed on new routes, including Perth, Shanghai, Johannesburg and Dusseldorf. The airline added a fifth daily flight on the Doha route, an extra daily flight to Cairo and Kozhikode, and increased frequencies to Dammam, Manila and Tehran. Etihad Airways carried more than 76 per cent of the total passengers who travelled to and from Abu Dhabi International Airport in 2016. With the addition of the airline's equity partners that operate flights into the UAE capital, the combined total rises to 86 per cent of passenger traffic at the airport. The airline's codeshare and equity partnerships delivered 5.5 million passengers onto Etihad Airways' flights, an increase of nine per cent over the five million passengers in 2015. The airline launched new codeshare agreements with Avianca Colombia, Avianca Brasil, Kulula, Precision Air and Montenegro Airlines. Etihad Airways' existing codeshares with airberlin, Alitalia, Brussels Airlines, Flynas, Jet Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Hong Kong Airlines, and Virgin Australia were significantly expanded. Etihad Airways also launched new interline agreements with Lufthansa, Pegasus, Malindo and LATAM. As a result, the airline now offers a combined passenger and cargo network of nearly 600 destinations through its 188 interline and 53 codeshare partnerships. Etihad Airways' equity partner network, including airberlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Alitalia, Jet Airways, Virgin Australia and Etihad Regional, represents the seventh largest global grouping of airlines. In 2016, the combined fleet of 705 aircraft carried 126.6 million guests. In November, Etihad Airways Engineering dealt with a record breaking week of heavy maintenance at its state-of-the-art facility in Abu Dhabi. Aircraft from six of the seven partner airlines were worked on by the company's 3,000-strong team. During 2016, Etihad Cargo carried 592,700 tonnes, which was flat year-on-year. Etihad Cargo expanded its freighter services to several new markets, including Columbus Rickenbacker, Ohio in the US; East Midlands and London Stansted in the UK; Copenhagen; Brussels; Addis Ababa and Casablanca in Africa; Colombo; Muscat; and Zhengzhou in China. This brings the number of freighter-only destinations to 15. Strong growth was achieved within the group's loyalty businesses with over three million new members joining the Etihad Guest, MilleMiglia (Alitalia), topbonus (airberlin) and JetPrivilege programmes, which now provide benefits to nearly 20 million members. The Etihad Aviation Group workforce, as of 31 December, stood at 26,635 employees, representing 150 nationalities. The airline continued to prioritise its Emiratisation programme, and in November, celebrated the graduation of 310 future leaders from the Future Leaders Programmes, a strong indication of the company's commitment to investing in its people. There are currently more than 3,000 Emirati employees – 52 per cent of whom are women, including engineers and pilots. Mr Hogan added: "2017 will be another challenging year. We will continue to expand prudently and efficiently, reflecting the nature of the economic environment. We remain optimistic and have every belief that our robust business model will succeed and, most importantly, stand the test of time." 2016 was a year of impressive accolades for Etihad Airways - the pinnacle being the Skytrax Certified 5-Star Airline Rating - the most sought after quality status in the airline industry. Etihad was also named the 'World's Leading Airline' at the World Travel Awards for the eighth consecutive year and collected the coveted Crystal Cabin Award for the Boeing 787 First Class cabin design. During the year, Etihad Guest marked its 10th anniversary and reached 4.7 million members.

For the Navy, unhappy with the performance of the naval version of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), Boeing's F-18s Super Hornet and Dassualt's Gripen are forerunners for the spot. However, US President's Donald Trump's 'America First' policy has raised speculation about the American companies' ability to adhere to Modi's Make in India policies, especially shifting manufacturing to India. Thom Breckenridge, vice-president, global sales - India, Boeing, however, said it was early for any speculation of policy changes. Although he didn't comment on the possible impact of the Boeing's abilities to deliver as per Indian requirements, he said Boeing would work with the Indian government in a manner similar to their cooperation with the US government. The latest variant of the aircraft was introduced in 2007 and the US Navy expects it to be operational till the 2040s. The Super Hornet is the largest operating naval fighter aircraft and has over 700 deliveries of Super Hornet across the world. "Cost per hour becomes an important issue for any Navy. US government public accountability office data shows the Super Hornet has the lowest cost per flight hour," he said. Boeing has 35 direct suppliers and 120 indirect suppliers of various components of Super Hornets. "With our scale and presence in India, we will be able to provide a compelling Make in India offer," he said, despite speculation on the Trump regime's policies. While Boeing is harping on their reliability, their competition Saab Gripen is promising a 6th-7th generation fighter planes. At the same time, many are still batting for the LCA naval version; recently, VK Saraswat, member of Niti Aayog and former DRDO chief, said the LCA Navy is as good as any aircraft and the Indian Navy should support the project.

Delivery of the single-aisle 737 MAX models, which replace the current 737 "NG" introduced in 1997, is crucial for Boeing to hit the financial targets it has promised investors and to offset slowing output of some of its largest jets such as the 777 and 747. Airlines want the MAX because it burns significantly less fuel than current models. The world’s largest plane maker is creating up to five MAX versions, while planning to increase output to 57 planes a month in 2019, from 42 a month at present. The first MAX model in production, known as the MAX-8, is on track to reach customers by mid-year. "We are anticipating our certification of the airplane within a matter of days-weeks," said Keith Leverkuhn, the 737 general manager. The stamp of approval by the US federal aviation administration would come about a year after the MAX-8’s first flight and allow Boeing to begin delivering the US$110 million, 162-seat jetliner in the second quarter, he said. Deliveries trigger the bulk of airline payments. Norwegian Air Shuttle will be one of the first airlines to fly the plane commercially, probably ahead of launch customer Southwest Airlines, which was first to order the MAX but is taking longer to put it into service. Boeing expects the MAX to account for as much as 15 per cent of the 500 or more 737s it expects to deliver in 2017, rising to nearly 100 per cent by 2020. Boeing on Monday showed off the first 737 MAX-9 sitting near the end of the assembly line at its factory in Renton, Washington. The nearly completed jet, which carries a list price of $116.6m and seats 178, will undergo about nine months of testing after first flight in April. Boeing is mulling an even larger version, the 737 MAX-10, to take on rival Airbus, which has had strong sales of its A321neo that is a larger competitor to the MAX-9. The MAX-10 would be 1.68 metres longer than the MAX-9, with the same engine thrust. The major change will be the landing gear, which must be taller to accommodate the longer fuselage. Boeing expects to test various landing gear designs this year "to see which one … is going to be the best solution," Mr Leverkuhn said. Boeing is about 90 per cent finished with design drawings for the smallest version, the 737 MAX-7. A high-density MAX-200, with seating for 200 passengers, rounds out the model line. Sales of Boeing’s larger twin-aisle planes have slowed sharply and the company is cutting output of the profitable 777 by 40 per cent this year. It will rely on the 737 and 787 to make up a large part of the financial difference. Introducing new models while increasing production rates requires Boeing to solve any factory issues quickly. So far, Mr Leverkuhn said, "the hours to build the MAX are meeting our expectation". * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Sydney Airport profits rise amid concerns over new city passenger hub Air France-KLM finds unexpected lift as profit beats forecasts Boeing and Airbus jetliner demand to fall but military aircraft to cushion blow India and Russia close in on helicopter manufacturing deal MOST VIEWED Business | All Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer Mubadala Investment Company set for next step on integration path Toyota recalls thousands of hydrogen-powered Mirais Dubai Land Department to introduce standard property lease form Property broker Asteco expects Abu Dhabi rents to fall Defence sector in focus ahead of Idex and Navdex in Abu Dhabi next week Five do’s and don’ts for Apple’s next iPhone Dubai landlord living overseas needs to evict tenant who hasn’t paid rent for six months Boeing and Airbus jetliner demand to fall but military aircraft to cushion blow RAK Ceramics’ profit hit amid building activity slowdown More Most Viewed UAE ambassador dies of injuries sustained in Afghanistan terror attack Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer UAE weather: heavy rain expected as unstable conditions persist Mubadala Investment Company set for next step on integration path Parents, not schools, are struggling Sheikh Mohammed attends ceremony; Sheikh Mansour chairs Mubadala meeting - in pictures Anniesa Hasibuan’s hijabs fit for royalty at New York Fashion Week The end of the two-state solution - killed off by Trump and Netanyahu Rouhani meets rulers of Oman and Kuwait to reduce Iran-GCC tensions What La La Land tells us about Abu Dhabi More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Rouhani meets rulers of Oman and Kuwait to reduce Iran-GCC tensions Property broker Asteco expects Abu Dhabi rents to fall About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Photographer: Bryan R. Smith/Pool via Bloomberg After a rocky start, Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg appears to have gained the ear of President Donald Trump. The U.S. planemaker was one of Trump’s first post-election corporate targets, and a tweet about soaring Air Force One costs briefly tanked the company’s shares in December. But the Twitter tirade also gave Muilenburg an opening to press the case of the largest U.S. exporter -- and the 1.5 million jobs at its jet-equipment suppliers -- in meetings with Trump. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up The CEO’s entreaties seem to have worked. Trump has emerged as a booster for Boeing’s F/A-18 fighter jets and voiced support to lawmakers for a key Boeing initiative: re-opening the U.S. Export-Import Bank for major deals. Trump will fly to Boeing’s South Carolina factory to attend an event Friday showcasing the newest 787 Dreamliner, where he’s expected to make an announcement about the federal export credit agency. “The supply chain for Boeing doesn’t just run through the state of Washington,” said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies. The Ex-Im Bank is “a door opener.” Supporting the lender would put Trump at odds with some fellow Republicans, who view the bank as providing corporate welfare.  Boeing Bank Ex-Im has been dubbed the “Bank of Boeing” for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by airlines unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it’s been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10 million because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a Senate committee since 2015. Trump is committed to reestablishing a quorum on the bank’s board, U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, said after a Feb. 9 bipartisan lunch meeting between the president and lawmakers. That’s needed to allow the bank to lend more as it faces a backlog of as much as $30 billion in projects. Senator Richard Shelby, an opponent of the bank, had blocked nominees to the board over the past two years as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. In January the Alabama Republican moved from the Banking to chair the Rules Committee, removing one hurdle for giving Ex-Im a quorum. Boeing and General Electric Co. have argued that without the financing, they would face a competitive disadvantage against companies in Europe, Canada, Brazil, China and Russia, who don’t face similar restrictions. Private Banks With the bank hobbled, U.S. manufacturers have been forced to turn to private banks or export credit banks from other countries where they operate to help customers finance big-ticket purchases. Boeing has lost or faces delays on three commercial satellite sales because of the lack of export credit, said Kate Bernard, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-based manufacturer. “It’s put us at a significant competitive disadvantage,” Bernard said. Critics argue that the Ex-Im Bank’s guarantees are heavily weighted toward a few large companies and the U.S. government could potentially be on the hook if borrowers default. In 2014, 40 percent of all authorizations went to Boeing alone, according to an analysis by George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. Other beneficiaries range from GE to Bechtel Group Inc. “I don’t blame companies like Boeing, Bechtel and GE for using Ex-Im or benefiting from Ex-Im,” said Diane Katz, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which favors limited government. “But we don’t have to give them the opportunity to do that on the backs of taxpayers.” GE Contracts GE had contracts valued at $11 billion that required Ex-Im Bank financing in 2015, when reauthorization of the bank lapsed. The company rushed to form partnerships with export credit agencies in Canada, the U.K., France and other countries to meet those needs, said Una Pulizzi, a spokeswoman for GE. A representative of Bechtel didn’t respond to a request for comment left outside normal business hours. Ex-Im Bank’s quarterly default rate was 0.27 percent at the end of September, well below the mandate by Congress. The bank is also profitable, returning $284 million to the U.S. Treasury last year and $675 million in 2014 when it was fully operational. The lender estimates it supported almost 165,000 U.S. jobs in 2014. If U.S. contractors can’t find Ex-Im Bank financing for U.S.-made equipment needed on an overseas projects, they will shift purchases to a country where the guarantees are available, said William Schubert, president of International Trade & Transportation Inc., which helps borrowers find government-backed credit. “When that happens, all the U.S. procurement disappears,” Schubert said. “I know people who are unemployed right now because the bank is down, and that’s unfortunate.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The state’s business lobby and political leaders have lent Boeing a hand in its anti-union campaign. (Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times) Boeing has cause for confidence about staying union-free in South Carolina, where a previous attempt to organize its aircraft factory fizzled. But when 3,000 employees vote Wednesday on joining the Machinists, it could be close and the company isn’t leaving anything to chance. Share story By Josh Eidelson Bloomberg News At a Monday rally in a North Charleston hotel conference room, South Carolina State Rep. David Mack looked out on about 100 supporters of the longshot campaign to unionize the city’s Boeing plant. Noting the aggressive opposition from management and the state business lobby, including a battery of anti-union commercials on local TV, the Charleston Democrat quipped: “After seeing some of those commercials, I was almost afraid to come in here.” Boeing has ample cause for confidence about staying union-free in South Carolina, the least unionized state in the U.S., where a previous attempt to organize the aircraft factory fizzled before a vote. But the company isn’t leaving anything to chance Wednesday, when about 3,000 employees are eligible to vote on whether to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Previous stories Jan. 20: War of words starts as Machinists union files for organizing vote at Boeing South Carolina The election is the latest round in a long-running, frequently ugly, unusually politicized struggle between the company and the union, which represents about 30,000 Boeing workers in the Seattle area.

It was freedom from strikes and escalating wages, a Boeing executive said in 2010, that was the overriding motivation for the company to place its new production line for 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina. The union brought a charge to the National Labor Relations Board alleging retaliation. The NLRB’s general counsel issued a complaint, sparking a firestorm of criticism from Republicans, including then-Governor Nikki Haley and several presidential candidates. The IAM agreed to drop the case upon reaching a new contract for its Washington members. Boeing’s southward shift was oft-touted by business and political leaders such as Haley, who saw union-avoidance as such a selling point in luring investment that she said she’d discourage unionized companies from coming to her state, so they didn’t “taint the water” there. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the plant Friday. “If the Machinists won at Boeing, it would be an earthquake in the South,” said University of California, Santa Barbara, labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein. So Boeing and its allies are pulling out all the stops to make sure that doesn’t happen. The jet maker ran 485 local TV spots between Jan. 31 and Feb. 6 urging workers to vote against the IAM, according to data from advertising tracker Kantar Media/CMAG. Additional anti-union ads from the South Carolina Manufacturers Institute had aired 350 times by Feb. 6, including one that ran locally during the Super Bowl. Boeing has also deployed radio, billboards, YouTube videos, social media, emails and mailings to reach its employees, according to the union. The IAM says Boeing has been pressing its case aggressively in the workplace as well, including through mandatory meetings, casual conversations on the shop floor, TV screens placed in break rooms, free anti-union T-shirts, and a giant stack of food, diapers and clothing labeled as all the things employees could buy for the same cost as annual union dues. A postcard titled “The Truth About IAM Wage Claims,” one of several the IAM says have been distributed by management at morning meetings, urges employees to “Just say NO to the IAM” and features an image of Pinocchio. On Monday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO and President Kevin McAllister joined Boeing South Carolina general manager Joan Robinson-Berry for group meetings with employees, at which a Boeing spokesperson said they discussed “the importance of their decision” about unionization. Workers say the executives suggested unionization would mean giving away all of their rights to the union and could ruin the plant’s competitiveness. “They were threatening us basically” through “innuendo,” said employee Don Winckles. “They take the worst possible scenario and throw it out there, and a lot of people buy it, even though those people don’t like the way things are now.” The Machinists union says Boeing has taken classic labor-busting tactics to unusual extremes. “It’s on steroids right now,” said Mike Evans, the lead organizer on the campaign. Along with stoking fears about dues and strikes, Evans said, managers have suggested to employees that if they unionized they could stop getting bonuses and their jobs could be moved to China. Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Merida said in an email that “we are not making threats or asking teammates how they will vote or what they think of the union.” Under federal law, employers aren’t allowed to threaten to punish employees if they unionize, but have leeway to make negative predictions about what could happen afterward. Merida said Boeing is “making every effort” to inform employees that the union’s “motivation for their interest is financial and could be strongly influenced by their commitment to protect jobs in Washington state.” In 2014, Washington state employees narrowly approved a contract freezing their pensions to get Boeing to build its 777X jet there. The IAM, whose demonstrated ability to disrupt Puget Sound production once brought great clout at the bargaining table, has been struggling to regain leverage. In 2015, when the IAM petitioned the NLRB for an election to unionize the South Carolina plant, Haley used Facebook and Twitter, a radio ad for Boeing, and her State of the State address to urge employees to reject the union. Citing “misinformation” from Boeing and “unprecedented political interference,” the IAM withdrew its petition for an election five days before it had been scheduled to take place. While Haley has departed to serve as United Nations ambassador, Boeing still has friends ready to lend a hand. “Organized labor has no place in our state,” said Lewis Gossett, a former head of the state’s labor department. “A lot of like-minded companies don’t want to see them in South Carolina.” Gossett is president of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance and of its education arm, which is running ads comparing joining the IAM to gambling in a casino and suggesting the union president needs dues to fund his family members’ salaries. Gossett said the ads were launched without any input from Boeing officials, including the one who sits on the alliance’s board. The “VOTE NO” TV ads Boeing is running itself take a more positive tack, featuring employees talking about their child or their guitar, and saying “if you dream big with Boeing, you can go anywhere.” On Monday, the state’s senior U.S. senator, Lindsey Graham, told reporters that he’d urge employees to remember that “if we destroy the business model that led Boeing to South Carolina, this plant will not be able to grow,” according to the Charleston City Paper. The IAM has responded with ads of its own, featuring Boeing union members in Puget Sound sharing messages like, “You deserve the same benefits that we have.” But it says the company’s campaign has taken a toll, leaving some of its strong supporters too intimidated to talk to the media. “There’s a heavy fear factor here,” said Evans, who until last month was one of only two full-time organizers working on the campaign. He declined to share what percentage of the South Carolina facility’s eligible workforce signed the IAM’s petition for an NLRB election; only 30 percent was legally required. “A lot of people are afraid that if Boeing finds out they’re voting yes, that it will be against them,” said eight-year employee Kitt Johnson, who was disappointed more of his co-workers didn’t show up to Monday’s rally. “I’m hoping that that fear doesn’t blow into the election.” Given how aggressive companies’ anti-union campaigns can be, no union should count on employees who won’t show their support in public to vote for the union in private, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a senior lecturer at Cornell’s labor relations school. “If a worker does not come out and publicly say they’ll vote for the union, that means they also are not going to vote for the union.”   Bloomberg reporters Julie Johnsson ,Greg Giroux and John McCormick contributed to this report.

"The great boom is over," Richard Aboulafia, analyst at Teal Group, said at an industry conference near Seattle. "But I don’t see a bust cycle" unless there’s a trade war, he added. An industry slowdown has implications for investors and suppliers trying to anticipate the flow of orders as a guide the capacity they will need to meet changes in aircraft production. Multi-year backlogs of jetliner orders at both big plane makers will cushion the downturn, along with rising sales of military aircraft, especially spy and fighter planes as defence spending is expected to rise at least initially under the US president Donald Trump, he added. Higher interest rates and a possible border tax on imports could hurt the US aerospace industry, however, by causing the dollar to strengthen further, Mr Aboulafia said. Also, the risk of a major trade dispute is as high as at any time since Second World War, he added. A US trade dispute with China would likely benefit the European plane maker Airbus since China could easily retaliate against the US by curbing orders of Boeing planes, Aboulafia said. In the commercial aircraft market, a planned boost in output of single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft is likely to continue. The two plane makers plan to increase output by more than 30 per cent through the end of the decade and need the income from these high-volume assembly lines to hit their financial targets. "This is the part of the market where you’re going to see continued growth," he said. But twin-aisle aircraft face a much tougher future because there are more models competing while demand is declining. "Everyone wants too much from this market," he said, adding that orders are "plateauing". * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Sydney Airport profits rise amid concerns over new city passenger hub Air France-KLM finds unexpected lift as profit beats forecasts Boeing and Airbus jetliner demand to fall but military aircraft to cushion blow India and Russia close in on helicopter manufacturing deal MOST VIEWED Business | All Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer Mubadala Investment Company set for next step on integration path Toyota recalls thousands of hydrogen-powered Mirais Dubai Land Department to introduce standard property lease form Property broker Asteco expects Abu Dhabi rents to fall Defence sector in focus ahead of Idex and Navdex in Abu Dhabi next week Five do’s and don’ts for Apple’s next iPhone Dubai landlord living overseas needs to evict tenant who hasn’t paid rent for six months Boeing and Airbus jetliner demand to fall but military aircraft to cushion blow RAK Ceramics’ profit hit amid building activity slowdown More Most Viewed UAE ambassador dies of injuries sustained in Afghanistan terror attack Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer UAE weather: heavy rain expected as unstable conditions persist Mubadala Investment Company set for next step on integration path Parents, not schools, are struggling Sheikh Mohammed attends ceremony; Sheikh Mansour chairs Mubadala meeting - in pictures Anniesa Hasibuan’s hijabs fit for royalty at New York Fashion Week The end of the two-state solution - killed off by Trump and Netanyahu Rouhani meets rulers of Oman and Kuwait to reduce Iran-GCC tensions What La La Land tells us about Abu Dhabi More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Rouhani meets rulers of Oman and Kuwait to reduce Iran-GCC tensions Property broker Asteco expects Abu Dhabi rents to fall About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

REUTERS/Randall Hill prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C.: Boeing Co handily defeated a union drive by workers at the company's aircraft factory in South Carolina on Wednesday, as almost three-quarters of workers at the plant who voted rejected union representation. The secret ballot vote, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at polling locations throughout the North Charleston plant, was the first for Boeing and a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The NLRB said 74 percent of the 2,828 workers who cast ballots voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). “We will continue to move forward as one team,” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president in charge of Boeing South Carolina, said in the post. In a statement, IAM lead organizer Mike Evans said: “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation.” The results come just before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit Boeing's South Carolina plant on Friday, as the world's largest planemaker rolls out the first completed 787-10, the largest version of its Dreamliner. Any remarks Trump makes at the factory could bring into sharper focus his views on organized labor before he chooses appointees to fill vacant seats on the five-member NLRB. "I think he will cheer the 'no' vote," said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California Berkeley specializing in labor and the global economy. "I think he's going to make the case that he wants to see the plant succeed and do everything to create a more competitive environment." MORALE BLOW The loss was not seen as a surprise in a state with a strongly anti-union culture. South Carolina is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is highest with 23.6 percent. "It's a blow, but largely to morale more than anything practical," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. The vote preserves the status quo on the factory floor at Boeing in South Carolina and is unlikely to alter relations with the 30,000 IAM members at Boeing's factories near Seattle, Shaiken said. Boeing ran a hardball campaign against the IAM in South Carolina, which has been trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. The IAM canceled a vote at the Boeing plant in April 2015, claiming political interference from state officials. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. "Haley said South Carolina doesn't want or need unions," said Shaiken. "That creates an atmosphere where to vote 'yes' - in the minds of many workers - puts them at risk." The 26 percent of workers who supported the union showed the IAM had established a foothold, he added. "Can they build on it? That will be their challenge going forward." Under NLRB rules, the union must wait a minimum of 12 months before petitioning for another election. Boeing said the union was not needed because it is divisive, picks fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers out on costly strikes. President of the Seattle-area IAM local, Jon Holden, said Boeing's anti-union campaign was not a surprise and followed a strategy they had seen before. The Chicago-based company produced videos that aired heavily on local TV stations and were also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, told Reuters in an interview. Boeing invested US$750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent US$1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent.

Boeing, it just so happens, is a big fan of something called the Export-Import Bank. It's a trade-promoting agency that some Republicans have worked very hard to kill.  In fact, some senators have kept the bank only partially functional for the past year by refusing to approve people to run it. Trump is said to have a new soft spot for the agency, and he is expected to throw his support behind the Ex-Im Bank on Friday. Here's why.

Results of a vote released Wednesday show workers have rejected union representation. Updated 10 p.m. ET The International Association of Machinists says workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant have voted not to unionize. In a video on the union's Facebook page, lead organizer Mike Evans says the workers have decided "at this time they don't need representation," and he says the IAM respects the process. He tells workers that the company should "pay attention to your issues and make Boeing a better place, not just for a few, but for everybody." Boeing released a statement saying that 74 percent of employees who voted rejected the union, adding: ""We will continue to move forward as one team," said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of BSC. "We have a bright future ahead of us and we're eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team and to developing new opportunities. "Friday we will mark the most recent incredible accomplishment in the proud history of the BSC team with the rollout of the first 787-10," said Robinson-Berry. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event." President Trump is expected to visit the plant on Friday for that event. Alexandra Olgin of South Carolina Public Radio reported that the IAM had promised "nearly 3,000 workers at Boeing respect, wages and consistency. The IAM reports it represents 35,000 workers at 24 Boeing locations around the country." "The state has the lowest union membership rate in the country," Alexandra reported for NPR's All Things Considered. "Around Charleston, Boeing [had] billboards, T-shirts and ads criticizing the IAM. And the union [countered] with its own rallies and ads." Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

In the past three weeks, Trump has: staffed the White House, sent a dozen Cabinet nominees to the Senate, browbeat Boeing into cutting its price on a government contract, harangued American CEOs into keeping their plants in the United States, imposed a terrorist travel ban, met with foreign leaders and nominated a Supreme Court justice, among many other things. (And still our hero finds time to torment the media with his tweets!) What have congressional Republicans been doing? Scrapbooking? More than 90 percent of congressional Republicans kept their jobs after the 2016 election, so you can cross “staffing an entire branch of government” off the list. Only the Senate confirms nominees, which they’ve been doing at a snail’s pace, so they’ve got loads of free time — and the House has no excuse at all. Where’s the Obamacare repeal? Where are the hearings featuring middle-class Americans with no health insurance because it was made illegal by Obamacare? The House passed six Obamacare repeals when Obama was president and there was no chance of them being signed into law. Back then, Republicans were full of vim and vigor! But the moment Trump became president, the repeals came to a screeching halt. After the inauguration (gigantic!), House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put out a plan for repealing Obamacare … in 200 days. They actually gave their legislative agenda this inspiring title: “The Two Hundred Day Plan.” TWO HUNDRED DAYS! What was in the last six Obamacare repeals? If we looked, would we find “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” carefully typed out 1 million times? Seriously, what does Paul Ryan’s day look like? This is the Silence of the Lambs Congress. They’re utterly silent, emerging from the House gym or their three-hour lunches only to scream to the press about Trump. To the delight of the media, these frightened little lambs are appalled by nearly everything Trump does. They’ve been especially throaty about Trump’s temporary travel ban from seven terrorist nations — as designated by the Obama administration (and by everybody else who hasn’t been in a deep freeze in a Finnish crevasse for the past decade). Just like the six Obamacare repeals, a refugee ban was already written and passed by one house of Congress. Then suddenly: the Silence of the Lambs. McConnell and Ryan are hiding under their desks, as Trump is being attacked from every side. Way, way back, 15 long months ago, congressional Republicans didn’t have a problem with a total ban on Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Not for a mere three months like Trump’s order — but permanently, unless the director of the FBI, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence personally certified that a particular refugee posed no danger to the U.S. That bill passed the House with an overwhelming, veto-proof majority, including 47 Democrats. Then it went to the Senate to die. But when President Trump imposed a comparatively mild three-month ban on immigrants from Syria, Iraq and five other terrorist nations, the same Republicans who had voted for a limitless ban on refugees whiled away their days calling reporters to denounce Trump. A little more than a year ago, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, bragged in a press release that he had introduced the House’s refugee ban, calling it a bill that would “protect Americans from ISIS.” But when it came to Trump’s three-month pause, McCaul told the Post that Trump’s order “went too far.” I guess that ISIS problem just sort of faded away. (Or maybe we should check with Mrs. McCaul, inasmuch as it’s her family money that makes Rep. McCaul one of the richest members of Congress.) Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., who voted for the House’s permanent refugee ban, demanded that Trump immediately rescind his travel ban, babbling on about the “many, many nuances of immigration policy” — which he must have learned about on one of his congressional jaunts to a Las Vegas casino. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., said that Trump’s order “overreaches and undermines our constitutional system.” Evidently, he was suddenly struck by the realization that it’s “not lawful to ban immigrants on the basis of nationality,” despite having voted to ban refugees on the basis of nationality just 15 months earlier. (I’m OK with this, provided the Syrians, Somalis and Yemenis are sent to live on Justin’s street after being told about his support for gay marriage.) Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., and Ben Sasse, R-Neb., both rushed to The Washington Post with this refreshingly original point: NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS! Why, thank you, senators! Where would the GOP be without you? The Post also quoted spokesmen — spokesmen! — for Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina complaining about not having been briefed on Trump’s order. The senators themselves were far too busy to talk to the press because they were — wait, what were they doing again? Words With Friends? Decoupage? Since the election, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., has been mostly occupied polishing his anti-Trump quotations to get a pat on the head from an admiring media. He complained about Trump’s order, saying it was “poorly implemented” and that he had to find out about it from reporters. (I wonder why.) This is the moment we’ve been waiting for our entire lives, but Republicans in Congress refuse to do the people’s will. Their sole, driving obsession is to see Trump fail. I am not presently calling for these useless, narcissistic, Trump-bashing Republicans to be defeated in their re-election bids, but they’re on my Watch List. To be cleared, they can start by getting off the phone with The Washington Post and passing one of those six Obamacare repeal bills.

Carolina Boeing Nearly 3,000 workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017, not to join the Machinists. The state has only 52,000 unionized workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. (The Associated Press) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press Follow on Twitter on February 15, 2017 at 7:22 PM, updated February 15, 2017 at 7:49 PM comments NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under National Labor Relations Board rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. -The Associated Press Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

Boeing, it just so happens, is a big fan of something called the Export-Import Bank. It's a trade-promoting agency that some Republicans have worked very hard to kill.  In fact, some senators have kept the bank only partially functional for the past year by refusing to approve people to run it. Trump is said to have a new soft spot for the agency, and he is expected to throw his support behind the Ex-Im Bank on Friday. Here's why.

Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labour and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labour unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labour relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defence contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labour director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labour department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice-president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

The secret ballot vote, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at polling locations throughout the North Charleston plant, was the first for Boeing and a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. Boeing said in Facebook post that 74 percent of the 2,828 workers who cast ballots voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). “We will continue to move forward as one team,” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president in charge of Boeing South Carolina, said in the post. In a statement, IAM lead organizer Mike Evans said: “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation.” The results come just before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit Boeing in South Carolina on Friday, as the company rolls out the first completed 787-10, the largest version of its Dreamliner. The world's largest planemaker ran a hardball campaign against the IAM, which has been trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. Opposition is strong in South Carolina, which is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is highest with 23.6 percent. The IAM canceled a vote at the Boeing plant in April 2015, claiming political interference from state officials. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. Boeing says the union is not needed because it is a divisive force that picks fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers out on costly strikes. The Chicago-based company produced videos that aired heavily on local TV stations and were also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, told Reuters in an interview. Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent. The South Carolina plant helps build the 787-8 and larger 787-9, and exclusively builds the 787-10 "stretch" version.

(Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." Story continues below video × Advertisement The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

REUTERS/Randall Hill 8/8 By Alwyn Scott and Harriet McLeod | SEATTLE/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. SEATTLE/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. Boeing Co (BA.N) handily defeated a union drive by workers at the company's aircraft factory in South Carolina on Wednesday, as almost three-quarters of workers at the plant who voted rejected union representation. The secret ballot vote, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at polling locations throughout the North Charleston plant, was the first for Boeing and a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The NLRB said 74 percent of the 2,828 workers who cast ballots voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). “We will continue to move forward as one team,” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president in charge of Boeing South Carolina, said in the post. In a statement, IAM lead organizer Mike Evans said: “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation.” The results come just before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit Boeing's South Carolina plant on Friday, as the world's largest planemaker rolls out the first completed 787-10, the largest version of its Dreamliner. Any remarks Trump makes at the factory could bring into sharper focus his views on organized labor before he chooses appointees to fill vacant seats on the five-member NLRB. "I think he will cheer the 'no' vote," said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California Berkeley specializing in labor and the global economy. "I think he's going to make the case that he wants to see the plant succeed and do everything to create a more competitive environment." MORALE BLOW The loss was not seen as a surprise in a state with a strongly anti-union culture. South Carolina is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is highest with 23.6 percent. "It's a blow, but largely to morale more than anything practical," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. The vote preserves the status quo on the factory floor at Boeing in South Carolina and is unlikely to alter relations with the 30,000 IAM members at Boeing's factories near Seattle, Shaiken said. Boeing ran a hardball campaign against the IAM in South Carolina, which has been trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. The IAM canceled a vote at the Boeing plant in April 2015, claiming political interference from state officials. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. "Haley said South Carolina doesn't want or need unions," said Shaiken. "That creates an atmosphere where to vote 'yes' - in the minds of many workers - puts them at risk." The 26 percent of workers who supported the union showed the IAM had established a foothold, he added. "Can they build on it? That will be their challenge going forward." Under NLRB rules, the union must wait a minimum of 12 months before petitioning for another election. Boeing said the union was not needed because it is divisive, picks fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers out on costly strikes. President of the Seattle-area IAM local, Jon Holden, said Boeing's anti-union campaign was not a surprise and followed a strategy they had seen before. The Chicago-based company produced videos that aired heavily on local TV stations and were also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, told Reuters in an interview. Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent.

REUTERS/Randall Hill 8/8 By Alwyn Scott and Harriet McLeod | SEATTLE/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. SEATTLE/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. Boeing Co (BA.N) handily defeated a union drive by workers at the company's aircraft factory in South Carolina on Wednesday, as almost three-quarters of workers at the plant who voted rejected union representation. The secret ballot vote, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) at polling locations throughout the North Charleston plant, was the first for Boeing and a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The NLRB said 74 percent of the 2,828 workers who cast ballots voted against joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). “We will continue to move forward as one team,” Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president in charge of Boeing South Carolina, said in the post. In a statement, IAM lead organizer Mike Evans said: “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation.” The results come just before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit Boeing's South Carolina plant on Friday, as the world's largest planemaker rolls out the first completed 787-10, the largest version of its Dreamliner. Any remarks Trump makes at the factory could bring into sharper focus his views on organized labor before he chooses appointees to fill vacant seats on the five-member NLRB. "I think he will cheer the 'no' vote," said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California Berkeley specializing in labor and the global economy. "I think he's going to make the case that he wants to see the plant succeed and do everything to create a more competitive environment." MORALE BLOW The loss was not seen as a surprise in a state with a strongly anti-union culture. South Carolina is one of 28 states that bar unions from requiring workers to join up as a condition of employment, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is highest with 23.6 percent. "It's a blow, but largely to morale more than anything practical," said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. The vote preserves the status quo on the factory floor at Boeing in South Carolina and is unlikely to alter relations with the 30,000 IAM members at Boeing's factories near Seattle, Shaiken said. Boeing ran a hardball campaign against the IAM in South Carolina, which has been trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. The IAM canceled a vote at the Boeing plant in April 2015, claiming political interference from state officials. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. "Haley said South Carolina doesn't want or need unions," said Shaiken. "That creates an atmosphere where to vote 'yes' - in the minds of many workers - puts them at risk." The 26 percent of workers who supported the union showed the IAM had established a foothold, he added. "Can they build on it? That will be their challenge going forward." Under NLRB rules, the union must wait a minimum of 12 months before petitioning for another election. Boeing said the union was not needed because it is divisive, picks fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers out on costly strikes. President of the Seattle-area IAM local, Jon Holden, said Boeing's anti-union campaign was not a surprise and followed a strategy they had seen before. The Chicago-based company produced videos that aired heavily on local TV stations and were also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, told Reuters in an interview.

More than 2,800 of the 3,000 workers eligible to vote in the election cast ballots, according to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) – which oversaw the voting.  Of those, a whopping 74 percent (2,097) voted against unionization. The defeat of the unionization campaign – which was led by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) – was widely expected given South Carolina’s status as a right-to-work state. Our sources pegged this outcome weeks ago after the union appeared to be losing ground following a 2015 “probing action.” “Boeing is in a much better place than it was last time and the union has made no progress,” one source close to the vote told us. “I don’t think the IAM is well organized to get a win,” another said. They were right … News of the initial IAM unionization push was exclusively reported by this website back in August of 2014. Big Labor’s defeat at Boeing’s South Carolina plant comes just two days before U.S. president Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the facility for the unveiling of its first 787-10 Dreamliner.  That’s the extended version of the much-maligned passenger jet that’s built exclusively in North Charleston. This website has been highly critical of Boeing, a crony capitalist company that has received more than $1 billion in taxpayer-funded incentives from South Carolinians.  Of course our contempt for the company doesn’t mean we supported the IAM push – far from it. As we’ve stated repeatedly, we believe unions are cancers … and we’re pleased whenever workers in any state rebuff their advances.  Only 11.1 percent of American workers currently belong to a union – and half of those belong to government unions.  In South Carolina, only 1.6 percent of workers are unionized – the lowest percentage of any state in the nation.

The morning round of voting has concluded Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017, among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. (Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) By MEG KINNARD The Associated Press NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Pictured from left to right are: Downingtown area school board member Jane Bertone, Mrs. Nowak, Coach Jerome Nowak, Downingtown Education Foundation Executive Director Jackie Fenn, school board President Colleen Cranney and Downingtown schools Superintendent Lawrence J. Mussoline. Submitted Photo – Downingtown Area School District By Staff Report Posted: 02/15/17, 5:27 PM EST | Updated: 6 hrs ago # Comments EAST CALN >> There is no greater gift a teacher can receive than to be remembered fondly by a former student. The Downingtown Education Foundation (DCEF) announced such a gift on Feb. 8 during the Downingtown area school board meeting. They broadcast the creation of the Jerome Nowak Scholarship for $5,000, the gift of a former Downingtown High School student who wanted to remember his coach. While a student at Downingtown, Brett Gerry ran cross-country track coached by current Downingtown West High School tech ed teacher Jerome Nowak. Gerry, the president of Boeing Japan graduated from Downingtown High School in 1989, prior to its split into Downingtown East and Downingtown West. Gerry went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in political science and economics from Colgate University, an M.A. in political science from Yale University and a J.D. from Yale Law School. Advertisement As Gerry moved on with his life, serving as an associate counsel to President George Bush, an attorney for Goodwin Procter LLP, a law clerk at both the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States before moving on to Boeing, he remembered his favorite coach. Gerry noted that Coach Nowak was his cross-country coach for all four years at Downingtown. DCEF Executive Director Jackie Fenn read a letter to the school board members that Gerry wrote of his great respect and admiration for his former coach. “We won two Ches-Mont titles and qualified for the Pennsylvania State Championships my senior year,” he wrote. “Coach Nowak was a terrific coach and mentor, with an understated style and smile. He made us not only better athletes, but also, I believe, better people, both through his guidance and most often, through his example. He taught everyone who ran for him the importance of perseverance, sportsmanship, decency and respect for others, and, above all else, humility. I am supporting this scholarship both to commemorate the long career of a superb educator, but also to support the worthwhile cause of encouraging students to purse technical and vocational training after graduation. I am convinced that it is a national priority to support the development of STEM.” STEM stands for the fields of science, technology, engineering and math.

"The great boom is over," Richard Aboulafia, analyst at Teal Group, said at an industry conference near Seattle on Wednesday. "But I don't see a bust cycle" unless there's a trade war, he added. An industry slowdown has implications for investors and suppliers trying to anticipate the flow of orders as a guide the capacity they will need to meet changes in aircraft production. Multi-year backlogs of jetliner orders at both big plane makers will cushion the downturn, along with rising sales of military aircraft, especially spy and fighter planes as defence spending is expected to rise at least initially under U.S. President Donald Trump, he added. Higher interest rates and a possible border tax on imports could hurt the U.S. aerospace industry, however, by causing the dollar to strengthen further, Aboulafia said. Also, the risk of a major trade dispute is as high as at any time since World War II, he added. A U.S. trade dispute with China would likely benefit European plane maker Airbus since China could easily retaliate against the U.S. by curbing orders of Boeing planes, Aboulafia said. In the commercial aircraft market, a planned ramp up in output of single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft is likely to continue.

Global aerospace boom is over, but likely no bust ahead - analyst SEATTLE (Reuters) - Demand for jetliners made by Boeing Co and Airbus is in decline but no big bust for the industry lies ahead, a leading analyst said on Wednesday, noting that military aircraft sales should rise. By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE (Reuters) - Demand for jetliners made by Boeing Co and Airbus is in decline but no big bust for the industry lies ahead, a leading analyst said on Wednesday, noting that military aircraft sales should rise. "The great boom is over," Richard Aboulafia, analyst at Teal Group, said at an industry conference near Seattle on Wednesday. "But I don't see a bust cycle" unless there's a trade war, he added. An industry slowdown has implications for investors and suppliers trying to anticipate the flow of orders as a guide the capacity they will need to meet changes in aircraft production. Multi-year backlogs of jetliner orders at both big plane makers will cushion the downturn, along with rising sales of military aircraft, especially spy and fighter planes as defence spending is expected to rise at least initially under U.S. President Donald Trump, he added. Higher interest rates and a possible border tax on imports could hurt the U.S. aerospace industry, however, by causing the dollar to strengthen further, Aboulafia said. Also, the risk of a major trade dispute is as high as at any time since World War II, he added. A U.S. trade dispute with China would likely benefit European plane maker Airbus since China could easily retaliate against the U.S. by curbing orders of Boeing planes, Aboulafia said. In the commercial aircraft market, a planned ramp up in output of single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft is likely to continue.

The morning round of voting has concluded Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017, among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. (Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said.

Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

The first round of voting began early Wednesday. A second round of voting was set for Wednesday afternoon to accommodate all the employees. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas. And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements is an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on why they should come to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. While some South Carolina workers have representation — just more than 1,900, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures — most don't. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have a greater impact on the general view of labor in the South than efforts by autoworkers to unionize Volkswagen in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as a foothold for organizing other Southern car plants. Anti-union advocates could always cite VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." A "yes" vote would be meaningful throughout the region, said Daniel Cornfield, sociology professor and labor expert at Vanderbilt University. "Given the dynamism of industrialization in the Southern region now, especially the development ... of the U.S. automotive industry, any type of heavy-industry union victory would certainly inspire other workers in related industrial sectors in the South to think about unionizing." What strikes Cornfield about the Boeing case is the company's silence over consequences for workers. "The company has not been threatening to relocate its operations in the event of a unionization," he said. "It is often the case that companies try to relocate outside of the United States to find cheaper labor and avoid U.S. unions altogether." Boeing already may have abstained from those kinds of threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts. Threatening to move manufacturing would come after Trump blasted Boeing for its cost of building a new presidential Air Force One for future presidents. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. "Given the recent pronouncements of President Trump about keeping manufacturing in the United States," Cornfield said, "it would be interesting and an ironic twist that President Trump is possibly defanging large corporations in their efforts to resist unionization by encouraging companies to stay in the United States, giving workers a leg up and unions a leg up in the campaign period." Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. On Monday, in a final gathering before the vote, several hundred Boeing employees gathered in a hotel ballroom just a mile from the Boeing plant, hearing from activists and members of other unions urging them to vote "yes" on Wednesday. "Suppressing working people is the old way of doing business in South Carolina," Machinists organizer Mike Evans said, to cheers from the crowd. "It's not going to be this way anymore."

Travis Dove Bloomberg i By MEG KINNARD and EMERY P. DALESIO Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing’s South Carolina plant are deciding whether they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. The first round of voting began early Wednesday. A second round was set for Wednesday afternoon to accommodate all employees. The voting is taking place with President Donald Trump set to visit North Charleston to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner, the White House said Thursday. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states’ lack of union presence, it’d make their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements is an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state’s minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. “It is an economic development tool,” Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. “We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina.” At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren’t unionized or haven’t experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers’ efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company’s board of directors, Hirsch said. “Boeing is very, very different,” Hirsch said. “No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union.” A “yes” vote could inspire others in the region to consider unions, said Daniel Cornfield, sociology professor and labor expert at Vanderbilt University. What strikes Cornfield about the Boeing case is the company’s silence over consequences if its workers unionize. “The company has not been threatening to relocate its operations in the event of a unionization,” he said. “It is often the case that companies try to relocate outside of the United States to find cheaper labor and avoid U.S. unions altogether.” Boeing may have abstained from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. Cornfield said Trump’s pressure on business to keep jobs in the U.S. could be “defanging large corporations in their efforts to resist unionization … giving workers a leg up and unions a leg up in the campaign period.” The union vote also comes after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. “Costs are out of control,” Trump tweeted in early December. “Cancel order!” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina’s former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina’s labor department, the governor played up Templeton’s union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to “fight the unions” at Boeing. “They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can’t deliver it,” Templeton said. On Monday, several hundred Boeing employees gathered in a hotel ballroom just a mile from the plant, hearing from activists and members of other unions urging them to vote “yes.” “Suppressing working people is the old way of doing business in South Carolina,” Machinists organizer Mike Evans said, to cheers. “It’s not going to be this way anymore.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:10 How is a blade born in N.C.?

"The major factors we watch - the exchange rate, fuel price and the profitability of the airlines - are all still favourable and we remain confident in the strong growth of India's commercial aviation sector," said Dinesh Keskar, Senior Vice President, Asia Pacific and India Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "We see the potential for travel growth in 2017 to continue to be high in India and we expect more than 100 million passengers to fly domestically this year," Keskar spoke during a briefing organised by Boeing at the 2017 Aero India Airshow in Bangalore. According to Keskar, Boeing continues to provide the airlines in India with the most fuel efficient and capable airplanes in every market segment. "We look forward to delivering several more 787 Dreamliners to Air India this year and the 737 MAX to SpiceJet and Jet Airways in 2018," Keskar said. Earlier, Boeing's 2016 India Current Market Outlook (CMO), had shown that the country's airlines would require 1,850 new airplanes, valued at $265 billion over the next 20 years. As per the 2016 India CMO, single-aisle airplanes such as the Next-Generation 737 and 737 MAX will continue to account for the largest share of new deliveries, while wide-body airplanes such as the 787 Dreamliner and the 777 family, will make up for the remainder of demand. --IANS rv/dg SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features AIADMK's shoe politics 'Lioness' Sasikala's fate 'Lioness' Sasikala's fate Floor test for Sasikala When PM Modi ridiculed Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2017.

No, stay hereYes, go to AWIN Airframe OEMs And The Aftermarket Feb 15, 2017 Daniel James | MRO Network EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Advertisement At the tail end of last year, I wrote about the issues facing MROs as engine OEMs appeared desirous of limiting the extent to which third parties were able to service their latest offerings. That was shaping up to be an acrimonious issue and a number of MROs cried foul in relation to competition issues and the potential abuse of the OEM’s dominant position. The European Commission weighed in back in 2015 but only to the extent of making some enquiries, by way of questionnaire, about the practices of some engine OEMs. No formal investigation has been launched. This is not of course to say the issue has gone away. However, to focus solely on the engine OEMs may be unfair. Over the past few years there has also been a gearing up on the part of airframe OEMs in capturing a segment of, what they have realised to be, a lucrative market. Lately both Boeing and Embraer have announced ambitious MRO plans with Boeing in particular looking to triple its income from MRO services over ten years.  To evidence some of that ambition, Boeing has recently announced the building of a new maintenance facility at Gatwick Airport. Embraer are a little more conservative in their ambitions, looking for a 10% increase in revenue from these services over the next decade, from 15% to 25% of their total revenue, but it certainly marks another deliberate and focused push firmly into the MRO space. Some commentators have considered that the provision of MRO services was thought to be “beneath” the airframe OEMs in the past, and this is why they were not minded to enter that particular space.  Others consider that the move into expanding airframe services has been a tougher decision given that that the majority of airline expenditure with MROs is actually in relation to engine and line maintenance. I do not disagree with either view but also consider that the recent developments, much as we have seen in the engine world, may be premised on the costs of development of new, ever more complex technology and a determination within the industry (not just OEMs) to build greater resilience into business models following the financial collapse in 2008 and in a world ever less certain.      Developing the technology of 21st century aircraft is costly and significant investment is required. The OEMs need to derive further, more diverse, income streams from aircraft to attract and provide adequate return to investors. Selling an aircraft is now only part of the income to be derived. Downturns in orders for aircraft as a result of financial crisis, terrorist events and global conflict, can perhaps be cushioned by the provision of MRO services for those aircraft already delivered.  The ambitions are bold and may represent a further squeeze on third party MRO capabilities and revenues going forward. From what I can ascertain the moves do not seem, at this stage, to be attracting as much controversy as the engine OEMs’ stance, but perhaps this may all change if some of these ambitious airframer targets are hit over the next ten years.

More About: Trump and Manufacturing Boeing factory in North Charleston, South Carolina Boeing Advertisement After a rocky start, Boeing Co. (IW 500/9) Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg appears to have gained the ear of President Donald Trump. The U.S. planemaker was one of Trump’s first post-election corporate targets, and a tweet about soaring Air Force One costs briefly tanked the company’s shares in December. But the Twitter tirade also gave Muilenburg an opening to press the case of the largest U.S. exporter -- and the 1.5 million jobs at its jet-equipment suppliers -- in meetings with Trump. The CEO’s entreaties seem to have worked. Trump has emerged as a booster for Boeing’s F/A-18 fighter jets and voiced support to lawmakers for a key Boeing initiative: re-opening the U.S. Export-Import Bank for major deals. Trump will fly to Boeing’s South Carolina factory to attend an event Friday showcasing the newest 787 Dreamliner, where he’s expected to make an announcement about the federal export credit agency. Popular Now Is Quality a Result or a System? Why It's Not Too Late to Build Your Own Industrial Internet Platform Leaders Must Have 'Strategic Intelligence' “The supply chain for Boeing doesn’t just run through the state of Washington,” said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies. The Ex-Im Bank is “a door opener.” Supporting the lender would put Trump at odds with some fellow Republicans, who view the bank as providing corporate welfare. Ex-Im has been dubbed the “Bank of Boeing” for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by airlines unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it’s been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10 million because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a Senate committee since 2015. Committed to a Quorum Trump is committed to reestablishing a quorum on the bank’s board, U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, said after a Feb. 9 bipartisan lunch meeting between the president and lawmakers. That’s needed to allow the bank to lend more as it faces a backlog of as much as $30 billion in projects. Boeing and General Electric Co. have argued that without the financing, they would face a competitive disadvantage against companies in Europe, Canada, Brazil, China and Russia, which don’t face similar restrictions. With the bank hobbled, U.S. manufacturers have been forced to turn to private banks or export credit banks from other countries where they operate to help customers finance big-ticket purchases. Boeing has lost or faces delays on three commercial satellite sales because of the lack of export credit, said Kate Bernard, a spokeswoman for the Chicago-based manufacturer. “It’s put us at a significant competitive disadvantage,” Bernard said. Critics argue that the Ex-Im Bank’s guarantees are heavily weighted toward a few large companies and the U.S. government could potentially be on the hook if borrowers default. In 2014, 40% of all authorizations went to Boeing alone, according to an analysis by George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. Other beneficiaries range from GE to Bechtel Group Inc. “I don’t blame companies like Boeing, Bechtel and GE for using Ex-Im or benefiting from Ex-Im,” said Diane Katz, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which favors limited government. “But we don’t have to give them the opportunity to do that on the backs of taxpayers.” GE had contracts valued at $11 billion that required Ex-Im Bank financing in 2015, when reauthorization of the bank lapsed. The company rushed to form partnerships with export credit agencies in Canada, the U.K., France and other countries to meet those needs, said Una Pulizzi, a spokeswoman for GE. A representative of Bechtel didn’t respond to a request for comment left outside normal business hours. The Bank is Profitable Ex-Im Bank’s quarterly default rate was 0.27% at the end of September, well below the mandate by Congress. The bank is also profitable, returning $284 million to the U.S. Treasury last year and $675 million in 2014 when it was fully operational. The lender estimates it supported almost 165,000 U.S. jobs in 2014. If U.S. contractors can’t find Ex-Im Bank financing for U.S.-made equipment needed on an overseas projects, they will shift purchases to a country where the guarantees are available, said William Schubert, president of International Trade & Transportation Inc., which helps borrowers find government-backed credit. “When that happens, all the U.S. procurement disappears,” Schubert said. “I know people who are unemployed right now because the bank is down, and that’s unfortunate.” By Julie Johnsson, Thomas Black and Austin Weinstein Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Boeing workers defy South's anti-unionization history? by MEG KINNARD and EMERY P. DALESIO, Associated Press AA NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding whether they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. The first round of voting began early Wednesday. A second round was set for Wednesday afternoon to accommodate all employees. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements is an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." A "yes" vote could inspire others in the region to consider unions, said Daniel Cornfield, sociology professor and labor expert at Vanderbilt University. What strikes Cornfield about the Boeing case is the company's silence over consequences if its workers unionize. "The company has not been threatening to relocate its operations in the event of a unionization," he said. "It is often the case that companies try to relocate outside of the United States to find cheaper labor and avoid U.S. unions altogether." Boeing may have abstained from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. Cornfield said Trump's pressure on business to keep jobs in the U.S. could be "defanging large corporations in their efforts to resist unionization ... giving workers a leg up and unions a leg up in the campaign period." The union vote also comes after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. On Monday, several hundred Boeing employees gathered in a hotel ballroom just a mile from the plant, hearing from activists and members of other unions urging them to vote "yes." "Suppressing working people is the old way of doing business in South Carolina," Machinists organizer Mike Evans said, to cheers. "It's not going to be this way anymore." ___ Dalesio reported from Raleigh, North Carolina. close News In Pictures Mudslide blocks major W.

(AP) — The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local): 9:30 a.m. The morning round of voting has concluded among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. The first of two voting shifts wrapped up around midmorning at the aviation giant's North Charleston facilities. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Machinists spokesman Jonathan Battaglia says the union feels Boeing workers are "ready to make history" with the vote. Boeing came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing. ___ 6:45 a.m. Voting is underway as thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant decide if they want to unionize. Polling places opened early Wednesday morning throughout the aviation giant's sprawling facility in North Charleston. A second wave of voting takes place this afternoon.

Aviation expert Yuri Sytnik explains how production of the aircraft will help revive Russia's civil aviation industry. On Tuesday, Russian business newspaper Kommersant reported, citing a source familiar with the situation, that the new version of the Ilyushin Il-96, presently under development, is designed to replace foreign-leased long-haul wide-body passenger aircraft whose service life is nearing its end. Next week, the responsible ministries are expected to draw up a timetable for the withdrawal of these foreign aircraft from Russia's airlines, and their substitution with the new Ilyushin. The decision to revive production of the Il-96, an advanced, long-range version of the Soviet-era Ilyushin Il-86 wide-body airliner, was made in May 2016. At that time, Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said that the government will be committing about 50 billion rubles to the program. © Sputnik/ Dmitriy Petrochenko Plan B: Russian Defense Ministry Considers Major Overhaul of Its Airliner FleetThe Il-96, developed in the twilight of the Soviet Union by the Ilyushin Design Bureau and built by the Voronezh Aircraft Plant, made its debut test flight in September 1988, and was rolled out for service with Russian state carrier Aeroflot in late 1992.  However, due to the economic crisis facing Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union throughout the 1990s, only 30 units of the prospective aircraft were ever built. Today, Aeroflot is believed to have between 8-10 Il-96s in their inventory. However, according to aviation expert and former Vnukovo Airlines flight director Yuri Sytnik, these planes have all been decommissioned after putting on 55,000 flight hours. © Flickr/ Alexander Babashov An Aeroflot Il-96-300 landing at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. File photo. © Wikipedia/ Alexey Demin Sukhoi Ascendant: High-Ranking Russian Officials Switch to SuperjetIn the 1990s, Russia's massive civilian aviation industry, once one of the largest in the world, was brought to the brink of collapse. In the interim, citing safety, engine noise regulations, and high fuel costs, Russian airlines began purchasing foreign aircraft, particularly from Airbus and Boeing. By the early 2010s, foreign planes accounted for two thirds or more of many airlines' fleets, particularly in the long-haul segment. However, in the mid-2010s, after the downturn in relations with Western countries in 2014 over the crisis in Ukraine, the Russian government started paying greater attention to the domestic commercial passenger aircraft industry, devoting energy and resources to encourage development, production and sales of modern aircraft at home, and promoting them abroad. Speaking to RIA Novosti about the prospects of the new Il-96-400M, Sytnik noted that "if the Il-96 did get an upgrade, what we would get is a model quite comparable to some Boeing and Airbus planes."  © Sputnik/ Alexander Polyakov The long range Il-96-400 jet airliner, designed by the Ilyushin experimental design office. Of course, he added, for a design from the late 1980s to really compete against modern foreign designs, nearly everything would be subject to upgrade or replacement, including parts of the fuselage. With the Il-96 effectively becoming a fundamentally new plane, all that would be left from the original design is the conceptual design. © Photo: vaso.ru Russia Developing 'Transformer' Flying TankerRIA Novosti recalled that the main problem of the original Il-96, like many other Russian civilian passenger aircraft, was high fuel consumption. If the comparable Boeing or Airbus burn an average of about 17.5 grams of fuel per passenger kilometer, their Russian counterparts consume significantly more, from 21-28 grams. However, this problem is on the brink of being solved. Russia's newest generation of aircraft engines feature reduced fuel consumption, and others, with fuel use of as little as 15.5 grams of fuel per passenger kilometer, are under development. Last summer, during a visit to the Voronezh Aircraft Plant, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri Rogozin said that Russian engineers had effectively resolved the fuel consumption issue with the new-generation PD-14 turbofan engine. The PD-14 and its variants have already found demand in the domestic civil aviation sector, and can be mounted aboard the Il-96-300, the Tupolev-214, and the MC-21 in its 200, 300 and 400 variants. Rogozin stressed that the new engine would help guarantee Russian passenger liners' competitiveness with Boeing and Airbus, decreasing not only fuel costs, but maintenance costs as well. © Sputnik/ Mikhail Voskresenskiy Visitors at the PD-14 aircraft engine displayed by the United Engine Corporation at the MAKS-2015 air show in Zhukovsky in the Moscow Region Sytnik noted that in terms of avionics technology too, Russian technology has demonstrated its capabilities, including aboard planes such as the Tu-160 supersonic strategic bomber, the Sukhoi Superject 100 twin-engine regional jet liner, and the Irkut MC-21, a short and medium-range airliner.  Furthermore, he noted the new Il-96 variant may be fitted with embedded ladders underneath the plane, as with its predecessor, the Il-86. This, Sytnik noted, would significantly reduce loading and unloading time, and save on expenses for ramps at airports. © Sputnik/ Ilya Bogachev First Flight of Russia’s Il-112V Transport Jet to Be Carried Out Until July 1Ultimately, the aviation expert noted that reviving the IL-96 will necessitate making significant changes to the design, but would still be better and more cost-effective than trying to create a totally new plane. It would also be quicker, taking a maximum of five years to create, compared with the ten years necessary for a new plane. The revival will also have positive knock-on effects, the expert said. "Passengers will pay airfare and fly onboard our aircraft, and we will not pay to lease foreign planes, each of which costs between $60 and $120 million dollars," Sytnik noted. If the new Il-96 replaces even a portion of the foreign planes, this is money that will remain in Russia. © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, left, and Governor of the Voronezh Region Alexei Gordeyev visit the VASO Voronezh Aircraft Plant Part of that money will then go to the manufacturer for the purchase of new equipment and machine tools. Furthermore, "in the process of the modernization of the Il-96, we will receive a crop of well-trained workers; in this way, in 10-15 years it will be possible to build a new, contemporary aircraft," the expert concluded.  In 1990, the Soviet Union produced nearly 30 percent of the world's civilian airliners. After the country's collapse, Russia's production, which contributed a significant portion of the Soviet figure, fell to the low-single digits. Over the last few years, Russia has come out swinging with several promising new aircraft designs to help correct this imbalance. Once it begins taking to the skies among Russia's civil commercial carriers, the Il-96-400M will help make these hopes and expectations into reality. ...

Redkite wide-area sensor takes first flight with Insitu Integrator Wide-area motion imagery system now small enough to fit payload bay of tactical UAS Integrator Launch with Redkite Wide-Area Motion Imagery Sensor Bay (Photo: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Integrator Launch with Redkite Wide-Area Motion Imagery Sensor Bay (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail February 15, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time FAIRFAX, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Logos Technologies and Insitu, a subsidiary of The Boeing Company, are proud to announce the successful initial flight test of the Redkite wide-area sensor aboard the Integrator small tactical unmanned aircraft. Conducted early this month in Boardman, Ore., the test marks the first time a wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) system has been carried in the internal payload bay of a small UAS. “In the past, we’ve mounted podded versions of our lightweight WAMI systems to rotary- and fixed-wing aircraft,” says John Marion, president of Logos Technologies. “Now, thanks to further reductions in weight, we can easily fit a Redkite inside a tactical unmanned platform, as demonstrated with our recent flights on the Insitu Integrator.” Despite its compact form, Redkite can image a city-sized area (over 12 square kilometers) all at once—detecting, tracking and recording all significant movers within the scene. It also stores up to eight hours of this geo-tagged mission data on onboard solid state drives (SSDs). While the WAMI sensor is flying, multiple users on the ground can select real-time and/or historical video feeds within its expansive coverage area and view them on desktop screens, tablets and other mobile devices. Redkite can transmit up to 10 unique views to hundreds of users at one time. “Insitu is pleased to collaborate with Logos to provide yet another way for our customers to get the critical information they need,” said Pete Kunz, chief technology officer for Insitu. “Integrator with Redkite enables an even broader set of missions to aid the warfighter in a complex operational environment.” In addition, the new sensor weight (under 30lbs) means that Redkite can potentially be integrated with even smaller unmanned aircraft in the future, notes Marion. Logos Technologies will be unveiling a full-size model of the new internal payload version of Redkite at the International Defence Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) 2017, held February 19-23 in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. For more information on Logos Technologies and its WAMI solutions, please visit Stand 03-B29 at the Abu Dhabi National Exposition Centre.

Updated: February 16, 2017 @ 2:54 am Full Forecast top right promo - flex2 Home Business AP Boeing vote tells next chapter in Southern unionization By MEG KINNARD Associated Press Feb 15, 2017 (…) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding Wednesday on whether they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas. And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements is an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on why they should come to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. While some South Carolina workers have representation — just more than 1,900, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures — most don't. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have a greater impact on the general view of labor in the South than efforts by autoworkers to unionize Volkswagen in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as a foothold for organizing other Southern car plants. Anti-union advocates could always cite VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." A "yes" vote would be meaningful throughout the region, said Daniel Cornfield, sociology professor and labor expert at Vanderbilt University. "Given the dynamism of industrialization in the Southern region now, especially the development ... of the U.S. automotive industry, any type of heavy-industry union victory would certainly inspire other workers in related industrial sectors in the South to think about unionizing." What strikes Cornfield about the Boeing case is the company's silence over consequences for workers. "The company has not been threatening to relocate its operations in the event of a unionization," he said. "It is often the case that companies try to relocate outside of the United States to find cheaper labor and avoid U.S. unions altogether." Boeing already may have abstained from those kinds of threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts. Threatening to move manufacturing would come after Trump blasted Boeing for its cost of building a new presidential Air Force One for future presidents. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. "Given the recent pronouncements of President Trump about keeping manufacturing in the United States," Cornfield said, "it would be interesting and an ironic twist that President Trump is possibly defanging large corporations in their efforts to resist unionization by encouraging companies to stay in the United States, giving workers a leg up and unions a leg up in the campaign period." Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. On Monday, in a final gathering before the vote, several hundred Boeing employees gathered in a hotel ballroom just a mile from the Boeing plant, hearing from activists and members of other unions urging them to vote "yes" on Wednesday. "Suppressing working people is the old way of doing business in South Carolina," Machinists organizer Mike Evans said, to cheers from the crowd. "It's not going to be this way anymore." ___ Associated Press writer Emery P.

The morning round of voting has concluded Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017, among South Carolina Boeing workers considering if they want representation by a union. Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. (Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. - Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant have rejected an effort to unionize, maintaining Southern reluctance toward unionization and setting up a picture-perfect stop for President Donald Trump, who visits the facilities this week. Vote totals weren't immediately available Wednesday, but the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers' lead organizer said it's "the workers who dictate what happens next." National Labor Relations Board rules require workers wait a year before another union vote. Wednesday's balloting came just two days before Trump was slated to make the first visit by a sitting president to the sprawling North Charleston complex, where Boeing makes the 787 Dreamliner. On Friday, Trump is coming to town for the rollout of the first 787-10 model. The presidential visit marks a photo finish for Boeing, which for weeks vigorously campaigned against the Machinists' effort. Billboards, radio and television ads blanketed the Charleston area, arguing to employees why they should not surrender their rights to the union. In its campaign, Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized — a tactic that often surfaces when collective bargaining efforts arise — perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defence contracts the company does not want to risk. Trump himself engaged with the company during the presidential campaign, blasting Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the union would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labour and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold in the state. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labour unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labour relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in the state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement, Boeing vice-president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. (Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Vote totals weren't immediately available Wednesday, but the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers' lead organizer said it's "the workers who dictate what happens next." National Labor Relations Board rules require workers wait a year before another union vote. Wednesday's balloting came just two days before Trump was slated to make the first visit by a sitting president to the sprawling North Charleston complex, where Boeing makes the 787 Dreamliner. On Friday, Trump is coming to town for the rollout of the first 787-10 model. The presidential visit marks a photo finish for Boeing, which for weeks vigorously campaigned against the Machinists' effort. Billboards, radio and television ads blanketed the Charleston area, arguing to employees why they should not surrender their rights to the union. In its campaign, Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized — a tactic that often surfaces when collective bargaining efforts arise — perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defence contracts the company does not want to risk. Trump himself engaged with the company during the presidential campaign, blasting Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December.

(Brad Nettles/The Post and Courier via AP, File) Share story By MEG KINNARD The Associated Press NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — Production workers at Boeing’s South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren’t immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. “Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next,” Evans said. “We’ve been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better.” The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker’s campus.

If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states’ lack of union presence, it’d it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state’s minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. “It is an economic development tool,” Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. “We’ll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina.” At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren’t unionized or haven’t experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers’ efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company’s board of directors, Hirsch said. “Boeing is very, very different,” Hirsch said. “No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union.” Boeing didn’t threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. “Costs are out of control,” Trump tweeted in early December. “Cancel order!” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina’s former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina’s labor department, the governor played up Templeton’s union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to “fight the unions” at Boeing. “They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can’t deliver it,” Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn’t feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. “I think we’re doing just fine without a union presence,” he said.

Do Boeing, GE have US permission to Make in India? February 15, 2017 13:29 IST Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar says global aircraft makers will have to get approval from their own governments to transfer technology and build jets in India. Alnoor Peermohamed reports from the Aero India show.

Photograph: Adnan Abidi/Reuters. Trump govt taking fresh look at F16 sale to India: Lockheed   India has mandated that global aircraft makers such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing get approvals of their governments to transfer technology and build jets with a local partner in India, if they are to bid for the country's single-engine fighter requirement. "The product which I want to buy, I want it to be made in India. Export to a third nation is an additional bonus. If someone wants to shift a facility to India it's their choice, or they wants to assemble a new one. I am no way concerned with it," said Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar after inaugurating the biennial Aero India show on Tuesday. "If they're proposing something, their government has to give them in-principle approval so that they can quote it to me. If something is not given or someone has not given it to them, then they cannot give a quote to me," he said, but did not clarify whether a request for proposal has been issued. Parrikar was responding to queries on US President Donald Trump's push for Make in America, to revive US manufacturing and generate local jobs. In October, India floated a request for information to global jet makers to partner with Indian companies and jointly bid to sell single-engine fighters for the Indian Air Force. The contest is different from the 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft, which was finalised with a 36-plane order from France's Rafale, which will begin delivery from September 2019. Lockheed Martin has offered to transfer its Fort Worth production line to India and make the latest Block-70 of F-16 fighters. Saab, which makes the Gripen fighter, has not only offered to help with Mark-1 and Mark-2 of India's light combat aircraft Tejas, but also co-develop the advanced medium combat aircraft, which the Defence Research and Development Organisation plans to develop. Independently, the Indian Navy has floated a tender to supply and produce 57 twin-engine carrier-borne fighters, for which Boeing has expressed interest to participate with its F-18 twin-engine planes. It opted to buy from the global market after it publicly rejected the navy version of the Tejas, saying it was overweight and would not meet its requirements. Parrikar also reiterated the country's stand that 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence in select areas would be allowed only to bridge technology gaps, than a blanket approval. "Suppose someone comes to manufacture engines, which we don't have technology in, I will definitely consider it. 100 per cent FDI in areas where I do not have any expertise, I will definitely consider it. What's the point of getting stuck and continuing to import?" he said. 'Make in India for defence must not be our goal' IMAGE: Tejas, India's first locally-built Light Combat Aircraft, before its induction into the IAF at the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Airport in Bengaluru in 2016. The Tejas fighter has been powered by the GE-404 engine since its development. Photograph: Abhishek N Chinnappa/Reuters. GE requires a US government approval to collaborate on military programmes before its Bengaluru team can work on the jet engine programme. Raghu Krishnan reports. General Electric (GE) has delivered two qualified 414 engines to be tested on the planned home-grown Tejas Mk-2 single engine fighter and is looking to collaborate with India to build engines for the proposed advanced medium-combat aircraft. The Tejas fighter has been powered by the GE-404 engine since its development and the Indian Air Force plans to induct over 120 planes with the same engine. So far, India has ordered around 100 engines for the fighter from GE and plans to buy more engines in the coming years. The single engine fighter being developed by the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), a DRDO unit, will undergo an upgrade with more features that requires a more powerful engine and GE has been tasked to supply its GE-414 engine. "The first two engines are for flight test. They are ready to go as and when the plane is ready. We are committed to deliver six more engines," said Mark Pearson, who leads the military engine programme for GE. Pearson is betting on the over 700 engineers who work on design and take charge of manufacturing parts of GE's commercial aero engines, at its India centre in Bengaluru, to push for local co-development of the engine for AMCA, which ADA is developing. India has begun preliminary design work on the stealth aircraft, but has not launched a programme officially. GE is looking to partner with ADA, but it also requires a US government approval to collaborate on military programmes before its Bengaluru team can work on the jet engine programme. The Bengaluru team has worked on the GE-9D engine that powers the Boeing 777 planes and the engine that powers the A380 aircraft. It is also developing the 9X, which the local team in India is collaborating on for the replacement engine of Boeing 777-9D. "The foundation is already here built over 17 years," said Pearson. GE, which has a manufacturing facility in Pune whose 40 per cent contribution is engine components, says it could meet the mandated 50 per cent requirement of local production for defence contracts within India. "We can deliver on our commitments as and when we see more orders," said Alok Nanda, general manager, (India engineering operations) at GE. Beware India's enemies!

In a statement that sent its shares down 22 percent, the company said 2017 could be even worse, as it struggled to fix operational problems in difficult markets. Its shares had already more than halved in the last 12 months. Cobham on Thursday cut its readout for 2016 trading profit by another 20 million pounds, to 225 million pounds, slipping yet again just a month after its last downgrade. The group, which scrapped its final dividend last month, said "undoubted" uncertainties in the market meant its ability to forecast its performance was not as strong as it should be, and it was difficult to predict the year ahead. In addition, it said it had to fix many operational issues to get the business back on track, which would require more spending. "The board considers that delivery of a similar performance to that of 2016 in 2017 may be challenging," it said. Chief Executive David Lockwood, who took over in December, said 2016 was an "incredibly turbulent and disappointing year". "Execution failure in many businesses led us to miss expectations badly and provides a poor entry point into 2017," he said. As well as a 150 million pound charge on the Boeing KC-46 tanker programme, Cobham took 574 million pounds of non-cash impairments across its business units.

Cobham, which provides communications equipment, control systems and services to the defence industry, will take a £574m impairment on problems across several of its units. It will also take a £150m charge on spiralling costs related to its contract to develop a mid-air refuelling tanker for Boeing.  Underlying profit for the year - stripping out these one-off charges - will now be £225m, the company said, down from the £245m in a warning last month. Cobham has now issued five profit warnings in two years.  Shares plunged 19pc in early trading, to 106p. Cobham share price Cobham warned that it was unable to give any "balance sheet guidance" for 2017, saying "the ability of the group to forecast performance is also not as strong as it should be". The company added in a statement: "The balance sheet is clearly not strong enough to properly support the operations of the group, given the important role it plays in many customer programmes." It will provide more information in its preliminary results on March 2. Cobham shares plunge 18%. Will the next news be a rights issue? Probably. Likely announced on March 2 alongside FY results.— Garry White (@GarryWhite) February 16, 2017 David Lockwood, chief executive of Cobham, said: "2016 was an incredibly turbulent and disappointing year for Cobham. Execution failure in many businesses led us to miss expectations badly and provides a poor entry point into 2017. "The medium term provides significant opportunity with encouraging market dynamics and strong product and programme offerings. The route to realising this potential is strong operational performance and financial control, which will be the relentless focus through 2017. This has commenced and the potential to improve is clear." Last month Cobham's shares nosedived after the company cancelled its dividend and issued its last profit warning. Last year it was forced into a £500m rights issue to get its debt under control.

The CEO of Baltimore-based sports apparel company Under Armour is responding to criticism he received after calling President Donald Trump "an asset to the country." Plank wrote an open letter to Baltimore published as a full-page advertisement in The Baltimore Sun Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) A week after Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank was roundly drubbed for his glowing remarks about President Donald Trump, Plank wants everyone to know that he didn't really mean it, and like anyone else with an operating moral compass he thinks that at least one of Trump's policies stinks, too. It's likely been a rough couple days for Plank, who last week told CNBC that he believed that the President was a "real asset...He wants to build things. He wants to make bold decisions and be really decisive." Plank, who along with Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris, Ford CEO Mark Fields, Dell's Michael Dell, General Electric's Jeff Immelt, Tesla's Elon Musk, U.S. Steel's Mario Longhi, and Boeing's Dennis Muilenburg, is a member of Trump's manufacturing council, said "I'm a big fan of people that operate in the world of 'publish and iterate' versus 'think, think, think, think, think', so there's a lot that I respect there." When asked about Plank's discription of Trump as an "asset," Golden State Warrior and Under Armour endorsee Steph Curry said "I agree with that description... if you remove the ‘et’.” Curry said last week that he'll stand by the brand, for now, after spending a day on the phone "with countless people at Under Armour, countless people in Kevin Plank’s camp, my team, trying to understand what was going on and where everybody stood on the issue." Curry sounded cautiously optimistic about the relationship, saying, "It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating," but "If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off if it wasn’t in line with who I am." Endorsee and dancer Misty Copeland also responded to Plank's remarks, saying "Those of you who have supported and followed my career know that the one topic I've never backed away from speaking openly about is the importance of diversity and inclusion. It is imperative to me that my partners and sponsors share this belief." NBC reports thaat Copeland has "spoken privately with Plank on his statements but is still requesting for the CEO and Under Armour to 'take public action to clearly communicate and reflect our common values' so as to continue with their ties to one another." Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who is typically apolitical to nearly a fault, said via Instagram that Plank's "words were divisive and lacking in perspective." I appreciate and welcome the feedback from people who disagree (and agree) with Kevin Plank's words on CNBC, but these are neither my words, nor my beliefs. His words were divisive and lacking in perspective. Inadvertently creating a situation where the personal political opinions of UA’s partners and its employees were overshadowed by the comments of its CEO. A good company is not solely defined by its CEO. A good company is not defined by the athlete or celebrity who partners with them. A good company is not a single person. A good company is a team, a group of brothers and sisters committed to working together each and every day to provide for their families and one another and the clients they serve. We don’t partner with a brand casually. I partner with brands I trust and with people who share my same values. That means a commitment to diversity, inclusion, community, open-mindedness and some serious hard work. But it doesn't mean that I or my team will always agree with the opinion of everyone who works there, including its executives. Great leaders inspire and galvanize the masses during turbulent times, they don't cause people to divide and disband. My responsibility here is not only to the global audience we serve, but also to the thousands of workers who pour blood, sweat, and tears into making Under Armour strong. A diverse group of hardworking men and women who possess integrity, respect and compassion for one another and the world they live in. Debate is healthy. But in a time of widespread disagreement, so is loyalty. I feel an obligation to stand with this diverse team, the American and global workers, who are the beating heart and soul of Under Armour and the reason I chose to partner with them. My commitment is as real as my sweat and callouses that thicken daily. #CommittedToThePeople A post shared by therock (@therock) on Feb 9, 2017 at 10:36am PST It appears that that high-profile criticism took its toll on Planck, who purchased a full-page advertisement in The Baltimore Sun that read in part that “In a business television interview last week, I answered a question with a choice of words that did not accurately reflect my intent." Under Armour, Planck says, believes “immigration is a source of strength, diversity and innovation for global companies based in America...With an anticipated new executive order on immigration set to come out, we will join a coalition of companies in opposition to any new actions that negatively impact our team, their families or our community,” Here's the full ad, which, you might note, does not mention the President by name. An effort to have his cake and eat it too? Guess we'll have to keep our eyes on Trump's twitter feed, so we can see of UA will get the Nordstrom treatment or will manage to squeak past the presidential radar.

Can't Keep Calm The Rolling In The Deep singer was also seen expressing her immense love and respect for the 35-year-old singer during her acceptance speech at the Grammys after she won Album Of The Year Grammy. Notably, Adele left behind Beyonce, who was nominated for the same category for her recent album Lemonade. In her emotional speech, Adele claimed that the award should have belonged to Beyonce as her nominated album was so well-thought, inspiring and monumental. "I can't possibly accept this award. And I'm very humbled and I'm very grateful and gracious. But my artist of my life is Beyonce. And this album to me, the Lemonade album, is just so monumental. Beyonce, it's so monumental," Adele said. Meanwhile, Beyonce won two Grammy Awards this year and also made her baby bump debut at the awards gala.

The International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (IAM) held the vote under the auspices of the National Labor Relations Board. It was open to about 3,000 Boeing employees at the North Charleston facility. “We’re disappointed the workers at Boeing South Carolina will not yet have the opportunity to see all the benefits that come with union representation” the IAM’s Mike Evans said. “But more than anything, we are disheartened they will have to continue to work under a system that suppresses wages, fosters inconsistency and awards only a chosen few.” The vote is a victory for Boeing who campaigned hard to fight off unionisation at the South Carolina plant. Workers at Boeing’s other 787 facility in Washington state are already represented by the IAM union. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before voting again on union representation.

According to a company statement, more than 2,000 of the nearly 3,000 Boeing workers at the plant eligible to vote in the closely watched election voted against the union, and only a bit more than 700 members voted yes. “We will continue to move forward as one team,” said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina. “We have a bright future ahead of us and are eager to focus on the accomplishments of this great team.” Manufacturers have been drawn to the South because the region is strongly anti-union. Less than 2% of South Carolina workers are union members, the lowest unionization rate in the nation. Boeing spent billions to open its North Charleston plant, arguing it needs to assure customers who buy the 787 Dreamliner, which is built there, that the plant wouldn’t go on strike. A win would have given the Machinists, who represent most Boeing factory workers, even more leverage over Boeing in future labor talks. The loss could further encourage other manufacturers to open union-free plants in the South. The vote was seen as an uphill battle for the union, which dropped plans for a vote last year. About 40% to 50% of organizing votes fail. “Boeing management spent a lot of money to make sure power and profits remained concentrated at the very top,” said Mike Evans, the union’s chief organizer. The union will now have to wait at least a year to petition for another representation vote. “The IAM remains committed to getting Boeing South Carolina workers the respect, wages and consistency they deserve.” The plant will get additional attention this week as President Donald Trump plans to visit the plant Friday to mark the completion of the first 787-10, the newest version of the Dreamliner. “It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event,” said Robinson-Berry. Wages were a key issue in the vote. The union says South Carolina workers earn about $10 an hour less than union members at Boeing’s Washington state plants. For its part, Boeing says pay scales are driven by wages in the local market, and that the South Carolina plant already pays better than a union-represented Boeing plant in Alabama. The company emphasized the cost of union dues, about $800 a year, as well as the risk that the workers could be caught up in a strike they opposed.

By Doug G. Ware   |   Feb. 15, 2017 at 8:20 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo Feb. 15 (UPI) -- The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Wednesday indicated that President Donald Trump may want the United States to resurrect its pioneering spirit in outer space -- much the same way another American leader did five decades ago. Acting NASA Administrator Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr., sent a memo to employees Wednesday saying he had instructed the agency to work up a feasibility report on adding astronauts to its planned EM-1 flight late next year. The mission, which is currently unmanned, will launch NASA's new Space Launch System rocket with an Orion capsule. The spacecraft would orbit the moon and return to Earth. The agency's EM-2 mission, scheduled for years later, was supposed to be the spaceflight to carry humans. Lightfoot's directive, though, raises the possibility that NASA will instead put astronauts near the lunar surface far sooner than expected. EM-1 was planned as a test flight for both the SLS and Orion craft, with the expectation they would facilitate astronaut missions in the future -- including a manned mission to Mars. Placing humans on EM-1 could also speed up NASA's return to the moon's surface. The SLS is a heavy expendable launch vehicle designed by Boeing to succeed the canceled Constellation program and replace the Space Shuttle. The Orion craft, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, is intended to carry up to four astronauts to low Earth orbit and beyond. "The possibility of NASA accelerating the timeline to put humans into the vicinity of the moon and onto Mars is exciting," Boeing said Wednesday. Because both spacecrafts have yet to be completed and are still in the development stage, experts say adding astronauts to EM-1 would require substantial work and cost. "I know the challenges associated with such a proposition, like reviewing the technical feasibility, additional resources needed, and clearly the extra work would require a different launch date," Lightfoot wrote in the employee memo. "That said, I also want to hear about the opportunities it could present to accelerate the effort of the first crewed flight and what it would take to accomplish that first step of pushing humans farther into space." It's unclear how likely an attempt to man EM-1 is to succeed. Wednesday's memo to even explore the idea of ramping up next year's spaceflight is unusual for NASA, which had planned for years before putting Astronauts in space on past excursions. Trump's motivation to get aggressive, advisers say, may be to send a message to China that the United States intends to maintain its dominion in space -- much in the same way former President John F. Kennedy did with the Russians. Kennedy famously pledged in 1961 to beat the Soviet Union and put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. His assassination two years later kept him from witnessing the fruition of that goal in July 1969. To this day, the United States is still the only country to send a manned mission to the moon, having landed on the lunar surface six times between 1969 and 1972. NASA was set to return in 2020 under former President George W. Bush's Constellation program, but that endeavor was canceled in 2010 by former President Barack Obama.

Shally Seth Mohile Cessna is among the prominent aircraft makers that manufacture small business jets. Photo: Bloomberg Bengaluru: TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd, which makes aero structures and other aircraft parts, is looking to contract-manufacture small business jets having two to 10 seats, chief operating officer Lokesh Ranjan Srivastava said. The Tata group company also expects robust growth on the back of a strong order book from its key customers Boeing Co. and Airbus, Srivastava said in an interview at the Aero India air show. Though new business will shape up only in 2019, TAL has already begun talks with some plane makers for contract manufacturing, Srivastava said, declining to elaborate further. Jet Airways may order at least 50 Boeing 737 Max planes this year Bombardier Inc., Cessna Aircraft Co. and Dassault Aviation SA are some of the global aircraft makers that build small business jets. “It’s all at an early stage. It has to make business sense for us as well as the original equipment makers,” he said. TAL hopes to have a revenue of Rs730 crore by the end of 2020, said Srivastava. Its revenue has grown from Rs15 crore in fiscal 2014 to Rs45 crore in fiscal 2015 and Rs108 crore in fiscal 2016. It expects to end the year with Rs200 crore, he said. Airbus Helicopters scouting for manufacturing site in India “We have an order book of worth Rs2,000 crore to execute over the next six to seven years,” he said. To accommodate the new orders, TAL is in the process of acquiring land for an additional facility near its existing unit in Nagpur. Meanwhile, on the back of steady growth and strong order book of TAL and orders from Boeing and Airbus, Tata Advanced Materials Ltd, a sister company of TAL that makes composites and structural parts for the aerospace industry, also aims to double its revenues from the estimated Rs400 crore in fiscal 2017 to Rs800 crore by 2020, said S.R. Mukherjee, chief executive officer at Tata Advanced Materials. “The idea is to be a dominant player in aero structures,” he said. The company, which has also been a supplier of bullet-proof jackets to the military, concluded an order of 50,000 units last month. It also supplies assemblies and parts to Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.

It is a great book that Gilman herself describes as a story adapted from an old Jewish folksong about a tailor who makes his old coat into a jacket, vest and tie, and finally a button. When the button is lost, he makes a song up about it all." In the story, as the various items wear down, they are renewed through the vision and a labour of a loving grandfather tailor who sees not waste in the diminished garments, but instead the emergence of new potential. He truly makes something from nothing over and again. Gilman's work -as supported by the accolades and awards- is a rather extraordinary story. And yet, what does it mean to be extraordinary? On some level, I think we are all looking to lead extraordinary lives, but is the extraordinary something that magically appears or does it emerge out of the ordinary? In Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers, Gladwell studies many stories of success and finds that while natural ability or skill are important factors in determining our path in life, extreme amounts of concentrated practice (10,000 hours) and happenstance simultaneously play very powerful roles in defining our success. In a way, Gladwell suggests that repetition (likely often mundane) and random advantages seem to account for a significant portion of the reason for disproportionate success in the lives of many individuals. On Gladwell's theme, I have always found that my best ideas emerge in idle, unfocussed or mindless moments:an illuminated insight that comes to me while sitting in a coffee house, or the creative impulse that strikes while I am swimming laps, or the epiphany that hits in the middle of the night, all emerge out of the ordinary, or out of stillness or repetition. I think of the Boeing Moonshine Shop case as one powerful 'out of the ordinary' professional success stories. In the Boeing case, a group of creative individuals were freed from their normal duties to work on a team challenged to make something useful from the waste and scrap from Boeing's manufacturing processes. In addition, they were provided with no additional resources - beyond their own ingenuity, of course. What these teams created was nothing short of incredible. They ended up creating some of the most profitable and effective innovations at Boeing by making creative use of the "useless" waste that would have otherwise found itself in the trash. They created something extraordinary out of the ordinary. Imagine if every organization implemented such an "extraordinary" strategy. I wonder what extraordinary opportunities we might walk by every day that just require us to look more deeply or might challenge us to see the potential hiding in the mundane. What might we learn if we look for the ordinary/extraordinary in each other? What might emerge if "out of the ordinary" became our rallying cry? Perhaps more distinctiveness and less waste. Perhaps something...extraordinary.

"The great boom is over," Richard Aboulafia, analyst at Teal Group, said at an industry conference near Seattle on Wednesday. "But I don't see a bust cycle" unless there's a trade war, he added. An industry slowdown has implications for investors and suppliers trying to anticipate the flow of orders as a guide the capacity they will need to meet changes in aircraft production. Multi-year backlogs of jetliner orders at both big plane makers will cushion the downturn, along with rising sales of military aircraft, especially spy and fighter planes as defence spending is expected to rise at least initially under U.S. President Donald Trump, he added. Higher interest rates and a possible border tax on imports could hurt the U.S. aerospace industry, however, by causing the dollar to strengthen further, Aboulafia said. Also, the risk of a major trade dispute is as high as at any time since World War II, he added. A U.S. trade dispute with China would likely benefit European plane maker Airbus since China could easily retaliate against the U.S. by curbing orders of Boeing planes, Aboulafia said. In the commercial aircraft market, a planned ramp up in output of single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft is likely to continue. The two plane makers plan to increase output by more than 30 percent through the end of the decade and need the income from these high-volume assembly lines to hit their financial targets. "This is the part of the market where you're going to see continued growth," he said. But twin-aisle aircraft face a much tougher future because there are more models competing while demand is declining. "Everyone wants too much from this market," he said, adding that orders are "plateauing."

LYNNWOOD — Workers at the Lynnwood Convention Center are getting the place ready for the hundreds of aerospace leaders gathering here this week to discuss the industry’s future. The focus for this year’s Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance’s 16th annual conference is how to keep or gain an edge in an increasingly competitive global market. The alliance is a nonprofit advocating on behalf of the aerospace industry. From the biggest airplane makers — Boeing and Airbus — down to the smallest supplier, companies are being pushed to drive down production costs and time. That is “changing the way we design and build each part and component of today’s commercial and military jets,” the PNAA notes on its website. A glance at the conference’s agenda reveals the anxiety creeping through the industry. The titles of two presentations refer to the “more for less era.” Executives from leading aircraft manufacturers Boeing, Airbus, Embraer and newcomer Mitsubishi will update attendees on their airplane programs and where they see the market going. Suppliers, such as Ed Colvin, vice president at Arconic Forgings and Extrusions, will discuss how 3D printing and other new technologies are reshaping how parts are designed, made and delivered. More than 600 people representing 355 companies are traveling from 10 countries to attend the conference, which runs from Tuesday through Thursday. The conference also offers smaller companies opportunities to meet with representatives from Boeing and major aerospace suppliers. Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com.

She is predeceased by her brothers: Bill, Jack and George; sisters-in-law: Mary, Betty and Hazel; brother-in-law, Ellery, and her favorite yellow lab, Yukon Jac. In 1939 her family moved from the family farm in Wisconsin to Grand Coulee Dam, Washington, where her dad and brothers worked on the construction of Grand Coulee Dam.  After graduating from Grand Coulee High School in 1948 she managed the telephone company in Grand Coulee.  She then went on to work for Boeing in Seattle, where she met her husband, Val.  After a move to San Diego and Florida and back to San Diego, Val was transferred to Vandenberg Air Force Base and they have resided in Santa Maria since 1958.  She was a homemaker until Dale was in junior high school when she went to work at Sears in the old store as well as the new store in the Town Center, where she was a teletype operator in the catalog department, retiring in 1995.  She was very involved in all of our school activities, sports and scouting. She and Val enjoyed traveling, having traveled to every state in the United States, all Canadian Provinces and several trips to Europe. They were at their best when they were on the road.  She enjoyed gardening - especially raising orchids, cooking, shopping, crocheting afghans, sewing, gambling (any one-armed bandit would do, as long as it paid), attending NASCAR and sprint car races (Sammy Swindell was her favorite driver), and watching Kobe Bryant and the Lakers; but most of all - fishing at Cachuma, the Eastern Sierras, American and Sacramento Rivers, and trout fishing in Rush River as well as Twin Lakes in Washington. Her favorite was salmon fishing on the Sacramento River with her son Dale, and in her 80s she could still catch and land a 40 lb. salmon. It was an ongoing deal: I will go to the races but then we go fishing! She will be greatly missed but she is at peace and we shall see each other again. We would like to thank her caregivers, Percy, Bless, Michelle and Annie of All Family for all of their love and support of our mom, as well as Dignity Health Hospice nurse Trina, Mrs. Oklerblom and Chaplain Dominick Simonelli. There will be no services for Helen at her request.  If you would like to make a donation in Helen’s memory, please contact your local Alzheimer’s Association.  MOST POPULAR: Comments Viewed 1.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Former Conservative MP and fighter pilot Laurie Hawn says he was forced from his role as a RCAF honorary colonel because he voiced strong concerns about the Liberal government’s plan to buy the Boeing Super Hornet. But the Royal Canadian Air Force says Hawn was asked to resign because those serving in such honorary positions are not allowed to be political advocates or promote political opinions. Hawn, a former CF-18 pilot, was Honorary Colonel for 401 Tactical Fighter Squadron until Feb. 11 when he was asked to resign by RCAF commander Lt.-Gen. Mike Hood. “Speaking truth to power can be risky,” Hawn said in a recent post on his Facebook page. “I re-confirmed that this week by speaking out rather more forcefully than was appreciated to the Commander of the RCAF and the Chief of the Defence Staff, on the issue of the CF-18 replacement.” Hawn, who as Conservative parliamentary defence secretary was the Harper government’s point man advocating the purchase of the F-35 stealth fighter, outlined on Facebook what he believed were the flaws of the Super Hornet. He accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “foolish and inaccurate statements” on the fighter jet file. “And you thought that Donald Trump was the only purveyor of ‘alternate facts’,” Hawn wrote. Related Liberals admit ‘interim’ Super Hornet jets may only fly for 12 years, despite costing billions Parliamentary budget watchdog investigating unknown cost to purchase Super Hornet fighter jets Report critical of interim fighter jet purchases deleted from DND website amid plan to buy Super Hornets Hood asked Hawn to resign on Feb. 11 and Hawn did so, the RCAF confirmed in a statement to the Ottawa Citizen on Tuesday. “As political advocating is not compatible with continued service as an Honorary Colonel, Laurie Hawn has resigned as Honorary Colonel for 401 Tactical Fighter Squadron,” the RCAF noted in the statement. “His leadership and tireless commitment to the RCAF is deeply appreciated.” According to the RCAF, the public and the news media consider honorary appointees to be representatives of the Department of National Defence. “It is very important, however, that Honorary Colonels remain outside any public controversy concerning the Canadian Armed Forces, steer well clear of comments that could possibly threaten operational security and never use the appointment to promote political opinion or to seek political favour for the unit or any member thereof,” according to a policy statement forwarded by the RCAF. Hawn acknowledged on Facebook that, “I have been very critical of the 100% politically motivated plan to buy 18 “interim” Super Hornets for some time.” “Most Canadians may not really care about Super Hornet versus F-35, but I think they do care about the waste of billions of dollars for very little return, especially if it’s purely in the name of politics,” Hawn added. In November the Liberal government announced it was entering into discussions with the U.S. government and Boeing for the eventual acquisition of 18 “interim” Super Hornet jets until a permanent fleet for the existing CF-18 aircraft could be bought. The Liberals said Canada is facing a capability gap because it doesn’t have enough fighter jets to fulfill its military missions. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has blamed the previous Conservative government for bungling the project to replace the aging CF-18s. The Liberal government has acknowledged the decision to buy the 18 Super Hornets will cost more in the long run. Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Published: 18:02 February 15, 2017 Fareed Rahman, Senior Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Abu Dhabi: The International Defence Exhibition and Conference (Idex 2017) opens on Sunday in Abu Dhabi and will see 1,235 defence companies participating, up 3 per cent compared to the last edition in 2015, organisers said on Wednesday. The thirteenth edition of Idex and the fourth edition of the Naval Defence Exhibition (Navdex) will run from February 19 to 23, organised under the patronage of President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. This year’s Idex will see 125 local defence companies taking part — a sign of a growing local defence industry in the UAE. Navdex will host 99 naval defence companies from 27 countries. Organisers also said that this year’s Idex will welcome 100,000 visitors from across the globe. “Since its inception, Idex has consolidated its status as one of the leading international defence events. It has successfully showcased the pioneering efforts of our wise leadership to strengthen the country’s defence sector and enhance its capabilities,” said Major-General Pilot Faris Khalaf Al Mazrouei, chairman of the higher organising committee of Idex 2017 and Navdex 2017. He said the first day of the events will host spectacular live demonstrations by military personnel showcasing the capabilities of the UAE’s cutting edge defence equipment. Humaid Matar Al Daheri, group chief executive officer of the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company (Adnec), said since its inaugural edition in 1993, Idex has grown stronger. “We have witnessed a tremendous increase in the number of participants and visitors, as well as the exhibition and demonstration area. The first edition 24 years ago hosted only 350 companies from 34 countries, with the total exhibition space not exceeding 12,000 square metres.” Al Daheri noted that the number of participating countries had increased to 57 with the addition of ten new ones this year. Speaking on Navdex, he said the fourth edition of Navdex has received a strong response from specialised naval defence companies with 99 companies participating from 27 countries worldwide, representing an increase of 17 per cent over the last edition in 2015. Big names in the global defence industry, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, Embraer, Northrop Grumman as well as local companies such as Tawazun Holding, Emirates Defence Industries Company (Edic), will take part in the five-day event that will be held at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (Adnec). Boeing Defence, Space & Security will showcase the Apache Attack Helicopter, services and sustainment capabilities, as well as a diverse array of defence and security products. Bernard Dunn, president of Boeing Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, said in a statement that international sales currently represent roughly 37 per cent of Boeing Defence, Space & Security’s business and they see continued opportunities for growth, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions. “Boeing continues to work closely with the United Arab Emirates and other government and defence forces in the region who will be present at Idex and play a key role in enhancing security in the region,” Dunn said. A number of defence deals are expected to be signed during the event. Deals worth Dh18.3 billion were signed during Idex 2015.   More from Aviation Trump warms to Ex-Im Bank value Idex 2017 to kick start on Sunday Rolls-Royce tumbles to record $5.8b loss Emirates says flight was delayed by Delta Muscat International Airport ready by year end Etihad flight diverted due to 'security threat' Emirates CEO not worried about US open sky deals Emirates chair stands firmly by US operations tags from this storyUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGNAbu Dhabi follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGN+ MGNAbu Dhabi follow this tag on MGN+ MGNkhalifa bin zayed Also In AviationStrikes to cause disruption at German airports Business Gallery Classic car collectors gather in Paris Look: Inside the most expensive home in US Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Etihad flight diverted due to 'security threat' 02Strikes to cause disruption at German airports 03Idex 2017 to kick start on Sunday 04Emirates says flight was delayed by Delta 05Trump warms to Ex-Im Bank value 11Images Look: Inside the most expensive home in US Feb 08, 2017 14Images In Pictures: Hatta Honey Festival Feb 02, 2017 20Images Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Jan 18, 2017 1Image In pictures: Cannes Yachting Festival Sep 07, 2016 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News UAE to build first city on Mars by 2117 14 rescued after blaze near Floating Bridge Etihad flight diverted due to 'security threat' UAE wakes up to wet, rainy conditions Three bodies found in Sharjah oil tank Getting a Dubai driving licence could get harder Man caught growing marijuana in villa World Government Summit 2017: as it happened Friends, family pay tribute to Indian student Close Recommended For You The beauty detailsPUBLISHED ON Feb 16, 2017 The fashion detailsPUBLISHED ON Feb 16, 2017 Kim Jong Nam assassination: Second woman heldPUBLISHED ON Feb 16, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The Machinists already represent the majority of the Boeing factory workers across the country, but Boeing specifically chose to build its new plant in South Carolina back in 2011 so it would be a non-union plant. Only 2 percent of South Carolina workers are unionized, the lowest share of any state in the United States. A victory for the union would turn up the heat even more on Boeing, which has been under fire from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump bashed Boeing for the cost of the new Air Force One, even threatening to “Cancel order!” on Twitter. Other Relevant Elements Of The Boeing Story In addition, Trump’s head-butting with China and Iran has threatened deals two of Boeing’s largest international customers. Boeing’s South Carolina workers want to be paid in-line with their unionized peers in Washington. Boeing currently pays its Washington workers roughly $10/hour more than its South Carolina workers. Related Link: Attention Boeing Investors: Don't Worry About Trump's Trade War With China Boeing has argued that the pay discrepancy has to do with the economics of the local market. The company point out that South Carolina workers are currently paid more than unionized workers in Boeing’s Alabama plant. If workers vote to unionize in South Carolina and Boeing is forced to increase wages, the company will likely feel more pressure to further reduce its workforce. Boeing cut nearly 11,000 jobs in 2016 and plans on further cuts in 2017 as well.

Note the extended spoilers, which are controlled by fly-by-wire on the MAX. Photo: Guy Norris/AW&ST More Share Image EMAIL fullscreen Boeing’s push to automate wing manufacturing at Renton is moving to the next phase with the introduction of the spar assembly line (SAL).  Two SAL cells, each containing four robotic drilling machines, are replacing less efficient automatic spar assembly machines introduced in the mid-1990s with the development of the 737NG. The SAL reduces machine footprint by 80% while increasing throughput by 33%—two key aspects of the drive to accelerate production to 47, 52 and 57 aircraft per month in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The first production spars were processed through the SAL in the third quarter of 2016 and will be up and fully running by the end of 2017. The SAL follows the introduction of the panel assembly line (PAL), an automated system developed by  automated manufacturing specialist Electroimpact based in Mukilteo, Washington. The introduction of the PAL process builds on the shift to the horizontal build line for the 737 wing, which came in 2012 as part of the longer term rate increase from 35 aircraft per month to 42 per month. The horizontal buildup system, which replaced the traditional system of drilling and fastening in static vertical jigs, also introduced automated machines made by Electroimpact and sped up the wing build lower skin assembly process by 35%.

Log In or Register to post comments Pilchard on Feb 16, 2017 After so much blood sweat an tears with the 787 it's beyond me why management wouldn't immediately follow up by giving their teams the green light for a fresh design replacement of the 737. All that knowledge was squandered. All they had to do was say " OK now that you've done the 787, let's build a smaller and cheaper version". Perhaps they know that their bureaucratic structure could never function in an efficient scalar fashion. One can only imagine how their eyes would glaze over at the thought of the unnecessarily high development costs. Instead they continue to milk an old design and are another decade behind the eight ball. Weak executive management.

My running joke is the larger the number on the 737 the more pain one feels in ones butt, back, and thighs/hips.

They would have been far better off to have not destroyed the 757 tooling so they could have brought forth an advanced technology variant of it.

By Vasudevan Sridharan February 15, 2017 13:35 GMT A Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft flies during the inauguration of Aero India show at the Yelahanka Air Force Station in BengaluruAbhishek Chinnappa/Reuters Despite a low-key inauguration and the conspicuous absence of the usual fervour at the air show-cum-aviation exhibition, Aero India, leading defence firms from across the world appear keen to exploit the "Make In India" opportunity set in motion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. With deals worth billions of dollar up for grabs, top military contractors are currently camped in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, to participate in the five-day biennial extravaganza. The air show is a platform set up by the Indian government in 1996 to boost the aerospace and defence sectors and capitalise on the growing Indian market. The 11th edition of the show was inaugurated on Tuesday (14 February) by the country's Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar in the presence of chiefs of the armed forces. However, the absence of Modi and the host state's Chief Minister Siddaramaiah did not go unnoticed at the high-profile event, which is being touted as Asia's premier air show. Some of the big names participating include US manufacturers Lockheed Martin, Boeing; Britain's Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems; France's Dassault Aviation and Swedish defence major Saab. Moreover, comments made by foreign delegates include words such as "co-manufacture" and "co-develop" that show their eagerness to partner with Indian companies at the sprawling Yelahanka Air Base. Banners of the overseas firms also did not shy away from embracing Modi's Make In India initiative. In the hopes of hard-selling their military equipment to India, traditionally a country with a heavy dependency on arms import, more than 500 firms from Russia, Europe, Israel, the UK, and the US are exhibiting their products. The toughest challenge for them would be to overcome bureaucratic hurdles and adhere to strict government regulations as they look to setting up manufacturing bases in the country, in partnership with Indian firms. When asked about the rapidly changing political environment in the Western world especially the US, the defence minister said, "What I will say is what I want... I want you to Make in India. If someone wants to shift production to some other place, it is his choice. I am not concerned." Speaking at a press conference, Parrikar revealed that India needs about 1,000 civilian aircraft, 300-400 fighter jets, and 800-1,000 helicopters over the next 10 to 15 years making the country one of the most lucrative markets for defence deals in the world. Additionally, the country also requires routine replacement and maintenance of antiquated equipment. Only in early February, India earmarked Rs2.74tn (£33bn) for its annual defence budget – a marginal rise from the previous year.

The support from American firms emerged at the ongoing Asia's premier airshow Aero India 2017 here, where government is making a strong pitch for the 'Make in India' campaign, wooing global companies to be part of India's evolving story. The US-India Business Council is leading its delegation to Aero India 2017, showcasing continuity in the defence and security partnership between the US and India following India being designated as a 'Major Defense Partner', which directs the US government to prioritise defence trade with the country. The international delegation consists of more than 20 senior executives from American aerospace and defense companies, according to the Council. USIBC's Executive Mission is led by George Standridge, Vice President for Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin, and Tom Bell, Senior Vice President, Boeing. Senior executives representing America's top defense companies, including Arconic, Telephonics, Raytheon, Honeywell, Harris Corporation and Textron Systems are part of USIBC's delegation, USIBC said in a statement here. At a seminar here on opportunities to integrate India into the global supply chain held by USIBC, Mission co-lead George Standridge, Vice President for Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said, "India is an important partner for the US industry." Aero India 2017, he said, is an excellent venue to further discussions in support of Modi's call to 'Make in India', and "we are committed to sharing knowledge, skills, and technology, today and in the future." "The US and Indian defense industries are poised to work collaboratively to position India as a major defense partner of the United States," Tom Bell, Senior Vice President of Global Sales & Marketing for Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) said. Boeing is committed to facilitating the ecosystem for India's defense industrial base in a manner that supports job growth in both the countries, Bell said. Aero India 2017 is an ideal venue to exchange lessons learned and showcase our commitment and progress supporting the Indian market and the 'Make in India' initiative, Hector F Colon, Corporate Vice President for Telephonic Corporation, said. "We look forward to continue our effort with USIBC to strengthen the Make in India campaign and also foster the blossoming of India-US defense collaboration," he said. USIBC's Director of Aerospace and Defense, Ben Schwartz said 2017 should be an exciting year for the defense industry. "We are hopeful that some key changes will take place that augur well for the bilateral partnership such as an agreement on communications security and the reform of defense offset management," he said.   Tweet Go to Top Videos India launches record 104 satellites at one go 3 dead, 21 injured after building slab collapses Watch: Rahul Gandhi performs aarti at Harki Pauri Watch: BJP woos its voters pedaling through Mumbai streets 2 villagers shot dead by 11 Maoists Protesters target police in Paris suburb unrest Satyarthis Nobel Prize replica recovered Woman falls to her death off escalator at WTC 'PM Modi likes peeping into others' bathroom': Rahul Gandhi Videos Beauty in the Sky: Aero India begins...

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Infinite Horace II, the first five missions Home Featured Articles The Flare Path: Sings The Unsung By Tim Stone on February 10th, 2017 at 1:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Once I’ve typed up this sortie summary, Infinite Horace II, my latest B-17: Queen of the Skies hope chalice, will be setting off on his sixth combat mission. Unlike the original Infinite Horace, a B-17 Flying Fortress based in England and crewed by RPS writers, Infinite Horace II is a B-24 Liberator based in Southern Italy and crewed – with one exception – by foolhardy fearless Flare Path readers. The steed change was partially motivated by curiosity (I was keen to try Preston McMurray’s rigorously researched B-24 rules variant) and partially by a desire to sing the unsung. Despite being more numerous than their Boeing-designed brothers-in-arms and in many ways (range, ceiling, speed, bomb load…) more capable, Flying Boxcars have always played second fiddle to Flying Fortresses in the popular imagination. Key differences between the two types are reflected in a clutch of carefully thought-out B17QotS rule changes. The Liberator’s retracting rolltop desk-style bomb bay doors bestow benefits during bombing runs but make ditching and wheels-up landings more perilous. Weaker wings and higher stick forces mean wing root hits are more dangerous and autopilot damage is potentially more serious. The USAAF’s tendency to overburden the bomber translates into dicier take-offs. Thanks to our higher cruise speed, Shiloh, our tail-end Charlie, has an increased chance of hitting tailgaters, and because of our exceptional range, fuel leaks are slightly less worrying. The ten souls cocooned within B-24J Infinite Horace II as he droned towards the oil refineries of Fiume (Rijeka) on his maiden op were… JFS – nose turret gunner Eightball – bombardier phuzz – navigator Yours Truly – pilot JB – co-pilot bsplines – engineer unacom – radio operator/waist gunner* Lord Byte – ball gunner Rorschach617 – waist gunner Shiloh – tail gunner (Gothnak, Leafy Twigs, and Rituro are on stand-by) *Though the B-24J had two waist gun positions, only one of these was manned full-time. In the event of an attack the radio operator was expected to hurry aft and occupy the vacant position. It was a four-zone mission and trouble arrived early in the form of a determined Fw 190 attack in zone 2. Three bandits managed to slip through both our fighter picket and the fiery ticker tape parade organised by Horace’s Browning brandishers. Fortunately, apart from a nibbled port rudder and a fuel tank hit that instantly self-sealed, the Focke-Wulfs only managed to cause superficial damage. The escorts performed better when another schwarm of Fw 190s tried their luck in zone 3, but they couldn’t stop a climbing Me 109 from drilling Horace’s belly as we neared the target. Though the Axis ascender only scored one significant hit, that hit was to our bomb bay door mechanism. When Eightball attempted to open the doors at the start of the bomb run, he found they wouldn’t budge. I think it would be fair to describe the journey back to Foggia as ‘tense’. Harassed by Me 109s over the Adriatic (Shiloh came very close to opening his account. Ball gunner Lord Byte escaped death by inches when his turret was trashed) the collective sigh of relief that was let out when Infinite Horace II, still heavy with HE, touched down safely at Cerignola could have been heard in Rome. Compared to the Rijeka run, Mission 2 was a cakewalk. We watched several blazing Liberators dash themselves against the Apennines during the five-zone trip to Verona, but nestled in the middle of the formation, had a quiet time ourselves. Part of the high group, even the flak batteries ringing the cratered marshalling yard that was our target posed little danger. In the circumstances, the fact that only 20% of our payload fell where it was meant to fall, was more than a little disappointing. The bright spot of the mission occurred as we turned for home. A Zerstörer approaching from 10.30 low, danced through the twining tracer streams of JFS, Lord Byte, and Rorschach617, missed us with its own emissions, then fell to Shiloh’s Ma Deuces moments after streaking past Horace’s tail. We’d only been back a few minutes when Technical Sergeant Someoldguy set up his stepladder and began painting a small black Me 110 outline on the side of the cockpit. The Infinite Horace II story almost ended a couple of minutes into Mission 3. A post-modifier ‘1’ on table G8 sent heavily-laden Horace careering off the end of the runway at Cerignola, the lucky – bearing in mind all that fuel and HE aboard – survivor of a potentially catastrophic take-off accident. Unexpected loss of engine power? Elevator malfunction? Forgotten four-leaf clover? Flight deck wasp? The tables refused to say. Repairs were completed in time for us to join the air armada heading Rome-ward on May 3. In theory a relatively easy two-zone outing, the sky above The Eternal City was alive with Augsburg eagles by the time we turned up. Four Me 109s decided to have a shy at Horace and one attacking from 6 high had the satisfaction of seeing his shells strike aluminium. Controls cables in the tail were chafed and radio operator unacom arrived in the waist to find it pierced by unfamiliar shafts of sunlight. The excitement passed as quickly as it had come and an uneventful return leg gave Eightball and me plenty of time to reflect on another mediocre bombing display (Only 40% of our bombs were on target). Mission 5. Belgrade. Infinite Horace II is eastbound midway between Mostar and the Yugoslavian capital. His fuselage is bullet-gouged in numerous places but his crew are quietly jubilant. The reason for the high morale and the majority of the holes is the pair of crooked smoke pillars behind us. The pillars mark the terminal trajectories of two Fw 190s that underestimated the prowess of nose gunner JFS and ball gunner Lord Byte. I let the mood percolate for a few minutes before announcing over the intercom that we will be descending to 10,000 feet in order to prevent Rorschach617 from losing his extremities to frostbite (the waist heater was shot out during the attack). Everyone knows what the altitude change means. We’ll be in the flak zone come Belgrade. Cantering Mustangs do their best to keep the bandits away on the approach to the target. I’m dimly aware of discouraged Me 109s and thickening flak as we line up for the run. For a horrible moment the insanity of what we’re doing tunnels my vision and stops my breath then something, training perhaps or a sense of responsibility, kicks in and I recover. Press on. Follow Eightball’s instructions. It can’t be long now. The next few minutes are a blur. Did the flak burst hit us a split-second before Eightball released our earth shakers or a split-second after? When the unburdened Horace began rising like an elevator was Engine 3 already riddled with shrapnel and screaming? I can see JB shutting down the runaway and feathering the prop while engineer bsplines calmly assists. I can hear myself asking every member of the crew in turn for injury and damage reports. I can remember listening to the string of ‘OKs’ with mingled relief and disbelief (Shiloh doesn’t admit to his lacerated shoulder until we are halfway home). Apart from that trashed engine all of Horace’s injuries are relatively minor. Flying slivers of steel have bodkinned the nacelles of Engines 2 and 4 here and there, but bsplines can see no signs of deeper issues. Shiloh traces a new tail turret draft to a small jagged hole in the tailplane root, and Rorschach doesn’t like the look of one of the control cable conduits in the waist, but, fingers-crossed, none of these flesh wounds will prevent us getting home. Concerned P-51s watch over us as we flee Serbia. They drive off a series of bandits drawn like vultures to the straggling, slowed Horace. In zone 4 one of the predators, an Me 110, sees an opportunity and commences a curving, climbing head-on attack. Our nose guns begin to chatter as I initiate a turn (Thank goodness Horace is a B-24J rather than one of the earlier front turret-less Liberator variants). Lord Byte’s ball turret Brownings join the chorus. Tadpoles of red fire rush past the windscreen. That evening in the mess, using an empty beer bottle to represent our ship and a smouldering Diamond Joe cigar to represent the doomed Zerstörer, Lord Byte and JFS demonstrate to a small but rapt audience how Infinite Horace II achieved her fourth kill. Behind them Eightball, Rorschach617, bsplines and phuzz noisily punish pool balls while Shiloh and unacom brainstorm some new aspect of their fiendishly complicated dice-based baseball simulation (they’ve been rerunning the 1940 World Series since we arrived in Italy).

Anyway, everything was going fairly well for the crew of Lucky Lou until our 10th mission over Meaulte. Dropping out of formation to 10,000 ft to avoid Flt Sgt Blow running the risk of frostbite, we were pounced on by a FW190 in a vertical dive who planted 4 shells square in #4 engine, causing a runaway. Co-pilot Will Goodrich ordered an immediate bail out, but only starboard waist gunner Rich Cliveden made it out, landing in occupied France and being picked up by a German patrol shortly thereafter. Not so Lucky Lou, as it turned out. They’ll be scraping what was left of the rest of us aircrew off the rooftops in Meaulte for some time to come, I reckon.

He had stepped outside for a smoke, after a gruelling shift in the operating theatre, when the hospital was bombed. He told me it was clearly marked. He was one of the very few survivors. He got bombed again. It was never again that close. So please. Do not turn this into some weird kind of a circular time-altering experiment on your radio-man.

The support from American firms emerged at the ongoing Asia's premier airshow Aero India 2017 here, where government is making a strong pitch for the 'Make in India' campaign, wooing global companies to be part of India's evolving story. The US-India Business Council is leading its delegation to Aero India 2017, showcasing continuity in the defence and security partnership between the US and India following India being designated as a 'Major Defense Partner', which directs the US government to prioritise defence trade with the country. The international delegation consists of more than 20 senior executives from American aerospace and defense companies, according to the Council. USIBC's Executive Mission is led by George Standridge, Vice President for Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin, and Tom Bell, Senior Vice President, Boeing. Senior executives representing America's top defense companies, including Arconic, Telephonics, Raytheon, Honeywell, Harris Corporation and Textron Systems are part of USIBC's delegation, USIBC said in a statement here. At a seminar here on opportunities to integrate India into the global supply chain held by USIBC, Mission co-lead George Standridge, Vice President for Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said, "India is an important partner for the US industry." Aero India 2017, he said, is an excellent venue to further discussions in support of Modi's call to 'Make in India', and "we are committed to sharing knowledge, skills, and technology, today and in the future." "The US and Indian defense industries are poised to work collaboratively to position India as a major defense partner of the United States," Tom Bell, Senior Vice President of Global Sales & Marketing for Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) said. Boeing is committed to facilitating the ecosystem for India's defense industrial base in a manner that supports job growth in both the countries, Bell said. Aero India 2017 is an ideal venue to exchange lessons learned and showcase our commitment and progress supporting the Indian market and the 'Make in India' initiative, Hector F Colon, Corporate Vice President for Telephonic Corporation, said. "We look forward to continue our effort with USIBC to strengthen the Make in India campaign and also foster the blossoming of India-US defense collaboration," he said. USIBC's Director of Aerospace and Defense, Ben Schwartz said 2017 should be an exciting year for the defense industry. "We are hopeful that some key changes will take place that augur well for the bilateral partnership such as an agreement on communications security and the reform of defense offset management," he said.

With no more orders for the F-16 from the Pentagon, Lockheed plans to use its Fort Worth, Texas plant instead to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. Lockheed would switch F-16 production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the U.S. In his first few weeks in office, he has pushed companies, from automakers to pharmaceutical firms, to produce more in the United States. In Lockheed's case, however, the plan is to build the F-16 to equip the Indian Air Force, and not sell them back into the United States. Lockheed said it has been talking to Trump's transition and governance teams as well as the U.S. Congress for several months on its plans, including the proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman told Reuters in Washington. "We've briefed the Administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama Administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the Government of India," the spokesman said. "We understand that the Trump Administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programs, and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with U.S. policy priorities." India is expected to spend $250 billion on defence modernisation over the next decade, analysts say, and there is concern that a veto on making the F-16 in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the plan to build the plane in India. A person close to Lockheed said company officials did not know what the Trump administration planned to do about the proposal to shift F-16 production to India. "They're following it closely and talking with the White House. But if they don't move production to India, there's no way they'll get the India contract," the person said. One argument to be made was that moving to India would preserve some component production in the United States. "Twenty-five percent of something is better than zero percent of nothing," the person said. NO THREAT TO U.S. JOBS Lockheed has said that moving F-16 assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. It has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16 would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India. "We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India," Randall L. Howard, head of F-16 business development, told Reuters ahead of India's biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB's Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. The Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage. The Indian air force alone needs 200-250 fighters over the next 10 years, its former chief Arup Raha said before he left office in December. Negotiating arms contracts with India can take years, and industry officials said there was no guarantee Lockheed would win the contract even if it moves production to India. Defence ties between India and the United States have grown rapidly, with U.S. arms sales of more than $4 billion in 2012-15, mostly under government-to-government foreign military sales, upstaging long-term supplier Russia and even Israel. Lockheed's executive director for international business development, Abhay Paranjape, said his team has met with representatives from 40 defence and aviation firms in India to help build the ancillary network for the aircraft assembly programme. "We want to be prepared, that's why we started the ground work," he said, adding Lockheed has also scouted possible factory sites in India. Lockheed has a joint venture with India's Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to make airframe components for the C-130J Super Hercules transport plane and the S-92 helicopter. "The capability for building components exists here, it's been proven with the C-130s. The challenge now is to pick the right partners," Paranjape said. 0 0 Lockheed says U.S. may take 'fresh look' at its India F-16 plan was posted in world of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on February 15, 2017 and was last updated on February 15, 2017.

(AP) " Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted Wednesday not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. "Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next," Evans said. "We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better." The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. "It is an economic development tool," Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. "We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina." At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. Continued below. Related Content Your views: Readers letters' National kicks off election promises with more police and ambitious burglary target Small Business: Helping you keep a record of your jewellery - GemLab Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. "Boeing is very, very different," Hirsch said. "No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union." Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. "Costs are out of control," Trump tweeted in early December. "Cancel order!" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to "fight the unions" at Boeing. "They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it," Templeton said. Asked earlier Wednesday about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. "I think we're doing just fine without a union presence," he said. In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. "It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event," she said. ___ This story has been corrected to show that 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, rather than 1,900. ___ Emery Dalesio contributed to this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

From the miniskirt we moved to the drape dress. From obligatory neckties we now have cool-biz. And whatever happened to those loose socks? Ditto for loose economic theories. My economics education began back in the days when protectionist polices were the norm. After all had not Germany and the United States relied heavily on such policies to create their industrial empires? And was not Japan already booming ahead because it protected its industries? The rationale then was as valid as it is now: Certain industries crucial to the industrial base should be protected to create the foundation for further industrial progress. But somewhere along the line they discovered some industries were getting protection they did not deserve. Ugly trade wars were also breaking out. So a new generation of economists emerged armed with blackboards and diagrams that proved the universal merits of free trade. Only newly emerging industries — “infant industries” — could qualify for protection, we were told, grudgingly. At the time the word “free” also had a political, anti-communist cachet. So soon it was not just trade that had to be freed, but currencies also. Before long “protectionism” was a dirty word, to be snarled at anyone, no doubt a “communist,” who sought even the minimal protection needed for an important industry to survive. Even the European Union’s move to protect and develop its own aviation industry — Airbus to compete with Boeing — had to be condemned even though the competition between the two has led to obvious benefits for the world aviation industry. Dogma has strange effects on people. Now we see yet another fashion switch with U.S. President Trump complaining about currency manipulators and insisting on across-the-board protection for U.S. industries threatened by low-cost producers like China. And to some extent he could be right. The currency of a developing nation is often undervalued relative to its production efficiency; Chinese production line assemblers can be as efficient or even more so than their U.S. equivalents, but at current exchange rates they will be paid only a fraction of the U.S. wage. There should be some mechanism — flat rate surcharges on cross-border transactions, for example — to allow advanced economies to avoid the damage caused by this imbalance. There should also be mechanisms to curb the harmful effects of the violent currency swings we see today. Protectionism gets much of its bad name from the examples of weak economies trying to industrialize by massively protecting all import-competing industries. A vicious cycle gets under way. Costs rise across the economy. Exporting becomes even more difficult than before. Trade balances collapse. The currency has to be devalued. Costs rise even further across the economy as a result. Latin America — Argentina in the past and now Venezuela — is exhibit No. 1. But it does not have to be that way. As I wrote on these pages earlier, Thailand relying on intelligent and highly targeted protectionism to force or encourage foreign, mainly Japanese, direct investment has come from nowhere to become a global exporter of vehicles (www.gregoryclark.net/jt/page137/page137.html ). Any other nation, even the so-called basket-case economies of Africa and the Middle East, could do the same. The only condition is for them to have a reasonably sized domestic market within their borders, combining with surrounding nations if needed. But the moment they try to do this the advanced nations begin the free trade rant that has kept these nations in their baskets for so long and with little chance of escape. The U.S. under Ronald Reagan skillfully used the threat of quotas and surcharges to revive its domestic car and other industries under threat. Tokyo screamed protectionism. But it bowed to the inevitable and started to build its factories in the U.S. Today it is very glad it did that. But if a nation wants to go the protectionist route, policies have to be carefully thought out and targeted. Australia is a pathetic example of how things can go wrong. It abandoned most of its low- and mid-tech industries under the free trade dogma that said people losing employment in industries hit by imports would automatically move to high-tech industries. Australia would become the Scandinavia of the South Pacific, exporting computers and other advanced gadgets to the rest of the world. When that did not happen it decided it would rely on high automobile tariffs to become a car industry powerhouse. All it got was a range of inefficient producers struggling to survive and now whittled down to the point of extinction. To preserve at least some manufacturing employment it is now into massively subsidizing a nascent submarine industry. Meanwhile Japan by very slowly phasing out protection, even for low-tech industries, has given its industries time to evolve and expand. Toray and Teijin, once exclusively textile producers, are now major world producers of carbon fiber, for example. The free traders also fail to realize the difference between protection for consumer and for producer goods. Tariffs on imported consumer goods act as little more than a tax on domestic consumers, hopefully to encourage or protect areas of the economy seen as important for employment, cultural or other reasons. Many taxes are imposed for much less worthy causes. Problems only arise when tariffs are imposed on producer goods since this raises costs across the economy, Latin American style. Trump gets a bad rap for his dislike of trade blocs. Yet even here he may have a point. The North American Free Trade Agreement may have done wonders for the Mexican and Canadian car industries, but it has devastated Detroit. Meanwhile efficient, large-scale U.S. corn producers have crippled Mexico’s rural economy, and maybe encouraged the rural unemployed into the drug industry. Trade liberalization is a worthy goal. But it should come about through carefully crafted bilateral deals rather than blunderbuss multilateral agreements where weak economies are thrown willy-nilly into competing with stronger economies — laid-back Greeks being forced to compete with disciplined Germans within the EU, for example. Here Trump with his anti-TPP hang-ups could come closer to the truth than the academics with their blackboards. Gregory Clark is a former Australian diplomat and longtime resident of Japan is now active in Japan’s education industry. He has also served as an adviser on industrial policy in Canberra and written extensively on the subject. A Japanese translation of this article will appear on www.gregoryclark.net .

Speaking specifically about US firms offering aircraft for the single-engine fighter sought by the Indian Air Force (IAF), he said: "I don't think they would have made the offer if they didn't have clearances to give us what we need. That is their problem even if there are issues, although I've not heard of any. And, so far as India is concerned, we are very clear about buying from a strategic partner. We don't want to just buy the aircraft." He was answering a specific question about US President Donald Trump being critical of American firms setting up manufacturing units outside of the US. Lockheed Martin, which makes the F-16, and Boeing, which makes the F/A 18 Super Hornet, have both offered to move their units to India. "I think any further questions on this matter need to be asked to the companies," Parrikar said. LCA-Navy has full support Notwithstanding the Indian Navy's rejection of the LCA-Navy, Parrikar allayed fears of the project being shut down. "The Navy is supporting the project. In fact, the second line of LCA production, which was approved at a cost of Rs 1,359 crore, will have the Navy's contribution too." The Navy will be contributing 25% of the cost, while the IAF will contribute another 25% and HAL will put in the remaining 50%, as TOI had reported earlier. At present, HAL can make eight aircraft a year and this line, once functional, will be able to make eight more per year. However, this line will become the third line for LCA, with HAL already having converted its old Kiran hangar to expedite production, given the demand. The clearance for the line Parrikar spoke about got the clearance of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) only last week. "It is wrong to say the Navy does not support the LCA ...You are being misinformed by an internal lobby," he said. Conceding that the fifth-generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) India is developing with Russia has some unresolved issues, Parrikar said: "A small team has been created to deal with these issues (pertaining to manufacturing, how exports will be done, other approvals and so on) and we are confident of resolving them."

If something is not given or someone has not given it to them, then they cannot give a quote to me,” responded India’s Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar at the Aero India show 2017 in Bengaluru to queries on US President Donald Trump's America First policy to revive US manufacturing and generate local jobs. Parrikar’s reply must make Lockheed Martin camp uneasy in the changed scenario after Trump’s becoming President of US that promotes domestic manufacturing and has warned companies from shifting production line from America. “We’ve briefed the administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the government of India…We understand that the Trump administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programs and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with U.S. policy priorities,” reads a statement from Lockheed Martin few days back. India had issued limited tender to jet manufacturers of countries like US, Sweden and Russia in October last year to select yet another fighter to be built in India under technology transfer. SAAB of Sweden and Lockheed Martin from USA had responded with initial offer which entail Transfer of Technology (ToT) for manufacturing of fighter jets in India. “The product which I want to buy, I want it to be made in India. Export to third nation is an additional bonus. If someone wants to shift a facility to India it's his choice, or he wants to assemble a new one. I am no way concerned with it,” said India’s Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar at the Aero India show 2017 in Bengaluru. India is expected to issue formal detailed request of proposal after receiving initial response from the global manufacturers in 2018. In the absence of formal proposal, global manufacturers are unaware of demanded numbers, technical requirements and cost of the exercise. However, final deal is expected to be signed by year 2021.

(Kevin Clark / The Herald) EvCC brings manufacturing training classes to north county Kari Bray Fri Feb 10th, 2017 10:00pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. ARLINGTON — There’s a noisy shop space at Weston High School where college students turn blocks of metal into tools and machine parts. It’s the precursor to what Everett Community College and Arlington officials hope will become a permanent arm of the Advanced Manufacturing Training &Education Center, or AMTEC, in north Snohomish County. New EvCC classes at Weston are an extension of AMTEC in Everett. There are courses in precision machining and programs focused on job readiness and training for employers and employees. The college began offering manufacturing and continuing education classes at Weston in September, following a small pilot program last summer. This winter, there are nine manufacturing students. More than 60 students are enrolled in other programs here for job and college preparation or professional development. The manufacturing program is geared toward filling a growing demand for skilled workers. Arlington and Marysville have some of the highest concentrations of manufacturing jobs in the county, behind Paine Field and Boeing. There’s a need for more programs in north county to ready local workers for those jobs, said John Bonner, a vice president at EvCC. The long-term goal is to find a larger, permanent location in the Arlington and Smokey Point area for an AMTEC North, he said. “We’re working with the school district and the city, and with their help we’ve started a small program in Weston High School,” he said. “It doesn’t represent AMTEC North, but it represents an important step toward us doing something bigger in the future.” Jerry Becraft, 52, and Adam Gott, 21, are instructors. Becraft started working in steel manufacturing when he was young, and he has taught and trained in the industry. Gott previously did construction work but learned precision machining from his grandfather. “We are all about hands-on,” Becraft said. There is some classroom work, but for the most part, they try to keep students on the machines. Once students grasp the basics, they can pursue projects, such as making tools. Becraft and Gott answer questions and walk them through steps. The instructors are strict about some things. They expect students to be on time, and they’re in class early in case someone wants to spend extra time on projects. “We run it like a machine shop,” Becraft said. The students learn to run manual and computer numerical control mills and lathes. They also practice reading blueprints and inspecting parts. More in-depth blueprint work is being added because it’s in demand from employers. “We really try to tailor it to what they’re asking for,” Gott said. An advisory board helps them keep track of the needs. Precision machining allows for variety and creativity. Students make levels, vice handles and a base for calipers, a measuring tool. Gott remembers his grandfather making a lever for an old-fashioned wood splitter. Becraft put months of work into researching, designing and machining a set of bagpipes made from African blackwood and copper. Most students start the program with little or no knowledge about machining, Gott said. They can go from not knowing the names of machines to making their own tools within a month. “I like building confidence,” Becraft said. “You put in the effort. You’re going to reap the reward.” He also sees the program as a window for high school students, who can go straight into EvCC’s manufacturing classes after graduation. Rob Giger, 46, started at the EvCC program to train for a new career after he was hurt working at a recycling plant. “I wish I would have done this 20 years ago,” he said. “I like that I’m working with my hands and I also have to use my head. Everything we do is all precision, all within a few thousandths of an inch.” Last week, Phil Montano, 48, used a manual lathe to make a replacement part for another machine. He previously worked as an aerospace engineer before being laid off, he said. The Marysville man decided to learn about the other end of the business. Now he better understands the demands on machinists to meet stringent requirements on parts. Montano was grateful to find a training program nearby. “I’m willing to go all over the place, but having it so close to home is super convenient,” he said. Sam Carpenter, 31, was connected to the manufacturing program through WorkSource. He lives in Mount Vernon. He enjoys working on manual machines. The program has taught him to double check every part because it’s all about detail, he said. “It doesn’t take much to make a part scrap,” Carpenter said. “Despite that, it’s not as scary as it sounds.” Kari Bray: 425-339-3439; kbray@heraldnet.com Learn more Information sessions about AMTEC programs in Arlington are scheduled for 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. Monday and again March 13. The sessions are at Weston High School, 4407 172nd St. NE. For more information, go to everettcc.edu/arlington.   Christian Sandoval works through a class assignment during a manufacturing class..
