Group Captain Amit Mahajan said it was the first landing of this C-17 Boeing on this advance landing ground bordering China, demonstrating the air force's capability to reach out to this remote ALG after AN-32 and C-130J aircraft. At an elevation of 6,200 feet, the 4,200 ft-long runway is located just 29km from the Sino-Indian border. Conventional military cargo aircraft operate from 9,000 feet runways even at sea level airfields. Mahajan said this is a quantum jump from the existing capability of AN-32 and C-130J aircraft. Such airlift capability facilitates critical requirement of transfer of men and materials on this rugged terrain, interspersed by high mountain ranges that inhibit road connectivity. In the event of a disaster in the region, C-17 operations to the remote ALG can enhance the speed and quantum of national relief effort. On August 19, the upgraded ALG at Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh's East Siang district was inaugurated by Union minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju. The touchdown by a Su-30MKI, a frontline fighter jet of the air force at the ALG is a "historic first" in the predominantly hilly state of Arunachal Pradesh which has several ALGs at varying altitudes. The air force will continue to validate airlift operations to the remaining ALGs being renovated in Arunachal Pradesh. This will usher in a new dimension in enhanced disaster response, Mahajan added. Following a memorandum of understanding between the government of Arunachal Pradesh and the ministry of defence in June 2009, the air force had embarked on an ambitious reconstruction plan to upgrade eight ALGs, including infrastructure development at an overall outlay of nearly Rs1,000 crore. The ALGs at Walong, Ziro, Along, Mechuka and Pasighat have since been upgraded and are operational now. Two ALGs at Tuting and Tawang are expected to be ready by the year-end, while the ALG at Vijaynagar will undergo reconstruction as soon as the road connectivity between Miao and Vijaynagar is restored, sources said. The a C-17 transport aircraft was received by the detachment commander Flt Lt S. Dixit on its maiden landing in Mechuka. The air crew, who were part of this historic landing were Group Captain T.R. Ravi, Wing Commander P. Sisodia, Wing Commander K. Patnaik, Master Warrant Officer Tripathi and Warrant Officer Nirana Ram. This would also pave the way for operation of civil flights operating to and from these newly upgraded ALGs that would give a huge fillip to tourism as well as improve the connectivity to these remote locations in the Northeast.  More stories in North East Atul pins hope on BJP stance Mora Dipholu loses colour Russian tourist drowns Eviction fear grips settlers Nomination paper binned No-campaign directive at Raas Ibobi in fix over districts Govt help sought as 200 fall ill after feast Cloud over ST status for six groups NSCN-U to push for peace talks Marathon mission for rights Plea to understand NE psyche Meet focuses on tribes Light on Arunachal tour permit goof-up Cry to protect tribal identities GMC steps up fogging drill Cong mulls legal options BJP gears up for Tripura byelections 13 child labourers rescued Prove us wrong, NGO tells firm Plans to improve air travel in region    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE A model of a widebody jet, which is planned to be developed by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation is presented at an air show, the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition. While Beijing seeks to challenge leading Western manufacturers Boeing and Airbus, the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, will develop a 280-seat wide-body plane with a range of 12,000 kilometers China and Russia will invest up to $20 billion to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet, reports Thursday and a company statement said, as Beijing seeks to challenge leading Western manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. The hugely ambitious plan was first agreed between the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), whose products include the Sukhoi Superjet 100, in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing. COMAC said in a statement that the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, will develop a 280-seat wide-body plane with a range of 12,000 kilometers. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. The project is worth between $13 billion and $20 billion, with each side contributing half, China's state-run Global Times newspaper on Thursday quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying. "COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property," Slyusar told the newspaper at the China Airshow in the southern city of Zhuhai, adding the plane will be 10 percent cheaper than its competitors. According to the companies' websites, the list price of a 280-seat Airbus A350 is $272.4 million, while a 290-seat Boeing 787 costs $264.6 million. Their putative China-Russian rival will make its first flight in seven years' time, COMAC said, with deliveries beginning three years later. But developing commercial aircraft is an advanced technological challenge and previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. COMAC said it will keep the project open and select global suppliers that are willing to "jointly shoulder risks." Beijing is looking to build up its domestic aerospace industry, with the sector among those highlighted in its "Made in China 2025" plan. The country is expected to become the world's largest aviation market, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. Airbus estimates China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion. COMAC is also developing its own single-aisle jet, the C919. It rolled it out last year and even though it has yet to make its first flight COMAC says it has so far received 570 orders from 23 customers. The firm's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight in June after years of delays.

Russia's UAC and China's Comac hope to give global commercial aviation leaders Boeing and Airbus a run for their money with their new design. United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) provided aircraft enthusiasts a glimpse of the new aircraft in mock-up form at Airshow China-2016, taking place in Zhuhai, China this week. Company representatives complemented the unveiling of the mockup by announcing that they have begun a search for suppliers. Officials did not specify funding details or technical characteristics of the joint project, but were able to confirm that the assembly of the new plane will take place in Shanghai. The unveiling was attended by Comac chairman Jin Zhuanglong, OAK director Yuri Slyusar and Russian Trade and Industry Minister Denis Manturov. #Comac unveils the model of #C929 wide-body, co-production with Russia’s @UAC_Russia, at #zhuhaiairshow pic.twitter.com/ewHRhFOa2X — ChinaAviationDaily (@CNAviationDaily) 2 ноября 2016 г. ​The new, as yet unnamed jetliner is expected to start flight testing in 2021, and to enter commercial production by 2025. The project was announced in 2014 during President Vladimir Putin's visit to China as part of a $13 billion deal on aviation cooperation, but few new details have been made available about its development since.  The wide-body aircraft is certainly an ambitious project, given that it hopes to compete with Airbus and Boeing's commercial sales leaders, the A330, the A350, the Boeing 777, and the Boeing 787. According to Comac wide-body department manager Guo Bohzi, the joint venture in Shanghai, whose shares are divided equally between the two parties, will start its work this year. "A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of modern technology, experience and skills," Guo said, speaking to reporters at the airshow. "China and Russia each have their own advantages," he added. © REUTERS/ China Daily A model of a widebody jet, which is planned to be developed by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) is presented at an air show, the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, November 2, 2016 Up to three variants of the plane may be built. The aircraft will have two aisles, space for between 250-280 passengers, and a range of up to 12,000 km, making it perfect for long-haul flights. © Sputnik/ Ilya Bogachev Russia's UEC, China's SBW Discuss Joint Gas Turbine Engine ProjectRussia has been making a big impression at Airshow China-2016, with displays from OAK, Rosoboronexport, Almaz Antei, and Roscosmos, among other major companies. Earlier this week, Russian newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported that Russian companies' displays at the event are the largest-ever exposition of Russian aviation technology abroad. A broad array of military and civilian equipment is being displayed. On Tuesday, the Russian airborne acrobatics teams Knights and Swifts performed their trademark stunts in Su-SM and MiG-29 fighter jets.

The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, also called Comac, is in talks with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp to produce a twin-aisle, long-haul commercial aircraft, said the Chinese company’s assistant president Guo Bozhi, during the Zhuhai Air Show this week. The new aircraft, which does not have a name, will be designed to compete in the same category as Airbus’ A330 and A350 models, as well as Boeing’s 777 and 787 models. The Chinese aircraft will adopt advanced aerodynamic design and engines with low fuel burn to make them more efficient and more economical for airlines to operate, he said. “We aim to make the direct operating cost of our new widebody jet 10 per cent lower than our competitors,” Guo said. A model of the proposed aircraft was unveiled in Zhuhai, displaying its logo with United’s name. The aircraft will come in three variants, with up to 280 seats in standard configuration, and a maximum range of 6,480 nautical miles (12,000km). The model may be named the C929 if Comac follows the 9X9 mnemonic tradition of its aircraft series. China is one of the latest entrants in the competition to develop home-made aircraft, eyeing the technological prestige and job creation associated with making planes. China, the world’s most populous nation, is projected to require 6,865 new aircraft over the next 20 years valued at six trillion yuan over the next two decades, as airlines replenish their retiring fleets or expand, according to Comac’s projection. About 21 per cent of these will be twin-aisle planes, while single-aisle aircraft make up 65 per cent of the demand, Comac said. Shanghai-based Comac was established in 2008 with the mission to spearhead China’s development of a home-grown aircraft that can help reduce the country’s dependence on Airbus and Boeing. It launched a twin engine jet called the ARJ21, which can carry between 70 and up to 105 passengers to compete with Brazil’s Embraer and Canada’s Bombardier for short-distance flights. Chengdu Airlines became the first customer to take delivery of this aircraft, flying three times a week between Shanghai and the Sichuan provincial capital. Comac also has a single-aisle, narrow body plane called the C919 in development. The aircraft, which can carry between 150 and 190 passengers, is scheduled for its maiden test flight later this year, Guo said. China Eastern Airlines this week said it was in talks to buy up to five C919 models. The C929, when it gets off the drawing board, will be a substantial leap in technology and manufacturing capability for China, said Chen Yong, chief designer of the ARJ21, during a September 29 interview at the InnoTech Expo in Hong Kong. “We are in the final stages of creating a proof of concept” for the widebody aircraft, Chen said. “The biggest challenge we face is our lack of experience in mastering the complexities in assembling a large aircraft.” United, established in 2005, is a consolidation of Russia’s aircraft manufacturing industry, combining the technology and brands of 18 companies including Ilyushin, Sukhoi and Tupolev. It usually takes seven years for a new aircraft to take its first flight after the announcement, but takes 10 years for delivery, Guo said. That means the first C929 delivery is likely to be in 2025. “There will be new technologies involved in the initial stage of developing the new craft and the new technology will be a challenge to us,” he said. “China and Russia each have their own advantages.” “We will prefer to choose suppliers who have rich experience and whose products are competitive , and who can keep the quality from the initial stage until the aircraft goes into operation,” Guo said. Airbus, which currently assembles the A320 family of narrowbody aircraft in Tianjin, is confident about China’s demand for larger, long-haul aircraft. “Over 170 A330s are in service in China now, and it is one of the most favourite aircraft in the country,” said Chen Juming, Airbus China president. Boeing is also getting in on the act. The US planemaker is finalising plans for a facility in Zhoushan, near Shanghai, for finishing work and delivery of its best-selling B-737 narrowbody jets to Chinese airlines.

Reuters SHANGHAI - China and Russia will invest up to $20 billion to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet, reports Thursday and a company statement said, as Beijing seeks to challenge leading Western manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. The hugely ambitious plan was first agreed between the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), whose products include the Sukhoi Superjet 100, in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing. COMAC said in a statement that the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, will develop a 280-seat wide-body plane with a range of 12,000 kilometres. That would put it in direct competition with Boeing’s 787 and the Airbus A350. The project is worth between $13 billion and $20 billion, with each side contributing half, China's state-run Global Times newspaper on Thursday quoted UAC president Yury Slyusar as saying. “COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property,” Slyusar told the newspaper at the China Airshow in the southern city of Zhuhai, adding the plane will be 10 percent cheaper than its competitors. According to the companies' websites, the list price of a 280-seat Airbus A350 is $272.4 million, while a 290-seat Boeing 787 costs $264.6 million. Their putative China-Russian rival will make its first flight in seven years' time, COMAC said, with deliveries beginning three years later. But developing commercial aircraft is an advanced technological challenge and previous Chinese aerospace projects have suffered lengthy delays. COMAC said it will keep the project open and select global suppliers that are willing to “jointly shoulder risks”. Beijing is looking to build up its domestic aerospace industry, with the sector among those highlighted in its “Made in China 2025” plan. The country is expected to become the world's largest aviation market, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. Airbus estimates China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion. COMAC is also developing its own single-aisle jet, the C919. It rolled it out last year and even though it has yet to make its first flight COMAC says it has so far received 570 orders from 23 customers. The firm's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight in June after years of delays. azk/slb/fa  © 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse Share Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Pinterest Read More:  china   russia   Boeing   Airbus   jet   aircraft   airplane   comac   /business/11/02/16/more-chinese-tourists-expected-as-china-flights-resume-in-laoag-airport /overseas/11/03/16/china-president-slams-conspiracies-in-communist-party /overseas/11/03/16/china-president-slams-conspiracies-in-communist-party /business/11/03/16/pilots-warned-over-china-rocket-launch /business/11/03/16/china-bank-says-9-month-net-income-surges-31-pct LATEST NEWS MOST READ Sanhi ng pagbagsak ng power plants, iniimbestigahan November 16, 2016 De Lima, kinuwestyon ang intel funds para sa Pangulo November 16, 2016 Lider ng mga naaresto sa drug raid sa Quezon City, pinaghahanap November 16, 2016 School principal, arestado dahil sa droga sa La Union November 16, 2016 Firing squad, isinusulong ng VACC November 16, 2016 PANOORIN: Festival of Lights sa Makati November 16, 2016 Parol na gawa ng inmates, tampok sa Bangued, Abra November 16, 2016 U.S. Pacific Command admiral concerned with Duterte's statements November 16, 2016 Parade for Kylie Verzosa scheduled Friday November 16, 2016 WATCH: How to protect the environment while traveling November 16, 2016 LOOK: Charo Santos on Rogue cover November 16, 2016 DOTr lacks expertise in solving traffic problems, says Poe November 16, 2016 DOTr vows to fight corruption within ranks November 16, 2016 House kicks off Cha-Cha consultations November 16, 2016 DOLE: Labor contracting still allowed by law November 16, 2016 Was Billy Crawford arrested in Hong Kong?

Wednesday, November 16, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Boeing, Airbus trade barbs as China competition heats up November 3, 2016, Thursday ZHUHAI, CHINA: Aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus took potshots at one another at the Zhuhai air show, as the US and European rivals seek to capture more of China’s booming aircraft market. China is one of the Western manufacturers’ key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The country’s airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth US$945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast. Boeing’s expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing US$1 trillion. To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms. Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers. Boeing is planning to open a facility with the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said. Eric Chen, president of Airbus China, dismissed the Seattle firm’s plan as “close to one generation” behind his own firm, saying it was following Airbus’s strategy “with a lot of reluctance”. “I got two impressions,” he said at a briefing at the China Airshow in Zhuhai, the industry’s biggest event in the country. “First one, the decision we made 10 years ago was right. The second impression is that we are well in advance of our competitor.” Darren Hulst, managing director for Northeast Asia marketing at Boeing, earlier told reporters that the Airbus A350 fell short of the 787 widebody plane in range, capacity, carbon emissions, window size and aerodynamics. “The 787 is capable and has technology and features built into it that are not available on the A350, which was obviously introduced later into the market,” he said. He added the company had 14 China deliveries of 787-9s in 2016 and had secured orders and commitments for 46 more. While the two megafirms see a sunny future in China, homegrown competitors backed by Beijing aim to beat them at home – and ultimately abroad. Chinese authorities have urged companies to acquire technology and skills in a range of high-value sectors including aerospace in the ‘Made in China 2025’ plan. At the same time as it is working with both Boeing and Airbus, COMAC is developing single-aisle jets to compete with them. Its C919 narrow-body is going up against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 in the 160-seat segment, which the Chinese company predicts will have more than 17,000 deliveries over the next 20 years. In Zhuhai COMAC announced that state-owned China Eastern Airlines had committed to buy 20 C919s. In the summer COMAC’s regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight after years of delays. Boeing, Airbus and Canadian regional builder Bombardier all played down the threat of Chinese competition. But the business climate has darkened for US and European firms in the country, with the American Chamber of Commerce in China reporting this year that more than three-quarters of survey respondents felt “less welcome” there. — AFP What do you think of this story?

At the same time as it is working with both Boeing and Airbus, COMAC is developing single-aisle jets to compete with them.

Boeing, Airbus and Canadian regional builder Bombardier all played down the threat of Chinese competition. But the business climate has darkened for U.S. and European firms in the country, with the American Chamber of Commerce in China reporting this year that more than three-quarters of survey respondents felt “less welcome” there. Pessimism among European companies hit an all-time high in the summer, according to a European Chamber of Commerce in China report on the “increasingly hostile” business climate. Chinese-built planes are sure to secure market share in the country, Eric Lin, Hong Kong-based director of Asia transport research with UBS Securities, told AFP. In the short term, he added, foreign firms have little to fear from Chinese rivals in the developed countries that are their home market. “But after 10 years, it’s hard to say,” he noted. China has a history of adapting foreign technology with remarkable swiftness, turning from a buyer of Russian military aircraft to a producer of advanced stealth jets in 20 years. Its high speed rail and clean energy industries went from collaborators to competitors faster than global rivals anticipated. Like all foreign firms with valuable intellectual property operating in China, the aerospace giants understand the risks of training their future rivals, said Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University’s HSBC Business School. But they are stuck between a rock and a hard place, he added, because shareholders want them to fight for Chinese market share. “Even if they don’t come to China, there’s a good chance that if they are doing anything innovative it’s going to get stolen anyway, so the only thing they are doing is harming their revenue.” Back To Top[*] Switch to full browser version © 2016 GPlusMedia

State-owned planemakers Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and United Aircraft Corp of Russia said they had started looking for suppliers, as they presented a mock-up of the wide-body jet at Airshow China. Neither firm gave details of financing or technical specifications. China opened the show in the southern city of Zhuhai on Tuesday with a brief flypast of its J-20 stealth fighter. Both countries are currently developing smaller narrow-body jets to compete with the bestselling Airbus and Boeing types. Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC’s wide-body department, said a 50-50 joint venture based in Shanghai will start operations this year. First announced in 2014, the project has so far been slow to materialize. The firms have said they want a maiden flight in 2022 and to begin deliveries in 2025 or later. Western industry analysts consider the target challenging, but more realistic than recent aircraft programs that sought results in five to seven years and came in late. “A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills and require broad industrial knowledge,” Guo told reporters. “China and Russia each have their own advantages.” Descriptions accompanying the model showed the firms ultimately envision three variants, based on a basic version that will seat 280 and have a range of up to 12,000 kilometers. The decision to base the venture in Shanghai was a “mutual decision,” Guo said at the event, attended by COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong, UAC’s Chief Executive Yury Slyusar and Russia’s Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov. Guo declined to say how much each party had invested in the project. A global effort to assess potential suppliers is now under way, said COMAC, which is separately pushing its own C919 narrow-body passenger jet toward a long-delayed maiden flight, now aimed for the end of this year or early next. US firms Honeywell and United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that they discussed the China-Russia jet with COMAC officials at the airshow, without commenting on the nature or subject of the contacts. “We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continually guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation,” Guo said. A key decision will be what engines to use. Industry sources speculate the jet could use Western engines. Another potentially tricky issue will be how the work should be divided, a subject which caused years of wrangling at Europe’s Airbus, which began in 1970 as a consortium of nations and took more than two decades to make a significant impact. Though a 50-50 joint venture, analysts view the Chinese side as being the more influential in the project. The firm’s Shanghai headquarters tells “where the balance of power is going to be and that reflects the size of the Chinese domestic market,” said Sash Tusa, an analyst at London-based consultancy Agency Partners.

November 16, 2016 1205 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:171438 Publish Date: Wed, 02 Nov 2016 19:05:40 GMT Service: Iran Boeing's huge deal with Iran Air to be finalized within days Boeing and Iran are 'within days' of finalizing the details of Iran Air's massive order for 80 aircraft after it was approved by the US government last month. The details reportedly include moves by Boeing and its rival Airbus, which has its own big deal with Iran, to grant companies In Iran a concession to make aircraft parts inside Iran, bizjournals.com reported. Boeing secured approval from US authorities last month to start selling passenger jets to Iran for the first time since 1979, including four more modern 747s to replace older models like this 747-200. Iran's Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan offered those details. A report by the Azerbaijan-based Trend News Agency, which operates in Iran, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan, quoted Fakhrieh-Kashan's boss, Iran's Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi, as saying that both Boeing and Airbus were drafting 'concessions' so unspecified aircraft parts could be made inside Iran. Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Paul R. Bergman said on Tuesday the jet maker remains in talks with Iran Air, and any final sale "would have to adhere to the license we’ve been issued". Boeing's blockbuster deal to sell up to 80 passenger jets to Iran includes 30 of its 777 jets and four 747-8 intercontinental aircraft. If it goes ahead, it will offer a much needed boost to Boeing's sluggish wide-body airplane sales — and the Puget Sound plants that manufacture them. Boeing's export license also allows the Chicago-based manufacturer to sell 40 737 Max airplanes and six 737NG jets, which are all made in Renton. Under its deal with Iran, Boeing also agreed to help lease 29 additional 737s. Iran Air deal totals $25 billion for Boeing at list prices, though larger orders of this magnitude typically enjoy discounts.     KeyWords Boeing Iran Air IranDaily   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran confiscates 2 tonnes of explosives from Daesh terrorists Iran, China must boost cooperation in fight on terrorism: Rouhani Syria holds pacesetter Iran in wetland Everton joins race for Iran’s Azmoun Iran defeated by Kazakhstan in Asian water polo championship Iran, absent from kabaddi World Cup final Iranian teams capture Asian youth, junior weightlifting titles French MP: Iran’s role in fight against terrorism crucial Iran: Killing of Muslims in Nigeria worrisome Rouhani: Iran, China must boost anti-terror fight Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/1628 sec

Here’s How It Works By Patrick Tucker Read bio November 1, 2016 BOEING AA Font size + Print The Boeing "Black" phone Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Read bio November 1, 2016 The Boeing device is less a phone and more a locked-down portal to a faraway server. There’s no such thing as a perfectly secure phone, especially if it also connects to the internet. But leaving your phone on the plane every time you visit a hostile foreign country isn’t an option for everyone, and so a handful of top military commanders now have a device that can send and receive Secret and Top Secret messages. No surprise: it doesn’t work quite like the one in your pocket. Developed by Boeing and the Defense Information Systems Agency, the Boeing Black phone has a dual-SIM card that “enables users to switch between government and commercial networks. Boeing Black integrates seamlessly into customer mobile device management systems and virtual private networks,” according to the product data sheet. One of the recipients is Cyber Command chief Adm. Michael Rogers, said DISA head Lt. Gen. Alan Lynn. That’s not to say that everyone in the military can expect to receive one. “The Boeing Black is the device we’re currently working with,” Lynn said. “We’re just now in the test phase,” he said.

A lot of device manufactures have been eager to meet rising military needs for secure communication. One contender, Silent Circle, co-founded by encryption guru Philip Zimmerman and former Navy Seal Mike Janke, has managed to push a few units into the hands of some military for testing and recreational use. Lynn said the Boeing Black phone also works with “a large amount of encryption.” But the encryption alone is not what makes the device so secure. “There’s nothing that lives on the devices,” said Lynn. “It’s close to a VDI,” a virtual desktop infrastructure. What that means is that the most secure phone in the world is, in the purest sense, just a window to another computer, a remote server on the military’s Top Secret JWICS network. That server does all the real work and holds the data. The phone itself just moves input commands — keyboard, mouse, and other signals — to that server. The result, said Lynn: “We’re not too worried about losing data,” at least not off the phone. But does Rogers like the phone? Lynn said, “I think he does. Haven’t heard any complaints.” Patrick Tucker is technology editor for Defense One. He’s also the author of The Naked Future: What Happens in a World That Anticipates Your Every Move?

Here’s what we know so far The whereabouts of the Boeing 777 has remained a mystery since March 2014 By AMANDA DEVLIN 2nd November 2016, 2:54 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments DOOMED Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared without a trace. New analysis of the plane’s last moments have suggested that it crashed at a high speed without a pilot in control. But investigators remain puzzled over the whereabouts of the missing aircraft, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew when it vanished in March 2014. Alamy 4 Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014 with 239 passengers and crew on board (stock image) What happened on March 8, 2014? Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur carrying 239 people on board. They included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadn’t been home in a year. The plane had recorded 7,525 take-offs and landings as well as 53,420 flight hours when it made its last journey. The MH370 Boeing was seen for the last time on military radar at 2.14am, close to the south of Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca. Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was “Good night Malaysian three seven zero”. Half an hour later, the airline lost contact with the plane. It had been due to land at around 6.30am. The search and rescue: What happened next? Evidence from a military radar suggested the plane had suddenly changed course. Dozens of rescue planes and ships moved their search efforts to the sea west of Malaysia before the country’s Prime Minister Najib Razak claimed MH370 had been deliberately diverted by someone on board. He added that they believed it had continued flying for more than six hours after losing contact with air control. In the end, the search spanned to almost three million square mile – which is 1.5 per cent of the earth’s surface. A week after disappearing satellite images of possible debris appeared to suggest that the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean, south west of Australia. But the search for the black box in this area was abandoned after nothing was found. Aidan Ellis 4 In total 1.5 per cent of the earth’s surface has been searched for the missing plane When was debris from the plane discovered? On July 29, 2015 – more than a year after the plane’s disappearance – debris was found by volunteers cleaning a beach in St Andre, Reunion. A week later investigators confirmed the debris did belong to MH370, but it did not help to locate the plane as it had drifted in the water. On October 7, 2017  it was announced that two wing flaps found in Mauritius came from missing flight. Some shocked relatives found it difficult to believe that this was genuinely debris from the plane. They said they think their loved ones are still alive and are being held at “an undisclosed location for unknown reasons.” AFP 4 A map showing pieces of debris scattered from the Malaysia Airlines jet that went missing in 2014 What has MH370’s debris revealed? The wing flaps showed that the plane was not in a landing position when it plunged into the ocean, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said. If the pilot was planning a controlled ditching of the plane, the wing flaps would have been configured for landing. As this was not the case, a report by the bureau concluded that the aircraft appeared to be “out of control” during its final journey. Chief search operator Peter Foley said: “You can never be 100%. We are very reluctant to express absolute certainty. “You can draw your own conclusions as to whether that means someone was in control.” If someone had been controlling the plane it could have glided much further than thought – meaning rescuers could have been searching the wrong area. More than 20 bits of debris suspected or confirmed to be from MH370 have washed ashore on coastlines throughout the Indian Ocean. However, a deep sea sonar search for the main underwater wreckage found nothing. Getty Images 4 This shows a trailing edge section of Boeing 777 left, outboard flap, originating from the Malaysian Airlines aircraft What are the theories about the fate of MH370? 1. RUSSIAN president Vladimir Putin was accused of being involved in the hijacking of MH370. by a US Science writer. Jeff Wise claimed Putin “spoofed” the plane’s navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome  so he could “hurt the West”. 2. FRENCH ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked. A book called Flight MH370 – The Mystery also suggested that it had been shot down accidentally by US-Thai joint jet fighters suring a military exercise and covered it up. 3. MALAYSIA police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested that the crash could have been suicide. He said that someone on-board could have taken out a large life insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back money they owed.

Norwegian is currently the only airline operating direct routes between Oslo and Las Vegas. The route constitutes Norwegian’s seventh direct flight to North America from Norway’s main airport. Starting tomorrow, the flight will leave every Tuesday for the entire winter season. The route will be serviced by a Boeing 787-8 with capacity for 291 passengers. “It is a happy day for all Norwegians who love to travel. Las Vegas is one of the world’s most famous cities, and we are very excited about Norwegian establishing this route. This route will increase access to a new city and region with new opportunities for further development and job creation”, says Jasper Spruit, Vice President of Traffic Development at Avinor. “The US is a favourite destination for Norwegians, and we see that direct flights are popular among tourists as well as business travellers,” he adds. Popular among Europeans as well as Americans The airline is also pleased to introduce yet another direct route between Norway’s main airport and the American continent. “We are happy to offer travellers from Norway another route to the US, this time from Oslo to Las Vegas. We can see that more and more customers choose Norwegian when travelling between these continents, which goes to show that Europeans and Americans alike appreciate reasonable fares, direct flights, good service and the new, more environmentally friendly Dreamliners,” says Thomas Ramdahl, Norwegian Chief Commercial Officer. When combined with Norwegian’s one-way tickets, the vast American route network provides even more opportunities for travellers who want more out of their trip to the US. One of many options is flying directly to Los Angeles or San Francisco before travelling on by car through Death Valley to Las Vegas. You can enjoy any kind of entertainment imaginable downtown, play golf on world-class courses, bike around the iconic Hoover Dam or ride a helicopter through the Grand Canyon – before flying straight home to Norway. If you want to go on a voyage of discovery in the US, you have an endless number of varied options to choose from. “We are excited that Norwegian are offering yet another direct route to and from Las Vegas. Passengers flying from Norway now have an outstanding opportunity to experience everything Las Vegas has to offer. The city saw a record-breaking number of visitors in 2015, and we look forward to welcoming even more Norwegian passengers,” says Rossi Ralenkotter, President/CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

(Photo: AFP/Fred Dufour) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A ZHUHAI: Aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus took potshots at one another at the Zhuhai air show, as the US and European rivals seek to capture more of China's booming aircraft market. China is one of the Western manufacturers' key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The country's airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth US$945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast. Boeing's expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing US$1 trillion. To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms. Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers. Boeing is planning to open a facility with the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said. Eric Chen, president of Airbus China, dismissed the Seattle firm's plan as "close to one generation" behind his own firm, saying it was following Airbus's strategy "with a lot of reluctance". "I got two impressions," he said at a briefing at the China Airshow in Zhuhai, the industry's biggest event in the country. "First one, the decision we made 10 years ago was right. The second impression is that we are well in advance of our competitor." Darren Hulst, managing director for Northeast Asia marketing at Boeing, earlier told reporters that the Airbus A350 fell short of the 787 widebody plane in range, capacity, carbon emissions, window size and aerodynamics. "The 787 is capable and has technology and features built into it that are not available on the A350, which was obviously introduced later into the market," he said. He added the company had 14 China deliveries of 787-9s in 2016 and had secured orders and commitments for 46 more. FUTURE RIVALS While the two megafirms see a sunny future in China, homegrown competitors backed by Beijing aim to beat them at home - and ultimately abroad. Chinese authorities have urged companies to acquire technology and skills in a range of high-value sectors including aerospace in the "Made in China 2025" plan. At the same time as it is working with both Boeing and Airbus, COMAC is developing single-aisle jets to compete with them. Its C919 narrow-body is going up against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 in the 160-seat segment, which the Chinese company predicts will have more than 17,000 deliveries over the next 20 years. In Zhuhai COMAC announced that state-owned China Eastern Airlines had committed to buy 20 C919s. In the summer COMAC's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight after years of delays. Boeing, Airbus and Canadian regional builder Bombardier all played down the threat of Chinese competition. But the business climate has darkened for US and European firms in the country, with the American Chamber of Commerce in China reporting this year that more than three-quarters of survey respondents felt "less welcome" there. Pessimism among European companies hit an all-time high in the summer, according to a European Chamber of Commerce in China report on the "increasingly hostile" business climate. Chinese-built planes are sure to secure market share in the country, Eric Lin, Hong Kong-based director of Asia transport research with UBS Securities, told AFP. In the short term, he added, foreign firms have little to fear from Chinese rivals in the developed countries that are their home market. "But after 10 years, it's hard to say," he noted. China has a history of adapting foreign technology with remarkable swiftness, turning from a buyer of Russian military aircraft to a producer of advanced stealth jets in 20 years. Its high speed rail and clean energy industries went from collaborators to competitors faster than global rivals anticipated. Like all foreign firms with valuable intellectual property operating in China, the aerospace giants understand the risks of training their future rivals, said Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Peking University's HSBC Business School. But they are stuck between a rock and a hard place, he added, because shareholders want them to fight for Chinese market share. "Even if they don't come to China, there's a good chance that if they are doing anything innovative it's going to get stolen anyway, so the only thing they are doing is harming their revenue." - AFP Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Etihad Airways flight EY604 took off from Abu Dhabi at 10.15am and arrived on schedule at 4.45pm local time. The return flight EY603 departed Johannesburg at 7.50pm last night, touching down Abu Dhabi on schedule at 6.10am this morning, November 2. Operating daily on the route, the two-class B787-9 Dreamliner features Etihad Airways’ next-generation Business and Economy Class cabins. Peter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways chief executive officer, said the decision to upgrade to the Dreamliner aircraft on the Johannesburg route was to meet the needs of growing numbers of business and leisure passengers travelling to and from South Africa. “Today’s modern traveller is constantly searching for comfort, innovation and convenience, and we aim to provide the highest standard of hospitality and technological advancements to make any journey a memorable one.” John Friel, Etihad Airways General Manager South Africa, added: “The introduction of the Boeing 787 is a welcome development that will further enhance our guests’ experience on this route. “Our luxurious Dreamliners offer a best-in-class experience, and attention to every last detail.” All Etihad Airways’ B787-9 Dreamliner aircraft feature the airline’s highly acclaimed next-generation interiors with 28 Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart Seats. The Business Studios all offer direct aisle access, a fully flat bed of up to 80.5 inches long, and an increase of 20 per cent in personal space. Upholstered in the finest Poltrona Frau leather, the Business Studio is equipped with an in-seat massage and pneumatic cushion control system which enables guests to adjust the firmness and comfort of their seat. Each Business Studio has an 18-inch personal touch-screen TV with noise-cancelling headsets. The 271 Economy Smart Seats provide enhanced comfort with a unique ‘fixed wing’ headrest on each seat, adjustable lumbar support, a seat width of approximately 19 inches, and an 11.1” personal TV monitor. In addition to full mobile and wi-fi service with USB and power points at every seat, the Dreamliner fleet features the latest in entertainment innovation, providing more than 750 hours of on-demand entertainment, including seven live TV channels, improved gaming and high definition screens across all cabins. The airline’s renowned hospitality includes innovative services such as Flying Nannies trained by the world-famous Norland College in the UK, who provide assistance to families on board. Food and beverage managers handpicked from the world’s finest hotels and restaurants guide guests in Business Class through the extensive a la carte and ‘dine anytime’ options, and provide recommendations on the best food and wine pairing. Guests on the Dreamliner also enjoy the industry’s largest windows; air that is cleaner, more humid and at a lower cabin altitude for better comfort; large overhead stowage bins, soothing LED lighting; and technology to sense and counter turbulence for a smoother ride. Etihad Airways uniquely offers travellers from Africa the convenience of US Customs and Border Protection at Abu Dhabi International Airport. This facility, exclusive to Etihad Airways in the Gulf region, allows guests to complete immigration, customs and security clearance procedures for the US while in transit at Abu Dhabi – avoiding lengthy queues upon arrival at US airports. Johannesburg is the ninth city to be served by Etihad Airways’ B787-9 Dreamliner. The aircraft is also deployed to Brisbane, Düsseldorf, Perth, Riyadh, Shanghai, Singapore, Washington DC and Zurich. Etihad Airways’ order for two variants of the B787 (-9 and -10), is one of the world’s largest for the type, totalling 71 aircraft. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: Etihad | Boeing | Dreamliner | 787 | Johannesburg | Abu | Dhabi | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Agilysys opens new office to serve EMEA customers Al Faisaliah Hotel summit to feature Como Hotels chef Mövenpick Hotels Jordan wins two top awards Oman Air concludes a successful WTM London GCC airlines should change how they market and sell to customers - study Dine with a difference at Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel & Spa Emirates boosts fleet with new A380, B777 aircraft Turkish Airlines offers GCC passengers special fares to Europe Busy Rooms, Thomas Cook ink strategic agreement 158,714 hotels rooms 'under contract' in ME 90pc of US,UK theme park guests want pre-booking-survey RJ, AccesRail ink key agreement Indonesia first SE Asian nation to announce Dubai Expo participation Hack your way into a flight upgrade Abu Dhabi residents get a glimpse of Korean culture Passenger traffic at DWC surges 161pc in Q3 Aviator Lifestyle to participate at Big Boys Toys exhibition First Group breaks ground on 34-storey Dubai hotel tower Etihad receives top recognition Emirates passengers can get UAE visa via mobile app New sales head for Le Méridien Dubai Hotel & Conference Centre Qatar Airways fined by US for flying over 'prohibited airspace' VR, robots to become the future of theme parks Gulf Air adds Colombo to destination network Air Arabia Q3 net profit up 26pc Trump effect dampens ME tourism to the US Al Futtaim, InterCon ink deal for UAE's largest Holiday Inn Family-friendly staycation at Emirates Park Zoo and Resort Mövenpick Hotel West Bay Doha wins two top honours Emirates Skywards adds The Wall Street Journal to partner list Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Moscow, Russia, November 02, 2016 --(PR.com)-- The Boeing engines, belonging to one of the Russian airlines, demanded an urgent maintenance service. "The transportation had to be executed within the shortest period of time and with the smallest financial expenses. The main things for the airline were time, and of course, reasonable price. That is why the engines flew for maintenance, in the truest sense of the world, on their own. At first the Boeing plane came from Irkutsk to Moscow, where the engines were replaced for further dispatch to the USA,” comments Yuri Lytkin, the expert of multimodal department. The delivery consisted of several stages: engines delivery from Irkutsk to Moscow by air without replacement, road delivery from Moscow to Amsterdam after replacement, airfreight delivery from Amsterdam to the USA for maintenance. “Our specialists had to deliver the cargo from Moscow to Amsterdam,” says Yuri Lytkin. “We offered to the client an optimal price provided by our partners from Belarus which managed to deliver the oversized cargo with the dimensions: 5,40m*2,63m*2,90m. Usually such kind of cargo is processed within 3 weeks, however we managed to decrease this period up to 10 days. As time was the main criterion for the client, besides the cost of delivery, it was necessary to take into account all details and deliver the cargo just to a designated date, otherwise the client could have been fined for the flight delay or cancellation.” In order to speed up the delivery the whole operational department was engaged in the cargo processing. The customs specialists prepared transit declarations, the head of the customs department assisted in the transit procedures at the Sheremetyevo airport, the specialists of multimodal department organized the delivery of oversized cargo to Europe. CARGO EXPRESS did its best to return such a necessary plane back into operations as quickly as possible.

The latest available data show that during year ending September 2015, just over 95,000 passengers traveled between the two points via connections – a 4.5% increase from the same period a year before. El Al Airlines could not be reached for comment. El Al Israel Airlines Ltd., trading as El Al, is the flag carrier of Israel. Its hub is Ben Gurion International Airport, Israel’s main international airport and the busiest airport in the country, 12 miles southeast of Tel Aviv. According to Miami International Airport, many foreign carriers are in the process of fleet revitalization and fleet expansion, as both Boeing and Airbus are making available new, efficient, long-range aircraft such as the Boeing 777 and 787 and Airbus A330 and A350. The Boeing 777 is a family of the world’s largest twinjets and has a typical capacity of 314 to 451 passengers, with a range of 5,235 to 9,500 nautical miles. The Airbus A330 and A350 models are positioned to compete with Boeing’s in terms of passenger capacity, fuselage, features and engines. “It is a very typical process for air carriers to look ‘down the road’ for expansion opportunities once new aircraft come into the fleet to replace older planes, and to consider what new service points fit into the range of these new planes,” Ms. Trutie said. “This of course is viable if market conditions warrant launching a new route. El Al has ordered the Boeing 787 and is examining its options for possible new service points.” The Boeing 787 is a long-haul, twin-engine jet airliner that can seat 242 to 335 passengers and is the company’s most fuel-efficient airliner. As of 2015, an airliner from the 787 family can cost anywhere from $224.6 million to $306.1 million. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Is Qatar Airways warning Airbus or bluffing with Boeing 737 Max announcement? Friday, 7 October 2016 Qatar Airways is sending a warning to Airbus Group with its announcement that it may buy 60 of rival Boeing's 737-8 Max aircraft, analysts suggested Friday. The state-owned airline unveiled a letter of intent for Boeing's fuel-efficient 737 model Friday along with its $11.7 billion order for 40 wide-body Dreamliner and 777 jets. The 737-8 Max order is worth $6.9 billion to Boeing (NYSE: BA) at list prices, but aerospace industry analysts disagreed about how seriously to take the airline's threat.

Here’s How It Works By Patrick Tucker Read bio November 1, 2016 BOEING AA Font size + Print The Boeing "Black" phone Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Patrick Tucker Read bio November 1, 2016 The Boeing device is less a phone and more a locked-down portal to a faraway server. There’s no such thing as a perfectly secure phone, especially if it also connects to the internet. But leaving your phone on the plane every time you visit a hostile foreign country isn’t an option for everyone, and so a handful of top military commanders now have a device that can send and receive Secret and Top Secret messages. No surprise: it doesn’t work quite like the one in your pocket. Developed by Boeing and the Defense Information Systems Agency, the Boeing Black phone has a dual-SIM card that “enables users to switch between government and commercial networks. Boeing Black integrates seamlessly into customer mobile device management systems and virtual private networks,” according to the product data sheet. One of the recipients is Cyber Command chief Adm. Michael Rogers, said DISA head Lt. Gen. Alan Lynn. That’s not to say that everyone in the military can expect to receive one. “The Boeing Black is the device we’re currently working with,” Lynn said. “We’re just now in the test phase,” he said. Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. That the military has been working on such a device is no secret. A lot of device manufactures have been eager to meet rising military needs for secure communication. One contender, Silent Circle, co-founded by encryption guru Philip Zimmerman and former Navy Seal Mike Janke, has managed to push a few units into the hands of some military for testing and recreational use. Lynn said the Boeing Black phone also works with “a large amount of encryption.” But the encryption alone is not what makes the device so secure. “There’s nothing that lives on the devices,” said Lynn. “It’s close to a VDI,” a virtual desktop infrastructure. What that means is that the most secure phone in the world is, in the purest sense, just a window to another computer, a remote server on the military’s Top Secret JWICS network. That server does all the real work and holds the data. The phone itself just moves input commands — keyboard, mouse, and other signals — to that server. The result, said Lynn: “We’re not too worried about losing data,” at least not off the phone. But does Rogers like the phone? Lynn said, “I think he does. Haven’t heard any complaints.” Patrick Tucker is technology editor for Defense One. He’s also the author of The Naked Future: What Happens in a World That Anticipates Your Every Move?

Log In or Register to post comments Goforride on Nov 7, 2016 Is a company, or an individual, supposed to make business decisions that are to their personal detriment, but for the collective good? Isn't that what they said in Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union? Sacrifice for the collective good? Seeing as how Boeing is at a disadvantage relative to Airbus because Airbus has actual assembly facility in China (as it does in Alabama), I would think you'd be pleased that Boeing is letting China do the interior finish work, like putting in the carpet, and keeping the manufacturing in the US, rather than doing the whole assembly in China as their competition does. Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement justcallmeworldwide on Nov 4, 2016 Yeah, I agree with you on that. If Zhejiang is a prosperous part of China with higher wages than the Chinese average, couldn't this work have been done in an economically depressed area here in the states? The 'Rust Belt' states, or even at the 787 plant in SC? Log In or Register to post comments dracsilva@gmail.com on Nov 4, 2016 Somehow this will transfer technology to China in the future will be a strong competitor and will make good much cheaper products. Ideally the US build its aircraft within the country. If the problem is the cost and the unions, change the laws! Later Boeing will regret this adventure overseas. (sorry for my bad english).

Log In or Register to post comments sioussat@gmail.com on Nov 8, 2016 If you try to find well trained, experienced aircraft assembly, tooling, machinist's, electronic tech's etc. etc, personnel in the US good luck. The good old USA has abandoned most of it's apprenticeship programs and most major trade school program's in favor of sending or kids to very expensive 4 year schools so they can learn something totally useless AND be in debt for years. At the rate we are going NOTHING will be built here. Log In or Register to post comments PITmech on Nov 8, 2016 The military trains many aircraft mechanics, some go on to tech schools, where are all the jobs for them? Going overseas and elsewhere? Where do these non US technicians get trained? If the job outsourcing continues we will have no technicians, Food stamps and welfare for all.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News UCLA Anderson School of Management Honors Retired Boeing Chairman, President and CEO W. James McNerney, Jr., Awarded 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Award LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–UCLA Anderson School of Management honored W. James (Jim) McNerney, Jr., retired chairman, president and CEO of The Boeing Company, with the 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Award on Nov. 2, 2016, at a banquet held at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The award, named for legendary UCLA basketball coach, author and leadership expert John Wooden (1910–2010), is given each year to an exceptional individual in corporate America whose leadership style and service to the community reflect the same high benchmarks of performance, integrity and ethical values set by Wooden. McNerney was selected as this year’s recipient for the exceptional leadership he has displayed throughout his career at some of the world’s largest and most iconic companies, including General Electric, 3M and, most recently, Boeing, where he served as chairman, president and CEO for a decade. “It would be difficult to identify another executive who has delivered as superb results across such complex global businesses as Jim McNerney,” said UCLA Anderson Dean Judy Olian. “Whether at GE, 3M or Boeing, Jim was laser focused on culture, process and integrity – with fantastic results that followed. It’s about winning, the right way, just like Coach Wooden demonstrated in his decades of coaching and teaching.” Over the course of his career, McNerney has received numerous honors and recognitions, including being named “CEO of the Year” in 2015 by Chief Executive magazine and the 2008 National Management Association’s Executive of the Year. By appointment of U.S. President Barack Obama, he serves on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. He previously chaired the President’s Export Council. He serves on the board of trustees of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, and he is a past chair and previous member of the executive committee of Business Roundtable. He also is a past chair of the US-China Business Council. He is a director of Procter & Gamble, a director of IBM, a member of The Field Museum Board of Trustees in Chicago, a trustee of Northwestern University, the chair of the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Board and of the Kellogg School Dean’s Advisory Board. “John Wooden’s way of going about things is envious,” said McNerney. “I loved watching his teams and the way every individual found his or her potential, yet the team was the best team on the floor. I understand the connection between individual and team achievement and making it all work.” Previous John Wooden Global Leadership Honorees include: Ursula Burns (chairman and CEO, Xerox), Paul E. Jacobs (executive chairman, Qualcomm), Robert Iger (chairman and CEO, Disney), Indra Nooyi (chairman and CEO, PepsiCo), Peter Ueberroth (managing director, Contrarian Group, and president of the Los Angeles Olympics Organizing Committee), Frederick Smith (president and CEO, FedEx), Kenneth Chenault (chairman and CEO, American Express Company) and Howard Schultz (chairman, president and CEO, Starbucks). Net proceeds from the event fund fellowships for UCLA Anderson students who embody Coach Wooden’s leadership ideals and commitment to improving the lives of others. Each of the four 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Fellows receive a $25,000 fellowship: Corey McMillen (MBA ’17) Datra Oliver (FEMBA ’18) Doug Larratt (EMBA ’17) Eric Potocek (FEMBA ’18) “One of our primary goals is to educate and develop future generations of global leaders,” said Dean Olian. “The John Wooden Global Leadership Award ceremony furthers that goal in several ways. First, the leadership examples set by both Coach Wooden and Jim McNerney serve as inspiration for all of our students. Awarding the Wooden Fellowships to our most deserving recipients assists the fellows as they pursue their own dreams and passions.” About the John Wooden Global Leadership Award As the most winning coach in men’s college basketball, Wooden’s legacy of leadership transcends athletics and spans generations. As a coach, prolific author and inspiring speaker, he dedicated his life to motivating individuals to achieve their highest potential. Wooden instilled in others a sense of pride, a commitment to ethics and a respect for teamwork. UCLA Anderson extends these fundamental principles and Wooden’s famous Pyramid of Success into the classroom through the Wooden Global Leadership Program.

James (“Jim”) McNerney Jr., as the 10th recipient of the John Wooden Global Leadership Award. An audience of nearly 500 that included UCLA Anderson supporters and Coach Wooden’s daughter Nan and son Jim gathered Wednesday under and around the Space Shuttle Endeavour at the California Science Center. “I’m deeply honored by this award,” McNerney said after receiving it from UCLA Anderson Dean Judy Olian. “John Wooden — if you’re of my generation, you know who he is, what he meant and what his values were. The prior (recipients) — I know them all, and I’m very proud to be included in that group.” The distinction is awarded annually to an exceptional leader who espouses and embodies the principles exemplified by the legendary UCLA coach, teacher and leadership expert. Olian expressed admiration for McNerney’s decades of business success, which in 2015 earned him recognition as CEO of the Year by Chief Executive magazine. In a featured conversation with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist from the Los Angeles Times Michael Hiltzik, McNerney talked about the current state of manufacturing in the United States. “Manufactuing, when you look at the numbers, has been down,” McNerney said. “But we are entering a place that should be a sweet spot for us. Technology is unlocking cost improvement, delivery and customization through digitization and automation. We’re exiting a period where we were disadvantaged but entering a period where technology and digitization are taking over. If we can grab that, we have a chance to regain our leadership.” With dozens of UCLA Anderson students and alumni in attendance in mind, Hiltzik queried McNerney about the qualities it takes to reach the upper echelons of management. “By the time you’re ready for a job at the top, you have a threshold cap on hard skills,” McNerney said, referencing decision-making and investment strategies. “(At that point), the softer skills become more important. How do you motivate people, how do you work with a team to define a new culture, how do you push people [while] motivating them? It’s a lot more leadership, communication, alignment — dealing with gray areas outside the company. It’s more about being able to handle the unstructured environment. Those skills are the differentiators.” The annual tribute to Coach Wooden was delivered by two-time American Basketball Association All-Star Swen Nater, who played on two of Coach Wooden’s title teams, and UCLA head women’s basketball coach Cori Close. Close recalled her first meeting with Coach Wooden when she was an aspiring assistant at UCLA in the 1990s. “I was so insecure going into that room,” she said. Yet, she said, “I felt seen, I felt cared for, I felt valued. People were always more important to him than things.” Nater lauded Coach for the example of humility and respectfulness he set. “When the UCLA team went on the road, we wore blue blazers and blue and gold ties, and we left the locker room cleaner than when we found it.” That resulted in hank you notes from custodians, praising the team’s consideration. “UCLA was the only team that did this,” he said. Nater has penned at least 100 poems in homage to Coach. Among his succinct observations of what his mentor taught him, Nater said, “Beyond the ‘how,’ I learned the ‘why.’” Proceeds from the dinner fund four $25,000 John Wooden Leadership Fellowships, given this year to UCLA Anderson students Doug Larratt, Corey McMillen, Datra Oliver and Eric Potocek.

ShareTweet Published November 3, 2016, 10:00 PM NEW PLANE MODELS ON DISPLAY – Models of an ARJ-21 jet is presented by Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) at an air show, the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, November 1, 2016. (Reuters) By Reuters Zhuhai, China,– China and Russia took a step closer on Wednesday to the joint development of a long-haul jet to challenge Boeing and Airbus, displaying a model of the unnamed plane that would compete with Western rivals. State-owned planemakers Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and United Aircraft Corp. (UAC) of Russia said they had started the hunt to find suppliers, as they presented a mock-up of the wide-body jet at Airshow China. Neither firm gave details on financing or technical specifications for what Western analysts call a politically-driven initiative that will be difficult to pull off and is likely to carry a high price tag. China opened the show on Tuesday in the southern city of Zhuhai with a brief flypast of its J-20 stealth fighter, in a demonstration of military clout. Both countries are currently developing smaller narrow-body jets to compete with the best-selling Airbus and Boeing types. Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC’s widebody department, said a 50-50 joint venture based in Shanghai will start operations this year. First announced in 2014, the project has so far been slow to materialize. The firms have said they want to conduct a maiden flight in 2022 and begin deliveries in 2025 or later. Western industry analysts consider the target challenging, but more realistic than recent aircraft programs that sought results in 5-7 years and came in late. “A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge,” Guo told reporters. “China and Russia each have their own advantages.” Descriptions accompanying the model showed the firms ultimately envision three variants, based on a basic version that will seat 280 and have a range of up to 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles). The decision to base the venture in Shanghai was a “mutual decision,” Guo said at the event, attended by COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong, UAC’s Chief Executive Yury Slyusar and Russia’s Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov. Guo declined to say how much each party had invested in the project. A global effort to assess potential suppliers is now under way, said COMAC, which is separately pushing its own C919 narrow-body passenger jet towards a long-delayed maiden flight, now aimed for the end of 2016 or early 2017. US firms Honeywell and United Technologies Corporation said on Wednesday they discussed the China-Russia jet with COMAC officials at the airshow, without commenting on the nature or subject of the contacts. “We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continually guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation,” Guo said. A key decision will be what engines to use. Industry sources speculate the jet could use Western engines. Another potentially tricky issue will be how the work should be divided, a subject which caused years of wrangling at Europe’s Airbus, which began in 1970 as a consortium of nations and took more than two decades to make a significant impact. Though a 50-50 JV, analysts view the Chinese side as being the more influential in the project. The firm’s Shanghai headquarters tells “where the balance of power is going to be and that reflects the size of the Chinese domestic market,” said Sash Tusa, analyst at London-based consultancy Agency Partners.

Meanwhile, the authorities consider renting two large ATR aircraft that would provide greater flexibility to the existing fleet, reports local News.ro. The privatization is just the last among other options for a company that has recorded nine consecutive years of losses, the minister added. Boeing and Airbus are considered for providing high-capacity aircraft whereas Embraer, ATR, and Bombardier are considered for small capacity airplanes. In the last years Tarom representatives have repeatedly said that it was necessary to replace the company’s fleet. Tarom airplanes have an average age of over 15 years, which significantly increases the maintenance and operating costs. In recent months, some Tarom flights have registered big delays while others have been cancelled due to technical problems. Tarom recently decommissioned its two Airbus 310 aircraft, which had been bought in 1992 and gave up some routes, including Dubai. The company now has a fleet of 22 aircraft from three producers: Airbus, ATR, and Boeing. editor@romania-insider.com Romania Insider Search on the web You might also be interested in these stories Romanian FinMin: Potential economic growth amounts to 4.2% for 2017-2020 11 Nov 2016business NEPI will start building new mall in Ramnicu Valcea next year 15 Nov 2016business Romgaz produces less gas as Romania imports more 14 Nov 2016business Five Romanian cities pledge to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 40% 11 Nov 2016eco Former Romanian PM: Trump’s victory is an opportunity for Romania 9 Nov 2016politics Romanian retailer sues competitor for stealing its clients via Google keyword 14 Nov 2016business Facebook Comments Romania Insider Newsletter Stay in touch with all that matters to you with our free daily newsletter.

New deliveries of passenger and freight aircraft for China will be close to 6,000 over the next 20 years, including 4,230 single aisle aircraft, and 1,740 wide-body aircraft, according to Airbus' 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast, released at the ongoing 11th China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province. Airbus rival Boeing is also optimistic about the Chinese market, with president of Boeing China John Bruns saying that China will become the world's first air market with a market value exceeding one trillion U.S. dollars. Airbus forecasts that China will need nearly 6,000 new passenger aircraft and freighters from 2016 to 2035, with a total market value of 945 billion U.S. dollars. It represents 18 percent of the world total demand in the next 20 years. "In the next 20 years, China will need more than 1,000 aircraft with 70 to 130 seats," said Guo Qing, vice president of Sales and Marketing, Commercial Aviation, Embraer China. Brazil's Embraer has big shares in regional air transportation market. "People's travelling needs are rising, which has brought huge opportunities for regional air transportation," he said. China will become the lead country for passenger air traffic, for both domestic and international markets, as passenger traffic in China will grow well above the world average rate, and will be the focal point for five of the top twenty traffic flows worldwide, according to Airbus. With aviation continuing to prove an extremely efficient way to move people and goods around the country, domestic air traffic in China will become the world's number one traffic flow growing at over three times from today level. Flows between China and the United States, Europe and Asia are expected to be amongst the fastest growing globally, with average annual growth rates 6.8 percent, 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent respectively. Between 2015 and 2035, the average annual growth rate for all international traffic from/to the Chinese mainland is forecast to be 6.7 percent. Domestic passenger traffic on the Chinese Mainland has quadrupled over the last 10 years, and China is set to become the world's number one aviation market, said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers. "In the next 20 years, the greatest demand for passenger aircraft will come from China," he said. China's rising middle-class, combined with agreements to ease travel between China and other major markets, are contributing to an outbound tourism boom. According to the China National Tourism Administration, the number of China's outbound tourists exceeded 100 million last year. By 2035, the propensity for the Chinese population to fly will grow from 0.3 trips per capita today, to 1.3, a higher level than the whole of Europe's propensity to fly today, Airbus predicted. Amid intense competition, China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) of China is ready to grab a share of the market. On Wednesday, the company and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation unveiled a jointly-developed wide-body aircraft model. The 280-seat aircraft is expected to make its maiden flight in 2023.

New deliveries of passenger and freight aircraft for China will be close to 6,000 over the next 20 years, including 4,230 single aisle aircraft, and 1,740 wide-body aircraft, according to Airbus' 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast, released at the ongoing 11th China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province. Airbus rival Boeing is also optimistic about the Chinese market, with president of Boeing China John Bruns saying that China will become the world's first air market with a market value exceeding one trillion U.S. dollars. Airbus forecasts that China will need nearly 6,000 new passenger aircraft and freighters from 2016 to 2035, with a total market value of 945 billion U.S. dollars. It represents 18 percent of the world total demand in the next 20 years. "In the next 20 years, China will need more than 1,000 aircraft with 70 to 130 seats," said Guo Qing, vice president of Sales and Marketing, Commercial Aviation, Embraer China. Brazil's Embraer has big shares in regional air transportation market. "People's travelling needs are rising, which has brought huge opportunities for regional air transportation," he said. China will become the lead country for passenger air traffic, for both domestic and international markets, as passenger traffic in China will grow well above the world average rate, and will be the focal point for five of the top twenty traffic flows worldwide, according to Airbus. With aviation continuing to prove an extremely efficient way to move people and goods around the country, domestic air traffic in China will become the world's number one traffic flow growing at over three times from today level. Flows between China and the United States, Europe and Asia are expected to be amongst the fastest growing globally, with average annual growth rates 6.8 percent, 5.3 percent and 6.7 percent respectively. Between 2015 and 2035, the average annual growth rate for all international traffic from/to the Chinese mainland is forecast to be 6.7 percent. Domestic passenger traffic on the Chinese Mainland has quadrupled over the last 10 years, and China is set to become the world's number one aviation market, said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers. "In the next 20 years, the greatest demand for passenger aircraft will come from China," he said. China's rising middle-class, combined with agreements to ease travel between China and other major markets, are contributing to an outbound tourism boom. According to the China National Tourism Administration, the number of China's outbound tourists exceeded 100 million last year. By 2035, the propensity for the Chinese population to fly will grow from 0.3 trips per capita today, to 1.3, a higher level than the whole of Europe's propensity to fly today, Airbus predicted. Amid intense competition, China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) of China is ready to grab a share of the market. On Wednesday, the company and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation unveiled a jointly-developed wide-body aircraft model. The 280-seat aircraft is expected to make its maiden flight in 2023. "We will focus on the growing global aviation industry with our aircraft," said Guo Bozhi, assistant to COMAC's General Manager. "Of course, China will always be one of the most important markets for us."

The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) unveiled a one-tenth scale model of a wide-body civilian aircraft at the ongoing Airshow China in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province, with experts saying that the two countries have strong complementarities in technology and market to bring the vision into reality. This cooperation is based on a contract signed in June witnessed by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin during Putin's visit to Beijing. According to a COMAC press release, the long-haul plane, with 280 seats, will have a range of 12,000 kilometers. The advanced aerodynamic design will use composite materials and a new generation high-bypass turbofan engine to obtain maximum performance. "Based on our experience of the research and production process, from the start it will take seven years to get to the first test flight, and 10 years to formally deliver to our client," COMAC noted. While the new aircraft has not yet been named, and it has not been decided which engine will be used, UAC President Yury Slyusar said he has strong confidence in the joint project with China, having previously told Russian media that the new plane will compete with the Boeing 787 and Air Bus 350. Lower operating costs will mean competitive pricing for the aircraft, with Slyusar saying it will have around a 10 percent advantage on the cost compared with its competitors. Slyusar told the Global Times on Wednesday that the total value of this program is approximately U.S.-20 billion, and China and Russia will split the bill. "COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property," he said. The joint venture will not be an exclusive Sino-Russian project, and will be open to world suppliers, the press release said. It will outsource to experienced suppliers of technologies and quality systems globally to share the risks, it said, and encourages suppliers to manufacture locally. Maurice Boon, Officer for Science and Technology at the Netherlands Embassy in China, was in the audience at the unveiling ceremony. He told the Global Times that "maybe Dutch companies can join the program and provide component supply services." Colossal challenge Qi Qi, an associate professor with Guangzhou Civil Aviation College, said it will be a colossal challenge for the joint venture to be accepted by the world market. The new plane will have to be tested for safety standards, operational and maintenance costs, before entering the international market. "Only those accepted by the international market will be deemed as successful models, so the joint venture must closely observe trends in the global aviation market," Qi said. "It takes time to accumulate experience to achieve certain levels of craftsmanship," he said. Airbus Group said at the air show that its A330 factory in Tianjin will deliver the first Tianjin-made A330 aircraft in September next year. A representative from Boeing told the Global Times Wednesday that the market is big enough for new competitors, and that healthy competition is conducive to the industry, which will prompt all manufacturers to produce innovative products to meet market demands. Lin Zhijie, an expert in passenger planes, noted that China boasts advantages as aircraft manufacturing is a national strategic industry with huge investment from the government, and Russia has a sound basis for the design and manufacturing of wide-bodied planes and engines. COMAC has already had success with its previous star product, the C919 passenger plane. Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines became the first buyer to take delivery of the China-made single-aisle 168-seat passenger jet on Tuesday at the air show, although the first test flights might not be until early 2017, COMAC said Tuesday, adding that China Eastern may then put in an order for five more planes. COMAC also signed an agreement with Shanghai-based aircraft leasing company SPDB Financial Leasing Tuesday, and received five confirmed orders and 15 international orders. So far, COMAC has received over 570 orders of C919 from 23 customers.

Debris drift pattern simulation from the ATSB's new report on MH 370 3 Nov 2016 at 01:03, Simon Sharwood Simon Sharwood Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Cloud, Security , Australia, Vmware, Microsoft Recent Articles Angry user demands three site visits to fix email address typos Russia to block LinkedIn over data domiciling issues What strange madness is this? Microsoft makes patch data RESTful The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has published a new report (PDF) on the likely fate flight MH 370, the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 missing since March 8th, 2014. The new analysis considers three things: the last handshake between the plane and Satcom satellites; the condition of debris from the plane, and; experiments aimed at figuring out how debris from the plane made it across the Indian ocean. As we've previously reported, the MH 370 search area was chosen by analysing seven satellite handshakes. . The new analysis of the seventh handshake suggests the plane was experiencing “a high and increasing rate of descent”. That conclusion is based on analysis of “burst frequency offset” (BFO), which the report explains “is a function of the Doppler shifts imparted on the communication signal due to the motion of the satellite and the aircraft.” Analysing BFO “can provide information about the relative motion between the satellite and the aircraft.” The report offers tremendous detail on BFO and how to use it in the case of MH370, and also reveals that the ATSB used BFO analysis to cook up new scenarios for Boeing to test in 777 simulators. Those efforts suggest MH 370 was heading down, and quickly, when it made its seventh handshake. Which leads to the notion that a sharp, rapid, descent could have seen the plane hit the ocean to the north of the current search area which was defined on the basis of previous analyses suggesting slower descents. Analysis of debris from the plane is also instructive, as it suggests the 777's flaps were retracted as is the case during normal flight. When the plane is landing the flaps are extended, so the finding of retracted flaps suggests MH370 was not being manoeuvred at low speed and therefore that flight crew were not attempting a soft landing on water. Drift pattern analysis is also considered, with replica plane parts having been set adrift in the Indian Ocean to see where they end up. To date these efforts have been inconclusive as some analyses suggest that the debris originated to the North of the search zone, while others suggest a more northerly impact point is not feasible. The ATSB has devoted three days to considering the report, an effort that will be closely watched by families of those aboard the fateful flight and the aviation industry as both have recently asked that the search for the plane be continued. The ATSB and authorities from Malaysia and China have previously said the search for the plane will be concluded once a survey of the currently-designated search area is complete. But if the new report turns up evidence suggesting the search zone should be expanded, it is possible the search will be extended. The current search is nearly complete, with 110,000km2 of the 120,000km2 search zone already surveyed without success. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 38 Comments More from The Register MH-370 search loses sharpest-eyed robot deep beneath the waves China-supplied 'towfish' only went to sea in February 63 Comments We're not looking for MH370 in the wrong place say investigators Glide-path theory debunked by the company that raised it 69 Comments Flight sim records show MH370 captain practiced 'flight' near search area Might pretend airports favoured by flight sim fans defeat nefarious intent theories? 54 Comments New MH370 search zone picked using just seven satellite 'handshakes' First and seventh pings from plane indicate power interruptions 86 Comments Passport PIN tech could have SAVED MH370 ID fraudsters Integrated keypad security?

State-owned planemakers Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and United Aircraft Corp (UAC) of Russia said they have started the hunt to find suppliers as they presented the mock-up of the widebody jet for the first time in public at a ceremony during Airshow China, the country's biggest air expo. But executives of both firms at the event offered no concrete details on financing and few technical specifications for a project that Western analysts have said is highly ambitious, difficult to pull off and likely to carry a high price. Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC's widebody department, said a 50-50 joint venture based in Shanghai would start operations this year. First announced in 2014, the project has been kept largely secret, though the companies have said that they want conduct a maiden flight in 2022 and begin deliveries in 2025 -- targets Western industry analysts consider unlikely, saying widebody jets can take decades rather than years to develop. "A widebody jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge," Guo told reporters. "China and Russia each have their own advantages." Descriptions accompanying the model showed the firms ultimately envision three variants of the aircraft, based on a basic version that will hold 280 seats with a range of up to 12,000 kilometres. The decision to base the venture in Shanghai was a "mutual decision" Guo said at the event, attended by COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong, UAC's chief executive Yury Slyusar as well as Russia's Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov. Guo declined to say how much each party had invested in the project. A global effort to search for and assess potential suppliers is now under way, said COMAC, which is separately occupied with pushing its own C919 narrow-body passenger jet towards a long-delayed maiden flight, now aimed for the end of 2016 or early 2017. US firms Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp said yesterday that they discussed the China-Russia jet with COMAC officials at the airshow, without commenting on the nature nor the subject of the contacts. "We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continually guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation," Guo said. Though a 50-50 JV, analysts view the Chinese side as being the more influential in the project. "The firm's Shanghai headquarters tells where the balance of power is going to be and that reflects the size of the Chinese domestic market," said Sash Tusa, analyst at London-based consultancy Agency Partners. "The volumes for a widebody jet are far smaller than for a narrow body ... so I think suppliers are going to be much more careful about this than for the (COMAC) C919," he said.  RECOMMENDED STORIES Police nab suspect after 6-year chase 8 trawlers sunk to create artificial reef NCPO pushing ahead to support rice farmers Thailand shock Australia with 2-2 draw Indonesia stocks post lowest close in 4 months Cabinet approves increase in flights from Russia Brother seeks conclusion of Thawatchai's death Actor Toshiro Mifune honoured with star in Hollywood Life imprisonment for shooting of football referee Most Viewed 119,269 Pattaya-Hua Hin ferry to begin on ... 42,459 'Supermoon' vigils set to honour ... 39,595 Philippine, Myanmar heads pay ... 34,207 Fresh attacks 'kill dozens' in ... 27,623 Two dead after NZ quake, tsunami ...

Two men, including Denver gang member, charged in Montbello drive-by shooting Colorado governor calls marijuana gray market “a clear and present danger” Read the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruling on why it reversed SolidFX’s $43 million award against Jeppesen Sanderson A ruling that awarded $43 million to a small software developer was reversed this week by a federal appeals court in Denver. Jeppesen Sanderson, the Englewood division of The Boeing Company that makes aviation terminal charts, won its appeal against SolidFX, the Massachusetts developer that accused Jeppesen of stealing its idea for an iPad app. “We are gratified with the decision of the court in the matter,” said Mike Pound, a Jeppesen spokesman. “The next step would be for them to respond.” SolidFX’s legal firm, Davis Graham & Stubbs in Denver, did not respond to requests for comment. Jeppesen was represented Kirkland & Ellis in Denver. In the ruling, released Monday, Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals judges Paul J. Kelly Jr., Carolyn B. McHugh and Monroe G. McKay wrote that the contract between the two companies didn’t allow for the recovery of lost profits, which was the bulk of the $43 million. It all started in November 2008, when SolidFX began discussing a way to digitize Jeppesen’s paper terminal charts used by pilots to navigate and land at airports. The result was the SolidFX’s iRex device preloaded with Jeppesen’s charts. The two companies finalized a five-year contract in December 2009. A month later, Apple introduced the iPad and SolidFX began the process of turning Jeppesen data into an iPad app. But Jeppesen, which wouldn’t share its data with SolidFX, built its own iPad app in May 2010. SolidFX sued in June 2011 for antitrust violations and breach of contract. Its lawyers argued that the contract included future devices like iPads. Related Articles April 17, 2014 Jury awards app maker SolidFX $43.1 million in case against Jeppesen April 7, 2014 App maker claims $78.6 million in damages in Jeppesen iPad app case April 4, 2014 Is an iPad an “e-book viewer?” Jury to decide in Jeppesen app case “There was never a doubt in their mind that the iPad was covered,” SolidFX attorney Shannon Stevenson, of Davis Graham & Stubbs, said during closing arguments, according to an earlier Denver Post story about the case. In 2014, a federal jury awarded SolidFX $43.1 million in damages, which included $20.9 million in lost profits and $21.4 million in lost business. In its appeal, Jeppesen lawyers challenged only the part about recovering lost profits — the entire $43 million sum. Tom Russell, a law professor at the Sturm College of Law at the University of Denver, said the appeals judges did the right thing by reversing the award. The original jury decision was based on what is called “consequential damages,” or future business and profits SolidFX would lose because Jeppesen breached the contract. “But in this case, the contract makes clear that lost profits are excluded from damages in the event of a breach,” Russell said. “My view is that the 10th Circuit gets that right. That’s a tough day’s work for the plaintiff’s lawyers.” SolidFX has 14 days to seek a rehearing. It’s very common for large jury awards to be reduced. Russell said that about three-quarters of jury awards higher than $1 million are reduced. “What fraction get eliminated, I can’t say. But when you read about a big award, you can think that 75 percent of the time, it will be reduced. It’s not like the plan is to walk out with a big bag of money,” said Russell, who specializes in contracts. With any contract, Russell advises that you read the fine print. “Just as we ordinary consumers don’t read rental car agreements or click-through licenses on the internet, in similar fashion, businesses don’t read the contracts they sign,” Russell said. “Another thing we like to say is large print giveth and the small print taketh away.” Tags:  Boeing,  Jeppesen Tamara Chuang ​Tamara Chuang covers personal technology and local tech news for The Denver Post.

Jim Chilton, president of Boeing's Network and Space Systems, speaks to the media Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. William Thornton / wthornton@al.com  That figure, coming in the company's 100th year of business, is just the surface, however. Jim Chilton, president of Boeing's Network and Space Systems, said Boeing has made a longterm investment in Alabama and Huntsville. "We have a talent base and a set of facilities that have a role in almost anything Boeing chooses to do nationally," he said. Approximately 54 years after its first plant in Alabama opened, Boeing is still the state's largest aerospace company. Its impact is being felt through weapons systems in use throughout the world, and in modules that have housed astronauts on the International Space Station for the past 16 years. Huntsville's Boeing presence has a hand in space exploration technology, research, strategic defense and intelligence systems and other arenas, Chilton said. The study gathered the company's impact according to 2015 figures and was assembled over a six-week period. By the numbers, Boeing: * Has $2.255 billion business sales impact, contributing $1.062 billion to the state's gross domestic product, and $565.1 million in household earnings. For a little perspective, Alabama's total GDP is $204 billion. * Purchased $532.3 million through suppliers and vendors in Alabama. * Employs 2,750 workers in Alabama on a $264 million payroll. * Is responsible for 8,393 direct and indirect jobs. * The company made in-state non-payroll purchases and expenditures of $748.7 million. *Generated $53.9 million in state and local tax revenue. And those numbers don't tell the full picture. Joseph Addy, an associate dean for economic development outreach at the University of Alabama Center for Business and Economic Research, said that doesn't include all the associated industry located in Alabama because of Boeing's presence. For every job at Boeing, another three jobs exist in the Alabama economy, he said. "You've made us a better place," Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battles told company officials at a gathering at the Huntsville Chamber of Commerce this morning. "Boeing keeps America safe through weapons systems, and they make America dream through space exploration." Chilton said one exciting aspect of the company is its Research and Technology center, which supports commercial airplanes, defense, space and enterprise projects. "That's the company saying we're here for the long haul," he said. "That's the future."

Source: Boeing Boeing sees an opportunity to expand its presence in Indonesia with sales of additional AH64E Apache attack helicopters and its CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter, company officials said on 2 November. The Indonesian Army (Tentara Nasional Indonesia - Angkatan Darat: TNI-AD) ordered eight Apache helicopters in 2013 for USD296 million, with the Foreign Military Sale (FMS) contract representing the largest US sale of a new military platform to Indonesia since Washington lifted an arms embargo on the country in 2005. Speaking at a media briefing at the Indo Defence 2016 exhibition in Jakarta, officials said there is potential for sales of another eight Apache helicopters to the TNI-AD. "They have an appetite for maybe eight more and we would like to fulfil that," said Edward Hassiepen, Boeing's director for vertical lift global sales and marketing. "After the fielding of the first Apache helicopter there will be a definitive answer as to potential follow-on purchases," added Yeong-Tae Pak, Boeing's regional director for Southeast Asia. The officials said that Boeing is scheduled to begin production of the TNI-AD's initial Apache helicopter in December 2016, with flight tests expected in June 2017. Deliveries of the eight aircraft are expected to be completed by the end of 2017. About the TNI-AD's potential purchase of the Chinook, Pak said that Indonesia has already submitted to the US government a request for price and availability of the latest CH-47F version of the platform. The programme will move ahead once Jakarta issues a letter of acceptance (LOA). "Indonesia's request covers between four to 10 Chinooks," said Pak. "But if you look at Indonesia's geography - it's a huge country - I would suspect that once we get the initial sale there will be more requirements. In a country of this size there are expansive requirements for capabilities such as humanitarian relief and firefighting, so we believe there is a market for more than what has been specified."

Four Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft (SHARCs) were deployed off the coast of Northern Scotland during the British Royal Navy´s Unmanned Warrior 2016 demonstration. The autonomous surface vehicles used advanced Boeing acoustic sensors in the live anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission. Over the two-week demonstration, the SHARCs detected and tracked an advancing unmanned underwater vehicle and a manned diesel submarine. The SHARCs provided detailed and actionable intelligence to commanders through more than 100 automated contact reports, proving the USVs efficacy to autonomously conduct ASW missions and exchange data in real time. Liquid Robotics designs and manufactures the SHARC (Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft) Wave Glider platform. The Wave Glider and SHARC are wave and solar-powered unmanned surface vehicles.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:00 PM, November 2, 2016 ZHUHAI, China - China and Russia took a step closer on Wednesday to the joint development of a long-haul jet to challenge Boeing <BA.N> and Airbus <AIR.PA>, displaying a model of the unnamed plane that would compete with Western rivals. State-owned planemakers Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] and United Aircraft Corp (UAC) of Russia said they had started the hunt to find suppliers, as they presented a mock-up of the wide-body jet at Airshow China. Neither firm gave details on financing or technical specifications for what Western analysts call a politically-driven initiative that will be difficult to pull off and is likely to carry a high price tag. China opened the show on Tuesday in the southern city of Zhuhai with a brief flypast of its J-20 stealth fighter, in a demonstration of military clout. Both countries are currently developing smaller narrow-body jets to compete with the best-selling Airbus and Boeing types. Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC's widebody department, said a 50-50 joint venture based in Shanghai will start operations this year. First announced in 2014, the project has so far been slow to materialize. The firms have said they want conduct a maiden flight in 2022 and begin deliveries in 2025 or later. Western industry analysts consider the target challenging, but more realistic than recent aircraft programs that sought results in 5-7 years and came in late. "A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge," Guo told reporters. "China and Russia each have their own advantages." Descriptions accompanying the model showed the firms ultimately envision three variants, based on a basic version that will seat 280 and have a range of up to 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles). SUPPLIER SEARCH The decision to base the venture in Shanghai was a "mutual decision", Guo said at the event, attended by COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong, UAC's Chief Executive Yury Slyusar and Russia's Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov. Guo declined to say how much each party had invested in the project. A global effort to assess potential suppliers is now under way, said COMAC, which is separately pushing its own C919 narrow-body passenger jet towards a long-delayed maiden flight, now aimed for the end of 2016 or early 2017. U.S. firms Honeywell <HON.N> and United Technologies Corporation <UTC.N> said on Wednesday they discussed the China-Russia jet with COMAC officials at the airshow, without commenting on the nature or subject of the contacts. "We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continually guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation," Guo said. A key decision will be what engines to use. Industry sources speculate the jet could use Western engines. Another potentially tricky issue will be how the work should be divided, a subject which caused years of wrangling at Europe's Airbus, which began in 1970 as a consortium of nations and took more than two decades to make a significant impact. Though a 50-50 JV, analysts view the Chinese side as being the more influential in the project. The firm's Shanghai headquarters tells "where the balance of power is going to be and that reflects the size of the Chinese domestic market," said Sash Tusa, analyst at London-based consultancy Agency Partners.

Aerojet Rocketdyne completes SLS launch abort engine hot fire tests by Staff Writers Sacramento CA (SPX) Nov 02, 2016 File image. Aerojet Rocketdyne has successfully completed a series of hot-fire tests on two Launch Abort Engines (LAE) featuring innovative new propellant valves for Boeing's Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner service module propulsion system. The tests were conducted in the Mojave Desert in California, and confirmed the ability for the new valves to modulate propellant flow and control peak LAE thrust in the event of a launch abort. The LAEs, designed by Aerojet Rocketdyne, include a fuel valve and oxidizer valve, which were developed and tested under the company's Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) subcontract to Boeing. The Starliner will open a new era of spaceflight, carrying humans to the International Space Station once again from United States soil. The LAEs, designed by Aerojet Rocketdyne, include a fuel valve and oxidizer valve, which were developed and tested under the company's Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) subcontract to Boeing. The Starliner will open a new era of spaceflight, carrying humans to the International Space Station once again from United States soil. "These innovative valves successfully enabled the engine to demonstrate precise timing, peak thrust control and steady-state thrust necessary during a mission abort. This testing culminates a year of dedicated hard work by the LAE Integrated Product Team at Aerojet Rocketdyne," said Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO and President Eileen Drake. "This is another important step forward as our nation prepares to safely and reliably send humans back to the space station from American soil." Under the CCtCap subcontract to Boeing, Aerojet Rocketdyne will provide propulsion system hardware, which includes LAEs, Orbital Maneuvering and Attitude Control (OMAC) thrusters, Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters, and more. Boeing will assemble propulsion hardware kits into the service module section of the Starliner spacecraft at its Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Aerojet Rocketdyne also provides hardware supporting service module hot-fire testing, which will take place at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico; the pad abort and system qualification testing, which will occur at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico; and the orbital flight test, which will be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Starliner service module propulsion system provides launch abort capability on the pad and during ascent, along with propulsion needs during flight - from launch vehicle separation, docking to and undocking from the space station, to separation of the crew and service modules when the spacecraft begins to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. At separation, crew module monopropellant thrusters, also provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne, support re-entry control. The Starliner service module and launch abort propulsion system is designed to rapidly "push" a crew capsule to safety if an abort is necessary. If unused for an abort, the propellant is used to complete the spacecraft's mission operations. The Starliner service module propulsion system includes four 40,000-pound thrust launch abort engines used only in an abort; 1,500-pound thrust class OMAC thrusters that provide low-altitude launch abort attitude control; maneuvering and stage-separation functions along with high-altitude direct abort capability and large orbital maneuvers; and 100-pound thrust class RCS engines that provide high-altitude abort attitude control, on-orbit low delta-v maneuvering and space station re-boost capability.

Goldman Sachs And Boeing Could Decide The Dow's Fate In 2016 Forbes 11/1/2016 Steve Schaefer, Forbes Staff © (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg) With only a week until U.S. voters decide on America’s next president, markets are on edge. But when it comes to how the Dow Jones industrial average performance measures up for 2015 the two names that might decide the outcome aren’t Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Following Tuesday’s triple-digit drop, the Dow is up 3.5% year-to-date, but if it’s going to hold onto those gains it might take a strong finish from Goldman Sachs Group and Boeing. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 148.11 -1.88 -1.25% Walt Disney Co DIS ▼ 97.70 -0.22 -0.22% UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH ▼ 152.23 -0.05 -0.03% Caterpillar Inc CAT ▲ 94.44 +0.27 +0.29% In a Tuesday morning note, Convergex chief market strategist Nicholas Colas noted that the price-weighted Dow has been relatively devoid of meaningful blowups in 2016. Nike shares are down more than 20%, but its shares are in the index’s cheaper third. Walt Disney's higher-priced shares are down 12% in 2016, but neither company is knocking more than 72 points off the index for the year. Meanwhile, Colas adds, the five stocks driving the Dow’s gains — through Monday that was UnitedHealth Group, Caterpillar, IBM, Chevron and 3M — are each adding at least 100 points to the index. Apple, for all its influence in other indexes by dint of its near-$600 billion market cap, “is a non-event to the Dow,” Colas writes, so he looks at Goldman and Boeing. “What really matters between now and year end are underperforming stocks with an outsized influence on the Average,” he continues. With weightings above 5% and shares down more than 1% each this year, the bank and the airplane maker fit the bill. For Goldman things have been looking up after a tough first half. The stock has gained 10% in a month, mostly after Q3 earnings jumped 68%. An October surge in M&A also bore fruit as Goldman has climbed back atop the rankings of deal advisors on announced transactions, with a narrow lead, even though it doesn’t have a role in the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner deal. Boeing has also been cutting its year-to-date loss, thanks most recently to its October earnings report. The aircraft company is up 8% over the last month. It’s not uncommon for a few stocks to carry the year for portfolios of any size, let alone one as small as the Dow’s 30 companies. (In 2012 much of the index’s advance was attributable to a big rise in shares of Home Depot.) “To make further progress from here…winners have to hold, and highly weighted laggards need to pick up the pace,” says Colas. That may leave Goldman and Boeing as potential saviors if election aftermath puts the Dow at risk of a down year.

Instead of using the redesigned Antares — which bounced back from a catastrophic explosion after liftoff in 2014 — to ship supplies into orbit early next year, these officials said, senior program managers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have devised an alternate plan. They want the next flight of Orbital’s unmanned Cygnus cargo capsule to ride on top of an Atlas V, a rocket produced by another company that can lift heavier loads and has a superior reliability record. Related Articles July 16, 2016 SpaceX launching space station docking port for NASA October 25, 2016 Lockheed surges on bullish 2017 sales forecast after IT deal September 8, 2016 Lockheed Martin-built OSIRIS-REx now on its way to distant asteroid The Atlas V, manufactured by a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., is the Pentagon’s primary large rocket, boasting a long legacy of excellent performance, dependability and more than 60 successful national-security and other missions in a row. Centennial-based United Launch Alliance, which builds and operates the rocket, also is known for the predictability of its launch schedules — an especially important attribute now for NASA decision makers. The shift, which surprised many aerospace experts and caught even senior Orbital officials flat footed, according to people familiar with the matter, underscores NASA’s desire to have greater assurance that the orbiting laboratory will have adequate supplies and material for experiments in the short term. A NASA announcement could come as quickly as the next few days, these people said. Antares successfully shipped cargo to the space station before its 2014 accident, and is expected to resume unmanned shipments from the Wallops Island launchpad offshore Virginia later in 2017. But for now, NASA effectively decided it wants an added insurance policy for both schedule and mission assurance. The agency is particularly concerned about the tempo of supply flights because Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the other commercial cargo supplier, currently has suspended all shipments pending completion of an investigation into the second explosion of the company’s Falcon 9 in roughly a year. With the Falcon 9 temporarily grounded, a replacement Atlas V, slated to blast off from Florida in February or March, could carry nearly 1,000 pounds more into orbit than an Antares. Recently, industry and Pentagon officials have said the next Falcon 9 flight is unlikely before mid-January. SpaceX, as Musk’s closely held company is known, has repeatedly said it intends to resume Falcon 9 operations by the end the year. During Orbital’s discussions with NASA, according to industry officials familiar with the matter, the company acknowledged it would have faced a hard time complying with NASA’s upcoming launch deadlines. Orbital still plans to make two launches from the Wallops Island facility in 2017. NASA’s decision surprised industry experts partly because agency officials recently said they felt comfortable with supply levels on board the space station. In a statement Thursday, a NASA spokeswoman reiterated that Russian and Japanese cargo vehicles are expected to link up with the space station this year, but she didn’t comment on the Atlas V issue. The statement added: “We’re working with all of our partners at this time on range availability, space station traffic and other factors to ensure we continue operation of the station in a safe and effective way.” Tags:  Boeing,  Lockheed Martin,  NASA,  United Launch Alliance Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off blog comments powered by Disqus More in Business Business Q&A: JAKE’s Toy Box, Arvada November 15, 2016, 4:12 pm JAKE’s Toy Store is a toy shop local to Arvada that offers a variety of children’s toys and is the proud home of the largest G-scale train setup in all of Colorado.

Getty Images Advertisement The ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance is spearheading an effort to have the U.S. reject a Chinese aluminum entrepreneur’s purchase of Cleveland-based Aleris Corp. on national security grounds. Oregon’s Ron Wyden and 11 other senators signed a letter addressed to the Treasury Department asking for the $2.3 billion acquisition announced in August to be reviewed, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg. Should the Democrats win control of the Senate, Wyden would likely steer the agenda of the committee, which oversees trade. Liu Zhongtian’s Zhongwang USA LLC plans to buy closely held Aleris for $1.11 billion in cash and $1.22 billion in debt, giving one of Asia’s biggest makers of extruded-aluminum products greater access to American and European technology, as well as buyers that include aerospace manufacturers like Boeing Co. and automakers such as Audi. “Chinese entities, including state owned or state controlled enterprises, may have relationships with China’s military, compounding the risk that U.S. technologies will fall into the wrong hands,” the letter, addressed to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, said. “Aleris’ R&D and technology are critical to current and long-term U.S. economic and national security interests given Aleris’ use of advanced research and modeling techniques, development of high-strength alloys, and design of light armor material with increased ballistic performance,” they wrote. Other signatories include Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York; Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota; and Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. Popular Now More 'Must Have' Metrics to Drive Continuous Improvement Trump is Right on Trade, But He Doesn’t Know Why The Internet of Things Will Make Manufacturing Smarter Significant Footprint When the deal was announced in August, Aleris Chief Executive Officer Sean Stack said in an interview that the company didn’t anticipate any regulatory hurdles.  “We don’t check any of those boxes in terms of the criteria” for a formal inquiry from Treasury’s foreign investment committee, known as CFIUS, Stack said at the time. China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd. could become the world’s second-largest aluminum rolling company should the Aleris acquisition be approved by regulators, Austin, Texas-based Harbor Intelligence wrote in an Aug. 30 research note. Aleris would give Zhongwang a significant footprint in the North American and European flat-rolled products markets, Jorge Vazquez, the managing director of Harbor, said in the note. Zhongwang declined to comment on any CFIUS investigation, saying only that there will be no change to Aleris’ brand, management or business strategy. Deal Scrutiny Chinese takeovers have drawn attention from Capitol Hill recently, including China National Chemical Corp.’s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG. In September, a group of lawmakers, citing investment in the U.S. by China, urged the Government Accountability Office to review whether CFIUS’s authority should be expanded and whether special consideration should be given to acquisitions from state-controlled Chinese buyers. CFIUS, whose members include officials from the Defense, State and Justice Departments, reviews acquisitions of U.S. businesses by foreign buyers. The panel scrutinizes deals for any risks to U.S. national security and can impose conditions on transactions or recommend the president block them. The aluminum industry has caught the attention of lawmakers in recent months amid rising concerns that overproduction in China will force U.S. smelters to shut more production, limiting domestic supply to manufacturers. Senator Schumer joined a group of lawmakers last month pushing for a World Trade Organization case against alleged Chinese subsidies of its aluminum industry, while the U.S. industry upped its anti-China drumbeat at a hearing by the U.S. International Trade Commission probe in September. The U.S. is one of the the top recipients of Chinese capital, attracting more than $18 billion of foreign direct investment in the first half of 2016, according to Rhodium Group. That’s a threefold increase from the same period last year. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

He was 89. Mr. White was an accomplished actor who performed in films and television commercials. He was a lifetime member of Slidell Little Theatre, directing or acting in more than 50 productions there and at other community theater venues. He was known for his portrayal of Mark Twain. He also depicted the fictional character Father Guido Sarducci at many celebrity roasts. In 2011, Mr. White received the President's Arts Award for Performing Artist of the Year from the St. Tammany Commission on Cultural Affairs. After receiving the award, he told The Times-Picayune he loved playing different roles, and that he had been involved in theater for so long that when he walked in the door at home his wife, Joyce, would sometimes ask, "Who are you this week?" Mr. White also won numerous Slidell Little Theatre Ginny awards for acting, directing, set design and poster design. "Whenever he was associated with anything, it was always done in a professional manner and a lot of fun," said Allen Little, a member of the theater's Board of Directors. "They were well done and always appreciated by the audience, whether he directed it or performed in it." In addition to his work in theater, he was known throughout St. Tammany Parish for his work as editor of the Slidell Sentry-News and as a columnist and contributing writer for The Times-Picayune. He won numerous awards from the Louisiana Press Association. Mr. White was born and raised in Washington D.C. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he moved to Wellington, Kan., and began working in Wichita for the Boeing Co., for which he worked for 22 years. Boeing transferred him to New Orleans in 1963. He was a member of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church and a past member of Slidell Elks Lodge 2321, and he volunteered as a juvenile reserve officer with the Slidell Police Department. He was a member of Le Rostierres and was once honored as the club's "roastee" for that year's charity event. Mr. White is survived by his wife of 66 years, Joyce Davis White; three daughters, Kristin Mayes of Greensboro, N.C., Susan Hart of Carriere, Miss., and Jane Cranford of Slidell; a son, Robert White of Slidell; six grandchildren; seven great-grandchilden; and numerous nieces and nephews. A funeral service will be held Wednesday (Nov. 9) at 11 a.m. at Honaker Funeral Home, 1751 Gause Blvd. West, in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Slidell. Visitation begins at 9 a.m. Burial, with military honors, will be in Southeast Louisiana Veterans Cemetery. follow us Twitter Facebook LInkedIn Google+ Pinterest Tumblr Most Read Active Discussions Today's Front Page Today's front page stories delivered to your inbox each morning at 5:30 a.m. Leave this field blank    optional Check here if you do not want to receive additional email offers and information.

ALSO READ Jet pilots report sick to protest against new duty hours; seniors deny crew shortage Jet Airways plans to restart US flights Jet Airways defers Boeing 787 induction Boeing says India needs 1,850 planes Jet Airways will prepare crew’s duty rosters in consultation with the pilots’ union. This was agreed between the pilots’ union and the airline management on Wednesday, after protests by pilots on Tuesday and Wednesday against the new duty hours. Several pilots called in sick and others refused to accept the revised flight duties (due to colleagues’ sick leaves) causing disruption. A shortage of Boeing 737 commanders added to the chaos as flights were disrupted. Jet Airways, however, denied there was shortage of pilots. In a statement, the company said: “The airline has adequate pilots to manage its operations and follows a structured plan for recruitment, induction, training of new pilots as well as grooming and upgrading internal candidates eligible for Captaincy, based on future projections.” Last month, the airline introduced a new software to optimise duty rosters of pilots on a trial basis. The new system was introduced to improve efficiency and productivity. It takes into account pilots’ duty time restrictions according to regulations and leaves. However, pilots are unhappy with this. “The new system does not take into account human factors. Pilots are being rostered for consecutive late-night or early-morning flights. This may be within rules, but does lead to fatigue. Also, in the new roster, pilots are operating flights from outstation bases for 4-5 days at a stretch,” a senior commander noted. He also stated the crew rostering software was fully compliant not only with DGCA regulations, but also internal company limitations that provide a buffer to the DGCA limits. The union submitted 13 points related to ‘human factors’ while expressing concern regarding the new rostering software. The next roster will be prepared taking into account the recommendations of pilots, sources said. For some months, the airline has been facing a shortage of pilots. “While there is a published duty roster for the month, certain flights are open and pilots are asked to do them at short notice,” a pilot complained. According to a PTI report, Jet Airways requires at least 200 more pilots to carry out its operations in a seamless manner. The airline currently has around 1,200 pilots to operate its fleet of 102 aircraft comprising Boeing 777s, B737s, Airbus A330s and ATRs. Almost two-thirds of its fleet consists of B737s. However, a management source said the airline has 350 pilots under various levels of training and has no shortage.

The New York Times reports factory jobs robots A worker loads spools of thread at the Repreve Bottle Processing Center, part of the Unifi textile company in Yadkinville, N.C., Friday, Oct. 21, 2016. The United States is manufacturing more products than ever; it just needs fewer people to make them. One academic study finds that technology is responsible for nearly 90 percent of America's manufacturing job losses. Technology is actually starting to bring factory jobs back to the U.S. as labor costs become less important. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton) Print Email Jennifer Larino, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Jennifer Larino, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 03, 2016 at 1:39 PM comments The decline in American manufacturing and what to do about it has been a central talking point throughout the presidential election. The likelihood the U.S. will again attract major factories that employ the masses is slim, but small, urban manufacturers could be the key to closing the U.S. class divide, The New York Times reports. The report profiles Marlin Steel, a small Baltimore factory that makes metal baskets for larger manufacturers such as Ford Motor and Boeing. The story features employee James Branch, a high school dropout and ex-convict who turned his life around after completing a two-year metalwork course and landing a job at the factory as a skilled machine operator. The report notes small plants like Marlin Steel are now the norm in American manufacturing, with the vast majority of the nation's 252,000 manufacturing companies employing fewer than 20 people. Blue-collar whites in the Rust Belt and elsewhere in America have been hard hit by factory closures, anger over which has boiled over during the current presidential election. But the report notes the urban African-American working class was "devastated first" when manufacturers moving plants out of "high-cost, union-dominated" cities to locales in the South and West. Experts see small urban manufacturers as one of the few remaining doorways to opportunity for less educated workers, particularly in big cities where finance, technology and other service sectors have dominated job growth, the report says.

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar #RussiaFail · #RussiaLies · CounterPropaganda · Information Warfare · Propaganda · Russia EW: Russia Claims Dubious Capabilities November 3, 2016 Joel Harding Russia is claiming their Il-22PP ‘Porubshchik’ ‘Lumberjack’ can effectively jam the NATO E-3 AWACS aircraft now deployed in Turkey. Maybe they can, maybe they can’t.  That’s not the point. Russia is now caught up in a disastrous cycle and has to increase their capabilities in Syria every time NATO, the US, or anybody else has a capability in the neighborhood.   Keeping up with the Jones’ has taken on a whole new meaning for Russia. Bottom line, Russia is dropping a ton of money into Syria they can’t earn back, there is no ROI.  Russia is, like the Soviets, spending themselves into oblivion. </end editorial> Last week, NATO announced that it had begun tracking the movement of Russian military aircraft operating in Syria using AWACS reconnaissance planes operating from Turkish bases. But as luck would have it, Russia has just received all the tools it needs to neutralize the alliance’s snooping. In late September, NATO announced that a fleet of 16 Airborne Early Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft would be sent to Turkey, ostensibly to help the alliance’s ongoing efforts against the Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) terrorists. A month later, the alliance confirmed that the aircraft had been deployed, and that they started their surveillance of Syrian airspace beginning October 20. NATO stressed that the planes are being flown only over international airspace or over Turkey, and will not enter Syrian airspace. Nevertheless, their presence will give them the theoretical capability to monitor aircraft flying over much of Syria. The systems aboard the 16 Boeing E-3 Sentry aircraft allow them to detect targets flying at low altitudes from distances of up to 400 km, and from distances between 450 and 650 km for planes flying at medium and high altitudes. In other words, hypothetically speaking, they can easily detect aircraft operating in Syria without ever crossing the border. The E-3s were deployed to Turkey at Ankara’s request, and following a formal decision at the NATO summit in Warsaw in July. The aircraft have been placed at an air base in the central Turkish province of Konya. Moscow obviously hasn’t been fooled by alliance claims that the planes were deployed to fight the terrorists. Experts have previously pointed out Daesh has no air force, adding that AWACS aircraft in the area are obviously directed against the Syrian Air Force and the Russian air group operating in Syria. In fact, despite the formal talk of an ‘anti-Daesh’ deployment, RAF Air Commander Paddy Teakle came out and openly admitted that the planes will be used to spy on Russian and Syrian jets. “I will not deny that the AWACS will monitor the Russian air forces in Syria, and the air forces of Bashar al-Assad, from Turkish territory; given their range, the radars can monitor territory in Syria and Iraq. But this is not our only goal,” Teakle said. The Il-22PP. Note the ‘pockets’ sticking out of the fuselage, containing electronic warfare equipment As luck would have it, the Russian Ministry of Defense has already worked out a response – installing electronic warfare equipment to the tried and tested Ilyushin Il-22 platform. The new Il-22PP ‘Porubshchik’ (roughly ‘Lumberjack’) electronic warfare and reconnaissance system passed state testing in September. One Il-22PP aircraft was handed over to the air force, with two more expected to be delivered later this month. According to the system’s designers, the plane’s onboard electronics are specifically designed to counter modern AWACS systems, ground-based air defense (such as the MIM-104 Patriot missile system) and manned and unmanned aircraft. Underside view of the Il-22PP The Il-22PP features frequency selectivity, meaning that it will not jam friendly radio electronic systems. Its carrier, a modernized, four-engine Il-22, has a range of up to 6,500 km at altitudes of 8,800 meters and a speed of up to 685 km/h. In addition to jamming capabilities, the planes are capable of conducting electronic intelligence operations of their own, and of protecting friendly aircraft from enemy electronic warfare. The new Il-22PPs will soon be complemented by the Tu-214R, a completely new design, equipped with cutting-edge optical, electronic and radar systems. In August, the Defense Ministry confirmed that a Tu-214R had undergone testing in Syria. That aircraft is itself intended to replace the Ilyushin Il-20M electronic intelligence (ELINT) aircraft, but is capable of multitasking. The Tu-214R’s capabilities include ELINT, signals intelligence (SIGINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT). The plane’s antennae are capable of intercepting signals emitted by everything from aircraft to combat vehicles and mobile phones, and can build an electronic order of battle (EOB). The Tu-214R has been undergoing extensive state testing all this year. © PHOTO: WIKIPEDIA/RIMMA SADYKOVA Russia’s State-of-the-art Tu-214R Spy Plane Successfully Passes Syria Test In other words, just as NATO decided to deploy over a dozen AWACS planes in Turkey to keep an eye on Syria, Russia rolled out several new aircraft allowing Moscow to jam NATO intelligence gathering operations at the flick of a switch. And that’s not even counting the jamming capabilities of ground-based systems already deployed. Whether Russia decides to use this equipment selectively or on a mass scale remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: NATO officials probably won’t be the ones to admit that their surveillance operation in Syria isn’t gathering as much useful info as they hoped they would get.

Home Industry Companies Air India Engineering Services eyes Rs 200 crore revenues next fiscal Air India Engineering Services eyes Rs 200 crore revenues next fiscal Pinning hopes on getting more work orders from private airlines and increased capacity, Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) expects to rake in Rs 200 crore revenues in the next financial year. By: PTI | Nagpur | Published: November 3, 2016 7:43 PM Speaking to reporters at AIESL’s Nagpur MRO facility, he said there is additional capacity here which the firm wants to utilise for aircraft maintenance work of private airlines. (Source: PTI) Pinning hopes on getting more work orders from private airlines and increased capacity, Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) expects to rake in Rs 200 crore revenues in the next financial year.A wholly-owned subsidiary of national carrier Air India, AIESL is working aggressively to expand its foot print in the high-growth potential Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) segment as most of the private airlines carry out these works overseas. “We are looking to mop up revenue to the tune of Rs 200 crore from third party business in the next fiscal,” Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani said here.Currently, revenues are around Rs 130 crore and a jump would also help Air India — which has turned operationally profitable after a decade — improve its overall financials. Speaking to reporters at AIESL’s Nagpur MRO facility, he said there is additional capacity here which the firm wants to utilise for aircraft maintenance work of private airlines.The Nagpur facility today started carrying out up to 4A checks on A320 aircraft, manufactured by Airbus. “So far we were doing mainteanance work on B777 only. After getting the mandatory approvals from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), we have now started carrying out up to 4A checks on A32O aircraft as well,” Lohani said. So far, Air India and aircraft maker Boeing have invested around USD 116 million in the Nagpur facility, which started functioning in August last year. So far, Boeing has put in USD 107 million, while the national carrier has pumped in USD 9 million.At current exchange rate, USD 116 million translates to more than Rs 770 crore. Recently, AIESL inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with no-frills carrier SpiceJet for maintaining the latter’s Boeing 737 fleet. According to Lohani, AIESL is negotiating with GoAir to maintain its A32O fleet at the facility here.”AIESL expects to start testing and minor maintenance work of GE engines by January next year,” he noted, adding that such works would be done at an exclusive workshop which is being set up for these engines at the facility. Currently, AIESL provides line maintenance support to around 30 domestic and overseas airlines at various stations. Last month, AIESL joined hands with Tribhuvan Technologies for a strategic partnership to tap opportunities in the defence MRO segment. As there are not many MRO facilities in India, the segment provides significant growth opportunities. While Air India does all these work within the country, most airlines carry them out overseas, at a much higher cost.For the first in a decade, Air India has reported an operating profit of Rs 105 crore in 2015-16 on the back of lower fuel costs and higher passenger numbers. It had an operating loss of Rs 2,636 crore in 2014-15. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Ever since British Airways retired its money-losing supersonic Concorde in 2003, airlines have generally stuck to top speeds of around 615 miles per hour. That’ll get you from New York to San Francisco in five or six hours, depending on the winds, but you can’t find a plane that will get you there significantly sooner. We’ve largely learned to tolerate our slow, boring aircraft. But there’s a compelling case that we shouldn’t — that air travel should actually be much, much quicker. Right now there are a host of energetic startups and NASA engineers working on sleek new supersonic jets that could fly twice as fast as today’s commercial planes, if not faster. These jets would be major upgrades on the noisy, fuel-squandering Concordes of old, and they could be ready within the decade. When you talk to people working on these super-fast planes, it’s hard not to get swept up in the excitement. Take Blake Scholl, the CEO of Boom, a startup that’s working with Virgin Galactic to put a new supersonic business jet into service by the early 2020s. He envisions a day when anyone could cross the Pacific or Atlantic in just a few short hours. “It changes how you think about the world,” he tells me. “In aerospace, there are two great passions,” Scholl says. “You either want to build rockets and go colonize Mars — or you want to go really, really fast. People like Elon Musk are focused on the former. We’ve built a team that’s obsessed with the latter.” So what’s the holdup? For some, it’s mostly politics. In a new paper for the Mercatus Center, titled “Make America Boom Again,” policy analysts Eli Dourado and Samuel Hammond make the case that outdated regulations are hindering innovation in air travel. Since 1973, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned civilian aircraft from flying faster than sound over land, to avoid the house-rattling sonic booms that the Concorde use to make. Yet recent technological advances have enabled supersonic designs that don’t create loud booms. So why not replace the FAA’s blanket ban with a simple noise standard, and let supersonic travel flourish? Yet there are also skeptics who argue that regulations aren’t the only thing holding back our supersonic future. In practice, faster air travel isn’t always worth it, and airlines have excellent reasons for preferring those slow, boring planes — from fuel efficiency to airport noise to concerns about climate change. “I wish them all the best!” says longtime aviation consultant Robert W. Mann Jr. of the push for supersonic flight. “But it’s still not clear that there will be a market for this.” That is to say, there are two tricky questions to explore here: Can we actually bring back supersonic flight? And even if we can — should we? The Concorde, revisited: Why early attempts at supersonic flight failed Anyone who wants to build a supersonic plane today first has to grapple with the tragic failure of the Concorde jet, a joint venture between Britain and France that began carrying passengers in 1976. The Concorde was a technical marvel, flying at at Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound, or 1,512 mph) to go from New York to London in just 3.5 hours, instead of the usual seven or eight. But it suffered its share of economic woes, and British Airways finally retired the jet in 2003: The Concorde’s demise is a complicated tale, but it suffered from two mortal flaws. First, it was a horrendous fuel-guzzler and expensive to operate. Under the laws of physics, the air resistance or drag that a given object faces in flight increases rapidly as you approach Mach 1. So a plane flying supersonic requires a lot more energy than one flying below the speed of sound. The Concorde’s designers tried to reduce drag by giving their plane a sleek body and short, slender delta wings. Even so, the Concorde required staggering amounts of fuel, burning roughly eight times as much oil per passenger mile for a trans-Atlantic trip as a modern-day 777. That made tickets forbiddingly expensive: $10,000 or more for a New York–London round trip. As oil prices rose, British Airways and Air France (which operated the jets) struggled to consistently fill the jets’ 100-125 seats. Bad for profits. A second problem, meanwhile, is that whenever the Concorde traveled faster than the speed of sound — about 767 miles per hour — it created noisy sonic booms in its wake. To put it simply, the air in front of the Concorde couldn’t get out of its way fast enough, so it bunched up into large shock waves in a cone trailing the plane. Wherever those shock waves reached the ground below, they’d be heard as a loud “BANG, BANG” that could rattle windows, shake structures, and startle people. A sonic boom is a cone-shaped shock wave produced by supersonic aircraft, heard the entire length of its flight path. Image from the US Air Force pamphlet “The Sonic Boom” (n.d.), modified by David Suisman. (Suisman, 2015) Opposition quickly mounted, and in 1973 the FAA banned civilian aircraft from traveling at supersonic speeds over the United States. The Concorde could only exceed Mach 1 over water, limiting its market. British Airways and Air France mainly flew the Concorde out of New York and Washington DC to London and Paris, though there were a number of other international routes over the years.* After the Concorde went bust, airlines shied away from supersonic flight. The extra speed didn’t seem to justify the hassle. At least, until recently. How new technology could make supersonic flight viable again Over the past decade, a number of aerospace engineers and entrepreneurs have been revisiting the Concorde’s demise. And some of them have walked away thinking that supersonic flight could work today — with just a few important (if difficult) tweaks. A few years ago, Blake Scholl, a former coder and longtime amateur pilot, was messing around with spreadsheet models and realized that a number of recent advances in aerodynamics and engine technology could, in theory, allow engineers to build a plane that was far more fuel-efficient than the Concorde. “If you could do that, you could have a plane that was competitive with existing business travel,” he says. “I started running these numbers by various experts and realized it wasn’t just science fiction.” In 2014, Scholl founded Boom, an aviation company based in Denver, Colorado. He has since assembled a team that includes accomplished former NASA, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin engineers to design a working successor to the Concorde. Artist’s conception of what Boom’s new supersonic plane might look like. (Boom) They’re not alone. Back in 2002, a group of investors led by Robert Bass formed a company called Aerion that aimed to harness innovative new drag-reducing technology to create a much more efficient supersonic business jet. Aerion is pretty far along in this task: In 2014, the company announced a partnership with aerospace giant Airbus to build and certify a supersonic craft within the decade. (Gulfstream, an established jet manufacturer, is also working with NASA on its own designs for supersonic flight.) The race is on. So what makes these companies think they can do better than the Concorde’s designers and build a vastly more fuel-efficient plane? In interviews, Boom and Aerion pointed to three broad technical advances that make this all seem feasible: First, modern-day computer modeling makes exploring new aircraft designs far easier than it was in the 1960s. If the Concorde’s designers wanted to test a new shape to see how it affected drag, they had to build a scale model and put it through large wind tunnels — a clumsy process that could take months. Nowadays, genetic algorithms can explore and tweak new shapes much more quickly and effectively. Newer composite materials, like carbon fiber, allow aircraft designers to pursue shapes and contours that weren’t possible for the Concorde’s designers, who worked with aluminum. (These materials can also better deal with the serious heat that builds up on the leading edge of the plane’s wing at speeds above Mach 2.) Today’s jet engines are far more efficient than they were in the Concorde’s heyday. “The breakthrough will be in the sum of those parts, not any one invention,” Scholl says. Put those three factors together, and he thinks Boom can build a plane that goes at top speeds of Mach 2.2 while being 30 percent more fuel-efficient than the Concorde. It will still create sonic booms, though quieter than the Concorde’s. The proof, of course, will be in the testing. Boom plans to publicly unveil its design for a supersonic plane in the near future. The company will then team up with Virgin Galactic to build and test a prototype at Edwards Air Base in California by the end of 2017. The hope, Scholl says, is to have a working plane in service by “the early 2020s.” Aerion, meanwhile, is pursuing a different design that harnesses supersonic natural laminar flow, a concept it developed (and tested with NASA) to reduce the turbulent airflow around wings and reduce drag. Aerion will work with Airbus on the engineering and is in the process of selecting suppliers to manufacture the engines. The plan, says spokesperson Jeff Miller, is to get the plane into service by 2021: (Aerion) Assuming these planes work, the next challenge will be finding a market. Scholl’s goal is to introduce a plane that will cost just $5,000 to fly round-trip between, say, New York and London. At that price, his market research suggests, there will be enough business travelers willing to pay a premium for speed that he can fill small 45-seat jets. (As part of their deal, Virgin has an option to buy 10 of Boom’s planes.) Consider the advantages: A flight between San Francisco and Tokyo might take just four hours instead of 11. A flight between New York and London, three instead of eight. “You could leave early in the morning from New York, have afternoon meetings in London, and be back home in time for dinner,” Scholl notes. Still, it’s far from clear that Boom and Aerion can succeed in luring enough passengers to turn a profit. For one, notes Mann, the aviation consultant, their planes will still be less fuel-efficient than conventional planes, which means they could be more vulnerable to sharp swings in oil prices. Plus, there are market risks. The most profitable Concorde route lay between the great financial centers of New York and London. But what happens if, say, Brexit ends up shrinking the size of London’s banking industry? “Obviously we’ll have to see,” says Mann. “But those are just examples of the sort of external shocks that could impinge on the practicality of supersonic travel.” Boom and Aerion remain optimistic. The broader hope is that if supersonic flight gains a foothold with business travelers, costs will eventually come down as technology improves. Scholl’s ultimate goal is to make supersonic flight affordable to everyone. “It’s the same thing that Tesla did,” he says. “They started with the luxury Roadster and are now focused on mass-market cars.” Because Boom and Aerion’s planes would only fly supersonic over water at the start, they could coexist with the FAA’s current ban on overland travel (although both companies could face regulatory hurdles around the noise their planes will make on takeoff and landing; more on that below). That said, oceanic flights are still a relatively limited market. For supersonic travel to truly conquer the entire world, someone would have to take the next step and develop a plane that doesn’t produce terrifying sonic booms over land. And that’s where NASA comes in. The next big challenge: silencing sonic booms to allow overland flights Ever since the 1970s, NASA has been wrestling with the math around the pressure waves that create aircraft sonic booms, trying to figure out how to reduce them. And, over the past decade, its engineers think they’ve finally cracked the problem. “We’re at the point where we think we can design a quiet supersonic airplane,” says Peter Coen, the commercial supersonic technology project manager at NASA’s Langley Research Center. His team is currently working with Lockheed Martin on a $20 million project to design a prototype X-plane with much, much softer booms. The science of what Coen’s team is doing gets a bit complicated (see this report for the gritty details), but here’s a very basic explanation. When a plane like the Concorde travels at supersonic speed, it creates a bunch of invisible shock waves, sharp pressure disturbances emanating from all the objects that stick out of the plane — the nose, the windshield, the wings, the tail. They’re shaped like this: Although shock waves aren’t usually visible to the naked eye, NASA used schlieren imagery to see the disturbances made by a USAF Test Pilot School T-38C aircraft flying at supersonic speeds over the Mojave Desert. (NASA) These shock waves are all different strengths, and they as they travel through the air, they coalesce into just two powerful waves — a strong positive pressure wave at the nose and a strong negative pressure wave at the tail. This “N-wave” configuration is highly stable and doesn’t decay much as it travels toward the ground. When this wave hits people below, our ears register it as two noisy bangs from each of the two sharp swings in pressure. “So the trick,” Coen says, “is to keep those shock waves from coalescing into a N-shaped signal.” In theory, a plane with a different shape would create shock waves of more uniform strength that coalesce more gradually as they move through the air. If done successfully, people on the ground would experience a gentle rise in pressure when the wave hits rather than two sharp pressure changes. Recent experiments have been promising. The Concorde created booms that were perceived to be as loud as 135 decibels on the ground — about as loud as the sound a jet engine makes from 100 feet away. But by experimenting with different shapes, NASA has developed aircraft models that, in wind-tunnel tests, create booms as soft as 79 perceived decibels, roughly comparable to a car passing 10 feet away. Eventually, NASA would like to get that down that to 70 decibels. The goal is to design an actual plane using these concepts. Here is an artist’s conception of what the new X-plane might look like. Artist’s conception of a low boom flight demonstration quiet supersonic transport (QueSST) X-plane design. (NASA/Lockheed Martin) NASA will then plan to build a one-third-scale prototype and conduct the first test flight in 2020.* The idea is that they’ll gather data on what sorts of sonic booms the planes actually make, and then the FAA can use that data in deciding whether it makes sense to replace the blanket ban on overland supersonic travel with a noise standard — saying, for example, that supersonic flight is acceptable overland so long as the booms are below a certain threshold. (If that actually happened, Gulfstream says planes with quiet booms might be a possibility by 2025 or 2030 or so.) But changing those rules will require wading into the murky world of politics — which is never easy. The US government could still put the kibosh on supersonic flight In theory, the FAA is open to the idea of revising its blanket ban on supersonic flight over land. In 2011, an FAA official gave a public presentation explaining that research on silencing sonic booms has progressed far enough that it may be time to consider a noise standard. But the FAA is moving very slowly on revamping the rules — in part because it’s focused on other challenges, like overhauling the nation’s air traffic control system. The agency is also waiting for NASA and other companies to demonstrate their quiet-boom technology before crafting fresh regulations. In their paper for the Mercatus Center, Dourado and Hammond argue that the FAA’s current approach is precisely backward. It would be much better for the agency to set guidelines ahead of time on what type of overland sonic booms would be acceptable — so that companies can have some certainty and know what to aim for in developing new designs. “Right now, the FAA is saying we’ll accept supersonic when we hear what’s acceptable,” says Hammond. “We’re trying to point out the absurdity in that.” Even if the boom issue gets sorted out, however, there’s still another hurdle for supersonic planes: takeoff and landing. While all supersonic planes would fly at less-than-supersonic (or “subsonic”) speeds around airports, they’d still make a fair bit of noise on takeoff and landing. And that’s where things get a little tricky. Over the years, the FAA has developed strict standards for the noise that airplanes can make around airports. Aircraft manufacturers have responded to these rules, in part, by doing things like building high-bypass engines with large-diameter fans that propel air out of the engine more slowly and hence reduce the noise from the exhaust. The trade-off with these high-bypass engines is that they’re not as fuel-efficient at takeoff and the large fans create more drag while the plane’s in the air. That’s not a huge deal for normal aircraft, but it could be ruinous for supersonic jets. If the FAA requires supersonic jets to adhere to the newest, strictest noise standards coming into effect by 2018 (known as Stage 5 standards), those jets will take a major fuel efficiency hit. By contrast, if the FAA merely asked supersonic aircraft to adhere to the standards that were in place back in 2006 (known as Stage 3 standards), Scholl estimates, that would reduce supersonic ticket costs by some 15 percent. Dourado and Hammond argue that the FAA should allow looser airport noise standards for supersonic jets in the very beginning, at least, to allow the technology to get to market. Engineers can then work on making them quieter. The companies making the supersonic planes agree. “The physics of supersonic aircraft are just so different, so saying you need to meet the standards of subsonic regulations could put a damper on development,” says Aerion’s Miller. “We’re hoping to reach a compromise with the FAA on this, since we’re talking about a new industry that could be beneficial.” This could prove a contentious subject, however. The politics around airport noise can be extremely dicey (in separate research, Dourado and Raymond Russell have found that most airport noise complaints to the FAA come from just a small handful of people). While a strict airport noise rule wouldn’t necessarily kill supersonic flight, it could increase prices and dampen the market, particularly in the early days. The deeper question: Do we really want supersonic flight? Good old Concorde. Photo by Ian Waldie/Getty Images The noise issue raises a bigger philosophical question around supersonic flight: How much do we really value speed, anyway? After all, the structure of our current aviation industry is the result of a series of compromises around competing values. And over the past 30 years, airlines have shown that there are a lot of other things we value more than simply going really, really fast. Back in the 1970s, Mann explains, the industry realized that if it wanted to keep growing, it needed to be a good neighbor. That meant replacing their existing fleet of loud and dirty airplanes with much quieter models — even if it meant some trade-offs in terms of performance. Similarly, ever since the oil shocks of that decade, the industry has made a point of valuing fuel efficiency over raw speed. “The optimal cruise speed has basically declined over the years,” Mann says. “Above about Mach 0.8, you pay so much for that speed in terms of fuel.” Today, a flight from New York to Denver or from DC to Miami actually takes longer than it did in the 1970s — because airlines have realized that the fuel savings are worth the delay. Going forward, there’s another important value to weigh on the scale: climate change. Aviation is already the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, and the world’s airlines just agreed to a sweeping deal under the International Civil Aviation Organization to offset the growth of their emissions starting in 2020. Conventional aircraft manufacturers have worked hard to reduce fuel burn by 45 percent since 1968, and companies like Boeing and Airbus are now pushing to cut fuel use even further, through the use of lighter materials and novel engine designs. Still, this remains one of the toughest sectors to decarbonize. And new supersonic jets that burn fuel at higher rates than conventional planes seem to go in precisely the opposite direction — even if they do save travelers time. True, a few supersonic business jets flying around wouldn’t have a major impact on emissions. But if cheap supersonic flight became ubiquitous, the global warming impact could be staggering (particularly if the planes fly at higher altitudes, due to the contrail effect). With the world already struggling to avoid dangerously large temperature increases, a new fuel-inefficient plane seems like a luxury the planet can ill afford. When I asked NASA’s Coen about the climate consequences of a world filled with supersonic jets, he agreed that it was a real concern. But he also pointed out that there might be ways to square these different values. Future caps on aviation emissions could, for instance, spur supersonic jets to adopt low-carbon biofuels. (Or there’s another way this could all go: As Mann pointed out, it’s possible that stricter carbon caps could simply make supersonic flight unviable.) It’s still too early to say how these issues will play out, but it’s a good reminder that our slow, boring planes have quite a few things going for them. Even so, at the end of the day, the prospect of faster flight will remain forever tantalizing. The reduction in travel times has been one of the great technological breakthroughs of the past 200 years. This isn’t merely convenient; in some ways, it’s been the very marker of progress. Humans have long been obsessed with breaking new barriers, with going faster and faster. Even if on a purely romantic level, it would be a shame if we’re currently stuck going about as fast as we’ll ever go. —— * Correction: I originally wrote that NASA and Lockheed Martin are working together to build a prototype of a quiet supersonic plane. That’s not quite accurate. Lockheed Martin has a contract to design a plane. But NASA hasn’t yet selected a company to actually build the prototype.

Self-driving vehicles could disrupt the economy by replacing human drivers in the future. (Reuters) Global trade and investment have been great engines of progress for much of the world.  Over the past two decades, poorer countries reduced the gap between themselves and their richer counterparts for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, in no small part because of the opportunities opened by global trade. Technology has the same transformative potential in industries as varied as energy, health care, transportation and education. New inventions that are imminent or already here could transform the lives of billions of people for the better. Yet, as we see in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, and as we have seen in Europe and elsewhere, rapid change has a dark side. If too many people are unable to adapt quickly and successfully to these changes, they will push back – blaming trade or immigrants or the elites – and demand a reversion to a simpler time. The task of governments is to help people manage these transformations so that they benefit many and do as little harm as possible.  In the United States, governments mostly failed at that task during the era of globalization; if the full benefits of the coming technologies are to be enjoyed, governments will have to do much better this time around. The competitive pressures create by globalization should have been no surprise.  About 45 years ago, President Richard Nixon’s top international economic adviser, Pete Peterson, warned him that rising competition from Japan and Germany, with much more on the way, “poses adjustment policy which simply cannot be ignored.” Americans have unquestionably gained by the lower prices and higher quality that import competition enabled.  Apple iPhones and the latest Boeing jets are the result of the collective input of tens of thousands of collaborators in dozens of countries around the world.  But many lost well-paid manufacturing jobs to import competition or outsourcing, and the U.S. government has made little effort to mitigate those costs, even in worker retraining. [‘What Trump represents isn’t crazy and it’s not going away.’ Peter Thiel defends support for Donald Trump.] President John F. Kennedy promised in 1962 that the government would help American workers who lost out to trade competition as the United States lowered its barriers to imports.  “When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by the competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact,” he said.  But today, the United States spends a smaller proportion of its wealth on worker retraining than any of the other 34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development except for Mexico and Chile. Too often, the attitude of the U.S. government has been deeply irresponsible, assuming that markets would simply sort everything out for the best.  In the long run, everybody may end up with work and income, but in the short run, as Peterson told Nixon, the failure to help Americans adapt to the new reality will “leave long periods when the transition is painful beyond endurance.” With technology change, too, we know well in advance exactly what is coming.  Driverless technology, for example, will soon become the standard in the trucking industry.  Driverless trucks can run 24 hours a day and won’t demand overtime pay.  There are 3.5 million truck drivers in the United States, and an additional 5.5 million jobs in related industries – roughly one in every 15 American workers.  They could perhaps go to work for UPS or deliver pizzas, but many of those delivery jobs will be lost to drones. Personal-care robots will increasingly replace home health-care aides, and self-checkout machines are already replacing retail-store clerks; these are jobs that filled some of the gap left by the disappearance of manufacturing jobs to global competition, but they, too, will soon be under siege.  Automation is even hitting law and education, two sectors long thought immune to technological substitution. [Google and Facebook contribute zero economic value. That’s a big problem for trade.] These vulnerabilities necessitate something that too often was absent in the era of globalization: good public policies.  Artificial intelligence will transform teaching, for example, but without access to the highest-speed broadband, students in poor and rural areas will fall further behind their urban counterparts.  And unless we strengthen social safety nets and retraining schemes, there will be far too many losers in the labor market.  There is no way to avoid the huge impact that technology will have on employment; we have to prepare for it and help those whose skills it antiquates. Much more even than globalization, technology is going to create upheaval and destroy industries and jobs.  This can be for the better, helping us create new and more interesting jobs or freeing up time for leisure and artistic pursuits.  But unless we find ways to share the prosperity and help Americans adapt to the coming changes, many could be left worse off than they are.  And, as we have seen this year, that is a recipe for an angry backlash—and political upheaval.

Read the Sun full report: “They reveal a pervy airman in stockings taking lurid selfies of his aroused manhood. One image shows a leg sprawled over the dashboard while the plane appears to be on autopilot and with the co-pilot’s seat empty.

A further sordid snap shows the man with his genitals exposed in a cabin’s toilet. Other images show a p*rnographic magazine spread on the controls and explicit playing cards scattered around the cockpit. Serial numbers on the control panel suggest the pictures were taken aboard at least two separate British Airways planes. The airline confirmed yesterday it was probing the images — and whether they were taken feet from passengers mid-flight. BA said: “We are taking these allegations extremely seriously.” Twice-married dad Glover — a BA Captain since 1990 — is thought to have denied to bosses the pictures are of him. But he is likely to be permanently grounded if they disagree. A senior airline source said investigators would examine whether the images could have been shot in a flight simulator. One of the serial numbers visible — GYMMB — is used on BA’s simulators. But it is also registered to a twin-engine Boeing. The other — GVIIL — is also one of the 777 fleet used by BA. Airline expert Chris Yates said yesterday: “This is very dangerous if the plane is in mid-flight. “If you are flying, you can fly into serious turbulence.” An Established Or Up And Coming Artist Or Actor/Actress?

November 16, 2016 1205 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:171489 Publish Date: Thu, 03 Nov 2016 13:24:17 GMT Service: Iran China, Russia to invest up to $20bn in long-haul jet: report China and Russia have agreed on a joint venture to build a long-haul wide-bodied jet, competing with Boeing and Airbus which wield total control over the jumbo jet industry. Beijing and Moscow will invest "up to $20 billion" to jointly make a jumbo jet, media reports said on Thursday. “Each side will contribute half,” Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) president Yury Slyusar said, quoted by China's Global Times newspaper. Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and UAC agreed to build the plane in June when Russian President Vladimir Putin met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing. COMAC and UAC executives presented a mock-up of the jet for the first time in public at a ceremony during Airshow China in Zhuhai, Guangzhou Province on Wednesday. COMAC said the joint venture, to be set up in Shanghai this year, aims to build a 280-seat wide-body jet with a range of 12,000 kilometers to be on a par with Boeing's 787 and the Airbus A350. According to the companies' websites, the price of a 290-seat Boeing 787 is $264.6 million and a 280-seat Airbus A350 is $272.4 million. Slyusar said their plane will be approximately 10 percent cheaper than those of the rivals. "COMAC has outstanding technology and designs and we will not only cooperate in technology but also in intellectual property." COMAC said their plane will make its first flight in seven years and customer delivery will begin three years later. Building commercial aircraft requires advanced technology. COMAC developed its single-aisle jet, the C919, last year and said it had received 570 orders from 23 customers.  The firm's regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ21, flew its first commercial flight in June. Russia, however, is more advanced in this field and UAC enjoys the Sukhoi Superjet 100 in its report card. "A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge," Guo told reporters. "China and Russia each have their own advantages." Beijing is looking to build up its domestic aerospace industry, with the sector among those highlighted in its "Made in China 2025" plan. China is expected to become the world's largest aviation market, with its travelers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. Airbus estimates China will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion in the next two decades, with Boeing's forecast even more optimistic at more than $1 trillion.     KeyWords China Russia long-haul jet   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran confiscates 2 tonnes of explosives from Daesh terrorists Iran, China must boost cooperation in fight on terrorism: Rouhani Syria holds pacesetter Iran in wetland Everton joins race for Iran’s Azmoun Iran defeated by Kazakhstan in Asian water polo championship Iran, absent from kabaddi World Cup final Iranian teams capture Asian youth, junior weightlifting titles French MP: Iran’s role in fight against terrorism crucial Iran: Killing of Muslims in Nigeria worrisome Rouhani: Iran, China must boost anti-terror fight Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0811 sec

Photograph: Alamy Rajeev Syal Thursday 3 November 2016 06.09 EDT Last modified on Thursday 3 November 2016 08.28 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger A £285m airport built on a remote South Atlantic island with UK government cash will require “an open chequebook” if it is to ever welcome commercial airlines as planned, a select committee hearing has been told. Plans to build a clifftop runway on St Helena were approved in 2010 by then ministers Andrew Mitchell and William Hague, making it the single largest investment made in an overseas territory. But its inauguration ceremony for commercial flights was suspended indefinitely in May after tests showed that planes could be blown off course. St Helena airport costing £285m of UK money is delayed over safety concerns Read more On Wednesday, civil servants from the Department for International Development (DfID) were unable to tell the public accounts committee why they had not tested for wind shear – a sudden powerful change in wind direction that can destabilise large aircraft – before the airport was built. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said more public money would have to be spent if the airport was to ever function for the island’s 4,000 inhabitants. One of the more drastic options that has been considered and rejected by officials was to blow the top off two mountains adjoining the airfield, the committee was told. The more likely option to make the airport useable would be to allow smaller planes to fly to the island instead of the planned Boeing 737s. Hillier said civil servants had already spent money allocated to them to make the airport useable. “Given that there is a UK commitment to the Saints [inhabitants of St Helena] and they are UK citizens, given that it is your responsibility and DfID’s to make that happen, and given that there is an airport there, it does seem that there is frankly an open chequebook because you have spent all that good money and you aren’t going to get anything for it,” she said. Mark Lowcock, DfID’s permanent secretary, told the committee repeatedly that he would prefer not to say who might be to blame for failing to discover the strong winds at the airport because of an ongoing internal review. He said officials were in talks with carriers about launching flights, but it would involve much smaller planes than previously envisaged. Stephen Phillips, a Conservative committee member, pointed out to Lowcock that in the 19th century the anthropologist Charles Darwin in his travel journal The Voyage of the Beagle referred to the wind shear on St Helena. “Darwin wrote this: ‘The only inconveniences I experienced on my walks [on St Helena] were from the impetuous winds. One day I noticed a curious circumstance: standing on the edge of a plain, terminated by a great cliff of about a thousand feet in depth, I saw at the distance of a few yards right to windward, some tern, struggling against a very strong breeze, whilst, where I stood, the air was quite calm.’ “If Charles Darwin, as he does in this passage, gives a very good example of wind shear in St Helena in 1836, how have we got a position where DfID commissioned a £285.5m airport, paid for by the British taxpayer, without appreciating the danger of wind shear?” Lowcock replied: “That is a very good question, and one I will attempt to answer in my review.” Phillips also raised the possible option, mentioned in previous media reports, of blowing up the tops of two mountains. “I have the greatest respect for the civil service but I did not realise that it could move mountains,” he said. Lowcock replied: “It is not my plan currently to spend a lot of money exploring that option. My plan is to put in place a safe air service.” Caroline Flint, the former Labour minister, asked Lowcock if he was aware that the businessman and former Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft had argued in favour of the airport weeks before it was approved by ministers. Lowcock replied that he had not been approached by Ashcroft. Ministers are resisting offering any compensation to those who made investments on the basis that up to 30,000 tourists would fly to visit the remote island. At present, it takes a five-day trip by ship to reach St Helena from southern Africa. One airline, Atlantic Star, on Wednesday urged the government to discuss a rapid introduction of “a much-needed air service” in and out of St Helena. Its proposal would involve using a specialist Avro RJ100 jet, with the airline able to begin flights next spring. The airline ran a test flight to St Helena on 21 October. The island, which is about 1,200 miles west of Angola, was where Napoleon was exiled in 1815 after his defeat at Waterloo. He died there in 1821.

Executives of the state-owned Comac have unveiled plans to make a twin-aisle jet that can fly as far as 12,000 kilometres – about the distance between Beijing and New York. The company is forming a joint venture with Russia’s United Aircraft to research on and manufacture the aircraft. The announcement at a biennial airshow in southern Zhuhai city marks the first time China has given details of the widebody aircraft since the planned Russian partnership was flagged two years ago and comes amid delays to the maiden flight of the C919. The new plane would be able to seat 280 people, posing a direct challenge to jetliners from Boeing and Airbus such as their current B777, B787, A330 and A350 models. Comac is targeting the maiden flight of the new aircraft to take place about seven years from now, and the first delivery three years after that. An assembly line will be set up in Shanghai, with an eye to exporting the plane to other markets in the future, said Guo Bozhi, an assistant president at Comac who is in charge of the widebody-jet project. "Developing an aircraft is an arduous journey and we have to overcome a lot of technical difficulties," Mr Guo said. But the timeframe "is a definite target", he said. He declined to provide financial figures on the joint venture and development of the twin-engine plane. Comac said this week that China Eastern Airlines will be the first carrier to take delivery of the locally made C919, a day after Wu Guanghui, Comac’s chief designer, said the narrowbody jet’s test flight would take place later this year or in early 2017.

This week, a group of US senators led by Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), ranking member of the US Senate committee of finance overseeing trade, urged US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to review and reject Zhongwang’s takeover plan on national security grounds, Bloomberg reported, citing a letter signed by Wyden and his 11 colleagues. “Chinese entities, including state-owned or state-controlled enterprises, may have relationships with China’s military, compounding the risk that U.S. technologies will fall into the wrong hands,” said the letter. Aleris’ high-strength alloys manufacturing technology enabled by advanced modelling techniques, and its design of light armour material with enhanced ballistic performance are critical to long term US economic and national security interests, the letter said. The opposition is not based on facts, said Amanda Xu, spokeswoman of Zhongwang USA. “Contrary to what was stated in the senators’ letter, Zhongwang USA and the Zhongwang group of companies are neither state-owned nor state-controlled,” Xu told the South China Morning Post in a phone interview. “Zhongwang is a fully market driven company without any affiliation to any government.” Aleris, which supplies rolled aluminium sheets to Boeing, Airbus and German carmaker Audi, said it doesn’t make products that have any defence applications. “Our facilities in the US produce aluminium [products] for car and truck exteriors, gutters and roofing material,” the Ohio-based company said in a statement. “Less than 1 per cent of our sales go into defence applications, and none of those goods are produced in the US. “The technology to produce aluminium plate, which is used in some military applications, is standard production technology widely used in the aluminium industry,” Aleris said. Zhongwang, based in Liaoning province, has not supplied any flat rolled aluminium sheets to China’s military, since its US$4.7 billion Tianjin plant will only be able to enter commercial production next year, spokeswoman Xu said. The company’s chairman Liu Zhongtian also owns Zhongwang USA. The company is eyeing Aleris’ technology and production capacity to produce aluminium sheets that can used in the automotive industry, as well as supply the aircraft manufacturing industry. China is the world’s largest vehicle market, and is projected to be the fastest growing major market for new aircraft. In Tianjin, Toyota has a plant that makes Vios compact cars, while Airbus assembles its A320 single-aisle aircraft in the city. Andrew Driscoll, head of resources research at CLSA, said he is not aware of cases where aluminium products caused security concern arising from sales to the military, since it is used in a wide range of industries. Zhongwang isn’t the first Chinese acquirer to face opposition by US politicians. This comes as China overtook the US in outbound mergers and acquisitions during the first nine months of 2016, according to data by Dealogic. China overtakes US as world’s largest assets acquirer “Much of this has to do with prejudice, unjustified worries, protectionism and politicking,” said Kevin Guo, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Guotai Junan Securities, who has a “Buy” recommendation on the company’s Hong Kong-traded stock. Aleris, which was founded in 2004 through a merger of Commonwealth Industries Inc and IMCO Recycling Inc., operates 40 production facilities around the world, making extruded aluminium products, recycling aluminium and high specification aluminium products. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009 and was taken over in 2010 by a group of private equity funds including Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Sankaty Advisors. “The change in shareholding from a private equity based ownership to a long-term industry investor will bring in additional resources and capital to Aleris and help create new jobs,” Zhongwang’s spokeswoman Xu said. After the proposed takeover, Aleris will continue to operate as an independent company under the same management in the forseeable future, and any plan to transfer technology to China Zhongwang will only be a consideration for the long term, she said. Zhongwang USA has submitted a filing to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) on an “entirely voluntarily” basis, to address any regulatory concerns about the takeover, she added.

PHOTO | FILE  In Summary KQ says the losses arise from leasing out aircraft at rentals lower than that charged by the primary lessors. Advertisement By VICTOR JUMA Kenya Airways is set to incur an additional Sh3 billion accounting loss from new aircraft sub-leasing contracts, representing the deficit between what it is earning on the deals and its payments to the primary lessors. The national carrier disclosed the new onerous leases in its financial statements for the half-year ended September. These follow the leasing of five Boeing airplanes to Oman Air and Turkish Airlines last year in a deal that left the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm with a Sh4 billion accounting loss in the year ended March. KQ, as the airline is known by its international code, says the losses arise from leasing out aircraft at rentals lower than that charged by the primary lessors. The leases are part of the company’s efforts to cut costs at a time when slow revenue growth and mounting liabilities have kept it in the loss territory. The additional sub-leasing of aircraft involves the same carriers, with Oman Air taking two B787-8s and Turkish Airlines taking three B777-300ERs. This brings the total number of aircraft seconded to the Muscat-based carrier to four while those sent to the Istanbul-based airline rises to six. The Sh3 billion loss on the new contracts is split into long-term leases that will generate a Sh2.07 billion deficit and short-term leases whose loss stands at Sh980 million. Part of the losses has been realised, with others to filter through over the coming years as the contracts roll on over the medium term. The loss-making contracts represent the heavy cost to shareholders of unwinding Project Mawingu. READ: KQ half-year loss shrinks to Sh4.8bn on deep cost cuts KQ signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have otherwise incurred from cancelling the contracts at a time when it could not fly the planes profitably itself. The airline has said the contracts would reduce the airline’s fleet costs by an equivalent of Sh8.4 billion annually, indicating that sub-leasing at a loss is a lesser evil compared with maintaining a bloated fleet. Sub-leasing the aircraft, non-renewal of other leases and sale of several airplanes saw KQ’s fleet drop to 47 units in the year ended March, compared with 52 units the year before. The airline plans to further scale back its capacity in the current financial year to cut costs. The company says it is keen on reducing the number of empty seats on long-haul flights, with the capacity reduction also being accompanied by termination of some routes and a decrease in the frequency of flights on others. email print In the headlines Auditor stands by Sh5bn Afya House dossier Official tells Senate team he is a patriotic Kenyan who is never cowed by threats.

F-35B jets undergo testing on U.S. Navy amphibious assault ship by Geoff Ziezulewicz Washington (UPI) Nov 1, 2016 Lockheed receives $536 million F-22 contract modification Washington (UPI) Nov 1, 2016 - Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. has been awarded a $536 million U.S. Air Force contract modification for work on the F-22 Raptor jet. The deal will cover sustainment services for the aircraft. Work will be performed in Texas and has an estimated completion date of December 2017. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is the contracting entity. The Raptor is the service's newest fighter and performs air-to-air and air-to-ground missions while providing a combination of stealth, super-cruise, maneuverability and integrated avionics. In its air-to-air configuration, the Raptor carries six AIM-120 missiles and two AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. When equipped for air-to-ground operations, it can carry two 1,000-pound GBU-32 joint direct attack munitions, as well as two AIM-120s and two AIM-9s. Seven F-35B Lightning II jets are scheduled to conduct developmental and operational testing aboard the USS America amphibious assault ship, the sea service said Monday. Two jets are slated for third-phase developmental testing, while five will undergo operational testing, the Navy said in a statement. That third phase will evaluate the jet's short take-off vertical landing operations in a high-sea state, shipboard landings and night operations. Operational testing will involve the simulation of extensive maintenance on a ship. America is the first ship of its class that incorporates design elements specifically to accommodate the fifth-generation jet. Among its enhanced aviation capabilities, the ship includes an enlarged hangar deck, realigned and expanded aviation maintenance facilities, increased stowage and more fuel capacity. It can accommodate the Lightning II, U.S. Marine Corps Ospreys and various helicopters. Boeing gets $80 million option for Apache helicopter work Washington (UPI) Nov 1, 2016 - Boeing has received an $80 million U.S. Army contract modification to execute a year two option for work on Apache helicopters. The deal will cover the continuation of Apache Helicopter performance-based logistics for D-unique, D/E common and E-unique components, supplies and services. Work will be performed in Arizona and has an estimated completion date of October 2017. The Army Contracting Command is the contracting entity. The Apache is an advanced multirole combat helicopter manufactured by Boeing. Boeing has delivered more than 2,200 of the helicopters to global customers. The first of the helicopters was delivered to the U.S. Army in 1984, with international customers now including Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, The Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.

Oregon's Ron Wyden and 11 other senators signed a letter addressed to the Treasury Department asking for the $2.3 billion acquisition announced in August to be reviewed and rejected on national security grounds, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg. Wyden spokesman Keith Chu confirmed the letter's authenticity. Should the Democrats win back control of the Senate, Wyden would likely steer the subcommittee's agenda. Liu's Zhongwang USA plans to buy closely held Aleris for $1.11 billion in cash and $1.22 billion in debt, giving one of Asia's biggest makers of extruded-aluminum products greater access to American and European technology, as well as buyers that include aerospace manufacturers like Boeing and automakers such as Audi. "Chinese entities, including state-owned or state-controlled enterprises, may have relationships with China's military, compounding the risk that U.S. technologies will fall into the wrong hands," the letter, addressed to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, said. "Aleris' R&D and technology are critical to current and long-term U.S. economic and national security interests given Aleris' use of advanced research and modeling techniques, development of high-strength alloys, and design of light armor material with increased ballistic performance," they wrote. Other signatories include Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. When the deal was announced in August, Aleris Chief Executive Officer Sean Stack said in an interview that the company didn't anticipate any regulatory hurdles. "We don't check any of those boxes in terms of the criteria" for a formal inquiry from Treasury's foreign investment committee known as CFIUS, Stack said at the time. China Zhongwang Holdings could become the world's second-largest aluminum rolling company should the Aleris acquisition be approved by regulators, Austin, Texas-based Harbor Intelligence wrote in an Aug. 30 research note. Aleris would give Zhongwang a significant footprint in the North American and European flat-rolled products markets, Jorge Vazquez, the managing director of Harbor, said in the note. Zhongwang declined to comment on any CFIUS investigation, saying only that there will be no change to Aleris' brand, management or business strategy. Chinese takeovers have drawn attention from Capitol Hill recently, including China National Chemical Corp.'s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG. In September, a group of lawmakers, citing investment in the U.S. by China, urged the Government Accountability Office to review whether CFIUS's authority should be expanded and whether special consideration should be given to acquisitions from state-controlled Chinese buyers. CFIUS, whose members include officials from the Defense, State and Justice Departments, reviews acquisitions of U.S. businesses by foreign buyers. The panel scrutinizes deals for any risks to U.S. national security and can impose conditions on transactions or recommend the president block them. The aluminum industry has caught the attention of lawmakers in recent months amid rising concerns that overproduction in China will force U.S. smelters to shut more production, limiting domestic supply to manufacturers. Schumer joined a group of lawmakers last month pushing for a World Trade Organization case against alleged Chinese subsidies of its aluminum industry, while the U.S. industry upped its anti-China drumbeat at a hearing by the U.S. International Trade Commission probe in September. The U.S. is one of the the top recipients of Chinese capital, attracting more than $18 billion of foreign direct investment in the first half of 2016, according to Rhodium Group. That's a threefold increase from the same period last year. × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

A number of Jet Airways flights have got delayed in the recent past as the airline has failed to provide pilots due to paucity of the flight crew, they said. The Mumbai-headquartered full service carrier is second largest airline in terms of number of domestic operations after no-frills IndiGo. As part of the winter schedule, which is effective from late last month, Jet Airways plans to operate 3,010 flights per week while its subsidiary JetLite 507 flights per week. "Jet Airways is facing shortage of pilots for quite some time now. While the airline has been increasing the number of flights in its both winter and summer schedules each year, the number of pilots is not increasing in the same ratio, leading to shortage of flight crew," a source said. Jet Airways requires at least 200 more pilots to carry out its operations in a seamless manner, the source said, adding "shortage is more in narrow body, Boeing 737 fleet." The airline currently has around 1,200 pilots to operate its fleet of 117 aircraft comprising Boeing 777s, B737s, Airbus A330s and ATRs. Almost two-thirds of its fleet consists of B737s. Response to queries sent to Jet Airways in this regard was awaited. Significantly, as many as 18 per cent of Jet Airways flights from four metro airports -- Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru -- failed to either arrive or depart on time in September. A major chunk of its flights are from its two hubs - Mumbai and New Delhi. Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan had hit out at the airline after his flight to Chennai from Mumbai last week was allegedly delayed due to non-availability of flight crew. "Flying to Chennai. Baggage, check. Board flight on time, check. Seat belt fastened, check. Only thing we need now are our pilots!!...Well done Jet Airways!!! Entire plane boarded without any pilots on board. Still waiting and hoping...," he had said in a series of tweets over the nearly none-and-half- hour delay of his flight. For the last almost two years, India has been the fastest growing air traffic market in the world. In September, the domestic air passenger traffic registered a robust growth of about 23 per cent as compared the same period last year.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File PhotoMore By David Lawder WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Twelve U.S. senators urged on Wednesday that a national security review panel reject Chinese aluminum giant Zhongwang International Group Ltd's proposed $2.3 billion purchase of U.S. aluminum products maker Aleris Corp. The senators asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a letter to launch a review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States and "ultimately reject it" on grounds that it would damage the U.S. defense industrial base. "Zhongwang’s purchase of Aleris would directly undermine our national security, including by jeopardizing the U.S. manufacturing base for sensitive technologies in an industry already devastated by the effects of China’s market distorting policies, and creating serious risk that sensitive technologies and knowhow will be transferred to China, further imperiling U.S. defense interests," the senators wrote. The deal, announced just over two months ago, would give one of the world's largest makers of extruded aluminum products access to U.S. technology and customers, which include Boeing Co and U.S. and European automakers that are increasingly turning to aluminum. It comes as another Zhongwang subsidiary is embroiled in a dispute over U.S. import duties amid broader trade tensions between the U.S. aluminum industry and China. The U.S. Commerce Department is currently investigating China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd over allegations that it has been evading U.S. import duties on extruded products by shipping them through third countries. The letter to Lew was signed by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, where Aleris is based, and Democrats Ron Wyden, Charles Schumer, Bob Casey, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Gillibrand, Joe Donnelly, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley, Amy Klobuchar, Tammy Baldwin and Al Franken. They said the review committee needed to be cautious about the potential for sensitive research data to be transferred to China, including data with military applications such as advanced modeling techniques, high-strength alloys and the design of light armor material. "Despite the national security importance of our nation’s aluminum sector, the industry continues to be decimated by China’s market distorting policies that contribute to vast overcapacity," the senators wrote. "China’s overcapacity in aluminum has directly contributed to severe reductions in U.S. domestic production as smelters unable to compete have been forced to close. Each such closure further imperils our nation’s ability to ensure a reliable supply of strategic materials in times of crisis," they wrote. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter, adding that information filed with CFIUS by law cannot be disclosed to the public and that Treasury does not comment on specific CFIUS cases. Aleris said in a statement reacting to the letter that the company's U.S. facilities produce no defense-related products, and the technology for aluminum plate used in some defense products was widely used in the industry. "Our facilities in the U.S. produce aluminum for car and truck exteriors, gutters and roofing material," Aleris said. " Less than one percent of our sales go into defense applications, and none of those goods are produced in the U.S." A Zhongwang spokeswoman said in a statement that the CFIUS filing for the transaction is voluntary and that the company and its U.S. subsidiary have no connection with the Chinese government. She added that the transaction will bring in additional resources and capital to Aleris and there will be no changes to management, employees or business strategies.

"Despite the national security importance of our nation’s aluminum sector, the industry continues to be decimated by China’s market distorting policies that contribute to vast overcapacity," the senators wrote. "China’s overcapacity in aluminum has directly contributed to severe reductions in U.S. domestic production as smelters unable to compete have been forced to close. Each such closure further imperils our nation’s ability to ensure a reliable supply of strategic materials in times of crisis," they wrote. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on the letter, adding that information filed with CFIUS by law cannot be disclosed to the public and that Treasury does not comment on specific CFIUS cases. Aleris said in a statement reacting to the letter that the company's U.S. facilities produce no defense-related products, and the technology for aluminum plate used in some defense products was widely used in the industry. "Our facilities in the U.S. produce aluminum for car and truck exteriors, gutters and roofing material," Aleris said. " Less than one percent of our sales go into defense applications, and none of those goods are produced in the U.S." A Zhongwang spokeswoman said in a statement that the CFIUS filing for the transaction is voluntary and that the company and its U.S. subsidiary have no connection with the Chinese government. She added that the transaction will bring in additional resources and capital to Aleris and there will be no changes to management, employees or business strategies.

The senators asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a letter to launch a review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States and "ultimately reject it" on grounds that it would damage the U.S. defense industrial base. "Zhongwang's purchase of Aleris would directly undermine our national security, including by jeopardizing the U.S. manufacturing base for sensitive technologies in an industry already devastated by the effects of China's market distorting policies, and creating serious risk that sensitive technologies and knowhow will be transferred to China, further imperiling U.S. defense interests," the senators wrote. The deal, announced just over two months ago, would give one of the world's largest makers of extruded aluminum products access to U.S. technology and customers, which include Boeing Co and U.S. and European automakers that are increasingly turning to aluminum. It comes as another Zhongwang subsidiary is embroiled in a dispute over U.S. import duties amid broader trade tensions between the U.S. aluminum industry and China. The U.S. Commerce Department is currently investigating China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd over allegations that it has been evading U.S. import duties on extruded products by shipping them through third countries. The letter to Lew was signed by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, where Aleris is based, and Democrats Ron Wyden, Charles Schumer, Bob Casey, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Gillibrand, Joe Donnelly, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley, Amy Klobuchar, Tammy Baldwin and Al Franken. They said the review committee needed to be cautious about the potential for sensitive research data to be transferred to China, including data with military applications such as advanced modeling techniques, high-strength alloys and the design of light armor material. "Despite the national security importance of our nation's aluminum sector, the industry continues to be decimated by China's market distorting policies that contribute to vast overcapacity," the senators wrote. "China's overcapacity in aluminum has directly contributed to severe reductions in U.S. domestic production as smelters unable to compete have been forced to close.

Login Learn more about Thomson Reuters Foundation Home Women's Rights Climate Trafficking Property Rights Humanitarian Food Search Twelve U.S. senators urge security rejection of China aluminum deal by Reuters Thursday, 3 November 2016 01:16 GMT Share: Newsletter sign up: Most Popular INTERVIEW-U.S. will be 'rogue' state if it ditches climate accord - UN envoy First U.S. transgender soldiers make gender transition after policy shift Stateless limbo ends as 3,000 'legal ghosts' in the Philippines get nationality Thorny issue of who will pay for climate damage simmers at UN talks As climate change uproots communities, innovation can rescue culture By David Lawder WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Twelve U.S. senators on Wednesday urged that a national security review panel reject Chinese aluminum giant Zhongwang International Group Ltd's proposed $2.3 billion purchase of U.S. aluminum products maker Aleris Corp. The senators asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a letter to launch a review of the deal by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States and "ultimately reject it" on grounds that it would damage the U.S. defense industrial base. "Zhongwang's purchase of Aleris would directly undermine our national security, including by jeopardizing the U.S. manufacturing base for sensitive technologies in an industry already devastated by the effects of China's market distorting policies, and creating serious risk that sensitive technologies and knowhow will be transferred to China, further imperiling U.S. defense interests," the senators wrote. The deal, announced just over two months ago, would give one of the world's largest makers of extruded aluminum products access to U.S. technology and customers that include Boeing Co and other U.S. defense contractors and automakers that are increasingly turning to aluminum. It comes as another Zhongwang subsidiary is embroiled in a dispute over U.S. import duties amid broader trade tensions between the U.S. aluminum industry and China. The U.S. Commerce Department is currently investigating China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd over allegations that it has been evading U.S. import duties on extruded products by shipping them through third countries. The letter to Lew was signed by Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, where Aleris is based, and Democrats Ron Wyden, Charles Schumer, Bob Casey, Joe Manchin, Kirsten Gillibrand, Joe Donnelly, Debbie Stabenow, Jeff Merkley, Amy Klobuchar, Tammy Baldwin and Al Franken. They said the review committee needed to be cautious about the potential for sensitive research data to be transferred to China, including data with military applications such as advanced modeling techniques, high-strength alloys and the design of light armor material. "Despite the national security importance of our nation's aluminum sector, the industry continues to be decimated by China's market distorting policies that contribute to vast overcapacity," the senators wrote. "China's overcapacity in aluminum has directly contributed to severe reductions in U.S. domestic production as smelters unable to compete have been forced to close. Each such closure further imperils our nation's ability to ensure a reliable supply of strategic materials in times of crisis," they wrote. A spokesman for the U.S. Treasury could not immediately be reached for comment on the letter.

Ga, Military, Civil), Application and Region - Global Forecast to 2021 News provided by Reportlinker Nov 02, 2016, 17:39 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Nov. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- "Aerospace composites market projected to grow at a CAGR of 8.95%" The global aerospace composites market is projected to reach USD 32.35 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 8.95% from 2016 to 2021. The major drivers stimulating the growth of the global aerospace composites market are, the increasing demand for light weight, fuel efficient and high performance materials from commercial airline companies, increased penetration of composites in advanced aircraft as well as low cost carriers and the high worldwide growth in the number of new generation aircraft deliveries. However, issues related to recyclability and the lack of standardization in manufacturing technologies, are restraining the growth of the aerospace composites market. "Exterior structural applications accounted for the largest market share in the aerospace composites market, by value." Aerospace composites are extensively used in exterior aircraft components such as fuselage, wings, undercarriage, propulsion system and others. The key drivers for aerospace composites are, the global growth in the number of airplane deliveries in the near future, high performance properties such as being light weight, excellent safety & acoustic features and complying eco-friendly regulations. In order to comply with the eco-friendly regulations, aerospace manufacturers such as Boeing (U.S.), Airbus (France), GE Aviation (U.S.), and others have started using aerospace composites to manufacture exterior as well as interior components of aircraft. Thus, investing in aerospace composites production for exterior structural aerospace components would be the most profitable revenue pocket for stakeholders. "North America is the fastest-growing market for aerospace composites." North America is expected to be the fastest-growing market for aerospace composites during the forecast period. Increased number of aircraft deliveries, clearance in the backlog of aircraft orders by commercial airline companies, and the replacement of old aircraft with advanced ones, is driving the growth of the aerospace composites market in North America. The U.S. leads the market for aerospace composites in North America. Further, the penetration of aerospace composites in the U.S. aerospace industry is expected to increase due to capacity expansion for the production of aerospace composites by major composite manufacturers, the increased budget for defense aircraft programs and growth in the aerospace industry due to a stable economy.

Oregon’s Ron Wyden and 11 other senators signed a letter addressed to the Treasury Department asking for the US$2.3 billion acquisition announced in August to be reviewed, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg. Should the Democrats win control of the Senate, Wyden would likely steer the agenda of the committee, which oversees trade. Liu Zhongtian’s Zhongwang USA LLC plans to buy closely held Aleris for $1.11 billion in cash and $1.22 billion in debt, giving one of Asia’s biggest makers of extruded-aluminum products greater access to American and European technology, as well as buyers that include aerospace manufacturers like Boeing Co. and automakers such as Audi. “Chinese entities, including state owned or state controlled enterprises, may have relationships with China’s military, compounding the risk that US technologies will fall into the wrong hands,” the letter, addressed to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, said. “Aleris’ R&D and technology are critical to current and long-term US economic and national security interests given Aleris’ use of advanced research and modelling techniques, development of high-strength alloys, and design of light armour material with increased ballistic performance,” they wrote. Other signatories include Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York; Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota; and Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. When the deal was announced in August, Aleris Chief Executive Officer Sean Stack said in an interview that the company didn’t anticipate any regulatory hurdles. “We don’t check any of those boxes in terms of the criteria” for a formal inquiry from Treasury’s foreign investment committee, known as CFIUS, Stack said at the time. China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd. could become the world’s second-largest aluminium rolling company should the Aleris acquisition be approved by regulators, Austin, Texas-based Harbor Intelligence wrote in an August 30 research note. Aleris would give Zhongwang a significant footprint in the North American and European flat-rolled products markets, Jorge Vazquez, the managing director of Harbor, said in the note. Zhongwang declined to comment on any CFIUS investigation, saying only that there will be no change to Aleris’ brand, management or business strategy. ChemChina clinches US security approval to buy Swiss seeds giant Syngenta Chinese takeovers have drawn attention from Capitol Hill recently, including China National Chemical Corp.’s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG. I n September, a group of lawmakers, citing investment in the US by China, urged the Government Accountability Office to review whether CFIUS’s authority should be expanded and whether special consideration should be given to acquisitions from state-controlled Chinese buyers. CFIUS, whose members include officials from the Defense, State and Justice Departments, reviews acquisitions of US businesses by foreign buyers. The panel scrutinises deals for any risks to US national security and can impose conditions on transactions or recommend the president block them. Chinese owned Zhongwang USA enters US aluminium market with buy of Aleris The aluminium industry has caught the attention of lawmakers in recent months amid rising concerns that overproduction in China will force US smelters to shut more production, limiting domestic supply to manufacturers. Senator Schumer joined a group of lawmakers last month pushing for a World Trade Organization case against alleged Chinese subsidies of its aluminium industry, while the US industry upped its anti-China drumbeat at a hearing by the US International Trade Commission probe in September. The US is one of the top recipients of Chinese capital, attracting more than $18 billion of foreign direct investment in the first half of 2016, according to Rhodium Group. That’s a threefold increase from the same period last year.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hong Kong property experts ‘shocked’ at record sale result for Kai Tak area site 2 Outdated fintech regulations hurting Hong Kong, Jack Ma says 3 The next black swan could be fast approaching from a region that few are talking about 4 Zhongwang says it’ll bring jobs stability to Aleris, hits back at US opposition to US$2.3 bln takeover 5 China, Russia join the crowded sky: wide-body planes to cut reliance on Airbus, Boeing Shared 1 Hong Kong property experts ‘shocked’ at record sale result for Kai Tak area site 2 Outdated fintech regulations hurting Hong Kong, Jack Ma says 3 Two-thirds of smartphone users now paying by mobile 4 The next black swan could be fast approaching from a region that few are talking about 5 Zhongwang says it’ll bring jobs stability to Aleris, hits back at US opposition to US$2.3 bln takeover Commented 1 Beijing interpretation on Legislative Council oath taking rattles Hong Kong 2 Mainland paper slams Hong Kong independence advocates in 1,000-word commentary 3 Youngspiration duo increasingly isolated by pan-democratic allies, as antics cause harm and chaos 4 Time to resume talks, Taiwanese president tells the mainland 5 Tesla urges Hong Kong government to keep e-vehicle tax breaks Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2016 2H       You may also like China How new Xinjiang party boss became front runner in race to be one of China’s most powerful men 30 Oct 2016 - 11:24pm 2 Shaping up: Home-grown app, Green WALK Hong Kong, is the pick of the mobile apps In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Why bankers and cocaine are best of friends 30 Oct 2016 - 8:46pm 9 American Express corporate payment solutions help businesses drive savings for growth Presented by: American Express Hong Kong Illegal fees, little rest and no documents: domestic helpers in Hong Kong continue to fight for their rights 30 Oct 2016 - 8:07am 21 Hong Kong Should history lessons in schools include details about Hong Kong’s 1967 riots? 30 Oct 2016 - 10:29pm 9 China A billion billion calculations per second: where no computer has gone before 29 Oct 2016 - 8:00am 4 Hong Kong Meet Viveca Chow, Broadway musical star from Hong Kong Oct 28th 2016, 11:57pm World Plane bursts into flame at Chicago airport Oct 29th 2016, 3:45pm China China has world’s most skewed sex ratio at birth – again 27 Oct 2016 - 10:04pm 2 Post Magazine The Asian men who buy sex with Cambodian virgins 28 Oct 2016 - 10:54am 3 Post Magazine With the paedophile-hunters on the streets of Phnom Penh 28 Oct 2016 - 10:55am 1 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

PHOTO | FILE  By VICTOR JUMA Posted  Wednesday, November 2   2016 at  19:30 In Summary KQ says the losses arise from leasing out aircraft at rentals lower than that charged by the primary lessors. Kenya Airways is set to incur an additional Sh3 billion accounting loss from new aircraft sub-leasing contracts, representing the deficit between what it is earning on the deals and its payments to the primary lessors. SHARE THIS STORY Tweet The national carrier disclosed the new onerous leases in its financial statements for the half-year ended September. These follow the leasing of five Boeing airplanes to Oman Air and Turkish Airlines last year in a deal that left the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm with a Sh4 billion accounting loss in the year ended March. KQ, as the airline is known by its international code, says the losses arise from leasing out aircraft at rentals lower than that charged by the primary lessors. The leases are part of the company’s efforts to cut costs at a time when slow revenue growth and mounting liabilities have kept it in the loss territory. The additional sub-leasing of aircraft involves the same carriers, with Oman Air taking two B787-8s and Turkish Airlines taking three B777-300ERs. This brings the total number of aircrafts seconded to the Muscat-based carrier to four while those sent to the Istanbul-based airline rises to six. The Sh3 billion loss on the new contracts is split into long-term leases which will generate a Sh2.07 billion deficit and short-term leases whose loss stands at Sh980 million. Part of the losses has been realised, with others to filter through over the coming years as the contracts roll on over the medium term. The loss-making contracts represent the heavy cost to shareholders of unwinding of Project Mawingu. READ: KQ half-year loss shrinks to Sh4.8bn on deep cost cuts KQ signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have otherwise incurred from cancelling the contracts at a time when it could not fly the planes profitably itself. The airline has said the contracts would reduce the airline’s fleet costs by an equivalent of Sh8.4 billion annually, indicating that sub-leasing at a loss is a lesser evil compared to maintaining a bloated fleet. Sub-leasing the aircrafts, non-renewal of other leases and sale of several airplanes saw KQ’s fleet drop to 47 units in the year ended March compared to 52 units the year before. The airline plans to further scale back its capacity in the current financial year to cut costs. 1 | 2 Next Page » Latest from Daily Nation: Business Centum's half-year profit grows 7.9pc to Sh2b Imperial clients demand payment of bank deposits Treasury paper investors flock to 364-day bill Shollei and seven others charged afresh with graft Fare cuts raise Uber’s Nairobi client numbers NSE top gainers & losers n-soko About us Contact us Digital Editions Syndication Help Privacy Policy Terms RSS

After two and a half years, the missing Malaysian Airlines flight has attained a sort of mythic status in popular culture.  By Weston Williams, Staff November 2, 2016 Save for later Saved Ministry of Transport Malaysian Senior Accident investigator Aslam Basha Kham (C) talks to other officials inspecting a wing suspected to be a part of missing Malaysia Airlines jet MH370 discovered on the island of Pemba, off the coast of Tanzania, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania July 15, 2016. Stringer/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Since the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370) disappeared in March 2014, the doomed plane has generated headline after headline of speculation about the ultimate fate of the plane, the location of the crash site, and the cause of the tragedy. Every new report and discovery reignites public interest in the ongoing search for the plane. After two and a half years of analysis and guesswork, MH370 has attained a pseudo-legendary status reminiscent of the response to the sinking of the Titanic. The ongoing interest in the plane's disappearance raises moral questions about the mythologizing of real events, particularly ones in which many victims lost their lives. Recommended: How safe is flying? Take the aviation safety quiz When MH370 disappeared from flight radars in 2014, it was hardly the first time a commercial airliner had crashed. But as rescue efforts turned up nothing, the mystery surrounding the disappearance began to mount, fueled by rampant speculation on social media and the news. Test your knowledge How safe is flying? Take the aviation safety quiz Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/15 Most recently, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau examined a piece of the Boeing aircraft wing found off the coast of Tanzania and concluded in a report released Wednesday that the plane made an  uncontrolled, steep dive into the ocean. Investigators hope this information will confirm they are searching in the right area for the remains of the craft. The report comes as a team of global experts began a three-day summit in Canberra, Australia to re-examine all the data associated with the hunt for the plane, which vanished during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board, The Associated Press reports. More than 20 items of debris suspected or confirmed to be from the plane have washed ashore on coastlines throughout the Indian Ocean. But a deep-sea sonar search for the main underwater wreckage has found nothing. Crews are expect to complete their sweep of the 120,000-square kilometer (46,000-square mile) search zone by early next year and officials have said there are no plans to extend the hunt unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. The lost flight evokes tragedies like Sir John Franklin's lost expedition to the North Pole or the disappearance of Amelia Earhart as well as the sinking of the Titanic on its maiden voyage.  Julie Williams, a Titanic historian at at Samford University in Birmingham, Ala., points out that the famous shipwreck prompted avid speculation that led to the mythologizing of the sinking even before the survivors arrived in New York. Dr. Williams is a descendant of one of the surviving passengers, Albert Caldwell. "My great-uncle could buy a Titanic postcard as soon as he arrived on the dock from the rescue ship," she tells The Christian Science Monitor. "It says something about how quickly an entrepreneurial person swept up the idea and took a supposed picture of the Titanic – it was probably actually Olympic, the sister ship with the name painted over it ... But the same thing happened in social media with the Malaysian airliner." Williams draws a parallel between these rapidly-produced commemorative Titanic postcards and the initial response to the MH370 disappearance on sites like Twitter and Facebook. She specifically recalls an "irreverent meme" that compared the missing flight to the characters of the 1960s sitcom, "Gilligan's Island," which also took little heed of the victims or their potentially grieving families. In the days following the plane's disappearance, speculation about what had happened ranged from sober analysis of the available facts to wild conspiracy theories. MH370 became a public sensation, much like the Titanic, with the first fictionalized novella about the disappearance of the plane appearing only three months after the presumed crash. Since then, a number of TV documentaries, more memes, and books have revisited the still-incomplete search for the missing plane. CNN even put the missing flight on a list of history's biggest mysteries along with the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot in 2014. In this sense, MH370 seems to have attained a status similar to a modern Titanic, retaining longevity due to just the right combination of social media discussion, occasional intriguing discoveries, and portrayal in the media. "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable. In this day and age, how can a large plane be un-locatable unfindable, untraceable?" William Nesbitt, a professor of English and chair of the department of humanities at Beacon College, tells the Monitor in an email. "We just can’t fathom how it can disappear and never reappear." Williams says that the desire to unravel the mystery of a tragedy like this is simply human nature, and warns that if it captures the imagination enough, it can become something of a public obsession, fueled by media hoping to retain the public's attention. "There's a sense that maybe we can do something by writing about it," says Williams. "I think we often have that opinion that exposing the truth will solve an error in the future, although it doesn't always." She points out that this some people get wrapped up in the sensationalism of solving a mystery at the expense of respecting the victims, but acknowledges that the attention can help focus attention towards resolving lingering questions in a case like MH370. In this case, the missing flight prompted the UN’s World Radiocommunication Conference to agree last year to allow satellites to receive specialized transmissions that aircraft currently send to other planes and to ground stations. The intent is to use part of the radio spectrum as a global flight tracking system in an effort to prevent any other planes from disappearing from the skies apparently without a trace. "The public eye has more power than most of us realize," says Williams.  Next up Test your knowledge How safe is flying?

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧World News Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / World News Thu, Nov 03, 2016 - Page 6　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Flight MH370 plunged rapidly, report says AFP, SYDNEY Missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 appeared to be out of control when it plunged into the ocean, with the wing flaps not prepared for a landing, a new report said yesterday. The report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found that the plane’s final satellite communications were “consistent with the aircraft being in a high and increasing rate of descent” when it vanished. Analysis of the right outboard flap — which was found off Tanzania — showed that it was “most likely in the retracted position at the time it separated from the wing,” suggesting the plane was not configured for landing before it smashed into the ocean. The bureau noted that the width of the defined search area was appropriate “to encompass all uncontrolled descent scenarios from the simulations.” “This report contains important new information on what we believe happened at the end of MH370’s flight,” Australian Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Darren Chester said at the start of a three-day meeting in Canberra where experts are to plan the final stages of the search. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 passengers and crew. Despite a massive underwater hunt far off Western Australia’s coast, no trace of the jet has been found. However, investigators have confirmed that three pieces of debris recovered along western Indian Ocean shorelines came from MH370. More than 110,000km2 of a 120,000km2 search arc have been scoured so far and the operation is due to wrap up early next year. The findings of the new report, which analyzed satellite data, end-of-flight simulations, recovered sections of the plane and debris drift modeling, confirm extensive testing by US manufacturer Boeing and the Australian Department of Defence. Experts at the meeting are to “review all the available data and analysis associated with the search to date,” Chester said in a statement. Their findings are to “inform the remainder of the search effort and develop guidance for any future search operations,” he said. “There are currently more than 20 items of debris of interest to the investigation team which have been located on the coasts of Africa, Madagascar, the island of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodrigues.” Ongoing drift analysis also suggested the search was in the right place, the report said, noting it was “unlikely debris originated south of the current search area.” “The northernmost regions were also found to be less likely,” it added. The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China, where most of the passengers were from, this year agreed to pull the plug on the operation once the search area is fully scoured unless “credible new information” emerges.

The finance ministry has exempted EVs from the tax to help boost sales, but the measure is to expire in January. The finance ministry said it would take cues from the economic ministry on the issue. Without the exemption, people would be required to pay NT$6,000 more to buy an electric scooter and an additional NT$400,000 to buy an electric car, local media said. AIRLINES Chicago service launched EVA Airways (長榮航空) yesterday launched direct flights between Taipei and Chicago in a bid to extend its reach in the North American market. EVA said it would operate four round-trip flights per week using one of its latest-model Boeing Co 777-300ER aircraft configured for 333 passengers. EVA, which has more flights and seat capacity between North America and Taiwan than any other airline, said it hopes to elevate its market presence through the new service to the US city, which attracts more than 40 million travelers per year. With more direct flight destinations, EVA can offer greater flexibility, especially for transit passengers, who can now extend their journeys to and from Southeast Asia, EVA chairman Lin Pao-shui (林寶水) said at a ceremony to mark the maiden flight. With the launch of the new route, EVA operates 77 flights per week between Taiwan and destinations in North America, including Chicago, Seattle, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, Toronto and Vancouver. There are also to be extra flights on the Taipei-Seattle route from Dec. 8, increasing the number of weekly services from seven to 10 and the total number of flights between Taiwan and North America to 80, Lin added. ELECTRONICS FTC approves Epson deal The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) yesterday approved Epson Taiwan Technology & Trading Ltd’s (臺灣愛普生) planned acquisition of repair and maintenance company TekCare Corp (捷修網). The commission said that after consulting local repair and maintenance service providers, it decided that the deal would not monopolize the market. Epson Taiwan subsidiary epMall Co Ltd (愛普網) is to increase its stake in TekCare from 30 percent to 100 percent via the deal, the commission said. DISPLAYMAKERS Giantplus net income falls Flat-panel maker Giantplus Technology Co (凌巨科技) yesterday reported a significant decline in net income for last quarter due to the rising cost of new product development. The company’s net profit last quarter dropped significantly to NT$27.76 million (US$879,483), compared with NT$346.78 million in the same period last year. The result also marked a plunge from the previous quarter’s NT$205.87 million, the firm’s filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange showed. The earnings result marked the firm’s worst performance in the past six quarters. Giantplus attributed the decline to costs associated with new products and currency exchange losses. The firm’s combined net profit in the first three quarters of this year totaled NT$364.46 million, up 4.58 percent from NT$348.47 million in the same period last year, the filing showed.

The new plane is expected to challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. Manufacturers Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) have announced the start of the search for suppliers. They didn’t provide any details on financing or technical specification.   “We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continually guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation,” Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC’s wide-body department told Reuters. US firms Honeywell and United Technologies Corporation have reportedly discussed the jet with COMAC officials at the air show. The Russia-China joint venture will start this year, according to Guo. The firms plan a maiden flight in 2022 and deliveries to begin in 2025 or later. “A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge,” Guo told reporters. “China and Russia each have their own advantages.” The memorandum on the creation of a new airliner was signed in 2014 during President Vladimir Putin’s visit to China. It is part of a $13 billion aviation cooperation deal. The basic version of the aircraft will have 250-280 seats and a range of 12,000 kilometers. The plane will be developed in Russia and assembled in China. It will be based on the Russian-designed IL-96, and will have two engines instead of four. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said in June the construction of a heavy-lift aircraft engine for the plane has already started. https://www.rt.com/business/365106-russia-china-joint-jet/ Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket Related This entry was posted in News.

Oregon’s Ron Wyden and 11 other senators signed a letter addressed to the Treasury Department asking for the $2.3 billion acquisition announced in August to be reviewed, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg. Should the Democrats win control of the Senate, Wyden would likely steer the agenda of the committee, which oversees trade. Liu Zhongtian’s Zhongwang USA LLC plans to buy closely held Aleris for $1.11 billion in cash and $1.22 billion in debt, giving one of Asia’s biggest makers of extruded-aluminum products greater access to American and European technology, as well as buyers that include aerospace manufacturers like Boeing Co. and automakers such as Audi. “Chinese entities, including state owned or state controlled enterprises, may have relationships with China’s military, compounding the risk that U.S. technologies will fall into the wrong hands,” the letter, addressed to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, said. “Aleris’ R&D and technology are critical to current and long-term U.S. economic and national security interests given Aleris’ use of advanced research and modeling techniques, development of high-strength alloys, and design of light armor material with increased ballistic performance,” they wrote. Other signatories include Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York; Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota; and Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio. Significant Footprint When the deal was announced in August, Aleris Chief Executive Officer Sean Stack said in an interview that the company didn’t anticipate any regulatory hurdles.  “We don’t check any of those boxes in terms of the criteria” for a formal inquiry from Treasury’s foreign investment committee, known as CFIUS, Stack said at the time. China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd. could become the world’s second-largest aluminum rolling company should the Aleris acquisition be approved by regulators, Austin, Texas-based Harbor Intelligence wrote in an Aug. 30 research note. Aleris would give Zhongwang a significant footprint in the North American and European flat-rolled products markets, Jorge Vazquez, the managing director of Harbor, said in the note. Zhongwang declined to comment on any CFIUS investigation, saying only that there will be no change to Aleris’ brand, management or business strategy. Deal Scrutiny Chinese takeovers have drawn attention from Capitol Hill recently, including China National Chemical Corp.’s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG. In September, a group of lawmakers, citing investment in the U.S. by China, urged the Government Accountability Office to review whether CFIUS’s authority should be expanded and whether special consideration should be given to acquisitions from state-controlled Chinese buyers. CFIUS, whose members include officials from the Defense, State and Justice Departments, reviews acquisitions of U.S. businesses by foreign buyers. The panel scrutinizes deals for any risks to U.S. national security and can impose conditions on transactions or recommend the president block them. The aluminum industry has caught the attention of lawmakers in recent months amid rising concerns that overproduction in China will force U.S. smelters to shut more production, limiting domestic supply to manufacturers. Senator Schumer joined a group of lawmakers last month pushing for a World Trade Organization case against alleged Chinese subsidies of its aluminum industry, while the U.S. industry upped its anti-China drumbeat at a hearing by the U.S. International Trade Commission probe in September. The U.S. is one of the the top recipients of Chinese capital, attracting more than $18 billion of foreign direct investment in the first half of 2016, according to Rhodium Group. That’s a threefold increase from the same period last year. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found the plane’s final satellite communications were “consistent with the aircraft being in a high and increasing rate of descent” when it vanished. Analysis of the right outboard flap — which was found off Tanzania — showed it was “most likely in the retracted position at the time it separated from the wing”, suggesting the plane was not configured for landing before it smashed into the ocean. The bureau noted that the width of the defined search area was appropriate “to encompass all uncontrolled descent scenarios from the simulations”. “This report contains important new information on what we believe happened at the end of MH370’s flight,” Australia’s transport minister, Darren Chester, said at the start of a three-day meeting in Canberra where experts will plan the final stages of the search. The Boeing 777 aircraft disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014 carrying 239 passengers and crew. Despite a massive underwater hunt far off Western Australia’s coast, no trace of the jet has been found. Investigators have, however, confirmed that three pieces of debris recovered along western Indian Ocean shorelines came from MH370. More than 110,000 square kilometers of a 120,000-square-kilometer search arc have been scoured so far and the operation is due to wrap up in early 2017. The findings of the ATSB’s new report, which analyzed satellite data, end-of-flight simulations, recovered sections of the plane and debris drift modeling, confirm extensive testing by US manufacturer Boeing and the Australian defense department. Experts at the meeting will “review all the available data and analysis associated with the search to date”, Chester said in a statement. Their findings will “inform the remainder of the search effort, and develop guidance for any future search operations.” “There are currently more than 20 items of debris of interest to the investigation team which have been located on the coasts of Africa, Madagascar, the island of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodrigues,” he added. The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China, where most of the passengers were from, this year agreed to pull the plug on the operation once the search area was fully scoured unless “credible new information” emerged.

News Business Business News Federal Reserve, China, YouTube: Business news in brief Wednesday 2 November Will US raise interest rates before Trump v Clinton?; China needs $1 trillion of aeroplanes; Germany finally opens music streaming market Ben Chapman Wednesday 2 November 2016 13:32 BST Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a rally, in Las Vegas in a Sunday, 30 October, 2016, file photo AP As election looms, divided US Fed begins meet on rates A divided US Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on interest rate policy yesterday, as bitterly contested US elections loomed large on the horizon. Most observers and market players do not expect the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s monetary policy board, to announce a rate hike when the meeting lets out on Wednesday afternoon, despite some recent signs of improving health in the world's largest economy. Instead, the Fed may use the occasion to put the public on notice to expect a rate hike in December – though even that is far from guaranteed. Fed Chair Janet Yellen in recent months has signaled that the case for raising rates has grown stronger. But the FOMC does not appear to be under pressure to act immediately. Raising rates so close to an election, which could invite needless political controversy, is also rare for the Fed, which has done so only once since the 1980s. Researchers say, however, that there is little evidence the FOMC acts based on the US political calendar. AFP China aircraft market to hit nearly $1trn in 20 years: Airbus Flight attendants at China International Aviation & Aeropsace Exhibition - the country is expected to bu around $1trn of aeroplanes over the next 20 years (Reuters) China will need nearly 6,000 aircraft worth $945bn (£773bn) over the next two decades, aerospace giant Airbus said on Tuesday at the Zhuhai air show. At that point China will be the world's number one source of air traffic and its top aircraft market, it said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast. “Domestic passenger traffic in mainland China has quadrupled over the last 10 years, and is set to become the world's number one aviation market,” said John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer. “In the next 20 years, the greatest demand for passenger aircraft will come from China.” China accounts for nearly a quarter of the European aircraft maker's deliveries, with 158 delivered to China last year. It is currently the second-largest aviation market after the US. Air travel is booming in the world's second-largest economy, as its burgeoning middle class spends more on travel, with overall air traffic growth of over 500 per cent from 2000 to 2014, Airbus said. Despite slowing economic expansion and a challenging transition to a consumer economy, China's market for international air travel is predicted to average 6.7 per cent annual growth for the next 20 years, it added. Airbus is locked in close competition with Boeing for China market share, with Airbus planes accounting for slightly less than half of the country's fleets. AFP German YouTube alive with sound of music after copyright deal One of the world's most restrictive countries on access to music videos opened up on Tuesday as YouTube announced a deal with musicians' body Gema to pay when people stream music in Germany. YouTube users in the country had for years been confronted with a red sad-face emoticon and messages announcing “this video is not available in Germany” when trying to view videos ranging from the latest pop clips to films with GEMA-controlled background music. Now the blockages should largely be a thing of the past. “Hell has frozen over!” wrote one Twitter user in response to the news. “Listen to all the music!” said another. Tuesday's deal will see YouTube pay an undisclosed amount for music belonging to the roughly 70,000 German artists represented by Gema – as well as many international artists – each time their songs are played. “Authors, composers and music publishers will be paid fairly,” YouTube executive Christophe Muller said in a statement. AFP Sony profit dives on strong yen, unit sale (Reuters) Japan's Sony said on Tuesday its first-half net profit dived as it was hit by a sharp rally in the yen's value and losses linked to the sale of its battery business. The electronics giant, which has been shedding assets as part of a broad restructuring, reported a 26bn yen (£203m) net profit in the six months through September, down nearly 78 per cent from a year earlier. Revenue in the first half of Sony's fiscal year fell more than 10 per cent to 3.3 trillion yen “primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates”, Sony said. Sales in Sony's mobile communications business slumped, while profitability in its memory chip and components businesses also suffered. That partly offset strong demand for games on its hugely popular PlayStation 4 game console. Last month Sony launched its new virtual reality headset, the PlayStation Virtual Reality (PSVR), in Japan and North America, joining Facebook, Samsung and Google in a market that analysts say could boost the global gaming sector. Tuesday's first-half results came a day after Sony warned that it now expected a net profit of 60bn yen in the year through March 2017, down by a quarter from an earlier forecast. AFP Go-Ahead sticks to outlook despite Southern strike chaos British bus and train operator Go-Ahead said it was on track to post annual results in line with its expectations despite being hit by strikes on its Southern rail contract. The Southern network is part of Govia Thameslink Railway, which is 65 per cent owned by Go-Ahead alongside France's Keolis. It has faced widespread criticism from passengers, politicians and the media after months of strikes, cancellations and delays on trains into London. Go-Ahead said on Tuesday that aside from its GTR contract, its rail and bus operations traded strongly in the July to October period. Strikes during the period, most recently in October with more due in November, dragged on margins at the company's struggling GTR franchise, said Go-Ahead, but its expectations for the network's performance over the seven-year contract remained the same. Reuters Saudi minister hails ‘bold’ deal with Japan's SoftBank Saudi energy minister, Khaled al-Falih (Reuters) The Saudi energy minister said on Tuesday that a multi-billion-dollar technology investment fund the kingdom is developing in partnership with Japan's SoftBank showed its determination to diversify its economy. Khaled al-Falih told an international forum that the proposed new fund “is simply one indication of this determination and the bold steps being taken” to reorient the economy of the world's biggest oil exporter. Since 2014, global oil prices have collapsed by about half, accelerating Saudi efforts to move away from petroleum, which still accounts for the bulk of government income. Falih told the KAPSARC Energy Dialogue that in the past the kingdom had not implemented diversification policies “as efficiently as we should have”. Vision 2030 - a wide-ranging plan released in April - was a “proactive response” to build a diversified economy led by the private sector and with international investments providing alternative revenue sources, he said. AFP Pfizer profit just misses; company scraps cholesterol drug (Getty) Pfizer, the largest US drugmaker, reported a quarterly adjusted profit that just missed analysts' estimates, and the company shaved 4 cents off its 2016 earnings forecast after scrapping development of a cholesterol-lowering treatment. The drugmaker earned 61 cents per share in the third quarter, excluding special items, missing the average analyst estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Pfizer's new breast cancer treatment, Ibrance, generated sales of $550m (£450m), missing the consensus forecast of $576m (£471m) compiled by Evercore ISI. Pfizer also said on Tuesday it was abandoning the development of its cholestrol-lowering drug, bococizumab, citing an “evolving treatment landscape”. Reuters Standard Chartered profits not yet acceptable, says boss as earnings disappoint (GETTY IMAGES) Standard Chartered boss Bill Winters has admitted the bank's profits are “not yet acceptable” as it posted worse-than-expected earnings. The Asian-focused bank, which is listed in London, saw shares slump by more than 7 per cent at one stage after it reported third quarter underlying profits of $458m (£374m). This marked an improvement from losses of $139m (£113.5m) a year earlier, but left investors disappointed as it fell short of City forecasts. Standard also revealed fresh compliance woes after confirming that Hong Kong’s financial regulator planned to take action against the bank over its role as a joint sponsor of an initial public offering in 2009.

Jet Airways facing acute shortage of pilots? New Delhi, Nov 2, 2016, (PTI) Naresh Goyal-owned Jet Airways is facing acute shortage of pilots amid the airline increasing its capacity in the fast growing domestic market, according to sources. A number of Jet Airways flights have got delayed in the recent past as the airline has failed to provide pilots due to paucity of the flight crew, they said. The Mumbai-headquartered full service carrier is second largest airline in terms of number of domestic operations after no-frills IndiGo. As part of the winter schedule, which is effective from late last month, Jet Airways plans to operate 3,010 flights per week while its subsidiary JetLite 507 flights per week. "Jet Airways is facing shortage of pilots for quite some time now. While the airline has been increasing the number of flights in its both winter and summer schedules each year, the number of pilots is not increasing in the same ratio, leading to shortage of flight crew," a source said. Jet Airways requires at least 200 more pilots to carry out its operations in a seamless manner, the source said, adding "shortage is more in narrow body, Boeing 737 fleet." The airline currently has around 1,200 pilots to operate its fleet of 102 aircraft comprising Boeing 777s, B737s, Airbus A330s and ATRs. Almost two-thirds of its fleet consists of B737s. Response to queries sent to Jet Airways in this regard was awaited. Significantly, as many as 18 per cent of Jet Airways flights from four metro airports -- Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru -- failed to either arrive or depart on time in September. A major chunk of its flights are from its two hubs - Mumbai and New Delhi. Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan had hit out at the airline after his flight to Chennai from Mumbai last week was allegedly delayed due to non-availability of flight crew. "Flying to Chennai. Baggage, check. Board flight on time, check. Seat belt fastened, check. Only thing we need now are our pilots!!...Well done Jet Airways!!! Entire plane boarded without any pilots on board. Still waiting and hoping...," he had said in a series of tweets over the nearly none-and-half- hour delay of his flight. For the last almost two years, India has been the fastest growing air traffic market in the world. In September, the domestic air passenger traffic registered a robust growth of about 23 per cent as compared the same period last year.  Go to Top Tweet Videos Demonetisation effect: Church comes to public's rescue,...

Travel News & Advice Frankfurt Airport opens up to no-frills flights as Ryanair moves in The airline will fly daily to four Iberian airports Simon Calder Travel Correspondent @SimonCalder Wednesday 2 November 2016 12:15 BST The first budget flights from Frankfurt will take off next March Getty Images The last of Europe’s major hub airports to remain the preserve of “legacy” airlines is finally to open up to the low-cost giants. Frankfurt, the third-busiest airport in the EU after Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle, has long been a bastion of network airlines, and is the home of Lufthansa. But from March 2017, Ryanair will base two Boeing 737s at Frankfurt for flights to Spain and Portugal. Alicante, Malaga, Palma and Faro will be served daily through the summer. Stefan Schulte, the chief executive of Fraport, the company that operates Frankfurt Airport, said: “Ryanair’s decision to come to FRA underscores the increasing importance of Frankfurt for low-cost traffic.” Read more Budget flights hit by Brexit despite falling prices Why has Ryanair made it trickier to check in online? Budget airlines rated: What you get for your money Ryanair, the biggest no-frills airline in Europe, has a history of building up new hubs rapidly. It is likely that for the winter season 2017/18 — beginning a year from now — the airline will expand the base and serve more business-orientated routes. Ryanair has said it will shift its focus for expansion away from its main base, the UK, because of the vote to leave the European Union.  At present the airline’s version of Frankfurt is Hahn airport, in the Hunsruck region high above the Moselle River, and closer to Luxembourg than it is to the German financial hub. Hahn is currently served from Stansted, with seasonal flights from Edinburgh and Newquay. Michael O’Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has long been dismissive of primary hub airports, regarding them as too expensive and complex for efficient operations. But as competition between airlines increases, Ryanair is looking for new opportunities.

Home Industry Companies Air India mulls leasing Dorniers to boost regional services Air India mulls leasing Dorniers to boost regional services Flag carrier Air India is mulling leasing ten Dornier aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd to boost its regional operations as the government looks to make flying more affordable under the ambitious UDAN scheme. By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: November 2, 2016 4:48 PM State-owned HAL is already making the Dornier 228 planes under licence from Swiss technology company RUAG for the defence forces and European markets. (PTI) Flag carrier Air India is mulling leasing ten Dornier aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd to boost its regional operations as the government looks to make flying more affordable under the ambitious UDAN scheme. State-owned HAL is already making the Dornier 228 planes under licence from Swiss technology company RUAG for the defence forces and European markets. To evaluate the feasibility of inducting a new type of jetliner into its fleet, Air India has set up three committees and a final decision on the matter would be taken after receiving reports from the panels, the airline’s Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani said. Currently, the government-owned carrier operates aircraft manufactured by Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and ATR. “We have set up three committees, one each from finance, operations and engineering. These committees will study all aspects of the proposal and any decision (whether to lease or not to lease) will be based on the outcome of their reports,” Lohani told PTI here. However, he did not divulge further details. Air India, which has turned operationally profitable last fiscal after nearly a decade, would operate more regional flights through Alliance Air. Alliance Air, which mostly connects Tier II and III cities to metro hubs, currently flies to 34 destinations and has 39 daily departures. Under the ambitious regional air connectivity scheme named UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik) launched last month, Civil Aviation Ministry has listed three categories of aircraft — those having less than 20 seats, 21-80-seaters, and 80 seats or more. HAL’s 19-seater Dornier 228 could be useful for civil operations with certain modifications, an official said. According to the official, both Air India and HAL are currently in discussions for a possible leasing of 10 such planes for operating flights under UDAN. “At least 10 Dornier 228 are expected to be inducted on lease,” the official said, adding a final decision on the issue would be taken before the end of this fiscal. UDAN seeks to provide air connectivity to un-served and under-served airports, especially in small cities, as well as make flying more affordable for the masses. Fares of half of the seats operated in a particular flight of one-hour duration under UDAN would be capped at Rs 2,500. The cap would be applicable for distance of 476-500 kilometres. Government expects the first flight under the regional connectivity scheme by early next year and is pinning hopes on Air India for the successful take off of UDAN.

New Delhi, Nov 2:   Flag carrier Air India is mulling leasing ten Dornier aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd to boost its regional operations as the government looks to make flying more affordable under the ambitious UDAN scheme.

State-owned planemakers Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) and United Aircraft Corp (UAC) of Russia said they had started the hunt to find suppliers, as they presented a mock-up of the wide-body jet at Airshow China. Neither firm gave details on financing or technical specifications for what Western analysts call a politically-driven initiative that will be difficult to pull off and is likely to carry a high price tag. China opened the show on Tuesday in the southern city of Zhuhai with a brief flypast of its J-20 stealth fighter, in a demonstration of military clout. Both countries are currently developing smaller narrow-body jets to compete with the best-selling Airbus and Boeing types. Guo Bozhi, general manager of COMAC's widebody department, said a 50-50 joint venture based in Shanghai will start operations this year. First announced in 2014, the project has so far been slow to materialise. The firms have said they want conduct a maiden flight in 2022 and begin deliveries in 2025 or later. Western industry analysts consider the target challenging, but more realistic than recent aircraft programmes that sought results in 5-7 years and came in late. "A wide-body jet is an extremely complicated product, which will require a lot of skills (to develop) and require broad industrial knowledge," Guo told reporters. "China and Russia each have their own advantages." Descriptions accompanying the model showed the firms ultimately envision three variants, based on a basic version that will seat 280 and have a range of up to 12,000 kilometres (7,500 miles). SUPPLIER SEARCH The decision to base the venture in Shanghai was a "mutual decision", Guo said at the event, attended by COMAC Chairman Jin Zhuanglong, UAC's Chief Executive Yury Slyusar and Russia's Minister of Trade and Industry Denis Manturov. Guo declined to say how much each party had invested in the project. A global effort to assess potential suppliers is now under way, said COMAC, which is separately pushing its own C919 narrow-body passenger jet towards a long-delayed maiden flight, now aimed for the end of 2016 or early 2017. U.S. firms Honeywell and United Technologies Corporation said on Wednesday they discussed the China-Russia jet with COMAC officials at the airshow, without commenting on the nature or subject of the contacts. "We will choose suppliers who have rich experience in development, whose products are competitive globally, and who can continually guarantee quality from the development stage until the planes go into operation," Guo said. A key decision will be what engines to use. Industry sources speculate the jet could use Western engines. Another potentially tricky issue will be how the work should be divided, a subject which caused years of wrangling at Europe's Airbus, which began in 1970 as a consortium of nations and took more than two decades to make a significant impact. Though a 50-50 JV, analysts view the Chinese side as being the more influential in the project. The firm's Shanghai headquarters tells "where the balance of power is going to be and that reflects the size of the Chinese domestic market," said Sash Tusa, analyst at London-based consultancy Agency Partners.

Whilst Bill is a wonderful teacher, this is a video with limitations. We would recommend taking a look at this video if you are; New to the world of flight simulation. Would like to learn more about the civilian jet procedure. Wish to learn from a professional, easy to follow video. ​ However, this is not the best choice if you are already well-skilled in jet flight management. You also want to avoid this if you only want to learn more about simulating the use of a combat jet in simulation. With a video at 16:53 minutes, you’ll get plenty of learning and value from watching this. However, just make sure you know what category you fall into so that you have the best chance of extracting value from watching this video. Another excellent part of this video, though, is the addition of the free V-Speed Card. This is used to show you common V-Speeds and is listed alphabetically, and also by speed. This is very useful if you are new to or are still learning about V-Speeds and want to try and grasp their usage more. Preview Video Simulating Properly Using this video is quite simple. When watching the video, Bill will help you to understand how to manage many of the most challenging parts of flight simulation. For example, it will help you; Face the heaviest simulation issues that you are likely to come across. Throughout the video, useful tips are provided to help you avoid the most challenging yet surprisingly common simulation challenges. Handle the largest airliners on the planet. Learn how to go about taming these behemoths to be used as your own. Understand how they work, operate and manage in the skies for safe usage and mastery. Cruise at the highest altitudes – this will show you how to handle things “way” up in the sky. This is very useful for helping you to get used to handling yourself when you come out of your comfort zone and put yourself in that correct approach naturally. Travel the longest distances on the planet safely.

Handling Any Flight However, this video looks to educate and improve your flight performance in kind. It will help you come to grips with; Flight prep. If you find that it’s extremely hard to get yourself off the ground and to adequately prepare for your flight, this video will help. By the end you should understand pre-flight planning for your continued success. Learn how to push back from the gates, start the engines and move from the taxi to the runway safely. If you wish to learn how to fly using official protocol, then this is a part of the video that is likely to be of great use to you. Take off and learn how to manage climbing. This is a major struggle and one of the parts of your flight that is likely to leave you unsure of what to do. The more you get used to climbing as this video shows, though, the quicker this becomes a forgotten issue. Learn about cruising. Cruising is a hard skill to master and will usually push your limits as a pilot to get there. Follow this video and you should quickly notice a considered and continued improvement. Get used to approaching and landing safely. Lots of people struggle with this part of flying – so use to your advantage and you can avoid this problem. It takes consistent time and planning, but it is by no means a challenge to get used to. Find out the keys to safe and smart parking, following ideal protocol to shut down any aircraft without any problems. Manage Various Jet Flight Tasks Another significant problem when flying, though, is managing the various flight tasks. This will help you get to grips with handling tasks such as; Buying a large amount of fuel to cover you for the journey. This video section should help you concentrate on how to manage your flight in terms of the quantities needed. Loading up passengers and cargo in a safe and professional manner. Learning these little things is all part of making sure that you fully appreciate, adhere to and understand flight protocol. Managing to use taxi and landing lights to guide you across the airport. Should you lack in skills for navigation then this should help you get over these issues relatively quickly. Get to understand the importance of altitude and flight levels as you go. This will go a long way to helping you correct these issues should they exist in your flight style. Make use of knots and Mach properly. Whilst not something every aircraft has to deal with it helps to know the scenario and to ensure you can adapt if needed. Finally, learn best how to get used to using V-Speeds and what that tends to mean. Improve your Focus Built to be demonstrated in a bulky Boeing 737-800 aircraft, this video shows you lots of skills both minor and advanced. This focuses mainly on using civilian jets, and makes most of the references regarding Microsoft Flight Simulator. However, keep in mind that these are flight principles as a whole – the operation may change depending on the simulator, but the idea won’t. This is also applicable to other aircraft that you might fly. The aim here is improving your focus and continuity as a pilot as a whole, not just in the cockpit of a Boeing aircraft. This video is made by a team of trusted experts who know what they are doing. It’s planned out and follows a meticulous pathway throughout, and is organized in a logical, easy to learn from manner. It also uses a good level of pacing so that you can learn at a fair and consistent rate throughout. With scripted and edited instructions, this reads clearly and is simple to follow along with. The designations and details all make sense in the context of the video, making it easy to learn at a speed you feel most comfortable with. The distinctions screens for each step will make sure you never have to try and interpret or guess what is going on. Best of all, this is free of all of the usual digressions and tangents. Anything extra included in here is added because it’s valuable, not because the author is on a soapbox. Time is kept to a minimum with all extra chatter filtered out and down. Instead, you get the message that you got this video for. As such, it makes it easy to learn from – it’s professional, succinct and clear. No “uhms” and “ohs” in here; just the information that you paid for! Watching the Video To watch this video, you need to be using one of Windows Media Player, Real Player, WinAmp or QuickTime. Each of these can be downloaded with relative ease from their official websites. Also, the video is 266 MB in size so make sure you have enough HD space! You can purchase the video over at SimShack.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Society Search for MH370: Investigators say aircraft went into steep dive before crash Examination of wing flap debris found off Tanzania in June showed it likely wasn't extended when the plane entered the ocean. IBTimes Staff Reporter November 2, 2016 13:28 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares Squadron leader Brett McKenzie marks the name of another search aircraft on the windshield of a Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3K2 Orion aircraft searching for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 over the southern Indian OceanREUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo The examination of a key piece of wreckage from the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has found that the aircraft was most likely in a steep dive and crashed with flaps in a retracted position, casting new doubt over theories that it was under human control, the Wall Street Journal reported. Australian investigators overseeing the hunt for the airliner in a remote area of the Indian Ocean released a report on Wednesday saying an examination of wing flap debris found off Tanzania in June showed it likely wasn't extended when the plane entered the ocean, suggesting the aircraft wasn't in a controlled glide with the pilot or passenger at the controls. Why advertise with us? Related Debris from MH370 found in Mauritius: Malaysian authorities MH370 debris found: Malaysia confirms debris discovered in Tanzania is from missing plane "It was probably in a non-extended position, which means that the aircraft wasn't configured for a landing or a ditching," said Peter Foley, the director of the search for Flight 370 at the ATSB. "You can never be 100 percent and we are reluctant to express absolute certainty, but that's the most likely scenario," he added. Authorities have long believed the plane wasn't under human control at the time of its apparent crash, based on communications between the aircraft and an Inmarsat PLC satellite. That communications data — central to fixing on a 120,000 square-kilometre search area, more than 90 percent of which has now been covered — suggest Flight 370 was plummeting at a rate of at least 12,000 feet a minute when it entered the water. However, another theory — that the plane was in a controlled glide following a loss of engine power — hasn't been ruled out, though authorities consider it less likely. The latest wing flap analysis found the right outboard flap of the Boeing 777 was likely damaged by an adjacent control flaperon in the "neutral position," instead of extended as it would normally have been when landing. Taken together with satellite data and modelling of possible crash simulations put together by Boeing experts, Foley said the analysis showed the current search zone along an area known as the seventh arc continued to be the most likely place where the plane came down. ns put together by Boeing experts, Foley said the analysis showed the current search zone along an area known as the seventh arc continued to be the most likely place where the plane came down. The WSJ reported that international aviation experts will meet for several days in Canberra to re-examine evidence and consider high-tech new drift analysis of how debris was carried from the crash site to wash up on the coasts of Africa and Indian Ocean islands. "I don't think anyone who's been involved in the search wants to walk away," said Foley. "Every single one of us is motivated by the desire to find the aircraft for the sake of the families of passengers and crew, and indeed for aviation safety more broadly," he added. The ATSB is seeking up to $30 million from the government to extend the search after working for months to redefine the parameters of the current 120,000 square kilometre zone. "If it's not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity," ATSB Chief Commissioner Greg Hood said in August.

The report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found the plane's final satellite communications were "consistent with the aircraft being in a high and increasing rate of descent" when it vanished. Analysis of the right outboard flap - which was found off Tanzania - showed it was "most likely in the retracted position at the time it separated from the wing", suggesting the plane was not configured for landing before it smashed into the ocean. The bureau noted that the width of the defined search area was appropriate "to encompass all uncontrolled descent scenarios from the simulations". "This report contains important new information on what we believe happened at the end of MH370's flight," Australia's Transport Minister Darren Chester said at the start of a three-day meeting in Canberra where experts will plan the final stages of the search. Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014 carrying 239 passengers and crew. Despite a massive underwater hunt far off Western Australia's coast, no trace of the jet has been found. Investigators have however confirmed that three pieces of debris recovered along western Indian Ocean shorelines came from MH370. More than 110,000 square kilometres of a 120,000-square- kilometre search arc have been scoured so far and the operation is due to wrap up in early 2017. The findings of the ATSB's new report, which analysed satellite data, end-of-flight simulations, recovered sections of the plane and debris drift modelling, confirm extensive testing by US manufacturer Boeing and the Australian defence department. Experts at the meeting will "review all the available data and analysis associated with the search to date", Chester said in a statement. Their findings will "inform the remainder of the search effort, and develop guidance for any future search operations." "There are currently more than 20 items of debris of interest to the investigation team which have been located on the coasts of Africa, Madagascar, the island of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodrigues," he added. Ongoing drift analysis also suggested the search was in the right place, the ATSB said, noting it was "unlikely debris originated south of the current search area. "The northernmost regions were also found to be less likely," it added.

Photographer: EPA Planemaker COMAC says airline has committed to 20 planes Negotiations to start within a year of aircraft’s test flight Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp China Eastern Airlines Corp. will be the first customer to take delivery of the home made C919 single-aisle passenger jet as a state-owned planemaker markets the aircraft whose maiden test flight has been delayed at least twice since 2014. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. said it signed an agreement with the Shanghai-based carrier to start negotiations to firm up orders for five of the 168-seat planes within a year of its first test flight, the planemaker locally known as COMAC, said in a statement issued at the Zhuhai Air Show. Wu Guanghui, the chief designer of COMAC, said Monday that the test flight could be conducted later this year or early 2017. Besides China Eastern, the planemaker also won commitments from a slew of leasing companies, including 36 from Citic Financial Leasing and 20 from SPDB Financial Leasing, according to the statement. Including Tuesday’s agreements, COMAC has orders and commitments from 23 customers for about 570 aircraft, the company said. The passenger jet project, kicked off in 2008, is part of China’s ambitious plan to vault in rankings to the likes of Japan and Germany in manufacturing, and transform its $10.9 trillion economy from a maker of sneakers, apparels and toys. President Xi Jinping, in a vision document unveiled last year, identified aerospace among sectors that could help accelerate modernization and eventually challenge Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. For an article on China’s aviation ambitions, click here Japan’s Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp., a unit of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., has also turned to a local airline for its MRJ regional jets -- ANA Holdings Inc. In 2010, China Eastern had signed commitments for 20 C919 aircraft. CFM International, an equal engine-making joint venture between General Electric Co. and Safran SA, said Tuesday in Zhuhai that it is building the LEAP-1C engines for the second C919 aircraft. COMAC would be a future player in the market for narrowbody jets and the market is big enough for competing makers, Darren Hulst, Boeing’s managing director of marketing for Northeast Asia, said at the Zhuhai Air Show. Francois Caudron, head of marketing at Airbus, said the French planemaker welcomes competition. Apart from the C919, COMAC is also pushing sales of its Advanced Regional Jet ARJ21. Longhao Air signed a commitment to purchase an unspecified number of the smaller 90-seat jets, while a local lessor has agreed to buy 20 with a pledge for more, COMAC said in the statement. Guangzhou-based Longhao Airlines, a cargo carrier that got approval from regulators earlier this year, is in the midst of building a passenger business, according to a statement distributed in Zhuhai. COMAC said it will convert some ARJ21 aircraft into cargo planes for Longhao Airlines, and cooperate with the carrier in areas including purchase and maintenance as well as pilot training. The ARJ21 has 413 orders and commitments from 19 buyers, according to COMAC. COMAC forecasts China needs new aircraft worth 6 trillion yuan ($886 billion) in the next 20 years, and the nation will see delivery of 6,865 planes by 2035. Airbus separately said Tuesday that the country needs 6,000 new planes, both passenger and cargo, valued at $945 billion as passenger traffic rises an average 6.8 percent over the next two decades. — With assistance by Dong Lyu Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The plane vanished from radar on March 8, 2014, en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board and its search is the world’s longest for a missing passenger jet. Some flight simulations after the plane ran out of fuel produced a descent rate “outside the aircraft’s certified flight envelope,” the ATSB said in its report. The plane lost at least 3,800 feet of altitude and that accelerated up to 25,000 feet every minute, the ATSB said. Simulations suggest the aircraft could have reversed track and flown back north even as it fell from the sky, the ATSB said. Investigators are looking at more than 20 items of debris, according to Wednesday’s report. The governments of Australia, Malaysia and China have said search will be suspended when the 120,000 square-kilometer search area in the southern Indian Ocean has been fully covered in January.

Urgency is not an excuse to get it wrong The I-732 campaign was built on, and still runs on, the politics of urgency without the policy substance of getting something done. First, it was an excuse for crafting the measure in isolation, a white male economist telling people of color we’re "using race and class as political weapons." Now urgency is used as an excuse to vote for a measure the backers themselves acknowledged is deeply flawed. They almost bailed on it when they had a chance, but got caught in different economics conundrum, sunk costs and the warm affirmation of good-old-boys talking only to each other. Washington voters must not follow this misguided path. For over a year, I’ve been mansplained by I-732 backers, most who live so far from the front lines of climate change they have no idea what real urgency feels like. As a Queer Filipino growing up working class in the US next to a polluted highway and a steel factory—someone who has been on the front lines of fossil fuel pollution, who has loved ones and family in the Philippines, and who has seen first-hand how increasing storms and flooding have shattered lives, and who organizes many other people like me—I know all too well the devastation that fossil fuel economy and climate change can cause. For real, you don’t have to convince me. Effective and equitable climate action is not a game to me, it’s not a "theory" to be proven or disproven; it is about survival for me and my community. Right now. But the reality is that I-732 will only cause harm to communities like mine. 2. Adding a buck to the price of gas will do nothing to reduce climate change without investing the revenue in clean, equitable communities.   "Revenue-neutral" carbon pricing was a scheme built for 1986 when we could cross our fingers and hope a slowly rising price for carbon would transition our economy off fossil fuels. But in 2016 we have years, not decades, before we’ve maxed out our global carbon budget to stay below a 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius rise in temperature. I-732 would contribute virtually nothing to Washington’s share. By 2040, analysis shows, it would raise the cost of electricity around 7 percent and price of gas around 11 percent to just $4.40 a gallon. We had gas prices like that in 2012; it was hardly the low-carbon transportation future we’re looking for. We shouldn’t expect any different this time around. In fact, in British Columbia, the model for the Washington proposal, greenhouse gas emissions went up all while two thirds of carbon revenues now support corporate tax cuts. You can explain it away, but that is a fact. An effective carbon pricing policy, at a minimum, must drive overall emissions down—"revenue-neutral" carbon pricing does not. Climate change is not a horseshoes and hand-grenades situation, we need substantive action not misdirection. 3. I-732’s "revenue-neutral" tax-cuts approach to carbon pricing is a step in the wrong direction and would be a devastating precedent for global climate action Sending the world a signal that "revenue-neutral" carbon pricing is our best hope for climate action would be a death wish for this planet. In burning through well over a billion dollars of carbon revenue each year, I-732 spends millions on corporate tax cuts, perhaps $50 million dollars to Boeing alone. If others follow, trillions globally could go toward tax breaks, when what is really needed is trillions invested in clean and affordable energy, transportation and housing. There is no magical pot of money to make these large investments happen—carbon revenues are our best shot. But I-732 would set a harmful precedent by short-changing ambitious climate action. It’s no wonder that the fossil fuel industry has not opposed I-732. In fact, Exxon supports the revenue-neutral approach, even while the industry attempted to squash an investment oriented approach in California (and lost). I-732 short-changes critical investments at a time when we need to significantly ramp-up the fight to save our climate. This is not the best we can do. We need to set a worthy precedent that shows the world that climate policy can be done right, that we are prepared to invest in equitable climate solutions.   4. It Does Nothing to Create A Just Transition to a Cleaner Economy A tax rebate provides no new solutions for workers who need to enter clean energy jobs, for a mother that wants to catch a bus to work, or for a business that wants to invest in a green building. We will not be bought by cheap tricks. Creating a just transition for workers, for frontline communities, and creating low-carbon infrastructure is not just a moral obligation, it’s a tactical obligation for so called "climate hawks." We will never get to more ambitious climate solutions if we don’t support the people who are most harmed by fossil fuels and the people most impacted by the transition. Instead, if we take care of communities and workers everyone will benefit. 5. I-732 wants to be tax reform, but carbon revenues aren’t the relief we’ve been looking for Washington State desperately needs tax reform, and that means an income tax. We all know it. Swapping one regressive tax for another is not "progressive tax reform." Trying to confound climate action with tax policy is a recipe for disaster for both people with lower incomes and the planet. Carbon revenues must decline over time and putting support for low income families on a narrow and declining source of revenue only sets us up for disaster in the long run. Of course it’s ironic that I-732 supporters claim tax reform at the same time they create a giant hole in the state budget. The Washington State Office of Financial Management (OFM) published their findings that “during the first six fiscal years, state General Fund revenue would decrease by a net amount of $797.2 million.” No entity is better equipped to make these projections than the state itself, despite I-732 supporters and their buddy’s attempts to discredit the bad news. This massive state budget hole will hurt Black, Brown, and poor communities hardest.   6. That’s why most people who care deeply about the climate and communities don’t support I-732 Van Jones, Naomi Klein, Climate Solutions, the Washington Environmental Council, the Sierra Club, the Washington State Labor Council, The Children’s Alliance, the Washington State Democratic Party, OneAmerica, Puget Sound Sage, the Asian Pacific Islander Coalition—none of them support I-732. Moreover, editorial boards across the state, including four members of the Stranger Election Control Board, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Columbian, the Yakima Herald Republic, and influential sources like the Progressive Voters Guide—they all oppose I-732 because it won’t effectively reduce climate change, it supports corporations over communities, and there are better options available. Go to www.dontbeneutral.org to learn more. 7. We can do better There is a better way: let’s put a price on carbon and invest the money in green jobs, clean energy, and the communities hit first and worst by fossil fuels. California has already done this with great success and the idea is moving forward in legislation in New York too. We can do the same in Washington. It will take a broad coalition to win, but that is what we have been building both in communities of color and with allies from across sectors. A No vote on I-732 is a demonstration of our commitment to the world that we won’t be fooled by false promises. We need a Just Transition and effective climate action. © 2016 The Stranger Jill Mangaliman Jill Mangaliman is executive director of Got Green in Seattle, Washington.
