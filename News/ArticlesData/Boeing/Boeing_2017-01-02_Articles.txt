(Photo: AP/Elaine Thompson) Beginning in 1979 in Seattle, WA, Jim Levitt expertly fabricated custom aircraft parts and tools, helping make the Boeing Company one of the most successful businesses in the world. But in 2013, corporate executives issued a threat: They demanded that Levitt and his fellow machinists surrender their pensions, and that Washington State political leaders hand over a record $8.7 billion in tax benefits. In exchange the company promised to keep production jobs in-state. The Democratic governor of Washington, along with virtually the entire political establishment, caved in to the blackmail. So did Levitt’s international union leadership – they had bargained the deal secretly with the company. The capitulation cost 32,000 Boeing workers their pensions. “We’ve lost collective bargaining, for all intents and purposes,” Levitt observed in the wake of the corporate blackmail. In recent weeks we’ve seen no shortage of reasons – and excuses – for why Hillary Clinton blew the election and Donald Trump will be our next president: the Russians, an unfair Electoral College system, FBI Director James Comey, xenophobia/racism/sexism, a weak Democratic candidate, Wikileaks, and faked news. Some Clinton backers even blame the “tough” primary run that Bernie Sanders gave their candidate. What’s barely given any attention in the mainstream media is the role that decades of destruction of union power played in the 2016 election debacle. But it’s no mystery to Levitt, his fellow Boeing workers, and millions of other workers from all walks of life who’ve justifiably grown cynical about a political establishment that repeatedly has failed them over the years. Today, overall union membership is at its lowest point in more than 70 years. In the private sector, a paltry 1 in 15 workers holds a union card. Now it will get worse: Public sector unions are bracing for the inevitable Supreme Court decision allowing “freeloading” – requiring unions to let workers avoid paying any dues while still receiving full union representation and protection. The incoming Congress promises to be hostile to worker organizations, eager to do on a national scale what Gov. Scott Walker has done to Wisconsin unions. Underscoring labor’s weakness, the election results produced the most anemic union turnout for the Democratic presidential candidate in more than 30 years: Clinton won union households by only 51 to 43 percent, an 8 percent margin. In the previous 7 presidential elections, in contrast, the Democrat won union households by an average margin of 22 percent. But it would be facile simply to blame Hillary Clinton for failing to inspire confidence and for running a bad campaign, or to credit Donald Trump for successfully tapping into the anger and frustration of working-class white voters and manipulating racism, sexism, and xenophobia to his benefit. That would tell only half of the story. The other half of the story is that past and present union leaders – like the top Machinist union leadership in 2013 – contributed to our current circumstances. The unraveling didn’t just happen suddenly. Over the last several decades, most leaders failed to lead in a bold, visionary direction to inspire millions to build power through collective organizing and action. Instead they clung to outdated assumptions about labor-management relations and remained stubbornly tethered to a political duopoly that has bestowed on us outsourced and exported jobs, stagnant wages, precarious employment schemes, terminated pension plans, rising health care costs, and an eviscerated social safety net. Most unions focused inward, instead of reaching out. Leaders thought their compromises were protecting good jobs, when in fact they were emboldening hostile corporate adversaries. Today, as union members and leaders, we find ourselves in a dead-end alley, surrounded by thugs brandishing crowbars and long knives. But we didn’t just get chased into the corner; too many unions went here willingly. To the extent that we recognize how we got here, we can begin to fight our way out of this corner. But it will be a tough fight. It will require us to reimagine the nature and role of unions, to discard failed strategies and assumptions, and to embrace new, deep labor-community-faith alliances. ~~~ Go back to the end of World War II: Union membership soared during the war, reaching a third of all workers. In the core of the nation’s economy, the manufacturing sector, fully 69 percent of production workers were covered by union agreements. Militant strikes during and right after the war pushed demands for a greater share of the economic pie along with social demands. In 1946 alone, 4.6 million workers went on strike – about 1 in every 20 in the paid US workforce. But rather than build on that nascent power, most union leaders determined to make peace with political and business elites, believing – incorrectly – that the tripartite domestic détente of World War II was still alive. Even before Senator Joe McCarthy’s witch hunts, unions started purging communists and other suspected radicals from their ranks, seeking to demonstrate their loyalty to government and business. The leadership of the labor federation that emerged in the 1950s, the AFL-CIO, steered away from organizing more workers. Federation president George Meany famously declared, “I used to worry about the size of the membership. I stopped worrying because to me it doesn’t make any difference. The organized fellow is the only fellow that counts.” Most union leaders focused on securing economic gains for their members, tamping down militant insurgency in the ranks and pledging allegiance to the capitalist economic system in exchange for collective bargaining agreements. The bargaining system has worked splendidly – at least for those fortunate to be covered by a union contract. By the new millennium, the average union member could expect to make 25 percent more than a worker not covered by a union contract. But flip side of the “union difference” touted proudly by so many was that it presented a huge incentive for corporate and political elites to attack union power, motivating them to accelerate union-busting, outsourcing, contracting out, and passing laws to hamstring unions. Most unions, in turn, focused defensively on protecting what they had, failing to appreciate that the antidote to the business offensive required organizing more workers into union ranks and fighting to raise benefits for all, not just some. Despite organizing initiatives by a few unions in recent years, the overall percentage of union members in the workforce has plunged from a post WWII high of 33 percent to barely 11 percent today. Worse, as union power ebbed and the American Dream of upward mobility slipped away, most union leaders clung reflexively to the Democratic Party for salvation. In 1976 they backed Jimmy Carter for president, expecting to win labor laws that would make organizing easier. Instead, Carter and an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress handed corporate America the tools to dismantle worker power: Trucking, railroad, and airline deregulation, along with new bankruptcy laws that authorized businesses to break union contracts and eliminate pensions. In 1992 unions counted on Bill Clinton to deliver jobs, but instead he pushed the job-killing North American Free Trade Agreement and eviscerated the nation’s welfare system. Even as workers became more productive, real wages stagnated. In 2008 labor had high hopes that Barack Obama would save workers but instead Wall Street got bailed out while nearly 9 million workers were fired, 14 million families lost their homes, and the president invested more political capital in promoting another horrible trade agreement – the Trans Pacific Partnership – than in backing modest labor law reform or a raise in the national minimum wage. Under Obama, union ranks have declined by another half a million workers, and US inequality has reached epic levels. In just the 24 months following the official end of the Great Recession in 2009, the gap in wealth between the richest 7 percent of households and the rest of us grew by $6.6 trillion. Even an immediate national minimum wage hike to $15 – obviously fantastical in today’s political reality – would offset just a tiny fraction of that recent growth in wealth disparity. Given all of that, the 2016 surprise isn’t that workers abandoned Democrats at the ballot box. Rather, the shocker is this: Why the heck didn’t they ditch them a lot sooner? For the last several decades we’ve had labor leaders who counseled union members to make pragmatic political choices, warning that the alternative to mediocre candidates was a lot worse. That was certainly true this past fall. But if there’s any single takeaway about working class voters in the 2016 campaign – from Bernie Sanders’s remarkable insurgency to Donald Trump’s brutal and ugly win – it’s a rejection of the establishment of both major political parties and the narrow mindset of lesser-evilism. Workers deserve better. The salvation of unions, and more generally, of the US working class, resides not in struggling to fix a broken national Democratic Party that repeatedly has betrayed workers, but in joining with allies to fight the coming Trump onslaught – and then to go beyond that to define a bold, unapologetic vision of society and economy, one that inspires millions of workers to engage and take action. This fight isn’t about blue states vs. red states, urban vs. rural, immigrant vs. native-born – all false frames that are intentionally deployed to divide and weaken working people – but about the 99 percent against the billionaire class and their political allies. It’s a fight about power and our societal values. For those of us in unions, it means we have to use all of the tools at our disposal to defend what we still have – at the bargaining table, on the shop floor, and in legislative halls – but then go beyond to forge new powerful community alliances to demand health care, quality education, civil rights, food and shelter, and fair wages for all. Indeed, the pinnacle achievements of US unions – think social security, minimum wages, safety laws – took place when labor acted not out of narrow self-interest, but as part of a broad social movement; not as a co-dependent of a political party, but as an independent force in politics. In other parts of the world, particularly among societies in the global south, such formations are called social movement unions: Bold movements that recognize the singular nature of a justice fight spanning workplace and community, and the inseparability of the fights for economic, racial, and social justice. Here’s some good news: The elements of social movement unionism already are among us, embedded in the leading justice struggles today. Chicago teachers have struck to defend the bedrock principle of quality public education for all, and in doing so have united with parents to push back against the corporatization of our schools. Uber and other rideshare drivers have organized strikes to demand new laws protecting their right to organize. Several unions, including the Service Employees International Union, the Communications Workers of America, and National Nurses United, built important new alliances when they stood with the Standing Rock Sioux’s efforts to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. In the city of SeaTac, just south of Seattle, low-wage immigrant airport workers, Muslim and Christian faith activists, and community members took on an improbable battle against corporate and political giants to organize a breakthrough $15 ballot initiative, helping to spark a national movement. (I was privileged to have been the campaign director.) In North Carolina and beyond, the Rev. William J. Barber II has united faith leaders, union members, and immigration-rights activists in a powerful Moral Mondays movement to reclaim democracy and raise the call for a moral economy. What connects these varied efforts is the common awareness that the fight is not just about workplace issues, but is about societal values, and that through unity and struggle a better world is possible. Also common to these fights is the recognition that a potent, sustained movement must rest on more than economic and political principles. It also must draw upon the values that emanate from our deepest human emotions and desires for justice and community. The call for spiritual morality, whether advanced by organized religion or secular humanist yearnings, has played a decisive role in leading struggles throughout history. The civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s and the abolitionist movement of a century earlier are but two examples of struggles that were propelled forward by powerful calls for spiritual morality. Today, the embryonic movements that fuse direct action with a spiritually based call for justice offer similar promise. None of these examples, of course, represents a full-fledged social movement union. But each contains at least a rudimentary recognition that the fight is about power, each recognizes the need to build broad alliances of the 99 percent, to disrupt convention and circumvent broken law, and each contains bold strategies that we can employ in building a formidable new labor movement. And, importantly, each of these campaigns challenges unions to think differently about their role in the world – to act expansively, to link arms with new friends, and to articulate a bold vision of justice. Back at Boeing, Levitt retired right after the 2013 pension debacle but his union colleagues went on to take steps to reclaim power and voice: They forced the retirement of their international union president, who had promoted the pension giveaway; secured a new membership bill of rights within their union; and stepped up organizing at Boeing contractors. Our job in 2017 and beyond is to nurture and build on these promising movements, challenging ourselves and others to think bigger and bolder, to focus not just on winning discrete campaigns, but on building a movement that has a moral foundation and vision. Indeed, the gift that Trump’s ascension gives us – perverse as that may sound – is that his victory strips away any illusions about the depth of organized labor’s existential crisis. Now there is no question that our collective backs are against the wall, and the only way forward is to fight back by uniting broadly and reclaiming the movement’s larger social purpose to lift up the dignity and value of all working people. © 2017 Tikkun Jonathan Rosenblum Jonathan Rosenblum is a union and community organizer living in Seattle, WA.

SCOUT Sign In Share & Embed New Navy Osprey Variant Brings Longer Range, New Radios Kris Osborn 01/03/2017 / Originally published onWarrior The new Navy Osprey will have a longer range, improved radios and greater fuel carrying capacity than the existing Osprey. It will both hover like a helicopter and reach airplane speeds as fast as 280mph. The Navy is in the early stages of building its own variant of the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft to perform its critical Carrier-Onboard-Delivery mission to delivery forces, supplies and weapons to forward-stationed ships at sea. The service plans to procure 44 new CMV-22B Ospreys for the COD mission, replacing the 1960’s era C-2 Greyhound aircraft. The C-2 Greyhound is a twin-engine, high-wing cargo aircraft first introduced in the 1960s. Since that time, 35 C-2s have been in the Navy inventory, service officials said. Unlike the C-2 fixed wing aircraft, which requires a catapult to lift off of the deck of a carrier, the Osprey tiltrotor can both reach airplane speeds of 220mph and also hover like a helicopter such that it can come in for vertical landings on the carrier deck. “280mph is the maximum speed,” Rick Lemaster, Director for Business Development, Bell Boeing, told Scout Warrior in an interview.    The Navy has contracted Bell-Boeing to develop the engineering changes needed to meet this range requirement, as well as the other changes, to enable the CMV-22B to fulfill Navy's COD mission.  New Technologies for the Navy Osprey The new Navy Osprey variant will be engineered with some new technologies and additional fuel carrying capacity to achieve a longer range than the existing MV-22 Marine Corps Osprey, however the Navy and Bell-Boeing are taking special measure to maximize commonality between the two services’ variants.  “Bell-Boeing will examine various methods to meet the range requirement, including additional fuel and how to carry it. The solution will be incorporated as a "cut-in production" engineering change to the MV-22B, producing the CMV-22B,” Navy spokesman Ensign Marc Rockwellpate told Scout Warrior. The Navy’s Osprey will add more than 200 miles to the Nautical range of the existing Corps' variant of the aircraft in order to extend its reach out to sea on-board aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. “The Navy's operational range requirement for the Carrier Onboard Delivery mission is 1,150 nautical miles.  This is required to provide long range aerial logistics support of the Seabase, and reflects an increase of approximately 200 nautical miles to the baseline MV-22B,” Rockwellpate said.  The new Osprey, slated to first be operational by 2021, will perform the full range of missions currently executed by the C-2s. This includes VIP transport, humanitarian relief mission and regular efforts to deliver food, spare parts and equipment for sailors aboard carriers. Also, C-2 aircraft has a reconfigurable cargo bay which can create space for 12-stretchers for medical evacuation and transport. The existing Corps MV-22 Osprey is also known for what is called "mounted vertical maneuver" wherein Marines use the speed, range and maneuverability of the Osprey to fly in behind enemy lines, land vertically and conduct a range of operations, including assisting amphibious missions. The Osprey can transport Marines, equipment and weapons systems with a combat radius of 450 miles. The new, in-development Navy variant will extend this combat radius to allow for ocean transport of supplies, equipment and weapons to assets on the open seas far from shore. The aircraft can also move important cargo between ships such as carriers and amphibs.  In addition, the Osprey is being developed as a tanker aircraft able to perform aerial refueling missions; the idea is to transport fuel and use a probe technology to deliver fuel to key aircraft such as an F/A-18 or F-35C.  The first Navy Ospreys will be procured in 2018 with some early “long-lead” items acquired in 2017, Lemaster said. Some of the requirements for the new aircraft have already been established, there are other still in the process of being determined and refined. “The Navy Osprey will have increased range and we are still working toward the engineered changes that will give them all the requirements and range they are looking for,” Brian Roby, Bell Field Manager, San Diego, told Scout Warrior in an interview.   While the Navy’s aerial delivery mission does not require an armed aircraft, there will be occasions which require the aircraft to operate from forward bases in a higher threat environment, Rockwellpate said.   The Marine Corps, however, is in the early stages of determining requirements to arm their MV-22 Osprey with rockets or other kinds of weapons.  “In order to decrease this risk, the CMV-22B will retain the MV-22B's survivability systems, which include a missile warning system as well as chaff and flares,” Rockwellpate explained. The CMV-22B will also be configured with a high frequency radio to provide a redundant "Beyond line of Sight" safety of flight communications capability, reducing risk during long-range over-water flights to an underway Carrier Strike Group, he added.  “They are looking at all the requirements still. It’s going to have as a minimum as 400 cubic feet. What we have is about 439 cubic feet,” Roby said.  Also, in order to successfully perform the long-range aerial logistics support mission, the CMV-22B must be interoperable with US and international civil aviation and military air traffic management systems.  In preparation for these developments, the Navy’s Atlantic Fleet completed a military utility assessment several years ago wherein they conducted Osprey flights from Mayport, Fla., and Norfolk, Va., to the USS Harry Truman out at sea. The idea for the flights was to assess the viability of the V-22 Osprey to perform COD missions to and from the deck of the aircraft carrier, Navy officials said.

Boeing recently delivered the 500th jet of the series. Advertisement Boeing Commercial Airplanes (Boeing Corp IW500/9) has settled terms with Delta Air after the carrier cancelled an order for 18 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner jets, a contract worth $4 billion at current list prices. Delta had inherited the purchase commitment from Northwest Airlines, the rival carrier it acquired in a $2.6-billion share-exchange in 2008.  Subsequently, in 2010, Delta negotiated a deferred delivery on the planes until after 2020. Related Boeing Delivers the 500th Dreamliner Delta Increases Order for New Airbus Jets, Engines The specific terms of the Delta-Boeing settlement were not announced, but the airline noted it would take delivery of 120 new 737-900ER aircraft, through 2019. “This business decision is consistent with Delta’s fleet strategy to prudently address our widebody aircraft needs,” according to a statement by Delta senior vice president Greg May. While Delta also deferred delivery for four Airbus A350s earlier this year, from 2018 to 2019-2020, it still has orders for 25 of those widebody jets, as well as 25 A330neo jets.

Photo: AP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:35 PM, January 3, 2017 NEW YORK — Mr Donald Trump has singled out a number of companies individually before and after winning the US presidential election. Here’s a quick rundown of the businesses he’s targeted and what he has said: AMAZON “If (at)amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The (at)washingtonpost scam is saving it!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 7, 2015. CARRIER “Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the US Thanks Carrier.” Mr Trump tweeted on Nov. 29, 2016. FORD MOTOR “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Mr Trump said in a series of tweets on Nov 17, 2016. LOCKHEED MARTIN AND BOEING “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 22, 2016. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than US$4 billion (S$5.8 billion). Cancel order!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 6, 2016. GENERAL MOTORS “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!” Mr Trump tweeted on Jan 3, 2017. MACY’S “Good news, disloyal (at)Macys stock is in a total free fall. Don’t shop there for Christmas!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 4, 2015. T-MOBILE US “.(at)JohnLegere (at)TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers.” Mr Trump tweeted on Nov 15, 2015. REXNORD “Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!” Mr Trump tweeted on Dec 2, 2016. BUSINESSES IN GENERAL “The US is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the US...without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies...wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but...but these companies are able to move between all 50 states and negotiate a tax free deal! Our country cannot keep losing these jobs, & won’t. These companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very....expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.” Mr Trump said in a series of tweets on Dec 4, 2016.

Here’s a quick rundown of the businesses he’s targeted and what he has said. Amazon “If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 7, 2015. Thrift Savings Plan: The problem with the I Fund Carrier Advertisement “Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier.” Trump tweeted on Nov. 29, 2016. Ford Motor Co. “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump said in a series of tweets on Nov. 17, 2016 Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 22, 2016. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 6, 2016. General Motors Co. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” Trump tweeted on Jan. 3, 2017. Macy’s Inc. “Good news, disloyal @Macys stock is in a total free fall. Don’t shop there for Christmas!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 4, 2015. T-Mobile US .@JohnLegere @TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers. Trump tweeted on Nov. 15, 2015 Rexnord “Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!” Trump tweeted on Dec. 2, 2016. Businesses in General “The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S….without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies…wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but…but these companies are able to move between all 50 states and negotiate a tax free deal! Our country cannot keep losing these jobs, & won’t. These companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very….expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.” Trump said in a series of tweets on Dec. 4, 2016.

By MarketWatch As the likes of Boeing BA, +0.34% and Lockheed Martin LMT, +0.76% learned previously, and GM, -0.45% discovered today, catching the attention of President-elect Donald Trump is not necessarily great news for a company or its shareholders, at least in the near term. For stock-market pros, it’s created a brave new world, as Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co., told MarketWatch early Tuesday. ‘Trump is making it both easy and difficult for stock pickers.

President-elect Donald Trump has laid out a sweeping defense and foreign policy agenda, from calling for a major defense buildup to vowing to quickly defeat the Islamic State to promising warmer relations with Russia. And his actions since Election Day have shown the defense world the unexpected, as he's gone on Twitter to go after the two biggest U.S. defense contractors, Lockheed Martin and Boeing.” Here are six big defense issues we’re watching in the new year: Story Continued Below — The budget: Republican defense hawks will almost certainly push for major increases in defense spending. Trump has pledged to embark on a massive military buildup while congressional Republicans have long pushed to end the caps on Pentagon spending set by the Budget Control Act. —Trump vs. defense industry: Trump has quickly made clear it won’t be business as usual for the defense industry in his administration. The president-elect has used his Twitter to target both Lockheed Martin and Boeing, slamming Lockheed’s F-35 program and Boeing’s new Air Force One. — Mattis as Defense secretary: Once James Mattis is confirmed as Trump’s Pentagon chief — despite the issues surrounding the legislative waiver he needs, Mattis’ confirmation is a near-lock — the key question is how the blunt-talking, retired four-star Marine general navigates within the Trump administration. — Fighting the Islamic State: Guided by a secret plan he says he's not ready to reveal, Trump has promised to quickly defeat the Islamic State abroad and to root out radicalism at home. Trump announced on the campaign trail he wants top military leaders to formulate a plan within 30 days of his administration to defeat the terrorist group. — Trump vs. McCain: Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain is poised to play a chief Republican foil to Trump. The Arizona senator has called for a Select Committee in Congress to investigate Russia’s meddling in the presidential campaign — a notion Trump contests. Still, McCain could be an ally for Trump on some issues, particularly Pentagon acquisition. — Guantanamo Bay: The fight over President Barack Obama’s effort to shutter the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is likely to fizzle under Trump, who opposes closing Guantanamo. But it’s unclear if he plans to resume sending prisoners there. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged he’d “load it up with some bad dudes. WHAT TO WATCH THIS WEEK — SASC TEES UP RUSSIA CYBER HEARING AHEAD OF INAUGURATION DAY: Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain is wasting no time in the new Congress taking on the president-elect on Russia. The Arizona Republican has scheduled a hearing on cyber threats for Thursday, where Russia's election-year hacking will take center stage. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, National Security Agency and Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers and Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Marcel Lettre are scheduled to testify. McCain and his Senate ally, Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), toured eastern Europe over the past week, with a visit to Ukraine on Monday where they slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia last week over the election-year hacking, McCain and Graham said they’d push for even stronger ones in the new Congress. — TRUMP SET TO GET HIS OWN SPECIAL INTEL BRIEFING THIS WEEK: While Trump has continued to dispute the U.S. intelligence conclusions that Russia was behind the election-year hacking of the Democratic National Committee, he’s supposed to get a special intelligence briefing this week. Asked about the hacking at a Mar-a-Lago New Year’s party in Florida, Trump told reporters he knows "things that other people don't know. And so they cannot be sure of the situation." Asked what he knows, Trump said: "You'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday." FOR YOUR RADAR — SASC’S MATTIS GAME PLAN: The Senate Armed Services panel is facing double duty with the confirmation of Mattis as Defense secretary — considering his nomination in addition to the congressional waiver allowing him to serve as Pentagon chief as a recently retired Marine general. To accomplish that, the panel is planning a Jan. 10 hearing without outside experts on civilian control of the military, according to sources familiar with the committee’s planning. Then, the committee plans to hold Mattis’ confirmation hearing on Jan. 12, although Democrats may yet object to that schedule over their demands not to hold simultaneous confirmation hearings for Trump’s Cabinet picks. Following that hearing, the committee intends to mark up the waiver to send it to the Senate floor. The goal, according to one source, is to have the waiver completed before Jan. 20, when Trump is sworn in and will officially nominate Mattis for the Pentagon post.

It’s gonna be a very busy new year, so keep the tips, pitches and feedback coming at jherb@politico.com, and follow on Twitter @jeremyherb, @morningdefense and @politicopro. HAPPENING TODAY — THE NEW CONGRESS IS SWORN IN: The 115th Congress is officially sworn in today, kicking off the beginning of Republican-dominated government in Washington. The new Congress has teed up a lengthy to-do list, with confirmation battles, a Republican assault on Obamacare— and, more than likely, hints of Republican infighting to come, report our colleagues Rachael Bade and Elana Schor. As their first action, House Republicans voted Monday evening to gut their own ethics watchdog that was set up after the Jack Abramoff scandal. NEW YEAR, NEW VIOLENCE CLAIMED BY ISIL: A gunman attacked a Turkish nightclub on New Year’s Eve, and dozens were killed in a Baghdad market bombing on Monday. And the Islamic State claimed both attacks. More here on the deadly Istanbul slaying from The Washington Post’s Erin Cunningham and Heda Habib: “The Islamic State claimed responsibility Monday for a deadly rampage at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year’s Eve, an assault by a single gunman that killed dozens of people and served as a brutal reminder of the consequences of Turkey’s expanding war with the jihadists in Syria. A statement posted online said that a ‘heroic soldier of the caliphate’ had attacked the nightclub with grenades and a rifle in ‘revenge for God’s religion’ and in response to orders from the Islamic State’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who recently urged his followers to attack Turkey.” Turkey arrests 12 in connection with the nightclub shooting and vowed to “speedily” identify the suspect, reports the BBC. — SUICIDE BOMBER HITS BAGHDAD MARKET, via The Associated Press: “A suicide bomber driving a pickup loaded with explosives struck a bustling market in Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 36 people in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group hours after French President Francois Hollande arrived in the Iraqi capital. The bomb went off in a fruit and vegetable market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded.” KIM JONG UN’S NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTION — A MISSILE THAT CAN HIT U.S., and experts warn the North Korean’s leader’s threat is plausible, reports Reuters’ James Pearson: “North Korea has been working through 2016 on developing components for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), making the isolated nation's claim that it was close to a test-launch plausible, international weapons experts said on Monday. "North Korea has been testing rocket engines and heat-shields for an ICBM while developing the technology to guide a missile after re-entry into the atmosphere following a lift-off, the experts said. While Pyongyang is close to a test, it is likely to take some years to perfect the weapon.” — TRUMP TWEETS ‘IT WON’T HAPPEN!,’ though the president-elect didn’t elaborate beyond 140 characters, via our colleague Rebecca Morin: “President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Monday evening that North Korea won't reach the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon that will be able to hit the United States. ‘North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!’ the president-elect wrote.” INDUSTRY INTEL — SPACEX PLANS TO LAUNCH AGAIN, writes The Wall Street Journal: “Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. said it plans to resume rocket launches on Jan. 8, using revised operational practices developed in response to a fiery accident that occurred during routine ground preparations last fall. The tentative blastoff date for the Falcon 9 from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base is subject to results of testing later this week, industry officials said, and still could change.” MAKING MOVES, TRUMP TEAM EDITION: The president-elect is expected to name Marc Short, a top adviser to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, to lead the White House legislative affairs shop, reports POLITICO’s Shane Goldmacher. Rick Dearborn, executive director of the presidential transition and a longtime chief of staff to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), was originally in line for the legislative affairs post, but is now expected to be named a deputy White House chief of staff. Trump this morning also named Robert Lighthizer, a veteran trade attorney and supporter of Trump's defensive view of trade, as his pick for the next U.S. trade representative. But in Trump’s quest for a VA secretary both Luis Quinonez and Toby Cosgrove have withdrawn from consideration, reports Leo Shane of the Military Times.

Bush has not phoned his successor once removed with a crisp message, he should do so immediately. Six words are enough. "Donald, you are not president yet!" And, the 43rd president might have added, "And please do a little more homework before sounding off." The intervention of Trump via Twitter and MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski into the most vital and potentially existential national security issues is, at best, unhelpful. These tweets followed the post- election congratulatory phone calls Trump accepted from the Taiwan president and Pakistani prime minister. The first called into question the 45-year-old "one China policy." The second provoked India. More seriously, Trump has called for "greatly strengthening and expanding" our nuclear weapons and boasted about winning a nuclear arms race against Russia; rejected the Obama administration's abstention of a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel for expanding settlements into the occupied territories; and threatened two major defense contractors -- Boeing over the cost of the next Air Force One and Lockheed Martin over the huge cost growth of the F-35 Lightning II fifth-generation fighter. Since Dwight Eisenhower promised to go to Korea to end that war in 1952, no other president-elect has imposed himself so dramatically on the political scene as has Trump. The president-elect has done this with 140 characters rather than press conferences or written op-ed pieces. Serious people worry whether these interventions help or hurt American security, especially when each appears to be an instinctive rather than a well thought-out response. And many fear this style of instant reaction is indicative of what will be a very active presidential bull in a very fragile china shop. Concerning the need for fuller understanding and knowledge of the issues, consider the tweets about nuclear weapons and the costs of Air Force One and the F-35 Lightning. During the campaign, Trump did not seem to understand what the nuclear triad of land, sea and air deterrent forces was or meant. Nor did he acknowledge that both Russia and America have signed the New START treaty limiting both sides to 1,550 strategic launchers and about 5,000 warheads. If Trump was reacting to Russian President Vladimir Putin's meeting with his senior military leaders in which Putin vowed to make Russian strategic nuclear capabilities sufficient to defeat the West's defensive anti-ballistic systems, did he appreciate the argument the Russian president was making? The answer appears to be no. Regarding Boeing and Air Force One, while the company's CEO Dennis Muilenberg pledged to keep the cost below $4 billion, that is not his or Boeing's call. It is the White House that sets Air Force One's requirements to protect the president from all dangers whether kinetic or electronic that drive costs. In prompting Boeing for an F-18 Super Hornet alternative to the F-35, did anyone advise the president that such a request had been made before and proved to be unworkable? Or did Trump know that only the Navy and Marines fly the F-18 not the Air Force? And did anyone inform the chief executive-to-be that eight other nations are planning to buy or have bought F-35s so that cuts to the program could be disastrous for this coalition? But suppose Trump had taken a different tack based on a fuller understanding of these issues. He could have reminded Putin that Ronald Reagan helped bankrupt the Soviet Union with the Strategic Defense Initiative. That tweet might have said: "Vlad, Star Wars broke you last time. Don't force us to do it again!" About Air Force One, a tweet might have read: "$4 billion for AF One is outrageous. We will ensure the price is right." And instead of trying to leverage Lockheed Martin's F-35 costs with an upgraded Super Hornet, the next commander-in-chief could have proposed: "Unmanned aerial vehicles are smart, effective and can create jobs. Boeing and Lockheed, what can you do about that?" Whatever one thinks of the president-elect, the greater challenge is not to make America great again. The challenge is to confront and fix the myriad problems, many irrational and self-imposed by a government in gridlock, that got Trump elected in the first place. Instinct is important provided it is headed in the proper direction. Instinct based on fuller knowledge and understanding is even better. Perhaps the 43rd and 44th presidents can pass that message to the 45th. Harlan Ullman is a senior adviser at Washington D.C.'s Atlantic Council and chairman of two private companies. His next book, due out next year, is "Anatomy of Failure: Why America Loses Wars It Starts," which argues that failure to know and to understand the circumstances in which force is used guarantees failure.

Here's what it means for both companies. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Jan 3, 2017 at 8:10AM More than a decade ago, Northwest Airlines ordered 18 787-8 Dreamliners from Boeing (NYSE:BA), becoming the aircraft's North American launch customer. However, this order has been on the rocks ever since Northwest merged with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). In 2010, in a bid to slash capital spending, Delta deferred all of its 787 deliveries to 2020 and beyond. In late 2014, it ordered 50 modern widebodies from Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) -- with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2017 -- casting more doubt on its continued interest in the Dreamliner. Delta has ordered dozens of widebodies from Airbus recently. Image source: Delta Air Lines. Last week, Delta Air Lines took the final step, officially canceling its entire order for 18 787-8 Dreamliners. Delta pulls the trigger Delta's decision to cancel its Dreamliner order had been anticipated by airline analysts for many years. When Delta ordered the 737-900ER narrowbody plane from Boeing several years ago, it negotiated the right to substitute those 737-900ER orders for its existing Dreamliner orders on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This unusual agreement may explain the timing of the order cancellation announcement. Based on Boeing's current price list, 18 787-8 Dreamliners would be roughly equivalent in price to 40 737-900ERs. Given that Delta only has 51 remaining orders for 737-900ERs, it may have been running out of time to cancel its Dreamliner order penalty-free. Delta doesn't need more widebodies -- for now Since 2013, Delta Air Lines has ordered 60 widebodies from Airbus: 10 A330-300s, 25 A350-900s, and 25 A330-900neos. Eight of those planes have already been delivered, with the other 52 set to arrive over the next six years or so. Delta will receive its first A350 later this year. Image source: Airbus. These planes will mainly be used to replace Delta's remaining Boeing 747s and its older 767s. Delta will retire its last seven 747s in 2017. Among its 767s configured for international service, 24 were built between 1990 and 1996 and will be ripe for retirement between now and the early 2020s. However, the majority of Delta's internationally configured 767s -- 55 to be exact -- were built between 1997 and 2002. Given Delta's penchant for keeping older aircraft in service for as long as possible, these planes are likely to remain in its fleet until the mid-late 2020s. Thus, Delta already has more than enough Airbus widebodies on order to meet its replacement needs over the next six years or so. Meanwhile, rampant overcapacity on international routes limits the number of attractive long-haul expansion opportunities in the near term. Furthermore, facility constraints at Delta's new transpacific hub in Seattle will likely prevent the company from adding new international routes there until at least 2019. Indeed, Delta deferred part of its A350 order earlier this year in order to slow its growth rate over the next few years. Clearly, it has no need for additional widebody aircraft in the early 2020s, when the Dreamliners were scheduled to arrive. Delta could still buy Boeing's Dreamliner later Delta's existing orders with Airbus fully cover its widebody needs through at least 2022 or 2023. However, looking ahead to the mid-late 2020s, Delta will need to replace dozens of widebodies that it received in the late 1990s and early 2000s. That could create an opening for Delta to reorder Boeing's Dreamliner. Many of Delta's widebodies were built between 1998 and 2002. Image source: Delta Air Lines. Delta Air Lines executives have been explicit in recent years that they want to operate a mix of Boeing and Airbus planes in order to keep the pressure on both manufacturers to offer rock-bottom pricing. Thus, Airbus' recent run of widebody orders from Delta may reflect an attempt to balance out the fleet rather than a permanent decision to shift from Boeing to Airbus. Of course, it's possible that Delta will turn to the used aircraft market to fulfill some of its future widebody replacement needs. That said, the costs of refurbishing a widebody plane can be quite significant. Furthermore, by the mid-2020s, Dreamliner production costs -- particularly for the most popular variant, the 787-9 -- will have declined significantly from today's level. That will enable Boeing to offer lower prices. Ultimately, canceling its Dreamliner order was a no-brainer for Delta. It's not a big deal for Boeing either, as the 787-8 model is barely profitable. And Delta will still have an opportunity to reevaluate the Boeing 787 a few years down the road, when its newer 767s start to approach retirement age.

See related  Donald Trump's most outrageous quotes Melania Trump: 15 things you didn't know about Donald's wife How did Donald Trump win the presidency? He told a press conference yesterday that he was handing control of the vast Trump Organization to his two sons, Eric and Donald Jr. He said that the company would not make any new foreign deals during his presidency. The measures were immediately criticised by Walter Shaub, the director of the US Office of Government Ethics, who said they would leave the president vulnerable to "suspicions of corruption", says the New York Times. He added that Trump should sell his company and place the assets in a blind trust run by a truly independent trustee approved by the ethics office, not a family member.  "His sons are still running the businesses, and, of course, he knows what he owns." Shaub was appointed by Barack Obama, but also served during the presidency of his Republican predecessor George W Bush. The ethics office "sets standards for 2.7 million employees in the White House and more than 130 executive branch agencies". "No modern president has entered the White House with such a complicated array of holdings," says the Times. According to Shaub, "every modern president has taken the strong medicine of divestiture". It's a very rare step for the ethics chief to comment publicly on a President-elect's plans. The Guardian says that Trump's team did not informed Shaub's office of his plans. The paper quoted Shaub as saying that he was "especially troubled" by plans to put liquid assets in a portfolio approved by ethics officials. "No one has ever talked to us about the idea, and there's no legal mechanism to do that," he said. Sheri Dillon, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, told the Times that many of the alternatives the ethics lawyers had advocated, such as selling off Trump's business assets entirely or putting them in a blind trust, were not practical. Responding to calls to put his assets in a blind trust, she said that Trump "can't unknow he owns Trump Tower, and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicised". "In addition, Dillon said, the price of a sale of assets would draw scrutiny, and… Trump would still be owed royalties". Donald Trump has to 'grow up', Joe Biden says 6 January Joe Biden has publicly declared that Donald Trump needs to "grow up" as he criticised the president-elect's attacks on the US intelligence community.   In a damning interview on PBS NewsHour, the outgoing vice president told the businessman: "Grow up, Donald. Grow up. Time to be an adult. You're president. You've got to do something. Show us what you have." He added it was "worrisome" that Trump, who takes power in two weeks, was still questioning the intelligence agencies' "overwhelming consensus" that Russia deliberately meddled in the US presidential election by hacking Democratic computers.  "For a president not to have confidence in, not to be prepared to listen to, the myriad intelligence agencies, from defence intelligence to the CIA, is absolutely mindless," he said. "The idea that you may know more than the intelligence community knows - it's like saying, 'I know more about physics than my professor. I didn't read the book, I just know I know more.'" Biden also criticised Trump's vow to repeal the Obamacare healthcare plan, saying the future president, while a "good man", lacked knowledge of the system. This is not the first time he has rounded on the Republican; the pair often clashed during the election campaign, particularly after a tape emerged of Trump talking about groping women, which the vice president said was "a textbook definition of sexual assault. Biden also told PBS that he will pursue non-political activities, including working with universities on domestic and foreign policy issues, after leaving office this month. He has said previously that he regrets not running for the White House "every day", although he has not ruled out what would be a third tilt at the presidency in 2020.  In one of his last acts as vice president, Biden will today preside over a joint session of Congress to formally confirm Trump's presidency, the Daily Telegraph reports. Donald Trump: Why he is siding with Julian Assange against US intelligence community  5 January Donald Trump has set himself on a collision course with US intelligence services after publicly criticising senior officials and siding against them with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The president-elect mocked the US intelligence agencies due to brief him on alleged Russian hacking of US political groups in a tweet on Wednesday. The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017 "It was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief," says CNN, and again put him at odds with the agencies' unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election. Despite being elected in November, Trump is yet to meet the heads of US intelligence agencies, although he has repeatedly questioned their assessment of Russian cyber activity. In another sign of increasing tension between the intelligence community and the president-elect, Trump also tweeted his support for Assange after he told Fox News that Moscow was not the source for WikiLeaks's mass leak of emails from the Democrats. Both the FBI and CIA say the leaked information was intended to sway the presidential election in Trump's favour. However, Assange claimed a 14-year-old boy could have carried out one of the hacks and accused the Obama administration of attempting to "delegitimise" a Trump presidency by falsely tying Russia to the attack. Trump's support represents an astonishing change in fortunes for the Australian hacker, who was publically vilified by conservatives, including Fox News, when he leaked US military secrets and published classified diplomatic cables in 2010. However, while Trump appears to be on his side, Assange has continued to face criticism from other Republicans. House Speaker Paul Ryan called him a "a sycophant for Russia", later adding: "He leaks, he steals data and he compromises national security."  Senator Mark Warner, vice president of the US intelligence committee, also said the president-elect should have more "respect" for intelligence professionals. Trump has previously criticised the spy agencies for the faulty intelligence about Iraq's supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction before the US invasion in 2003. However, "to publicly embarrass some of the most senior intelligence officials in the country and question their motives is unprecedented for a president-elect or incumbent president", says The Independent. Donald Trump dismisses North Korean missile tests in tweet 3 January Donald Trump has shot down North Korea's claim that it is close to testing long-range missiles capable of targeting the United States. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made the claim in his New Year message, saying the country was almost ready to test intercontinental ballistic missiles that could carry nuclear warheads. However, the US president-elect derided the suggesting, tweeting simply: "It won't happen!" North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 Trump also took aim at China over the issue, writing: "China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!" See related  Donald Trump's most outrageous quotes Melania Trump: 15 things you didn't know about Donald's wife How did Donald Trump win the presidency? It is Trump's first comment on North Korea's nuclear plans since the US presidential election in November. Prior to that, he had said he might be prepared to have a burger with Kim. South Korea said Trump's message showed he understood the seriousness of the situation and could be interpreted as a "clear warning" to Pyongyang.    "President-elect Trump and US officials are clearly aware of the gravity and urgency of the North Korean nuclear threat," ministry spokesman Cho June-hyuck told a briefing, reports Reuters. "There are no ifs or buts in Mr Trump's tweet," the BBC says, adding that the message could mean the president-elect believes North Korea will not be able to finalise the technology or that he thinks the two countries could reach an agreement for it to terminate its nuclear programme. It could also imply Trump is considering military action, although experts, who calculate Pyongyang is less than five years from conducting successful tests, believe that would be ineffectual. Methods such as "bunker-busting" bombs would be unlikely to halt the programme, while cyber warfare or the assassination of top scientists would also be difficult. The US has dismissed North Korea's attempts to hold talks over the years, saying it must disarm first.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Mukilteo aerospace supplier has a social-service mission, too Dan Catchpole Tue Jan 3rd, 2017 7:45am BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. MUKILTEO — Walk through Orion Industries’ Mukilteo plant and you’ll see airplane innards — wire bundles, part of a light fixture for front-landing gear, air vents. They are some of the roughly 2 million parts its manufacturing division provides to Boeing and other aerospace companies. Unlike its competitors, Orion Industries is not simply serving its bottom line. It is a nonprofit that combines commercial success with a social mission. The Auburn-based company provides counseling and job training for people who have challenges to landing a job on their own, challenges such as neurological, developmental or psychological disabilities. Trainees may have had trouble in the job market, but Orion is not about hand-holding or creating busy work, said Tom Brosius, its vice president and general manager. “To bring in a program participant, they have to be creating value pretty quickly” on balance. Despite its social mission, Orion has to competitively bid against local and international companies for work. Its products are on every Boeing commercial and military airplane. It also provides parts to other airplane makers — including Bombardier, Airbus and Gulfstream — and major aerospace suppliers such as Triumph, Spirit Aerospace and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Orion was named a Boeing Supplier of the Year in 2011 and 2015. “The main thing is to get parts out on time” and to spec, said Rodney Goodwin, a machinist in the Mukilteo plant. “We do quality work.” Sometimes that means a rush job turning out a spare part for an aircraft stranded on the ground. It has to be done quickly and properly. The company has a simple philosophy when assessing newcomers for training. “Everybody’s good at something. Most people aren’t good at everything,” Brosius said. Some people learn machine tooling and get manufacturing jobs. Others learn customer service and find work at a restaurant. Some find jobs at Orion. In 2015, 56 percent of participants went into manufacturing and production, 15 percent into customer service and 29 percent into other industries — including one carpenter, a bus driver and an IT consultant. The company has a call center in Auburn that has about 70 employees, including 12 people from Orion’s training program. The company handles calls for major clients, such as Microsoft and the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. “If you need a fishing license at 3 a.m., you’ll talk to someone at Orion,” Brosius said. Orion has about 400 employees, and serves more than 300 people a year. It acquired the Mukilteo plant in September when it merged with Diversified Industrial Services, a nonprofit with a similar mission. Orion Industries was founded in 1957 by several south King County families who had relatives with disabilities that limited their options. They started making wooden toys in a church basement, Brosius said. “A lot of the families were Boeing families,” and within two years, Orion was making parts for the 707, Boeing’s first jetliner, he said. Most participants now are referred to Orion by two state agencies: the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation and the Developmental Disabilities Administration. Both are under the Department of Social and Health Services. They are matched with training programs that best fit their strengths and weaknesses. They are assigned mentors, who provide on-the-job training. They also receive counseling and other support along the way and after landing a job. The need to have someone be a mentor and a worker can make it hard to fill openings, especially for high-skill jobs. “We’re asking a machinist to do their work and train somebody. It’s a pretty unusual combination of skills,” Brosius said. But “it’s an opportunity you can’t find anywhere else” in the region. That is one reason Orion has such low turnover — about 8 percent a year, he said. The company is in the process of expanding its aerospace manufacturing training to Mukilteo. Currently, it is only in Auburn. Teaching technical skills is relatively straightforward. Teaching how to show up on time and with the right attitude is trickier. Brosius said. “It’s always the soft skills that require the most work.” Building confidence and self-esteem are critical steps, as well. “Self-esteem is number one. Pretty much everyone who walks in the door has gotten here through bad choices or bad luck. It hasn’t been a good ride,” he said. Mentors know that and make sure to give students opportunities to succeed. “We’re going to work with them until they get it right,” he said. “There are no free rides.” Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com.

The British Ministry of Defense claimed in July that it had "confirmed the deal to purchase nine P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft" from Boeing. However, The Daily Mirror reported Sunday that the deal with the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama was far from complete and in fact no orders were made before the New Year. The problem is that the deal is a "foreign military sale," meaning that it requires Washington's approval before Boeing could make the delivery. This leaves the contract "at the mercy" of Trump, Obama's successor, the report added. "Why are we not buying these planes directly from Boeing and instead using a foreign military sale?" said Lib Dem defense spokeswoman Baroness Judith Jolly. "This puts us at the mercy of the Americans and soon-to-be President Trump." Back in July, the government of then-UK prime minister David Cameron said it had inked new multi-billion pound contracts with Boeing. As part of the deal, Boeing had to provide the Royal Air Force with nine P-8A Poseidon spy aircraft, complete with a £100 million ($129 million) maintenance facility at the RAF Lossiemouth base in Moray. UK military sources told the daily earlier that the deal "for the 8th US Production Lot, which will include the UK's initial aircraft, will be placed early next year." Based on Boeing's best-selling 737 aircraft, the P-8 or Poseidon is capable of launching torpedoes, depth charges, SLAM-ER missiles, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and other weapons. It can also track submarines and alert the UK Navy's vessels of approaching threats. The UK has recently made another "foreign military sale" with the US, under which London would receive an undisclosed number of nuclear-capable Tomahawk cruise missiles from the US Navy.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 3 January 2017 | MYT 9:00 AM How Seattle became ‘Cloud City’: Amazon and Microsoft are leading a tech revolution by matt day On the ball: Corey Sanders of Microsoft leads a cloud-computing team working with Boeing. "If you're not building (tools) that are keeping up with your customers on a daily or weekly basis, you're falling behind," he says. — Seattle Times/TNS SEATTLE: In a Seattle-area conference room earlier this year, Washington state's two largest employers started sketching out the future.  In a daylong series of meetings at Microsoft's campus, engineers from the software company knocked heads and keyboards with their counterparts at Boeing. The goal: tapping in to Microsoft's Azure, the software maker's network of on-demand computing power, to build a new generation of software.  Boeing for years has made tools, from paper navigational aids to maintenance software, that help its aerospace customers fly and take care of their planes. An engineer with a record book and a manual knows roughly when to replace a part. But an engineer equipped with software that can help make sense of decades of maintenance data could do a more precise job, the thinking goes, improving aircraft maintenance and fuel consumption. Boeing is hoping to build web-based variants of its aviation analytics tools on Microsoft's Azure.  "If you're not building (tools) that are keeping up with your customers on a daily or weekly basis, you're falling behind," said Corey Sanders, a Microsoft manager who leads a cloud-computing team working with Boeing. "Because your competitors are."  Cloud computing, or tapping in to rented computer power and data storage over the internet, has existed for more than a decade. Most people know the cloud as the unseen servers that store the emails in their Gmail account or back up their iPhone photos.  But enabled by increasingly sophisticated technologies – and billions of dollars' worth of factory-sized server farms being built around the world – cloud computing is changing from a consumer phenomenon to one that's reshaping big business. Thanks to the growth of Amazon.com, Microsoft and a roster of Silicon Valley transplants, it's also reshaping Seattle.  Technologists compare the shift now under way to the advent of electrical utilities a century ago that sparked rapid advances in fields from agriculture to medicine and entertainment. Electricity rapidly changed from an expensive good available only to those with the wherewithal to generate it themselves to a ubiquitous commodity only noticed when it goes down.  "In general, there is someone who can deliver you electricity more reliably and less expensively than you can generate it yourself," said Ed Lazowska, a University of Washington computer scientist. "What's happening now is most of us are increasingly relying on utilities, be it Amazon, or Microsoft or Google, to give us the computing we need."  In other words, the power of the technology at your fingertips no longer depends on how powerful of a PC you bought for your den or the number of servers blinking in the backroom where you work.  All you need is a credit card, which can give you access to the power and technology that enables everything from your corporate email account to a supercomputer.  Competing for cash  Sales of Internet-accessed software and technology services are expected to total about US$118bil (RM529.34bil) this year, researcher Gartner estimates.  That sum represents an industry in its infancy. Gartner estimates that business will direct more than $1 trillion of cash toward cloud computing between now and 2020.  The technology industry is fiercely competing for that cash, a race pitting traditional business computing giants like IBM and Oracle against relative newcomers Salesforce.com and Dropbox, and hundreds of startups.  Seattle is at the forefront of this revolution, largely thanks to Amazon.com.  Google, Microsoft and Yahoo all built their own search engines, email platforms and other global web services that relied on massive datacentres, but it was Amazon that first started renting that kind of infrastructure to other businesses.  In 2006 the company launched Amazon Web Services, or AWS, which at first amounted to a big, web-accessed hard drive where other businesses could store their data. A few months later the company added a service where businesses could also rent the processing power available on Amazon-maintained servers.  At the time, the world of business technology was structured like this: corporate information-technology departments bought servers and the expensive software that made them tick and installed on top of that the specific applications that the business needed to run, be it word-processing tools, accounting databases or other software.  Office workers accessed the whole pile of technology from a personal computer.  Amazon's alternative was simple: Don't bother with most of that; rent it from us instead. Employees, who can still access the whole system via the web or their PC, won't notice.  That premise was a hit among technology startups, an alternative to shelling out tens of thousands of dollars for servers and software, and spending days or weeks setting it up.  Caught flat-footed  AWS built dozens of services, replicating in cyberspace the functions of all sorts of out-of-the-box software.  Much of the rest of the industry, living well off the high margins they were used to reaping from business software sales, was caught flat-footed.  A watershed moment arrived in 2013 when the Central Intelligence Agency awarded a large datacentre contract to Amazon over IBM, a company with decades of experience providing technology services to giant customers. The vote of confidence from the spy agency helped ease business-technology buyers' worry about the reliability and security of Amazon, a company better known as an online bookstore than a technology provider.  In the years since, interest in cloud services has spread to increasingly large and sophisticated businesses and government institutions. When they go looking for data storage, processing power and other infrastructure services, many choose Amazon.  Amazon's annual shareholders meeting in May was a triumphant affair. The company's stock was near a record high, and investors cheered the transformation of an online bookseller to a retail juggernaut with a massive technology arm.  AWS took in more than US$11bil (RM49.34bil) in sales over the most recently reported 12 months, accounting for 71% of the company's operating income before taxes.  Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said he was surprised by how long it took big technology-industry incumbents to match AWS' capabilities after the service was hatched.  "We got a seven-year runway," Bezos said. "That's almost unheard of. For years, we were kind of left alone."  Microsoft jumps in  When a big competitor did come calling, it was a familiar name.  After a decade of flubs in consumer technology, and a few false-starts in cloud computing, Microsoft has gone all-in on the cloud, investing billions of dollars in datacentres from Australia to Germany and Quincy, Washington.  While it built that infrastructure, Microsoft also changed its approach, reorienting a company that built its business around massive software releases delivered every few years to one that pushed out new products every week – and suddenly had to listen to customers at the same time.  Scott Guthrie, the Microsoft executive vice president who oversees the company's Cloud and Enterprise unit, says the payoff has started to arrive in the past couple of years.  "There's almost no cloud (buying) conversation anywhere that we're not part of," he said in an interview.  This year, those conversations have made customers out of companies like BMW, General Electric and Boeing.  "They came from so far behind, and they came out of the gate roaring," said Brent Frei, an executive with Smartsheet, a software company that partners with both Amazon and Microsoft. "I didn't know you could turn a big company around that much."  ___ Cloud Computing Broadly defined, cloud computing comes in three categories: Infrastructure as a service: Nuts and bolts of computing, rented virtual machines, storage space or network time, usually on a pay-for-what-you-use basis. This realm is dominated by Amazon.com. Platform as a service: A developer's sandbox, including ready-made databases or tools to create websites. Software as a service: Ready-made tools accessed over the Web. This is the bucket most consumers would recognise – think Facebook or Gmail. In the corporate world, think Microsoft's Office 365, Salesforce.com's sales tracking tools or Concur's expense-management software. — The Seattle Times/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Vonn just happy to be racing again after 13th place Man burnt to death in Beluran house fire Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Mercedes wants to use robots for making goods deliveries Create your own website Two thumbs-up for Oculus Touch Sci-fi tech set for 2017 QLED vs OLED Most Viewed in Tech QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Create your own website Sci-fi tech set for 2017 Could your gadgets send you to jail?

Aviation expert John Goglia, a safety consultant and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said while the current search led by Australia is winding down the quest for answers is far from over. “The search will continue ... but it will be a privately run,” he said with most likely Boeing taking the lead. “It’ll be smaller and more focused but that’s probably better.” Boeing was not available for comment yesterday.

In 2015, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen found the wreck of the long-lost World War II Japanese super battleship Musashi near the Philippines. The philanthropist spent eight years searching for the Musashi which was sunk in the Battle for Leyte Gulf on October 24, 1944.

Last month Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester dampened hopes of extending the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 to a new 25,000 square/km search zone identified by international experts as having a high probability of containing the wreckage. Mr Chester’s view — and that of China and Malaysia — is that the new search area is not specific enough and put him at odds with the experts’ conclusion that the location north-east of the existing search zone needs investigating. Possible MH370 debris washed up on Riake beach, Madagascar. Picture: Marc Russo PhotographySource:Supplied The expert findings detailed in “First Principles Review’’, issued last month by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is the result of findings from a three-day meeting held in Canberra in early November by parties involved in the search for the missing Boeing 777. “The participants of the First Principles Review were in agreement on the need to search an additional area representing approximately 25,000 sq. km,’’ the report concluded. “Based on the analysis to date, completion of this area would exhaust all prospective areas for the presence of MH370.’’ The new area identified as a potential crash site adjoins an area searched in 2014 and takes into account additional information from a CSIRO ocean drift study. It is not part of part of the 120,000 sq. km swathe of Indian Ocean swept for more than two years and in which no sign of the aircraft debris field has been found. The new area — between latitudes 32.5 degrees south and 36 degrees south — was based on “comprehensive satellite data analysis and updated with the latest search results and the CSIRO drift analysis,’’ the report said. It is slightly narrower than the first zone due to revised calculations that the aircraft crashed closer to the seventh arc, the curved line determined by the last satellite handshake between the aircraft and the plane. The three-day First Principles Review was attended by Australian and international experts in data processing, satellite communications, accident investigation, aircraft performance, flight operations, sonar data, acoustic data and oceanography. It aimed to reassess and validate existing evidence and to consider any new analysis that may assist in identifying the location of MH370, which crashed in 2014 while en-route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A key to the finding was additional information not available when the first search area was defined. More than 20 items of debris have been recovered and identified as likely to be, almost certainly or definitely originating from MH370, including parts the wing.

Private search mooted for missing Flight MH370 in southern Indian Ocean Nevil Gibson Tuesday January 3, 2017 Share Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester Play NBR radio on As the official search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 winds down, reports of a private search funded by Boeing have surfaced. A former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board, John Goglia, is said to have originated the project. Meanwhile, the underwater search in the southern Indian Ocean — jointly funded by Australia, China and Malaysia — is nearing its end. “The search will continue ... but it will be a privately run,” Mr Goglia is quoted as saying, adding that Boeing will most likely take the lead. “It’ll be smaller and more focused but that’s probably better.” Boeing has not confirmed the report. Experts' conclusions Last month, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau released the result of findings from a three-day meeting held in Canberra in early November by parties involved in the two-year search for the missing Boeing 777. “There is a high degree of confidence that the previously identified underwater area searched to date does not contain the missing aircraft," the report stated.  “The experts concluded that, if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be exhausted.” The ATSB, which is leading the $A145 million search, says the operation will be suspended if there are no credible clues as to the plane's whereabouts after the completion of the underwater search of an addition 25,000sq km. The new area adjoins an area searched in 2014 and takes into account additional information from a CSIRO ocean drift study. Minister has doubts However, Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester has thrown doubts on whether this search will go ahead. His view — and that of China and Malaysia — is that the new search area is not specific enough. Nor is it part of the 120,000sq km area of Indian Ocean already searched without any aircraft debris being found. More than 20 items of debris have been recovered and identified as likely to be, almost certainly or definitely originating from MH370, including parts the wing. Flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board while on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.  Read more from Nevil Gibson Email Nevil: ngibson@nbr.co.nz Follow @@nevilgibson Got a question about this story?

Ali Osman Nur By Md. Ali Osman Nur* IT all started some 44 years ago, when the free people of our newly liberated country had, perhaps, looked up into the skies and imagined a dreamboat of their own which could fly them to faraway places. The hopes and aspirations of the peoples of Bangladesh gave birth to Biman— the wings that would carry them beyond the sunset. Under the auspices and personal intervention of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the dream came true on Jan. 4, 1972. The beautiful airline was born with a unique birthmark— the only one born without any aircraft or ancillary. The journey began with a DC-3 aircraft – an air force plane gifted to the new airline by the government. Biman was finally air borne on March 7, 1972 with flights to Chittagong and Sylhet and on March 9 to Jessore. Thus the domestic operation of Biman began. Since then there has been no looking back for the legacy- carrier. On March 4, three days before start of domestic operation, the first flight of Biman›s international operation landed in Dhaka from London with 179 passengers on board. DC 10 cabin crew In 2008, the airline went into an agreement with Boeing Aircraft Company for the acquisition of 10 new generation aircraft of 4 Boeing 777-300ER, 2 Boeing 737-800 and 4 Boeing 787, the biggest ever deal in the history of Biman as well as the country. The government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh provided the necessary sovereign guarantee for procuring the aircraft. In 2011, the first two of four Boeing 777-300ERs joined the fleet in October and November, and thus replacing the ageing DC10-30s, the longtime backbone of Biman fleet. In 2014, the 3rd Boeing 777-300ER joined the fleet on Feb. 5 and the 4th joined the fleet on March 27. Now the airline has a new backbone comprising of Boeing 777-300ERs, the new workhorses of Biman, named as the ‘Palki’, the ‘Arun Aalo’, the ‘Aakash Pradeep’ and the ‘Raanga Pravat’. Two Boeing 737- 800s named as the ‘Meghdoot’ and the ‘Mayurpankhi’ joined the fleet in 2015. The first of the four Dreamliners (Boing 787) is likely to join the fleet in 2018 and the last one in 2020. “The industry-leading technology of the 787 Dreamliner is creating remarkable opportunities for airlines around the world and dramatically improving the air travel experiences. We call it the Dreamliner effect. The 787’s unparalleled fuel efficiency and range flexibility enables carriers to profitability, open new routes as well as optimize fleet and network performance. And for their passengers, an experience like none other in the air, with more comfort and less fatigue. The Dreamliner effect. That’s a better way to fly,” a Boeing statement said. Presently the fleet consists of four Boeing 777 300ERs, two Boeing 777 200s, four Boeing 737 800s, two Airbus 310s and two Dash 8 Q44, a total 14, most of them are new generation flying machines. The airline is all set to receive four Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the first two of which are making way to adorn the fleet in 2018 and the rest due in the following year. Induction of these four priced jewels of Biman Fleet would make it one of the youngest fleets in the world! During the four decades of Biman’s existence, many types of commercial airliners have adorned the fleet- ranging from the early leader, the venerable DC 3 to the modern ‘People’s Preference’, the Boeing 777. As stated earlier, Biman had placed a firm order for the fifth generation Dreamliner to complement its fleet in 2008. Fuel-efficient Dreamliner is a new wonder of the skies. On Feb. 20, 2014, Biman operated the historical final-flight of world’s last passenger DC10-30 on Dhaka – Birmingham route and thus could write down its name in the history of world aviation. A couple of years back, the airline launched its three tiers frequent flyer program of Green, Silver and Gold. It comes with all the stunning features of an FFP that is featured by simple registration, easy redemption and a host of attractive benefits. Of late, the airline has formally introduced the next phase of its upgraded service features in its Business Class including expanded choice of menu items. Great care is being taken for enhancing the quality of in-flight food and service. A major improvement in the field of punctuality, information technology including website, advanced seat reservation and integrated revenue management system is paving the way for the airline to be the choice of a discerning passenger. At the moment, Biman, while consolidating its operation is also poised for growth. Along with fleet expansion, also on the planning-board is the matter of route expansion. Possible projected destinations include Delhi, Colombo, Guangzhou, Tokyo and so forth. Currently Biman has every day one frequency between Jeddah and Bangladesh , 6 frequencies a week between Riyadh and Bangladesh and 3 frequencies a week between Dammam and Bangladesh. Biman operates to/from Bangladesh points – Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet. Biman is also considering operation plan to/from Madinah in near future. From the hub Dhaka, it also flies to Kolkata,, Kathmandu, Yangon, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore , London, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Muscat, Doha, Kuwait. It will reopen the Dhaka – Delhi / Hong Kong route. Also will be opening new route to Colombo and Male . The national flag carrier plays a vital role in carrying the Haj pilgrims. It carries more than 50,000 pilgrims every year through dedicated and schedule flights. This year the carrier has successfully operated the Haj flights, most of which were operated by new generation B777-300 aircraft. On behalf of the company, I express our gratitude to all related authorities in the Kingdom for their support to Haj flight operation. We hope that the valued passengers and pilgrims will get world class service after opening of the new airport. Biman management›s commitment to ensuring punctuality coupled with stress on improved ground services are aimed at increasing its competitiveness in order to achieve success in today›s highly competitive commercial aviation market. With the dedicated efforts of all the airline personnel and the support of customers, Biman is poised to fly into an ever millennium of prosperity and happiness. * The writer is Regional Manager, Western Province, Saudi Arabia, Biman Bangladesh Airlines TAGS Biman Bangladesh Airlines route expansion SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleSaudi stocks gain; Gulf indices mixed Next articleMisbah to captain Pakistan in Sydney Imran Syed 7 COMMENTS Dr. Mohammad Abdur Rahman Jan 3, 2017 at 1:02 pm Thanks Mr. Ali Osman Nur for ur good academic article !

Forty-eight hours later, he fired off a tweet that would cost the company that built the F-35 nearly $4 billion. Trump’s tweet called into question the F-35 program saying the “cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.” Free e-book on the state of identity management in government. Download now The Monday morning tweet sent Lockheed Martin’s stock tumbling before a late day rally recovered some of the value lost. Advertisement The company headquartered in Maryland is the latest target to suffer from one of Trump’s morning tweets. The previous week, Trump took aim at the Air Force One program headed by Boeing. Similarly, Boeing’s stock suffered the following day and left Boeing executives scrambling to issue statements saying they will respond to changes requested from the Trump administration. Trump’s tweets signal the president-elect has his eye on military spending as a potential target where he can save money, said Michael Hoffman, executive editor for Tandem National Security Innovations. He’s certainly not the first to suggest the F-35 program has gone over budget. Countless congressional hearings have been held to criticize the Pentagon’s most expensive weapons program in history for a misuse of tax payer’s money. However, Trump’s 140-character attack is the most high profile condemnation the the program has received in recent years. More importantly, Trump’s recent critiques make some in the defense industrial world question whether a Trump administration will result in the financial windfall many expected when he was elected. Defense analysts have said the greater Washington region stands to receive a substantial boost from increased defense spending. With a Republican president saying he wants to build more ships and planes, many expect significant increases to the military budget with a Republican Congress. However, Trump has used his social media bullhorn to criticize the Pentagon and defense industrial complex for over spending on current weapons programs. Trump has shined a light on defense acquisition programs that don’t typically get much national attention. Defense companies and Republican members of Congress have supported acquisition reform. The Obama administration made it a priority but their efforts have resulted in modest gains. Trump has announced he will appoint retired Marine Gen. James “Mad Dog” Mattis as his secretary of defense. Mattis is known for his lack of patience for bureaucracy and it will be interesting to see how he tackles spending on big ticket weapons programs. If Trump wants to build as many ships and planes as he promised on the campaign trail, he will need the help of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. If the president-elect matches his words with contracts, those two defense titans will be happy to oblige. Check out all our coverage of the incoming Trump administration here.

But in reality, you’d probably settle for an air travel experience that’s even slightly better than what you get today—or at least, not worse. In which case, you’re in luck. “I don’t envision any grand, over the top cabin and seating designs,” says Raymond Kollau, founder of Amsterdam-based research and innovation agency AirlineTrends. “Certification standards are strict in the industry, budgets, in general, limited, and airlines quite conservative.” But you can expect gradual change: Even economy class will someday feel a bit softer, a bit warmer, a bit faster, a bit easier to sleep in. Mostly. Here’s what’s coming. Mood Lighting Virgin Atlantic is the pioneer in the fancy lighting space, its clubby LEDs welcoming riders and then calming them to zzz’s. Now Airbus and Boeing are in on the act, with honest-to-jeez scientifically proven light progressions that help passengers adjust to jet lag. The next step: Boeing’s projections concept, which can briefly light up the ceiling with images of your destination, a starry night sky, or (sorry) advertisements. (The manufacturer filed a patent in September.) Icelandair’s Boeing 757 has offered a Northern Lights experience since 2015. You can expect more technicolor fireworks in the future.

The Flying Office You’ve been let down before. But it’s coming this time, we promise: inflight Wi-Fi so acceptable, you can even take calls from your very own phone as you glide closer to the stars. Thanks to larger but still aerodynamic mounted antennae and reliance on Ka-band systems, the internet in the sky could get 10 times faster, raising capabilities to an insane 100 Mbps. (Those speeds won’t happen on most aircraft, though.) Oh, and some terrible news: The Department of Transportation is considering letting people take phone calls midflight. “I’m going to start saving all my billing questions and help desk inquiries for the plane,” one flyer told the WSJ.

Toasty Seats Ah, the familiar sweater-on, sweater-off dance. One moment, the air conditioners are blasting; another, you’re awakened from your nice nap by the trickle of sweat. Fancy seats to the rescue. Heating and cooling seats—the kind now common in cars—are on their way to private jets, and maybe even business and first class for the proles. Tech and aircraft interior experts like Panasonic, Fraunhofer IBP, and Gentherm already have working concepts, and the latter says to expert to see their seats on commercial flights in three to five years’ time.

Boeing unveiled a self-cleaning lavatory concept last spring, which uses hands-free technology and UV rays to zap 99.9 percent of the bacteria you leave when you’re done with your business. Just three seconds of light, and the lav is clean enough for the next flyer. Airbus, meanwhile, is developing anti-bacterial surfaces for its WCs, and Diehl Autosystems, the aircraft interiors company, is working to separate its toilets from its handwashing stations, à la European.

That’s the concept behind a new premium class concept from the aircraft interior specialists at PriestmanGoode. “The concept is all about creating a bespoke environment for the passenger,” the design firm says, which is a little precious—but also intriguing, yeah? Each single, double, or ensuite cabin contains its own particular materials, colors, and finishes, like the hippest of boutique hotels. This lush space is also modular, so an airline can reconfigure its cabins to fit the needs of each flight’s fancy passengers. Futuristic, sure, but the firm says custom greatness is not too far off. “We are already creating tailor made interiors for some of the leading airlines in the world,” says Nigel Goode, the firm’s director.  Credit: PriestmanGoode If you’re going big, go selfish, too.

Security Tweaks The very smart folks at Northeastern University’s Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats (ALERT) Center have a plan for your next security check, and it involves…walking. Their millimeter wave scanner concept uses the same tech that scans your bod now, but at speeds of up to 300 people an hour, instead of 100. Ideally, you’ll never have to break your stride, much less dig that errant makeup kit from the bottom of your bag. While we’re waiting for this fancy system, though, expect to see more automated security points like the kind the Transportation Security Administration installed in select airports this fall, which push and organize bins themselves.

Joe Sutter in 2006 I'm fairly certain that very few people heard the news that Joe Sutter passed awayin August 2016 at age 95. Who was Joe Sutter and why should we care? He led the Boeing engineering team that developed the Boeing 747 jumbo jet in the 1960s, an aircraft which completely changed commercial aviation and made air travel truly a routine event and transportation option for the masses. (There's no need for me to repeat his life story or achievements as a hands-on engineer or team leader; you can read some of the obituaries in the linked references at the end.) Only a few other aircraft can make a comparable claim: the Douglas DC-3, Boeing 707, and perhaps the Ford Trimotor (which others should be added to the list is an interesting after-hours topic for discussion and argument with your coworkers). The scope of the 747's innovations and its design/production audacity are hard to imagine given how commonplace it is now; just as impressive is that the design, engineering, and production challenge was met before our powerful present-day computer-based tools for design, simulation, scheduling, tracking, and production planning. What bothers me is how little attention his passing and his accomplishments received. There was almost no attention in the "mass media," although what he did brought low-cost air travel to their audience. I guess his passing had to compete with the latest news about the Kardashians, Brangelina, and other celebrities and models. I understand the need to "escape" and the kind of relief that following the exploits, adventures, and tribulations of these Hollywood-type celebrities and models offers. Still, can engineers get a little-larger slice of the attention piece, please? We're only asking because it's the efforts of engineers (and scientists and production people) that make possible all of these miraculous devices and gadgets that you take for granted and think are "no big deal." I often wonder why engineers don't get the celebrity recognition they used to get and still should. Is it because society's values and, thus, preferences have changed? Or perhaps it is because many products are now the result of diffused efforts by large global teams, while the media prefers stories where one or two people can be the focus. Yes, there have been some technologists as celebrities (the list includes Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk), but they are outnumbered by a large ratio. A few years ago, I came across a self-celebration of the history of Time magazine (are they actually still around?) that featured the covers from their earliest years to the present. What struck me was both who and what the cover features were about. The covers from the 1950s and into the 1960s featured test pilots, engineers, scientists, doctors, and other high-achieving individuals with genuine accomplishments. In contrast, the covers of more recent issues highlighted issues and causes across many topics ("Is Our Food Killing Us?"), but few individuals (and the few they had were non-technical, usually political types). Seeing the time-machine effect of those covers really made it clear that somehow our focus and priorities have changed, as have our heroes. If the increased emphasis on STEM-related education (science, technology, engineering, math) is to be successful, there has to be a reassessment of who our heroes are as well. There's little point in telling young adults that STEM is good for them when celebrities, models, and athletes get the attention, admiration, and, yes, money for doing things that don't actually amount to much, in most cases. For many of them with little actual accomplishment, the main thing to admire is how they have turned that into so much rather than having something tangible and of broader benefit to which we can point. I'll stop my rant here, since I feel like I am spitting into the wind. Unless we re-calibrate who and what we admire and spend our time, energy, and money following, it won't make much difference, at least for now. I do like to think that these things come in cycles, and perhaps technologists will once again become the heroes, just as down-scale neighborhoods and cities have become hot and trendy again in many places. I do have a final odd question: Who sets the standards to be called a "supermodel?" When I see someone identified with that label, I wonder, Says who? What are the criteria? Are they updated every few years? Is there some application form where you list your modeling income, number and type of assignments, and other factors so that a panel or certification board can decide? Or is it the amount of publicity and coverage that your press agent (or team) can generate? If you can help with the answer, let me know. Until then, let's focus on raising the stature of engineers (and other technologists) so we can get some of the attention and admiration that is focused elsewhere. —Bill Schweber is an engineer and technical writer who writes blogs for EE Times and EDN.com.

Capitalism means profit no matter what. with an overabundance of competing products, the makers have a problem of attracting the attention of the primitive and the not so primitive minds to their products. Plain advertizing does not cut it. They find it easy to pair it with entertaintment like nudity, sports, talk shows, game shows and so on. Anyone who can attract the attention of the primitive minds, reaps huge rewards because of the media's ability to reach the huge number of primitive minds. The value of these people is multiplied a thousand fold by the far reaching media. A singer or a model would not be worth even a small fraction of what he or she earns without recording media like CDs and DVDs or television broadcasting. Yet that revenue is not shared with the technologists who make this happen. The primitive minds have no idea what it takes to develop these technologies vs posing nude on a front page. The primitive mind does not even understand what the hidden cost of these advertizing are, the costs that are added to everything that is purchased. And the primitive minds have no individual control over this business though collectively they encourage this business by patronizing.

(unless you pay for dedicated channels).  I agree it is ok, for those who can, to push the limits of human strength, agility, and reflexes, but our society now, more than ever, needs skills in other areas as well.  It is not an either/or senario, it just that there it is easier to connect a single athlete when a team wins, than to understand what group designed their latest I-Phone.

If you talk to the average "person on the street," it is surprising what they don't know about the technology they use every day, or how it is developed. It just is, apparently. It's been well publicized, even in EE Times, how most people don't even know what engineering is. Pretty hard to make a celebrity out of those you don't know exist. Possibly, back in the 1950s, when space travel began, a small number of the actual movers and shakers were covered in Time Magazine. I would suggest that Time may have stopped that practice, in search for greater circulation?

This summer ahead of the Olympics, i was noticing that the games are showing us how primitive our society still is. It's all about physical strength and skill, same as 2000 years ago. The celebs issue starts with children's books and toys - princes and princesses, superheroes- continues in school where history is neglected - history could teach kids respect for skilled people instead of respect for fame and can also teach respect and tolerance for other cultures. The focus society puts on looks has a substantial impact too and it's something marketing heavily promotes. It's also a problem that this is not necessarily a global issue so not all countries will be held back by this mentality.

Aviation Expert Claims As Underwater Search Nears End By Suman Varandani @suman09 On 01/02/17 AT 12:49 AM Close Boeing is expected to take over a new privately funded search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, an aviation expert said Sunday. The news comes as the underwater search — jointly funded by Australia, China and Malaysia — is nearing its end. John Goglia, a safety consultant and former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, reportedly said that while the current search led by Australia is wrapping up, the quest for answers is far from over. “The search will continue ... but it will be a privately run,” he said, adding that Boeing will most likely take the lead. “It’ll be smaller and more focused but that’s probably better.” Related Stories Missing MH370 Plane Won't Be Found Near Search Area, Investigators Say Amateur Investigator Finds Handbag, Shoes In Madagascar Last month, investigators said in a report that the missing Boeing 777-200 won't be found in the area in a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean that officials have searched for two years. The plane's wreckage may have instead traveled further north based on flight simulations and new analysis of satellite communications, according to a team of international investigators searching for the plane. “There is a high degree of confidence that the previously identified underwater area searched to date does not contain the missing aircraft," the report stated. “The experts concluded that, if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be exhausted.” The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading the $145 million search for the aircraft, said that the operation will be suspended if there are no credible clues as to the plane's whereabouts after the completion of the underwater search of the 46,000-square-mile area in a remote part of the ocean. Flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board while on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.  Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Lockheed Martin shares fell about 2 percent, while Boeing shares gained about 1 percent. Trump's tweet shaved off about $1.2 billion of Lockheed Martin's market value.

A spokesman for Lockheed Martin declined to comment to CNBC. The president-elect previously threatened to cancel the order for a new Air Force One from Boeing because of the costs. He's also criticized the price of Lockheed Martin's F-35 program before, which took as much as $4 billion off of the company's market value.

He teamed up with state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, to file legislation — two bills in each chamber — pushing back against a pair of recent controversial Texas Supreme Court rulings that immediately made it easier for those involved with government contracts with private companies to shield parts of what those contracts say. Following those 2015 rulings, government entities have withheld a wide range of information from government contracts that had long been considered public. Such secrets include how much the City of McAllen paid pop star Enrique Iglesias to sing at a holiday parade, how many driver permits Houston had issued to the ride-hailing giant Uber and details of a Kaufman County school district’s food service deal. “Those were big steps away from that very important ideal that the public will have the information they need to hold government accountable,” Watson said of the Supreme Court rulings. “The public has the right to know what it’s paying.” In June of 2015, the justices ordered Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to block the release of information in a lease between Boeing and the Port Authority of San Antonio because the aerospace manufacturer said making the details public could tip off its competitors. That ruling expanded the secrecy of government contracts in two key ways, experts say: by broadening an exemption in public records law used to protect the government’s competitive interests and by affirming that businesses could invoke it, too. Originally, lawmakers sought to prevent a bidder for government work from nabbing a competitor’s bids on a contract. And once that contract was finalized, it was considered public. But the Boeing v. Paxton decision lowered the threshold for what can be secret, while affirming that private entities could invoke that protection when doing business with governments in Texas. Since that ruling, Paxton’s office has been flooded by requests to shield the release of contract details — more than 300 have cited it, Watson said. Denton’s municipal electric utility cited that ruling in a successful effort to block the release of its $265 million contract to build a new natural gas-fired power plant, said Bill Patterson, publisher of the Denton Record Chronicle, which had asked for the information. “This project is the single largest capital purchase the city has made to date,” Patterson said, noting that electric ratepayers would be unable to watch for cost overruns or operational malfunctions.   One of the new proposals (House Bill 792 and Senate Bill 407) would limit the competitive interest threshold that governments could use to withhold information, and states that all finalized contracts would be released. Another proposal (HB 793 and SB 408) would restore a legal test that made private entities subject to state open records law under certain circumstances — if they receive public funds to perform services traditionally regulated to government agencies, for instance.  In March 2015, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the Greater Houston Partnership, which received some public funds, could withhold details of contracts for economic services, because it was not entirely dependent on public funds. In doing so, it narrowed the definition of groups subject to open records law. The lawmakers said they had sought input from a variety of groups in crafting their legislation, including those who work on First Amendment issues, the Texas Municipal League and Texas Association of Counties. Laura Prather, a First Amendment attorney and a Texas Freedom of Information Foundation board member, said her group was “pleased” with the new legislation. “Texans need to know who the government is making deals with and how the money is being spent,” she said. Capriglione suggested that people in government “generally behave better if they know some people could be watching.” He said he was worried that the Public Information Act could be rendered “effectively moot” in Texas if the Legislature did not act this session and the “loopholes” became more widely used. He said he didn’t expect vocal opposition to the legislation though that didn't necessarily mean they would pass without a fight. “Whenever we try to broaden transparency, we've found that most of the people who battle it will do it in darkness,” Capriglione said.   The Texas Tribune provided this story.

Comments by Labour MP Kevan Jones were retweeted by Paddy Ashdown who backs his assertion that the Government sold Yeovil workers down the line when it signed a £425 million deal with Boeing in the summer for Apache helicopters. Lord Ashdown has long argued the deal to build the next generation of helicopters should have gone to Leonardo with GKN producing the airframes. Instead, there are no major new orders for Leonardo and GKN, which carried out contract work for the Italian giant on the AW159 Wildcat helicopter, is due to close in December with the loss of 221 jobs after bosses said it was "no longer viable". MORE: GKN closure : how one of Yeovil biggest stories of 2016 unfolded Mr Jones, MP for North Durham and a former defence minister, said: "The government's Apache deal with the US is a complete sell out. "If it was the other way round, the Americans wouldn't stand for such a poor deal, and now British workers are paying the price for this lack of investment in UK defence. "The UK helicopter industry is being taken apart." MORE: GKN crisis - Leonardo poised to move assembly jobs to Poland unless Government stops it says Ashdown GKN announced its site would be closing in December of this year last November, with the loss of 221 jobs. Lord Ashdown welcomed the comments - responding with a tweet, (below). At last! Someone else taking up the cudgels in Parliament to protect Yeovil's helicopter industry and jobs! https://t.co/kTT4rnrsIG ���� — Paddy Ashdown (@paddyashdown) January 1, 2017 Lord Ashdown has been heavily critical of the Government since the summer. He says the GKN closure is the Government's fault and has slammed its "foolish" failure to secure what was a key contract for Yeovil workers. "The workers at GKN have been let down by this government," he told Somerset Live at the time. MORE: GKN crisis - workers could find employment with Leonardo Helicopters says Marcus Fysh MP He blames the decision of the MOD not to put a new contract to supply the British Army with 50 new Apache helicopters in the summer out to competitive tender, for the closure of GKN. With the contract going to Boeing he says, any viability of the GKN site was going to be threatened. Ministers had claimed the UK industry would get a huge slice of support work for US building operations. But they have now admitted that the kick-back is worth only 5p in the pound of the overall value of the overall programme. Critics of the government say the new work will go nowhere close to compensating for jobs lost when GKN Aerospace closes its factory in Yeovil, Somerset, this year. MORE: GKN crisis: Yeovil MP Marcus Fysh 'will do everything he can' to safeguard jobs The problems for Yeovil's embattled aerospace industry appeared to have been compounded just before Christmas when the minister for defence procurement Harriett Baldwin seemed to be signalling to Lord Ashdown in a letter that work fabricating airframes for any new Wildcat orders would be undertaken in Poland - not in Yeovil. It had been hoped that the work would be done in the Leonardo site, possibly with the employment of at least some of the former GKN workforce, thereby utilising their valuable skills. Yeovil's MP Marcus Fysh has said he doesn't believe any decision has been made by Leonardo yet - he too is pushing for the work to remain in Yeovil. Leonardo has declined to offer any comment on the issue.

News Business Business News Donald Trump blasts General Motors for making cars in Mexico temporarily damaging the company's stock President-elect warns of 'big border tax' if car manufacturers keep producing cars south of the border Ben Chapman Tuesday 3 January 2017 14:23 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The next President of the United States has pledged to slap 35 per cent tariffs on companies that move production to lower wage countries Reuters US President-elect Donald Trump temporarily wiped almost a quarter of a billion dollars off the stock market value of General Motors on Tuesday after threatening to impose a “big border tax” for making its Chevrolet Cruze model in Mexico. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!” Trump said on Twitter. GM, which owns Vauxhall and Cadillac among other brands, saw its shares fall 0.7 per cent in pre-market trading after the tweet, before recovering as the US stock market opened strongly. The incident will cause embarrassment to GM chief executive Mary Barra who last month agreed to join the new President’s economic advisory panel. Read more Thousands of jobs at risk as Vauxhall takes $400m Brexit hit GM defended against Mr Trump's accusation, saying: "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US" The tweet is the latest example of Mr Trump’s online comments hurting multinational companies. In December shares in aerospace giants Lockheed Martin and Boeing also tumbled after Mr Trump criticised the cost of their US government contracts. Mr Trump blasted GM and other US car manufacturers on the campaign trail for their Mexico operations as he appealed to disenfranchised working class voters who have lost out amid increasing globalisation and the dismantling of trade barriers with lower wage economies.

In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent.

The United Auto Workers Union has called for NAFTA to be scrapped but US car-makers say access to low-cost Mexican labour is crucial to their competitiveness. Mr Trump has also threatened import tariffs of 35 per cent on companies that shift production from the US.  More about: Donald Trump General Motors Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

In a tweet, the President-elect said “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!”, a warning which could be read as an effective ultimatum to move production back to the US or risk tariffs on foreign-made products. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Another potential problem for GM, as shown in the chart below, is that while GM has posted a substantial recovery since its bankruptcy following the financial crisis, the firm’s number of jobs has barely budged, even as its biggest “Detroit” competitor has been on a hiring spree. What makes Trump’s criticism surprising, however, is that one month ago, Trump appointed GM CEO Mary Barro to his Strategic and Policy Forum, which as a reminder “is composed of some of America’s most highly respected and successful business leaders, will be called upon to meet with the President frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his plan to bring back jobs and Make America Great Again.” If Trump’s tweet is sincere, Barra may be the first CEO who is “fired” from this particular advisory group. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) fell $0.29 (-0.83%) in premarket trading Tuesday. In 2016, GM gained 6.30%, versus a 10.78% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 3 January 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Seattle’s cloud-computing boom is new force driving regional economy by matt day Mounting a challenge: Sanders, a Microsoft engineer who leads a cloud-computing team, which worked on a key part of Microsoft's challenge to Amazon. "It was very daunting," Sanders said. — The Seattle Times/TNS SEATTLE: Western Washington state's economy has long been driven by companies that build complex systems, from Boeing's airplanes to cellular networks and the personal computer operating systems that gave rise to Microsoft.  Amazon.com's growth into a technology power through its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing unit and Microsoft's move to compete aggressively in that market have added the cloud to Seattle's list of specialties.  From 2013 to 2016, Washington's employed labour force grew by 7.2%, according to state occupational data. The number of workers employed in roles core to cloud computing – including computer-systems analysts, network architects and software-application developers – grew by 26%, to 80,017.  "There's an aspect of pride for the city," said Corey Sanders, a Microsoft engineer who leads a cloud-computing team. "You're a big cloud company? You're here."  From his old apartment, Sanders had a unique view of Seattle's cloud-computing boom.  His windows overlooked the two new towers at the core of Amazon.com's corporate campus, a building boom made, in part, to house the thousands of engineers who have helped make Amazon the undisputed leader in the business of renting computing power and data storage.  Meanwhile, he and his team worked on a key part of Microsoft's challenge to Amazon.  "It was very daunting," Sanders said of his charge when he joined the team building Microsoft's Azure. "We did have a very big competitor to look at."  Google is another major player in the Puget Sound area, with engineering offices in Seattle and nearby Kirkland. It's constructing a campus just blocks from Amazon's headquarters.  Facebook put the finishing touches this year on its own larger, custom-built engineering outpost in the city, and already has plans for another expansion.  Dozens of cloud-focused Silicon Valley transplants and startups are clustered throughout the area.  As with all booms, there's a downside.  The pressures of a roaring, technology-fuelled local economy have created what Seattle Mayor Ed Murray calls a housing-affordability crisis. Homelessness is on the rise, and the new buildings going up along with the high cost of living have dramatically changed the character of the city.  For those with the right in-demand technology skills, Seattle remains full of opportunity for second acts.  Deepak Patil, who spent 16 years at Microsoft, started work in January at Oracle as the Redwood City, California, company embarked on a hiring spree to help build its own cloud platform.  "We are in the middle of one of the most dramatic evolutions in modern civilisation," Patil said. "And Seattle happens to be the epicentre of this revolution."  Manuel Medina is among the generation of entrepreneurs that used both Microsoft and Amazon as a training ground.  He came to Seattle out of Harvard's business school in 2003, joining a team that later became a part of Amazon Web Services. The company, he says, was his second MBA.  Two years later, he jumped to Microsoft, pitching in on MSN, videogaming and mobile.  Now, he runs Outreach, a Seattle software startup that makes cloud-based tools for sales professionals.  Its service is built on Amazon Web Services. About-two thirds of Outreach's engineering staff, Medina says, came from Amazon.  It's still hiring. — The Seattle Times/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Vonn just happy to be racing again after 13th place Man burnt to death in Beluran house fire Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Mercedes wants to use robots for making goods deliveries Create your own website Two thumbs-up for Oculus Touch Sci-fi tech set for 2017 QLED vs OLED Most Viewed in Tech QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Create your own website Sci-fi tech set for 2017 Could your gadgets send you to jail?

Now, the first commercial rockets aren't expected to blast off until 2018. 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Transcript: Safety Issues Delay US Commercial Crew Launches Until 2018 NASA has long said 2017 would be the year the U.S. could start sending people into space on its own again. No longer would Americans have to hitch rides on Russian rockets to the International Space Station. Instead, they would be able to rely on U.S. companies like SpaceX and Boeing. Lawmakers and former astronauts have been calling for that kind of independence since the shuttle program ended in 2011. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.): "In space, we are losing our ability to lead." Eugene Cernan: "I drove a car on the moon 42 years ago, and we can't get a human being in space today?" So how's that plan going? Well, like most things involved in spaceflight, there have been delays. NASA and its contractors have both had setbacks, so they won't be launching crews for a while. But they're getting closer. SpaceX's plans for manned test flights of Crew Dragon got pushed back to the second quarter of 2018. A spokesman told Newsy the company might change the way it fuels its rockets to avoid more explosions like the one in September. That will be safer for eventual crew — but it will take time to change procedures around. Boeing told us it's sticking to the schedule  it announced earlier this year : Its first manned flight tests will be in August 2018. The company had pushed its dates back earlier, when it ran into design challenges for its Starliner capsule that could have been safety risks. The company  warned inspectors  the goals it first set with NASA for its flight tests might have been too ambitious. And some delays are thanks to NASA. Auditors  reviewed the commercial crew program  in September and found NASA isn't being prompt with its safety monitoring. That stacks on top of technical hurdles its contractors still have to get over, like the crew seats SpaceX has to finish designing. NASA felt it had no choice but to buy passage on Russia's rockets through 2018. That's a far cry from the optimism NASA had about 2016 flights  back when it announced Commercial Crew in 2011 . And now it's stuck waiting. It won't be launching its own manned missions until the Space Launch System is ready to fly — which might not happen  until 2023 . But even with these delays, the commercial crew program is moving quickly. NASA started working with contractors  in 2010 . For comparison,  the Apollo program  took seven years to get astronauts off the ground.  The space shuttle  took nine years from announcement to carrying crew.

(NYSE: BA) would not cost the $16.6 billion list price, but only about half that amount. Iran Air’s CEO also said that the airline’s order for 100 planes from Airbus valued at $18 billion to $20 billion would, in fact, cost no more than $10 billion. Commercial airplane prices are negotiable, especially for large customers making large orders. And we’re looking at a buyer’s market right now, especially for wide-body jets, so new orders are likely to do better than the usual 30% to 40% discount to list prices. For Boeing, which did not raise list prices in 2016, reducing its costs has helped make up for the larger discounts. We can expect continued cost cutting from Boeing, both from layoffs and from squeezing suppliers. Here’s Boeing’s current price list by aircraft family. 737 Family 737-700: $80.6 million 737-800: $96 million 737-900ER: $101.9 million 737 MAX 7: $90.2 million 737 MAX 8: $110 million 737 MAX 200: $112.9 million 737 MAX 9: $116.6 million 747 Family 747-8: $378.5 million 747-8 Freighter: $379.1 million 767 Family 767-300ER: $197.1 million 767-300 Freighter: $199.3 million 777 Family 777-200ER: $277.3 million 777-200LR: $313.8 million 777-300ER: $339.6 million 777 Freighter: $318.7 million 777-8: $371 million 777-9: $400 million 787 Family 787-8: $224.6 million 787-9: $264.6 million 787-10: $306.1 million Boeing is seeing a resurgence in military aircraft orders, and that is good news for the company as it tries to make up for the slowdown in commercial jets. Not only is the U.S. Department of Defense buying more, but foreign governments from Canada to Qatar are spending as well.

But it all comes at a pivotal time, as President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. As president, Trump will nominate a NASA administrator and will be tasked with setting a budget for the space program, which will then have to be approved by Congress. The current proposed budget for NASA in 2017 is $19 billion — down $300 million from the previous year but still an improvement from the past decade, which saw the end of the space shuttle program.

Whomever Trump nominates could set the tone for the future of the space program, including how NASA partners with the commercial space industry, according to Jim Cantrell, CEO of Vector Space Systems and a founding member of SpaceX. With Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel acting as a close Trump adviser, Cantrell said "some of the more commercial thinking" he brings "is very healthy, and if Trump continues to do that, it will be very positive for NASA." Presidents are usually relatively hands-off with NASA; however, Cantrell sees an opportunity for Trump, who has previously called space "terrific." "Occasionally you see presidents come in and provide a clear change in direction of leadership," he said, referring to John F. Kennedy's decision to go to the moon and George W. Bush's appointment of a NASA administrator who helped paved the way for partnerships with the private space industry. "The potential is there for Trump to do the same thing," Cantrell said. Ending Reliance on the Russians Since NASA grounded its shuttle program in 2011, the space agency has been buying seats aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule in order to send American astronauts to and from the International Space Station. It likely won't happen in 2017, but expect to hear updates from NASA partners SpaceX and Boeing as both make strides in their testing of commercial crew vessels: When they are ready to shuttle humans, SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's Starliner would cost about $58 million per seat, according to NASA. By comparison, a seat aboard the Russian Soyuz has the heftier price tag of $81 million. A Return to Flight for SpaceX SpaceX is planning to return to flight in January — just four months after an anomaly destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket and the satellite it had been set to carry into space. Elon Musk's company is targeting a January launch, exact date to be determined, for Iridium's mobile communications fleet. SpaceX's timeline is ambitious, but the company has pulled it off in the past. After its Dragon capsule exploded en route to the International Space Station, the company was sidelined for six months. The Unpredictable Jeff Bezos Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is a member of the billionaire rocket club. As CEO of Blue Origin, he's largely kept quiet about the company's plans, instead telling the world after they've pulled off something impressive. "They have been unpredictable from the start because there isn't much known about what their core path is," said Cantrell. "I am fascinated to see what it is the guy has in mind. His style is very different from Elon's. Elon says what he wants to do and goes and gathers the money to do it. Bezos suddenly shows up with a fully functional vehicle that blows your mind." Blue Origin has been following a cycle of "launch, land, and repeat," with its reusable New Shepard rocket and vehicle, which goes into sub-orbital space. Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon and founder of Blue Origin. Matthew Staver / Bloomberg via Getty Images Building a Space-Based Internet "I see it as a very bright year for the space internet," Cantrell said. Building a space-based internet is not a new idea, but it's one that has taken off once again largely due to new technology and lower launch costs. While a number of companies, including SpaceX, have expressed a desire to build a space-based internet, it's shaping up to be a big year for OneWeb. The company, whose investors include The Virgin Group, Coca-Cola, Airbus, and Qualcomm, announced earlier this month it had received a $1.2 billion injection of capital, which will support production in a high volume satellite facility, according to the company. "My bet is on OneWeb to get it going first," Cantrell said. Virgin Galactic Virgin Galactic suffered a major setback with its SpaceShipTwo when it broke apart over the Mojave Desert in 2014, killing the co-pilot and seriously injuring the pilot, who was able to parachute to safety. Earlier this month, Virgin Galactic marked its first major milestone since the crash when its new spaceship, the VSS Unity, successfully completed its first glide test. When it comes to space tourism, Virgin Galactic has been one of the most visible companies setting imaginations wild with the idea of actually letting human tourists visit space. "They aren't going to move as aggressively forward as the smaller companies launching unmanned stuff," Cantrell said. They'll work on "getting the risk of losing human life down" and showing their more than 700 customers who have been patiently waiting that they have a "strong future."

Before it slams into the ringed planet, Cassini will come as close as 1,012 miles above Saturn's clouds before it makes a fatal plunge into the atmosphere. The space probe launched in 1997 and arrived at Saturn in 2004.

Wake up, Washington! In the specter of the anticipated “Obamacare” repeal and the subsequent loss of federal Medicaid subsidies, Gov. Inslee has proposed some $4 billion in tax increases. Though failing in the past election, the governor has also proposed the addition of a new “carbon tax.” Furthermore, the governor’s recent proclamation of Washington to be a “sanctuary” state virtually assures the loss of substantial federal funds from the incoming presidential administration, while placing an increasing load on state coffers. Topping it off, the minimum wage increase, which failed throughout the state, except in Puget Sound, has made Washington the least business-friendly state in the nation. “No worries,” you say, “we’ve got Boeing.” Though directly unaffected by the minimum wage increase, the multitudes of small, local subcontractors that Boeing uses are not, and when those subcontractors are forced to raise their prices to comply, it places ever-increasing fiscal pressure on Boeing, raising their costs. Make no mistake, Boeing is fiscally conscious of these increases and is expanding its facilities and production in South Carolina. And with Seattle being the largest “sanctuary city” in the nation, think of how this area will look after the $5 billion or so in annual Boeing salaries disappears — shades of 1970 all over again, only worse! Contact your legislators! The governor is out of touch with reality, spending our money like a drunken sailor. The state needs to do what the rest of us must do — trim the budget and live within our means.

News Business Business News Fat Cat Wednesday: Top executives have already earned the average worker's entire annual salary With pay of more than £1,000 an hour it has taken fewer than three days to out-earn the typical employee - the national living wage is £7.20 Ben Chapman Tuesday 3 January 2017 19:25 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Sir Martin Sorrel says he is worth every penny of his £70m pay packet Getty Senior executives have already made more money in 2017 than the average British worker will earn all year, new research shows. The High Pay Centre has dubbed today "Fat Cat Wednesday", after finding that bosses will rake in the median salary of £28,200 by midday. With average hourly salaries of £1,000 an hour  it has taken less than three days to out-earn the typical worker. Meanwhile the national living wage stands at £7.20 per hour. Read more UK salaries less than they were 12 years ago, official figures reveal The High Pay Centre said it made the “generous assumption” that top bosses work 12 hours a day, most weekends and take fewer than 10 days holiday a year, in order to justify their pay packets. Bosses of FTSE 100 companies took home close to £4 million on average, or 144 times what normal workers in 2015 the report found.  While top executives enjoyed a 10 per cent pay hike in 2015, real average wages have stagnated for more than a decade, figures from the Office of national Statistics show.

High Pay Centre director Stefan Stern said: “Our new year calculation is not designed to make the return to work harder than it already is.

Bobby Yip/Reuters/File | Caption Steven Porter Staff | @reporterporter January 3, 2017 —Threatening once again to impose a hefty tariff on foreign-made goods, US President-elect Donald Trump singled out yet another manufacturing company Tuesday via Twitter, criticizing General Motors Co. for making some of its compact cars in Mexico. Since winning the presidential election in November, Mr. Trump has made a habit of targeting big businesses one by one, including United Technologies Inc., Boeing Co., and Lockheed Martin Corp., to name a few. A spokesman for his transition team said these individual critiques reflect a broader goal for the incoming Republican administration to rescue American workers. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors," spokesman Sean Spicer told Reuters. "But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind." Although not specific, Trump's Tuesday threat was clear: "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border," he wrote. "Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 General Motors responded with a statement acknowledging that "a small number" of Cruze hatchbacks are manufactured in Mexico and sold in the United States. The overwhelming majority of Cruze models sold to Americans, however, are sedans – all of which are made in Lordstown, Ohio, the company said. Of the 190,000 Cruze models sold in the US last year, only 4,500 – less than 2.4 percent – were hatchbacks made in Mexico, a GM spokesperson tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email. Although sales were down significantly last year, the Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Trump – who has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Mexico, the US, and Canada, which took effect in 1994 – did not specify how he would impose the tariff threatened in his tweet or how severe it would be. But the comment echoes past statements in which he has threatened to impose a 35 percent tax on foreign-made goods sold to Americans by companies that offshore American jobs, an idea economists have said would not work. "Imposing tariffs or putting up trade barriers may sound good, but it will hurt our economy and credibility," Wendy Cutler, a former acting deputy US Trade Representative who helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership last year, told Reuters in March. And others point out that presidents lack the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally without congressional approval, as CBS Money Watch reported. Hours after Trump's tweet about GM, rival carmaker Ford Motor Co. announced it would cancel plans to built a $1.6-billion factory in Mexico, instead investing $700 million at a factory in Michigan. Shortly before noon, Trump retweeted a link to a Fox News article praising him as "quite the job creator" for putting pressure on Ford and others to keep jobs stateside. "@DanScavino: Ford to scrap Mexico plant, invest in Michigan due to Trump policies"https://t.co/137nUo03Gl— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM chief executive Mary Barra is among business leaders who sit on a council unveiled last month to advise Trump on job creation efforts. Detroit's "Big Three" automakers – GM, Ford, and Chrysler – have all sought in recent years to produce more small cars in Mexico for the North American market in an effort to lower labor costs, while having American workers build trucks, sport utility vehicles, and luxury cars, which are more profitable. In 2014, GM announced a $5-billion investment in its Mexican plants, creating 5,600 jobs. In November, GM announced plans to lay off nearly 2,000 employees at two US auto plants in early 2017, including at the facility in Lordstown.

Metro Denver’s housing market developing a split personality, sending rents down and home prices up By Ben Brody and David Welch, Bloomberg News President-elect Donald Trump criticized General Motors for building a version of the Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico, saying the largest U.S. automaker should build the car at home or face a hefty tariff. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” Every Cruze sedan is built in Ohio and most of GM’s Mexican-made hatchbacks are exported to global markets, said Tony Cervone, a company spokesman. He declined to comment on whether the company planned to talk to Trump. Trump’s tweet is the latest example of interventionist behavior toward U.S. companies that have included Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies. His threats against Mexican-built vehicles have the potential to affect the nine global carmakers, including Toyota and Nissan, that have announced more than $24 billion in Mexico investments since 2010. Volkswagen’s Audi, BMW and Daimler each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the country. The Trump transition team has said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra will be among the panel of business leaders giving him strategic advice on the economy after he takes office. The Detroit-based company said in November it planned to cut a shift at its Cruze plant in Ohio and furlough 1,200 workers there due to weak demand for small cars. Glenn Johnson, president of United Auto Workers Local 1112, which represents GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio, said in an interview at the time of the layoffs that he didn’t know if his plant had the tooling in place to make the Cruze hatchback version. The hatchback version sells in small numbers and probably would not rescue an entire shift, he said. Trump has made a point of pressuring large U.S. manufacturers into keeping production in the U.S. He criticized Ford during the presidential campaign for moving production of the Ford Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico. In November, he said on Twitter he talked with Chairman Bill Ford and got the automaker to commit to keeping production of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle in Kentucky instead of Mexico. At the time, Trump indicated he’d saved the plant. In reality, the plant was not scheduled to close. Its employees assemble the Ford Escape SUV, a better-selling model. More than 5,000 employees work nearly around the clock on three crews to meet demand for the two SUVs.

Who's next? President-elect Donald Trump speaks to workers at Carrier air conditioning and heating on December 1, 2016 in Indianapolis, Indiana. (Photo: Tasos Katopodis, Getty Images) Donald Trump tweets and an auto titan retreats. But it's more complicated than that. It's increasingly a story of an unconventional president-elect who enjoys keeping opponents on edge and a century-old auto industry trying to adjust as quickly and nimbly as possible. Here's what we know so far and what Ford's decision to back off plans to expand in Mexico and invest in Michigan could mean for the auto industry and corporate America in a time of Trump. 1. An incoming president notches another victory after chiding an industrial titan into reversing course.  First Carrier, now Ford. The air-conditioning company originally decided to move many of its Indiana plant jobs to Mexico. But after the election, Carrier reached an agreement with the incoming administration of President-elect Trump to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in the state. Then Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford told the president-elect that the automaker no longer plans to move production of its Lincoln MKC from Louisville to Mexico. Trump took credit for causing Ford to change its plans in two tweets. Tuesday, after Ford's announcement about the cancellation of its new Mexican plant in favor of a Michigan investment, Trump again touted his role in the move on social media. Who could be next? Well, Trump's Twitter account in recent months has targeted online retailer Amazon, defense contractors Lockheed Martin  and Boeing, department store Macy's, mobile phone carrier T-Mobile and industrial parts maker Rexnord, according to the Associated Press. 2. A Michigan plant once feared slated for closure could be on the leading edge of auto technology Workers surround a 2014 Ford Fusion which ceremoniously was rolled off the line at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan on Thursday, August 29, 2013.  (Photo: Eric Seals) Ford's Flat Rock plant, formerly shared in a joint venture with Mazda that ended in 2012, has produced exclusively Ford vehicles since then. The plant now builds two Ford icons: the Mustang and Lincoln Continental. More than 3,200 workers are employed at the plant, according to a Ford online fact sheet. The plant's future has been in doubt from time to time in recent years. In 2012, Flat Rock was operating a single shift and was in danger of being closed. It was saved with the decision to add the Ford Fusion to augment the three shifts of production at a plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, that could not keep up with demand. Ford invested $555 million to make Flat Rock flexible enough to make multiple vehicles. A second shift was added in August 2013 to boost Fusion production. But then Fusion production left while Mustang continued and Lincoln Continental production launched. Now the automaker is investing $700 million and adding 700 direct new jobs in the Flat Rock Assembly Plant to create a factory capable of producing high-tech electrified and autonomous vehicles — plus the iconic Mustang and Continental. Ford said an all-new fully electric small SUV, coming by 2020, will be engineered to deliver an estimated range of at least 300 miles. It will be built at the Flat Rock plant and sold in North America, Europe and Asia. The plant is also getting a high-volume autonomous vehicle designed for commercial ride hailing or ride sharing. The hybrid vehicle will debut in 2021, according to Ford. 3. Ford appears to be on a charm campaign for Donald Trump Bill Ford, the executive chairman of Ford Motor Company talks with automotive journalists after the 2017 Ford Raptor and three versions of the 2017 Ford Fusion were revealed during the 2016 North American International Auto Show at Joe Louis Arena in downtown Detroit on Monday, Jan. 11, 2016.  (Photo: Eric Seals) Early on, Ford sounded almost defiant amid criticism by Trump. “We are everything that he should be celebrating about this country," Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford told reporters in Detroit in September before Trump's Nov. 8 victory. "We pulled ourselves up with our bootstraps. We paid back our borrowings. We are very healthy again. We’ve been adding jobs in the U.S. And we’re the largest manufacturer of cars and trucks in the U.S." Ford, who is Henry Ford's great-grandson, added that "investments we are making in the U.S. are enormous." Trump's "basic premise is wrong. For over 100 years we’ve been in markets all over the world making vehicles. We’ve made vehicles in Mexico for a long time,” Ford said, later disclosing that the auto industry scion and president-elect had met one-on-one in 2016. Less than two months later, the automaker's tone had changed. Last month, Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks liked many of the pro-growth, pro-business polices that  Trump's incoming administration wants to pursue even though the president-elect has repeatedly threatened to punish the automaker for moving small-car production to Mexico. "I think governing and the campaign are two different things," Shanks told the Free Press. "I am hopeful and optimistic that this change in tone will carry forward into policies that ... will be quite different than the prior administration but will be positive for growth." Shanks said Ford hopes Trump's administration will consider easing greenhouse gas regulations and fuel economy regulations scheduled to take effect between 2020 and 2025. It also hopes for corporate tax reform. Shanks said Ford hopes the Trump administration explores whether "some adjustment that can be made to the present regulatory framework that recognizes the market realities." But that doesn't mean Ford isn't worried about Trump's free-trade polices and potential changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. "Trade probably is one (area) that we are concerned about," Shanks said. "On trade we will have to see ... I think he is starting to put people around him who know part of that business … and recognize the incredible integration of Mexico and Canada and the United States." Tuesday's Ford announcement again mentioned Trump admiringly. On July 23, 2015, Ford Motor Company President and CEO Mark Fields speaks during a ceremony to mark the opening of contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers in Detroit. Fields said Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, that Ford Motor Co. will have a fully autonomous vehicle ready to provide ride-hailing or ride-sharing services by 2021.  (Photo: Paul Sancya, AP) “We look at all the factors and our view is we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he is talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing," Ford CEO Mark Fields said. “We informed him and also Vice President-elect (Mike) Pence this morning. They were very pleased that we are investing here in the United States." And it's not like Trump had disliked everything connected to the Blue Oval automaker.  Last month, former Ford President and CEO Alan Mulally met with Trump to talk about the Secretary of State post that eventually went to Exxon's CEO. 4. Despite Ford's decision to invest in the U.S. rather than Mexico, the overall industry's investment south of the border is slated to continue. The president for the Americas of Ford Motor Company, Joseph Hinrichs smiles while speaking at Los Pinos presidential palace in Mexico City on April 17, 2015. The Ford Motor Company had announced a $2.5 billion plan to expand factories in Mexico to make next-generation engines and transmissions. Speaking at an event alongside President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico's capital, Hinrichs said the projects in the states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato will create 3,800 direct jobs.  (Photo: YURI CORTEZ, AFP/Getty Images) In recent years, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Mazda, Toyota and Volkswagen have all announced plans to either expand existing plants or build new ones in Mexico. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles also has said it is considering an expansion of its production there. By 2020, Mexico is expected to build one in four vehicles in a North American industry producing 8.6 million units a year. But Trump's election may cause forecasters to revisit their projections. Ford said last month that it decided to continue producing the Lincoln MKC in Kentucky because of "changing business conditions" — not because of threats Trump has made over the past 18 months to impose tariffs on cars made in Mexico. However, Ford does concede that the economic policies the president-elect has proposed helped to tip the scale toward keeping production of the crossover in Kentucky. Unlike Ford, GM has mostly avoided criticism from Trump — until Tuesday — even though it announced plans in December 2014 to invest $5 billion in Mexico through 2018 — a move that would double its production capacity there. GM said in 2014 the investment would create 5,600 jobs in Mexico. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles noted that it has announced $8.4 billion in U.S.-based investments and has added almost 25,000 U.S. jobs since 2009. However, FCA also is moving production of its next-generation Jeep Compass from Belvidere, Ill., to Toluca, Mexico. Even some Michigan Democrats blame the North American Free Trade Agreement — passed under Democratic President Bill Clinton — for moves south of the border that ultimately cost Americans job opportunities. "Our industry has been badly hurt by NAFTA, which has cost us a million jobs across the country," U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn, said Tuesday of the auto industry while joined by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka to call on Trump to live up to his campaign promises to renegotiate NAFTA. 5. Ford's sizable electrification investment comes as demand for vehicles remains slack From left, LG Group Chairman Koo Bon-moo, Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and LG Chem CEO Peter Bahn-Suk Kim break ground on the new LG Chem plant that will manufacture advanced batteries for Chevrolet and Ford electric cars, Thursday, July 15, 2010, in Holland, Mich.  (Photo: Carlos Osorio, AP) Every automaker likes to talk about electrified vehicles. But reality shows they still sell very few of them. According to the website Inside EVs, there were about 134,000 electric vehicles sold in the U.S. through November. According to Autodata, total U.S. sales through November rose to a seasonally adjusted annual running rate of 17.87 million. Going forward, for example, the future of federal tax credits for buying electric cars and trucks — a key incentive to get consumers into the showroom — is unknown. "The short answer is that we don’t know what will happen with the Trump administration and electric vehicles," Dave Reichmuth, senior engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists clean vehicles program, told the Free Press in November. "It might be awhile before we understand the policy priorities for the new administration." 2013 Ford C-Max Hybrid: C-MAX Hybrid headlined Ford's transformed lineup, one-third of which will feature a model with 40 mpg or more in 2012.  (Photo: Ford) Still, most car makers are global companies, and China and Europe are moving forward with their incentives for non-gas-burning vehicles. Whatever the Trump administration does, the rest of the world will not likely abandon the Paris Agreement to reduce the global growth of carbon emissions. Ford said Tuesday it's trying to make owning an electrified vehicle easier than ever. Ford touted its memorandum of understanding with several other automakers in Europe to create an ultra-fast charging network projected to be significantly faster than the most powerful charging system deployed today. An initial target of about 400 sites in Europe is planned. By 2020, consumers should have access to thousands of high-powered charging points, according to Ford. Ford also is piloting wireless technology on company EVs in the U.S. and Europe that make recharging as easy as pulling into a parking spot so drivers never forget to recharge. Wireless recharging extends electric-only range for short distance commuters, even during quick stops. The system known as FordPass also can help consumers reserve charging times.

The company's announcement culminated a dizzying morning that started with Trump threatening to punish General Motors for building a version of its fading compact car in Mexico. GM challenged his assertions, but minutes later Ford — a frequent target of Trump's campaign-trail criticism — struck a different note.

More videos Trump puts pressure on US auto industry Ford cancels Mexico factory plans after President-elect Donald Trump assails General Motors and threatens a "big border tax" for producing cars in Mexico. Trump was "very pleased we were making this investment in US jobs," Mark Fields, Ford's chief executive officer, told reporters at the automaker's plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, where it will add 700 positions. "One of the factors we're looking at is the more positive US business environment that we foresee under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies that he's been outlining. So this is a vote of confidence around that." However, Mr Fields said the move was primarily a response to a decline in the North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said the company would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Trump faces a divide in his party if he is not tougher on Russia. Photo: AP Trump has pledged to revive US manufacturing that has steadily migrated to countries with cheaper labor over the past couple decades. His persistent interventionist campaign has targeted companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies, singling out those whose job moves or prices have rankled him. While many analysts doubt the long-term efficacy of his approach, short-term gains, like Tuesday's, can be had. Michigan's Man The auto industry has been a special prize for Trump, conjuring visions of a thriving, 1950s-era Detroit where shift work created jobs that paid for mortgages, college educations and an annual vacation. His feud with the auto industry emerged during the campaign. He appeared eight times in Michigan, driving home a message that he would cancel the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blamed for sending auto-factory jobs to Mexico. Trump was the first Republican presidential candidate to win the state since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Advertisement General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Companies aside from Ford may find it more advantageous to work with Trump rather than to battle his unprecedented social-media reach and willingness to get involved in individual deals. "You're just setting yourself up to lose," said Joe Watkins, a Pennsylvania-based Republican consultant and former aide to President George H.W. Bush. "He can continue to keep you front and centre in the news just with a single tweet, so why do you want to engage in a fight?" The news sent Ford shares up 3.2 per cent to $12.52 and GM shares rose 0.6 per cent to $35 at 2:10 p.m. in New York. The Mexican peso, meanwhile, weakened beyond 21 to the dollar as Ford's announcement sparked concern that Trump is succeeding in curtailing investment in the country. Earlier in the day, Trump trained his sights on GM. Trump said in a Twitter post that the largest US automaker, which manufactures a Chevrolet Cruze hatchback model in San Luis Potosi, should build the car at home or face a hefty tariff. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border," Trump tweeted. "Make in USA. or pay big border tax!" That barb elicited a terse response from GM spokesman Tony Cervone challenging his assertions: "General Motors manufactures the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US." Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.https://t.co/siXrptsOrt— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 The automaker has sold only 4500 hatchbacks north of the border, said another spokesman, Jim Cain. The 190,000 Cruze sedans that Americans have bought were all built in Lordstown, according to Cervone. Cervone declined to say whether the company would engage further with Trump. There is no tariff on cars built in Mexico and shipped over the border for sale in the US Mexico's government has courted car companies around the world by entering into 13 free-trade agreements with 44 countries that make up 60 per cent of the global gross domestic product. The country has tariff-free access to 47 per cent of the worldwide vehicle market, compared with 9 per cent for the US Mexican autoworkers earn less than $6 an hour on average, with a minimum wage of $4.50, according to the Center for Automotive Research. Their United Auto Workers union peers average $28 an hour. President-Elect's Pressure Nine global carmakers, including Toyota and Nissan, have announced more than $24 billion in Mexico investments since 2010. Volkswagen AG's Audi, BMW AG and Daimler AG each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the country. Trump has made a point of pressuring large US manufacturers into keeping production in the US. He criticised Ford during the presidential campaign for moving manufacturing of the Ford Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico. In November, he said on Twitter that he talked with Chairman Bill Ford and got the automaker to commit to keeping production of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle in Kentucky instead of Mexico. At the time, Trump indicated he'd saved the plant. In reality, the plant wasn't scheduled to close. Its employees assemble the Ford Escape SUV, a better-selling model. More than 5,000 employees work almost around the clock on three crews to meet demand for the two SUVs. Fields expressed skepticism that Trump would slap a 35 per cent tariff on the Focus, which will still be built in Mexico. "The right policies will prevail because we share the same aspirations that I think the president-elect does — we want a very strong US economy," Fields said. "The president elect has run on many of these stances and he seems to be a man of his word." Bloomberg, Reuters Advertisement HuffPost Australia Man Spends 30 Hours Disputing False ...

Finance Search Automakers in headlights as Trump set to take the wheelBy John BIERS | AFP – Tue, Jan 3, 2017 10:52 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo Ford is adding 700 US jobs and investing $700 million during the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan US automakers found themselves in the political hot seat Tuesday, with President-elect Donald Trump lambasting GM for importing Mexican-made cars into the United States and Ford scrapping plans for a new plant south of the border. Trump, who won the presidency in part with tough talk on trade, has shown his willingness to single out individual companies by name if they displease him, and Ford seems to be the latest to fall in line. Also on Tuesday, Trump nominated Reagan-era protectionist lawyer Robert Lighthizer to serve as US trade representative, signaling he intends to make good on pledges to renegotiate trade deals he blames for killing millions of American jobs. The moves likely will loom large over next week's Detroit auto show, when the US industry's top executives gather to show off their new models. The president-elect, who has previously taken to Twitter to slam Boeing and Lockheed Martin, made GM his latest target in a breakfast-hour tweet threatening to impose tariff on imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze models into the US. - About-face at Ford - A couple of hours later, Ford announced it was scuttling plans for a new $1.6 billion factory in San Luis Potosi, and instead invest $700 million over the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan to build electric and self-driving vehicles. The Ford decision was an about-face after the second-biggest US automaker repeatedly rebuffed Trump's criticism over its plans for the Mexico plant during and after the presidential campaign. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the decision reflected the hope that Trump's policies will boost the US manufacturing environment. "It's literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that he has been outlining and that's why we're making this decision to invest here in the US and our plant here in Michigan," Fields told CNN. He said company chairman Bill Ford spoke Tuesday morning to Trump, and that he himself had spoken to Vice-President-elect Pence about the move, which Ford said would result in 700 new US jobs over four years. The new plant, announced in April, was expected to employ 2,800 by 2020. Mexico's government said it "regrets" Ford's decision, and that the company gave assurances it would repay "any expenditures made by the state government to facilitate this investment." - Another win for Trump? - Trump took to Twitter again to crow about the Ford reversal: "Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION." Ford's decision creates a "political headline win for Trump, Ford and the UAW," yet the diminished demand for small cars also makes it a positive decision in terms of business rationale, investment bank RBC Capital Markets said in a note. Meanwhile, GM responded to Trump's Twitter attack with a statement emphasizing that the vast majority of its Cruze cars sold in the US are made in Ohio, with just a small percentage imported from a plant across the southern border. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio," the auto giant said. Of 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the US, only 4,500 were hatchbacks made in Mexico, said a GM spokesman. - Trade war coming? - Tough talk on trade helped Trump win election, and on the campaign trail he threatened to impose a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico. He has also pledged to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, blaming NAFTA and other trade agreements for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. The appointment of Lighthizer as his top trade negotiator suggests Trump plans to follow through on that rhetoric. Lighthizer served as deputy US trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s, when the focus was on attacking Japan for its huge exports into the US market. But leading business lobbies such as the Business Roundtable have cautioned that US trading partners could retaliate against any new tariffs, threatening key US markets. "Any significant tariff increase within the North American region would impact the auto industry greatly and that just really makes the industry... much less competitive," said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. Automakers are also worried that Trump's tough rhetoric towards China could trigger a full-scale trade war if the Republican makes good on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Beijing.

That is, jawboning by exerting rhetorical bombast focused on people, corporations and institutions, with massive media propulsion behind the very personal presidency he will establish. It will be a natural daily extension of his boundless, easily bruisable ego. Trump has embraced these tactics as both a candidate and president-elect. He went after Carrier Corp. (a subsidiary of United Technologies) and Ford Motor Co. for shipping jobs to Mexico, after Boeing for charging too much for the new Air Force One and after Lockheed/Martin for over-pricing its F-35 fighter planes. Previous presidents, knowing they have the "bully pulpit," have generally been averse to the sort of jawboning that singles out specific firms and persons. President Harry Truman did take on a newspaper columnist who criticized his daughter, Margaret's, singing skills. President John F. Kennedy went after U.S. Steel and referred to price hikes from the industry as "a wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest." But generally, presidents do not want to be seen as bullies, preferring one competitor against another or frittering their presidential authority by getting into petty squabbles. In the midst of more serious matters of state, jawboning can be a serious distraction that alienates larger numbers of people who may side with the assailed. With Trump, none of this may matter. He has said repeatedly that he always slams back twenty times harder than anyone who slams him. He revels in his 20 million Twitter followers and loves how his tweets are carried by the mass media. That gives him a personal "mass media" which he controls, unfiltered by his antagonists in the press. Rather than playing the "going-through-channels" game in Washington, he'll want to throw his opponents off balance through personal attacks, including attacks on members of Congress and governors. He is into the psychology of human frailties, vanities and occupational vulnerabilities. He knows that jawboning one person, firm or politician will put others on the defensive wondering whether they will be next, or putting foreign powers off balance because of his furious unpredictability. The downside for Trump is that he will be so absorbed in jawboning and rebutting critics that he won't be paying attention to what his underlings are doing until trouble rises to his level for decision. Jawboning can lead to complex consequences when it comes from the most powerful office in the county. Should Trump use jawboning to give corporate gougers of workers, consumers, taxpayers and communities some pause and restraint, if not produce outright reversal of policy, he can become the champion of the underdogs and those bullied. He's already said that drug prices are too high. If he believes that plain fact, can you guess what he'll do next with his tweet on a specific company or a pay-or-die drug costing patients $100,000 or more a year? Trump is known not to like detailed immersion into issues or detailed briefings by civil servants. He likes to set the pace, establish the new focus of the day and, above all, get even with anyone who stands up to or embarrasses him. He seems to behave as if rules and norms do not apply to him. The strange Trump personality can radiate in many directions. Some results may be beneficial. Others - such as in the case of a stateless terror attack - may worsen a bad situation because of impulsive and violent over-reaction, leading to a worsening situation overseas and damage to the national interests, civil liberties and other constitutional rights of the American people.

The Air Force on Friday released its final request for proposal (RFP) on a contract valued at around $16 billion for a new T-X trainer to replace the venerable T-38. The Air Force also issued an RFP to purchase 17 E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) planes that were first deployed as tank hunters in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm. The contract is valued at $6.9 billion for development and production. Three teams led by Northrop Grumman Co. (NYSE: NOC), Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) are already working on bids. Privately held Sierra Nevada may inject a surprise bid, and other prime defense contractors could also enter the fray. Defense Department acquisition chief Frank Kendall used authority ceded to him in the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act to waive a congressional requirement that the contract be awarded only as a firm, fixed-price deal. The waiver allows the Air Force to proceed with its planned hybrid contracting strategy that includes both fixed-price and cost-plus elements. Air Force officials had argued that limiting the JSTARS deal to a fixed-price contract would delay the program by months. Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said: We realize intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR] is currently a combatant commander top priority. Given the language in this year’s defense policy bill, we took additional time before releasing the JSTARS request for proposal. With the support of the department on the importance of JSTARS to national security, we are moving out to deliver this critical ISR capability. We will continually look for ways to speed up the process towards initial operational capability. The current JSTARS aircraft, designated the E-8C, is a second-hand Boeing 707-300 that includes modifications and equipment installed by Grumman prior to its acquisition by Northrop. The plane is now being used to track down oil tankers, trucks and other vehicles used by the Islamic State terrorists in Syria and Iraq. Some of the existing planes have been grounded due to concerns over maintenance, according to Aviation Week. The Air Force RFP for the new planes specifically excludes used, reconditioned or remanufactured aircraft. Boeing’s 737-700, the smallest of the company’s commercial jets, is likely to be competing against a Northrop design that uses a Gulfstream G550 or G560 business jet and a Lockheed version of Bombardier’s Global 6000 business jet. The Air Force has determined it wants a smaller airframe than the Boeing 767-400ER originally specified and then scrapped in 2007 for cost reasons.

Bobby Yip/Reuters/File | Caption Steven Porter Staff | @reporterporter January 3, 2017 —Threatening once again to impose a hefty tariff on foreign-made goods, US President-elect Donald Trump singled out yet another manufacturing company Tuesday via Twitter, criticizing General Motors Co. for making some of its compact cars in Mexico. Since winning the presidential election in November, Mr. Trump has made a habit of targeting big businesses one by one, including United Technologies Inc., Boeing Co., and Lockheed Martin Corp., to name a few. A spokesman for his transition team said these individual critiques reflect a broader goal for the incoming Republican administration to rescue American workers. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors," spokesman Sean Spicer told Reuters. "But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind." Although not specific, Trump's Tuesday threat was clear: "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border," he wrote. "Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 General Motors responded with a statement acknowledging that "a small number" of Cruze hatchbacks are manufactured in Mexico and sold in the United States. The overwhelming majority of Cruze models sold to Americans, however, are sedans – all of which are made in Lordstown, Ohio, the company said. Of the 190,000 Cruze models sold in the US last year, only 4,500 – less than 2.4 percent – were hatchbacks made in Mexico, a GM spokesperson tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email. Although sales were down significantly last year, the Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Trump – who has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among Mexico, the US, and Canada, which took effect in 1994 – did not specify how he would impose the tariff threatened in his tweet or how severe it would be. But the comment echoes past statements in which he has threatened to impose a 35 percent tax on foreign-made goods sold to Americans by companies that offshore American jobs, an idea economists have said would not work. "Imposing tariffs or putting up trade barriers may sound good, but it will hurt our economy and credibility," Wendy Cutler, a former acting deputy US Trade Representative who helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership last year, told Reuters in March. And others point out that presidents lack the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally without congressional approval, as CBS Money Watch reported. Hours after Trump's tweet about GM, rival carmaker Ford Motor Co. announced it would cancel plans to built a $1.6-billion factory in Mexico, instead investing $700 million at a factory in Michigan. Shortly before noon, Trump retweeted a link to a Fox News article praising him as "quite the job creator" for putting pressure on Ford and others to keep jobs stateside. "@DanScavino: Ford to scrap Mexico plant, invest in Michigan due to Trump policies"https://t.co/137nUo03Gl— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM chief executive Mary Barra is among business leaders who sit on a council unveiled last month to advise Trump on job creation efforts. Detroit's "Big Three" automakers – GM, Ford, and Chrysler – have all sought in recent years to produce more small cars in Mexico for the North American market in an effort to lower labor costs, while having American workers build trucks, sport utility vehicles, and luxury cars, which are more profitable. In 2014, GM announced a $5-billion investment in its Mexican plants, creating 5,600 jobs. In November, GM announced plans to lay off nearly 2,000 employees at two US auto plants in early 2017, including at the facility in Lordstown.

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) Posted: Tuesday, January 3, 2017 9:00 am | Updated: 9:30 am, Tue Jan 3, 2017. Trump's latest US corporate Twitter target: General Motors Associated Press | 0 comments DETROIT (AP) — In another tweet targeting a U.S. company, President-elect Donald Trump threatened Tuesday to slap a tax on General Motors for importing compact cars to the U.S. from Mexico. But GM imports only a small percentage of its Chevrolet Cruze small cars from Mexico, with the vast majority made at a sprawling factory complex in Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland. Trump tweeted early Tuesday that GM is sending Mexican-made Cruzes to the U.S. tax-free. He told GM to make the cars in the U.S. "or pay big border tax!" GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it sold only about 4,500 of them in the U.S. last year, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. The company sold about 172,000 Cruzes through November. The hatchback, which went on sale in the U.S. in the fall, is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. Cruze hatchback production amounts to less than a day of output at the Lordstown plant, said Glenn Johnson, president of a United Auto Workers union local at the factory. The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. "It makes for news, that's all," Johnson said of Trump's tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatchback model. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the GM tweet wasn't about just one company. "I think he generally made it very clear he wants to bring American jobs home. He doesn't want jobs to leave this country," he said. Immediately after the tweet, which was posted around 7:35 a.m., GM shares fell about 1 percent in premarket trading. But by early afternoon they had rebounded and were up 0.5 percent to $35.01. The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax companies that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the U.S. Trump's targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy's have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Last year Trump went after Ford Motor Co. for plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the Detroit-area factory that now makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant is to get a new small pickup truck and SUV. Ford announced Tuesday that Focus production is still going to Mexico, but it would scrap plans for a new $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Instead, it will invest $700 million at a Michigan plant to make autonomous and electric vehicles, creating 700 U.S. jobs. Last year Trump touted a deal to keep 800 jobs at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis from going to Mexico. He has promised to lower corporate tax rates to preserve factory jobs inside the United States, while threatening harsh penalties for companies that produce goods overseas to save on labor costs. On Twitter, Trump warned that he will impose a 35 percent tariff on the goods imported by companies that outsource production. Nearly every automaker produces small cars in Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Companies have said it's difficult to make lower-margin small cars profitably in the U.S. due to higher wages here. Last year, GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler made about 1.6 million vehicles in Mexico, about 17 percent of the vehicles produced overall in North America, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. That's projected to rise to 2.5 million, or about 26 percent, by 2022. Automakers and parts supply companies have added 12,000 U.S. jobs in the past year, according to government statistics. GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the compact car, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the U.S. are now made in Ohio, he said. In November, GM said it would lay off about 1,250 workers at the Lordstown plant due to sagging demand for cars as U.S. buyers take advantage of low gasoline prices to buy trucks and SUVs. The workers on the third shift at Lordstown will go in indefinite layoff starting Jan. 23, although some may move to other GM factories. Workers on two shifts will continue making the Cruze in Ohio even though its sales were down more than 18 percent through November. Shifting demand from cars to trucks and SUVS is forcing General Motors to lay off more than 2,000 workers. Last month, 61.5 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales were trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp., and analysts say there's no sign that will change anytime soon. ____ Josh Boak and Christopher S.

(Photo: Kenneth Lim)  Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SINGAPORE: Despite concerns that US President-elect Donald Trump’s isolationalist policies and his promise to withdraw America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership would hurt economic ties between the US and Asia, outgoing US Ambassador to Singapore Kirk Wagar says it will be “business as usual” for Singapore and ASEAN. “The concept that a trade agreement is a be-all and end-all for our economic engagement is insane”, he said on Tuesday (Jan 3), citing the nature of the US political system, American businesses’ long-term investments in Singapore, and the growing Asian middle class as some reasons why a Trump Administration will not close the door on deals. “Unlike most countries, our central government doesn't drive our nation,” Mr Wagar said. “I’m pretty sure that Tim Cook or Bill Gates never asked Barack Obama or will ask Donald Trump where they’re going to invest, where they’re going to expand, where they’re going to engage - and that’s who we are as a nation.” “I don’t think our politics is as relevant as our core national interests - being engaged here in Asia,” he added. We have survived in spite of Washington, not because of it.” Mr Wagar was speaking at a forum organised by the National University of Singapore’s Office of Alumni Relations, attended by 350 NUS alumni, staff, students and guests. He also described the US political system as “slow and laborious”, referring to the various checks and balances between the President and Congress. “There’s a lot of things we (the Obama administration) weren’t able to get to because of our system,” he said. TAKING STOCK OF US ENGAGEMENT IN ASIA The US is currently Singapore’s largest foreign investor, with investments reaching US$288 billion in 2015, according to the US State Department. Mr Wagar pointed out that 3,700 American companies are based in Singapore, and that the city-state’s reputation for “transparency and good governance”, “allows all countries to engage in this region”. "Any country that doesn’t understand the unique role that Singapore plays in the most dynamic region of the world suffers at their own peril," he said, adding that the country is "proof of concept behind what can happen when you open your borders with smart trade". The ambassador also cited growing Asian affluence as a reason for American companies to remain, with 525 million people in the middle class today in Asia. By 2030, it is expected that the number will grow to 3.2 billion.  For example, Asia is expected to account for one-third of global passenger traffic in the coming years. Aircraft giants Airbus and Boeing have predicted that Asia Pacific will take on close to 40 per cent of new aircraft purchases, worth US$2 trillion over the next 20 years. “There are more planes and equipment that’s going to be sold in Asia over the next 10 years than the rest of the world combined,” Mr Wagar told the audience. “Where are we going to be? Where’s Boeing going to be? Where’s General Electric going to be?” For these reasons, President Barack Obama’s “pivot to Asia” is likely to continue, Mr Wagar said, calling 2016 a “Year of ASEAN” for Washington. "President Obama attended seven out of eight East Asian Summits,” Mr Wagar said. Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi made her first official visit to the White House. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also visited Washington - the first official visit by a Singaporean Prime Minister in 31 years. “What you did have for the first time was someone who understood South Asia, Southeast Asia, and he did certain things to accelerate and cement our engagement,” Mr Wagar said. FUTURE OF THE TPP Still, to many, Mr Trump’s promise to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a 12-nation trade deal that was about eight years in the making - has been seen as a rejection of globalisation, possibly leaving many countries "feeling let down," as forum moderator and former Nominated Member of Parliament Viswa Sadasivan put it. Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, for one, has said that the TPP “would be meaningless without the United States”. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said that there may be a different, new deal in the future without the US - but this would mean putting negotiations back on the table. “The TPP without the US means it is a new agreement,” Mr Lee said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings in Peru in November 2016. “That means, the 12-minus-one will have to get together and sign an agreement with a different coming-into-effect clause. That is fresh negotiation, and that is not so easy to do.” But Mr Wagar, who was sworn in as US Ambassador to Singapore in 2013, remains optimistic. “I’m very proud of the work we do on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and I think many countries in the region are going forward with it,” he said. “I’m hopeful that the facts will be re-evaluated by the new administration.” “The President-elect says it’s dead,” he added. “I say wait a while.”  - CNA/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

There’s going to be a tendency in the media to minimize the impact of soon-to-be President Trump, in part because he so readily takes credit for positive developments. But, even if it’s fair to debate how radically, it’s hard to deny that Trump is reshaping the business climate. The most tangible example comes from Ford F, +0.32%  , which just announced the shelving of a $1.6 billion Mexican plant and instead plans to pour $700 million into one in Michigan. Read: Ford cancels plan for $1.6 billion Mexico plant Said Ford CEO Mark Fields, to CNN: “We look at all factors, including what we view as a more positive U.S. manufacturing and business environment under President-elect Trump. It’s literally a vote of confidence in some of the pro-growth policies that he is outlining.” There are real carrots that Trump is dangling, in addition to the sticks being brandished. The carrots are tangible: lower corporate taxes and less regulation. The sticks are Trump’s public criticism, aimed earlier at Ford, Boeing BA, +0.34%  ; Lockheed Martin LMT, +0.76%  ; Carrier, the United Technologies UTX, -0.54% air-conditioner maker; and, just Tuesday morning, General Motors GM, -0.45%  , as well as his proposal for a 35% repatriation tax on products built overseas and then sold in the U.S. Ford’s Fields stressed that “he didn’t cut a deal” with Trump, but, then, Trump doesn’t need to actually strike a deal if the net effect of his actions causes the desired change. That said, let’s also look at the reality of the Ford announcement. The vehicle that was going to be produced in Mexico, the Ford Focus, has seen dwindling interest. In the 10 months ending October, Focus sales tumbled 17.1%, as Americans, in light of $2-and-change gasoline and an improving economy, have been loading up on gas guzzlers. So the cost of getting on Trump’s good side is actually a pretty decent investment, and it’s as much due to the shale revolution (which has driven oil prices lower) and quite possibly the economic stewardship of President Barack Obama and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen. That Trump deals don’t necessarily require corporate sacrifices also seems to be the case in the still-fuzzy Carrier deal, as well as the supposed “discounts” Boeing is offering on Air Force One. Even assuming the Trump impact on these particular cases is far less than he’s laid claim to, Trump’s rhetoric seems to be augmenting the business climate. Survey after survey, of both businesses and consumers, show rising confidence. Read: Manufacturers most upbeat in two years, ISM survey shows How that translates into actual activity remains to be seen. And there are obviously risks that Trump’s frequent rhetoric will backfire, that a recalcitrant or just hard-to-harness Congress will deflate the Trump balloon, that a rising dollar will curb exports, or simply that the business cycle turns sour. But no one has ever denied that Trump is a salesman. And right now what he’s selling, companies are buying — the need to announce that they’re creating jobs in the U.S. More from MarketWatch Bill Priest: Stocks With Solid Earnings Potential Trump: Russians Behind Hacks but Haven’t Compromised Him President-Elect Donald Trump Press Conference Quote References F +0.04 +0.32% BA +0.54 +0.34% LMT +1.91 +0.76% UTX -0.60 -0.54% GM -0.17 -0.45% Show all references Most Popular Why Goldman sees only 90 good days for U.S. stocks in 2017 More Democratic lawmakers plan on boycotting Trump’s inauguration Stocks may need a flawless earnings season to keep Trump rally going CIA chief John Brennan has a stern warning for Donald Trump Tour the house Obama will live in after he moves out of the White House Steve Goldstein Steve Goldstein is MarketWatch's Washington bureau chief.

(REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo) DETROIT/WASHINGTON: President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose a “big border tax” on General Motors Co. for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico, an arrangement the largest US automaker defended as part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell them in the United States. Trump’s comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on Jan. 20, signaling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming US president into corporate affairs. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA. or pay big border tax!” Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. GM, the world’s No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. “GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US” it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM’s best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump’s tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM’s rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc. , Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United’s Carrier unit in Indiana. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major US corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. His latest comments come as a congressional Republican tax proposal meant to boost US manufacturing faces mounting pressure from industries that rely heavily on imported goods or parts. ’BORDER ADJUSTABILITY’ Last month, 81 industry groups including several automaker groups rejected the proposal, known as “border adjustability.” The policy would help manufacturers by exempting export revenues from corporate taxes. But it would tax imports, hitting import-dependent industries. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit’s Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid US workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two US auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. US small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM’s US Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November. GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs. Representatives for the United Auto Workers union could not be reached immediately for a response to Trump’s comments. Facebook STAY CONNECTED Follow @Arab_News Tweets by @Arab_News Download The App!

Parrikar also made it clear that navy will continue supporting the development of naval version of Tejas but the current one will be just a technology demonstrator. He said that the navy is seeking a double engine aircraft. He said when India decides to go for a twin-engine fighter to be made here, the government will also consider the Rafale. But as of now there are no plans to procure any additional aircraft, he added. Talking about the next fighter competition of India, Parrikar said the need for a second production line for single engine aircraft is felt besides the one for Tejas. "The second line of single engine requirement is also felt for which we are thinking of using the strategic partnership route," he said. The Defence Minister said once the chapter on strategic partnership is finalised this month, his ministry will start moving in the direction of single engine fighter aircraft. He said by the end of this year, decisions on the next aircraft should be tentatively finished. Parrikar said few of the initial aircraft may come off the shelf by the "rest would be made in India increasing the Indian capability in aviation". He said the process for the next fighter aircraft will include both selection through normal process and government- to-government contract. "Selection of the local partner would be through a transparent and well defined process," he said, adding that capabilities and financial strength would also be looked into. "Once you select the local partner, the OEM obviously will be selected through a process of the way we do it. It means who gives the best offer, Transfer of Technology and many other things and price. There will be weightage to both to both," he said. Parrikar added that once the company is selected, there will be a government-to-government contract to ensure that the other government stands guarantee to the promises made by the firm in terms of technology transfer and other issues.

Kirk Watson, D-Austin State Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin Image 2 of 2 State Rep.﻿ Giovanni Capriglione; R-Southlake State Rep.﻿ Giovanni Capriglione; R-Southlake Photo: Ian McVea, MBI Two bills seek to reopen public contracts detail 1 / 2 Back to Gallery AUSTIN -- Legislation was filed Tuesday to lift the curtain of secrecy on taxpayer funds spent by private companies and organizations allowed by separate Texas Supreme Court decisions. The bills by state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, and Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, would overturn secrecy provisions sanctioned by the high court which allowed final contract details and bids on public contracts to remain secret. It would also require disclosure of funding details to private organizations and entities in all cases, not just ones that are sustained by public funds. The high court earlier allowed the Greater Houston Partnership to keep secret details about the public funding it receives and allowed the Boeing Co. to keep secret the final details of its contracts as trade secrets. Capriglione and Watson said both decisions significantly undermined the intent of the Texas Public Information Act, which gives citizens the right to monitor what its government is doing and how it is spending taxpayer money. "Unfortunately, these recent decisions from the Texas Supreme Court weakened the law by allowing governmental bodies and private entities that receive public funds to more easily conceal their dealings," Watson said. "I believe it is our duty as the Legislature to ensure the people of Texas can track how government spends public money." Capriglione said if the measures fail to pass, taxpayers will find themselves increasingly unable to know how public funds are being spent -- as has been the norm in Texas for decades. Citizens, businesses and competitors, lawyers and the press all use the public-information act to get information about government. Capriglione and Watson said the law is a capstone for transparency in government, one of the strongest in the nation, and they expect the changes will find wide support during the legislative session. They said a broad coalition of groups support the measures: Attorney General Ken Paxton, the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, the Texas Municipal League, the Texas Association of Counties, the Texas Association of Urban Counties, the Texas Press Association and the Texas Association of Broadcasters. Business interests that generally try to keep secret as many details of their operations as possible are expected to oppose the changes, although no public opposition has been announced.

Skip to main content DONATE SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Search form Search Sunday, January 15, 2017 Home World U.S. Canada Climate War & Peace Economy Rights Solutions Ready for the Jawboning Presidency of Donald Trump Published on Tuesday, January 03, 2017 by Common Dreams Ready for the Jawboning Presidency of Donald Trump by Ralph Nader 0 Comments 'Want a New Year’s resolution?' writes Nader. 'Stay alert.' There's an erratic bully on his way to the White House. All signs point to Donald Trump becoming a jawboning president without equal in American history. That is, jawboning by exerting rhetorical bombast focused on people, corporations and institutions, with massive media propulsion behind the very personal presidency he will establish. It will be a natural daily extension of his boundless, easily bruisable ego. Trump has embraced these tactics as both a candidate and president-elect. He went after Carrier Corp. (a subsidiary of United Technologies) and Ford Motor Co. for shipping jobs to Mexico, after Boeing for charging too much for the new Air Force One and after Lockheed/Martin for over-pricing its F-35 fighter planes. Previous presidents, knowing they have the “bully pulpit,” have generally been averse to the sort of jawboning that singles out specific firms and persons. President Harry Truman did take on a newspaper columnist who criticized his daughter, Margaret’s, singing skills. President John F. Kennedy went after U.S. Steel and referred to price hikes from the industry as “a wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest.” But generally, presidents do not want to be seen as bullies, preferring one competitor against another or frittering their presidential authority by getting into petty squabbles. In the midst of more serious matters of state, jawboning can be a serious distraction that alienates larger numbers of people who may side with the assailed. With Trump, none of this may matter. He has said repeatedly that he always slams back twenty times harder than anyone who slams him. He revels in his 20 million Twitter followers and loves how his tweets are carried by the mass media. That gives him a personal “mass media” which he controls, unfiltered by his antagonists in the press. Rather than playing the “going-through-channels” game in Washington, he’ll want to throw his opponents off balance through personal attacks, including attacks on members of Congress and Governors. He is into the psychology of human frailties, vanities and occupational vulnerabilities. He knows that jawboning one person, firm or politician will put others on the defensive, and wondering whether they will be next, or putting foreign powers off balance because of his furious unpredictability. The downside for Trump is that he will be so absorbed in jawboning and rebutting critics that he won’t be paying attention to what his underlings are doing until trouble rises to his level for decision. Jawboning can lead to complex consequences when it comes from the most powerful office in the county. Should Trump use jawboning to give corporate gougers of workers, consumers, taxpayers and communities some pause and restraint, if not produce outright reversal of policy, he can become the champion of the underdogs and those bullied. He’s already said that drug prices are too high. If he believes that plain fact, can you guess what he’ll do next with his tweet on a specific company or a pay-or-die drug costing patients $100,000 or more a year? Trump is known not to like detailed immersion into issues or detailed briefings by civil servants. He likes to set the pace, establish the new focus of the day and, above all, get even with anyone who stands up to or embarrasses him. He seems to behave as if rules and norms do not apply to him. The strange Trump personality can radiate in many directions. Some results may be beneficial. Others – such as in the case of a stateless terror attack – may worsen a bad situation because of impulsive and violent over-reaction, leading to a worsening situation overseas and damage to the national interests, civil liberties and other constitutional rights of the American people. Want a New Year’s resolution? Stay alert, keep up with your fellow citizens at the Congressional grassroots, stay informed on current events, and always be ready to foresee and forestall initiatives by politicians and corporatists that recklessly or greedily gobble up your tax dollars and undercut your health, safety and civil rights.

Trump's comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on Jan. 20, signaling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming U.S. president into corporate affairs. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Trump's tweet came hours before GM's rival Ford Motor Co announced it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after it also came under criticism from the Republican president-elect for its Mexican investment plans. Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., said he personally notified Trump of the decision, but after Trump's early-morning GM tweet. GM, the world's No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump's tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM's rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors. But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind," Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit's Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM's U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November. GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs.

Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter.Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.GM, the world's No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States."GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016.Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump's tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM's rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana.Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra.GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs.GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name.His latest comments come as a congressional Republican tax proposal meant to boost U.S. manufacturing faces mounting pressure from industries that rely heavily on imported goods or parts.'BORDER ADJUSTABILITY' Last month, 81 industry groups including several automaker groups rejected the proposal, known as "border adjustability." The policy would help manufacturers by exempting export revenues from corporate taxes. But it would tax imports, hitting import-dependent industries.According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit's Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars.In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM's U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November.GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs.Representatives for the United Auto Workers union could not be reached immediately for a response to Trump's comments.

While ambitious ideas such as crewed spaceflights to Mars may be out of reach for now, 2017 is still set to be an important one for space exploration and travel. Boeing Starliner Boeing is set to launch its CST-100 Starliner crew capsule in 2017, which aims to restore the USA’s capacity for manned spaceflight missions. The Starliner will make its maiden flight in December and will be used to ferry crew to the International Space Station in 2018. The capsule can support seven passengers and is designed for orbital missions of up to seven months. SpaceX Dragon 2 SpaceX’s Dragon 2 capsule is a manned space capsule capable of supporting a crew of up to seven people. The Dragon 2 capsule will support terrestrial soft landing aided by specially-designed boosters. The first orbital test of the Dragon 2 capsule will be in November 2017. Falcon Heavy The Falcon Heavy rocket is designed by SpaceX to ferry a crew to Mars, and produces a huge amount of power thanks to its large boosters and engines. The rocket is designed to be reusable, similar to previous SpaceX vehicles. The Falcon Heavy is expected to launch in 2017. Chang’e 5 Moon Mission China will conduct an unmanned lunar exploration mission in 2017, which aims to return over 2kg of surface material back to earth. The Chang’e 5 mission probe carries an array of surface analysis technology and will launch in 2017.

News Business Business Comment Britain faces debt crisis as advice charities warn of busiest Christmas in years Regulators would do well to review rules on how lenders deal with distressed borrowers, particularly if the economy takes a hit from Brexit  James Moore @JimMooreJourno Tuesday 3 January 2017 16:31 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Debt charities are being inundated with calls from distressed borrowers Rex Features With retailers preparing to reveal who won Christmas, the Money Advice Trust (MAT) has taken the opportunity of a quiet-ish corporate news day to highlighted the plight of the losers.  No, I don’t mean the chains which undershot analysts’ expectations and are now furiously discounting in an attempt to offload their excess stock. I mean the shoppers who, caught up in the pre Christmas frenzy, with all its special offers and Black Friday deals, over spent. The people for whom the new year will be anything but happy as they try to work out how to pay for everything they bought.  According to the MAT some 5.5m Britons are likely to fall behind with their finances this new year. Only a third have a budget, and perilously few have anything resembling a plan to repay debts that doesn’t involve more debt.  Read more Payday loan companies 'hounding' homeless teenagers, charity warns The Autumn Statement showed Brexit for what it really is Repo man pays off debt on elderly couple's car after towing it The charity is expecting its busiest January in years. During December the National Debtline and its sister service, Business Debtline, took an average of 715 calls a day. More than 40,000 people were helped online making it the busiest Christmas in four years.  The MAT is advising people to set a budget now, to open all their bank statements on the day they arrive, and to seek free advice quickly if things look dicey. All eminently sensible. But the fact is, there are an awful lot of people who will choose not to heed it.  They will instead put dealing with their situations off, and then put it off again. Maybe that scratch card will pay off in the meantime. Perhaps Auntie Nellie will have left more than anyone could have dreamed in her will. Perhaps an unexpected heirloom will be found in the attic. Putting things off in the hope that something turns up is easier than facing up to a harsh reality and you can't really blame people for doing so. It's human nature.  The British consumer has proved remarkably resilient in recent months, doing much to sustain the British economy through a difficult period. A lot of that resilience, however, has been fuelled by debt and debt has to be repaid.  About the best that the MAT, and other charities dealing with people struggling to do that, can do is to keep saying “call us” and “call us soon” because for most people that scratch card won’t come good.  Business picture of the day 31 show all Business picture of the day 1/31 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles.

Sterling plunged more than 6 per cent to $1.1841 in two minutes, prompting traders to speculate about a possible trigger. 29/31 Pound sterling value hits another new 31-year low against the dollar amid hard Brexit fears - Wednesday October 5 Sterling has continued its “slippery decline” as ongoing fears over the consequences of "hard Brexit" haunt investor attraction towards the currency. The currency has fallen below the “psychologically important” $1.27 level, down 0.3 per cent to $1.2695 in early trading on Wednesday, extending Tuesday’s selloff.

Getty 31/31 Philip Hammond ditches George Osborne's 15% corporation tax cut target - Monday October 3 Chancellor Philip Hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor George Osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the UK’s Brexit vote. In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty There is also, however, a role that regulators can play. The rules covering how lenders treat distressed borrowers have been tightened in recent years. Some of the more sensible lenders have also recognised that calling in the heavy mob isn’t generally the best way of getting their money back. Working with borrowers on payment plans can pay dividends to all concerned.  Now would be as good a time as any to review the current framework and assess whether it is fit for purpose.  If the Brexiteers are right, and Britain continues to show resilience in the wake of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty being triggered, then there will be no harm in doing the work anyway. If they are wrong, and the warnings of Jeremiahs such as myself prove justified, well, there will be a lot of people who have cause to be thankful if the watchdogs heed my advice. There are a large number of heavily indebted households in Britain. They won’t find it easy to weather an economic storm.  More about: consumer debt debt charity average Christmas debt personal borrowing Brexit Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File PhotoMore By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose a "big border tax" on General Motors Co for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico, an arrangement the largest U.S. automaker defended as part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell them in the United States. Trump's comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on Jan. 20, signaling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming U.S. president into corporate affairs. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Trump's tweet came hours before GM's rival Ford Motor Co announced it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after it also came under criticism from the Republican president-elect for its Mexican investment plans. Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., said he personally notified Trump of the decision, but after Trump's early-morning GM tweet. GM, the world's No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump's tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM's rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors. But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind," Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit's Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM's U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November. GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Cars We Remember: GMC powered Missile Transporter’ truck memories Tuesday Jan 3, 2017 at 9:44 AM Jan 3, 2017 at 9:44 AM Greg Zyla More Content Now Q: Greg, I recently found an article you wrote about the GMC V-12 engine. It brought back great memories of my time in the Air Force when I worked as a missile tech on the Minuteman Missile transporter (WS133 also known as the TE or TEL). To get to the missile sites we used a transport erector with a long trailer that had three axles. The tractor came with the with the GMC V-12 engine you wrote about in your previous columns. This V-12 was situated right under the (front) of the trailer. The cab was less than 48-inches high and had a two front axle setup that both could steer and also power and then a tag axle, too. The GMC V-12 hooked to a five-speed main transmission with an additional two-speed auxiliary. This GMC V-12 was the only engine the Air Force could find at the time to pull this unit when loaded with the missile. And yes, the GMC V-12 could pull very well. I had to wear ear plugs because you had to sit right next to the GMC V-12. Thanks for your articles.  Sgt. John Jankas, Navasota, Texas. A: Sgt. John what a great letter and I thank you in advance for your service and great memories of the GMC V-12 engine that powered the Air Force Minuteman Missile Transporter. Thanks up front to you and also to www.thunderV-12.com, the latter a company I have written about before that builds and sells the 702 cubic-inch Thunder V-12 to this day and has excellent information on their site about this engine and the missile transporters you drove. Much of the following narrative is not mine as also noted on the Thunder V-12 site as the author/source of the article wishes to remain anonymous. However he hopes the following information will help open a dialog here of an important piece of GMC V-12 truck and USA military history. If any of my readers have more info, please send it to mail@thunderV-12.com and cc me at greg@gregzyla.com. Specifically, back in 1960, some 80 Missile Transporters were scheduled to be built in a cooperative between Boeing, which sub-contracted to GMC for the tractor and engine, and Cessna for the transporters airbag suspension and a hydraulically-powered fifth wheel. As you mentioned and explained further by Thunder V-12, the 48-inch high tractor could be lowered or raised up to engage the emplacer. This allowed either fitting the missile into its tube for transportation or raising it high in the air to install the missile into its launch silo. The first drive axle was always live, while the second axle could be engaged to drive while the third was the tag. As you noted also, both front axles steer. As for the transporters wheels, the Alcoa aluminum rims are some of the earliest known to exist. Top speed in fifth and high gear is 45 mph. The engine supplies both cold and hot water to the huge missile containment fuselage to keep the missile climate controlled. Thunder V-12 also notes that the tractor did have a Pontiac compressor air conditioning unit, but none of it was for keeping the driver cool, it was all for the missile container. The GMC V-12 powered special purpose tractor truck transported the complete Minuteman III missile, without warhead, from the base out to the missile silo. Then the Cessna built monocoque trailer fuselage coupled with pins to huge structural members by the silo. Giant five section hydraulic actuators would then raise the body up vertical, and a winch would lower the missile into the silo. The roll transfer weight including missile and carriages was near 80,000 lbs. and the whole vehicle when loaded weighed about 139,000 lbs. The truck tractor cab was hand built by GMC and powered by the GMC 702-inch V-12. The cab was magnesium to save weight, and the anonymous author did say that this thing was really something else. The units pictured were built in 1961 and 1962 and hauled Minuteman missiles until retirement in 1990. Today, Hill Aerospace Museum in Roy, Utah, has a GMC V-12 powered TEL in place for the world to see. There is also one at Warren AFB, Wyoming, at the front gate and a third GMC V-12 powered Minuteman sits fully restored at Malmstrom AFB in Montana. If my readers would like to see a YouTube video of the GMC V-12 and the Air Force Missile production, its called Minuteman - From Design to Delivery (1963) about the missiles and vehicle in action. If you go to about 14 minutes into the video, youll see the truck in action. I want to thank Thunder V-12, LLC and the U.S. Air Force for supplying interesting information. And thanks again Sgt. John for your info from behind the wheel. Have a great New Year.  Greg Zyla writes weekly for More Content Now and other Gatehouse Media publications, He welcomes reader questions or comments on collector cars, auto nostalgia or old-time racing at 303 Roosevelt St., Sayre, Pa. 18840 or email at greg@gregzyla.com.

He declined to comment on whether the company planned to talk to Trump. Trump’s tweet is the latest example of interventionist behavior toward U.S. companies that have included Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. and United Technologies Corp. His threats against Mexican-built vehicles have the potential to impact the nine global carmakers, including Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., that have announced more than $24 billion in Mexico investments since 2010. Volkswagen AG’s Audi, BMW AG and Daimler AG each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the country. The Trump transition team has said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra will be among the panel of business leaders giving him strategic advice on the economy after he takes office. GM shares rose about 0.2 percent to $34.90 as of 9:31 a.m. in New York. The Detroit-based company said in November it planned to cut a shift at its Cruze plant in Ohio and furlough 1,200 workers there due to weak demand for small cars. Trump has made a point of pressuring large U.S. manufacturers into keeping production in the U.S. He criticized Ford during the presidential campaign for moving production of the Ford Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico. In November, he said on Twitter he talked with Chairman Bill Ford and got the automaker to commit to keeping production of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle in Kentucky instead of Mexico. At the time, Trump indicated he’d saved the plant. In reality, the plant was not scheduled to close. Its employees assemble the Ford Escape SUV, a better-selling model. More than 5,000 employees work nearly around the clock on three crews to meet demand for the two SUVs. Trump’s promise to make Mexico pay for a border wall seems less likely to be a burden in 2017 than his threat of retribution against companies that move jobs abroad. If that makes US manufacturers hold off or slow down investment in Mexico, the impact would be significant. More than half of the $30 billion in foreign direct investment in Mexico in 2015 came from the US. Already, Citigroup Inc. has cut its projections for total investment in Mexico from abroad for 2017, to $25 billion from $35.8 billion. Perhaps Trump’s biggest impact will be on the peso, which became a proxy for his election chances. It’s tumbled about 11 per cent since the vote to near record lows, putting pressure on the central bank to intervene as inflation expectations rise. Analysts say Mexico’s economy is in for a nightmare even if the incoming president doesn’t build that wall or ball up North American Free Trade Agreement. Economists forecast gross domestic product will expand just 1.7 per cent this year, according to the latest surveys from Banco de Mexico and Citi/Banamex, as anticipated rate increases weigh on borrowing and spending. That’d be the slowest since the 1.4 per cent achieved in 2013. “It’s going to be a very difficult year for policymakers,” said Benito Berber, the senior economist for Latin America at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York. “The central bank will have to navigate a lot of different shocks, external and internal.” While forecasts are more dire at Credit Suisse Group AG and Bank of America Corp. — where economists anticipate growth could be the slowest since the height of the financial crisis — any threat to the North American Free Trade Agreement that started January 1, 1994, would make these seem rosy. Mexico sends more than three-quarters of its exports to the US and ran a trade surplus of about $60 billion in 2015, accounting for more than 5 per cent of economic output. Trump lashed out at a US company manufacturing in Mexico early on Tuesday.   Trump Twitter crosshairs: The companies singled out — AP Amazon “If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!” Trump tweeted on December 7, 2015. Carrier “Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the US. Thanks Carrier.” Trump tweeted on November 29, 2016. Ford Motor Co. “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump said in a series of tweets on November 17, 2016 Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump tweeted on December 22, 2016. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump tweeted on December 6, 2016. General Motors Co. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!” Trump tweeted on January 3, 2017. Macy’s Inc. “Good news, disloyal @Macys stock is in a total free fall. Don’t shop there for Christmas!” Trump tweeted on December 4, 2015. T-Mobile US .@JohnLegere @TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers. Trump tweeted on November 15, 2015 Rexnord “Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!” Trump tweeted on December 2, 2016. Businesses in General “The US is going to substantially reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U. S ... without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ... wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc, back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but ... but these companies are able to move between all 50 states and negotiate a tax free deal! Our country cannot keep losing these jobs, & won’t. These companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned before making a very ... expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.” Trump said in a series of tweets on December 4, 2016.

WATCH: Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs discusses Trump’s threat to impose a ‘border tax’ on GM vehicles made in Mexico.  However, GM later responded to Trump’s claims, stating most of its Chevy Cruze models are manufactured in the U.S. at it’s Lordstown, Ohio facility – except for the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback, which is made in Mexico for global markets. “All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S,” the company said in a statement, according to CNBC. In November, GM said it plans to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the Lordstown plant, in early 2017.

The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit’s Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. During his campaign, Trump attacked U.S. automakers for threatening to outsource jobs to Mexico. He previously vowed to block Ford from opening a new plant in Mexico and threatened to impose taxes on cars it shipped back across the border. WATCH: Ford announces it will scrap Mexico production plant in response to Trump’s attack Trump would later take credit for stopping Ford from moving its plant to Mexico on Twitter; however, according to the Associated Press, Ford clarified it never intended to move an entire plant, just the production of one of its vehicles. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 And its not just auto companies who are being targeted by the incoming president’s tweets. Trump’s targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy’s have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Trump’s tweets have the power to move stocks Social media users were quick to point out Trump’s tweet about GM appeared to have a direct effect on the company’s stock. But this isn’t the first time Trump has influenced the stock market in 140 characters.   In December, Trump tweeted about the “tremendous cost of the Lockheed Martin F-35,” causing the aerospace company’s stocks to tumble. According to The Independent, Lockheed Martin shares fell about two per cent, while Boeing shares saw a one per cent rise that day. Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 But, earlier that month, Trump took aim at Boeing tweeting, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” According to Slate, it only took ten seconds for Boeing stock to start trading down, eventually shrinking the stock value by over one per cent. This has raised concerns with several pundits, including LA Times columnist Michael Hiltzik who wrote, “Inevitably, pronouncements about anything by a president have an outsized effect. Sometimes that’s appropriate, but the power to move markets, like the power to deploy armies, is something to be used very sparingly, because people can get hurt by a stray remark or a stray artillery shell.” – With files from Reuters and The Associated Press © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Picture: AP Staff writersAP DONALD Trump has threatened General Motors in a tweet, as rival Ford scraps a plan to build a $US1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Mr Trump tweeted to CM that he would slap a tax on the company importing compact cars to the US from Mexico. But GM makes the vast majority of compact Chevrolet Cruzes in Lordstown, Ohio, near Cleveland. General Motors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. Picture: APSource:AP Donald Trump has hit out at GM on Twitter. Picture: AFPSource:AFP Mr Trump tweeted early on Tuesday that GM is sending Mexican-made Cruzes to the US tax-free. He told GM to stop or pay a big border tax. GM released a statement saying it only brought in a “small number” of the Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico. “General Motors manufacturers the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US,” the company said. Shares of GM fell 0.4 per cent to $US34.70 in premarket trading after the tweet.

Picture: BloombergSource:Bloomberg Last year Trump threatened to tax Ford, which plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Hours after the GM threat, Ford announced that it is cancelling plans to build a $US1.6 billion plant in Mexico and instead will boost US production of electric vehicles. “Ford today announced it is canceling plans for the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico,” the company said in a statement. At the same time, Ford is adding 700 US jobs and investing $700 million during the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan so that it can build self-driving and electric vehicles. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 One of Mr Trump’s first tweets after winning the election was aimed at Boeing, claiming he wanted to cancel the construction of the new Air Force One, falsely stating that it was costing $4 billion. After his morning tweets about GM, Trump then shifted gears and attacked the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ‘Obamacare’. “People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn’t work, and it is not affordable — 116 per cent increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it ‘crazy’,” he wrote. “The Democrat Governor of Minnesota said ‘The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!’ - and, it is lousy healthcare.” People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it "CRAZY"— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said "The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!" - And, it is lousy healthcare.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Former US president Bill Clinton was critical of Obamacare during the election campaign. “You’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It’s the craziest thing in the world,” Clinton said. Former US president Bill Clinton has been critical of US President Barack Obama’s health care initiative. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied Mr Clinton tried to walk back the comments afterwards. “Look, the Affordable Health Care Act did a world of good ... we, for the first time in our history, at least are providing insurance to more than 90 per cent of our people,” he said. “But there is a group of people — mostly small business owners and employees — who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can’t get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places. And the reason is they’re not in big pools. So they have no bargaining power.” Jump back to top Right now in technology 381Readers Nintendo Switch: Australian price, release date, specs 289Readers This is what the world will look like in 250 million years 120Readers The Light Phone: The anti-smartphone doesn’t have text, emai... 37Readers Spaces launches first rocket since launch pad explosion MORE IN Motoring Diesel engines are damaging your health Aussie car industry’s grim reaper arrives Kia sedan woos the Holden diehards What luxury will look like in 2017 FOLLOW US ADVERTISE ABOUT US JOIN Please enter a valid email address Legal: Privacy Policy Relevant Ads Opt-Out Cookie Policy Terms & Conditions A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

By: Agencies | Updated: January 3, 2017 7:57 PM Representatives for GM could not be reached immediately for comment. (Reuters) US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday blasted US carmaker General Motors Co and threatened to impose a “big border tax” for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA. or pay big border tax!” Trump said in a post on Twitter. Shares of GM fell about 1 percent in premarket trading after Trump’s tweet. Donald Trump has singled out a number of companies individually before and after winning the US presidential election. His targets have ranged from US retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy’s have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it amounts to only a small percentage of the 172,000 Cruzes sold by GM through November, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. He was working to get the exact number. The hatchback is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. Cruze hatchback production amounts to less than a day of output at the Lordstown plant, said Glenn Johnson, president of a United Auto Workers union local at the factory. The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. “It makes for news, that’s all,” Johnson said of Trump’s tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatch. You May Also Like To Watch This:  GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the Cruze, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the US are now made in Ohio, he said. The hatchback version just went on sale in the fall. The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax automakers that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the US under the North American Free Trade agreement. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two US auto plants, including one in Lordstown, Ohio, where it builds the compact Chevrolet Cruze. You May Also Like To Watch This: The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit’s Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid US workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. Last year Trump threatened to tax Ford, which plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the US factory that makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant would get a new pickup and SUV. Trump in a series of tweets on December 4, 2016, said, “The US is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the US…without retribution or consequence, is WRONG!

Trump tweeted on Dec. 2, 2016. Businesses in General "The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S....without retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies...wanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units, etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but...but these companies are able to move between all 50 states and negotiate a tax free deal! Our country cannot keep losing these jobs, & won't. These companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very....expensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS." Trump said in a series of tweets on Dec. 4, 2016.

Opinion Op-Eds Blumenthal: Messing With The F-35 Would Be Huge Mistake F-35 Getty Images One of the first two F-35 fighter jets bought by Israel is seen after landing at an Israeli base in the Negev desert on Dec. 12.  One of the first two F-35 fighter jets bought by Israel is seen after landing at an Israeli base in the Negev desert on Dec. 12.  (Getty Images) As a businessman about to become president, Donald Trump ought to know better. His threat to sink the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program sows uncertainty among our military and our allies, aids our adversaries, and confounds the companies and workers who make this next-generation combat jet vital to American air, ground and sea superiority. His 140-character tweet — one of a series that seem unwise and unproductive for an incoming commander in chief — jeopardizes jobs and national defense. The F-35 means thousands and thousands of jobs for Connecticut at Pratt & Whitney, where its unrivaled engines are made, but it is also a technological wonder vital to national security. Over the past six years, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have fought for the F-35 because it means that our nation and our troops will always have an edge — and never face a "fair fight" in air combat. Hostile nations have long sought to steal its design. The Russians and Chinese have flown prototypes of their own attempts at stealthier aircraft. In an era of mounting military threats, failing to build the F-35 on schedule would seriously risk losing our strategic edge. I have also advocated cutting costs — as has the manufacturer Lockheed Martin itself. As a result, the F-35's expense has been reduced by 70 percent since 2007. But the president-elect's suggestion that Boeing should "redesign" the aging F-18 to be "comparable" to the F-35 is nonsensical. The two jets, by design, are not comparable. The F-35 has stealth and strength that the older fighter cannot match — along with advanced technology that cannot be redesigned into the F-18. Different versions fit the distinct needs of different military services. The F-35A is a conventional multi-role fighter for the Air Force, the F-35B a short-takeoff-and-landing version for the Marine Corps, and the F-35C a carrier-based variant for the Navy. It can fly undetected, transmit sensor information, operate in formation, and conduct air-to-air combat and air-to-ground missions in ways beyond imagination in earlier aircraft. The F-35, of course, must be part of an overarching air strategy working in tandem with the rest of our air, sea and ground elements. No one asset is the answer. In fact, the F-35 can integrate and share information instantaneously with other aircraft and troops on the ground, providing unified situational awareness and coordinating combat power. Fortunately for our nation, we are committed to other stealthy and strong weapons systems, most prominently our submarine fleet, also proudly produced in Connecticut and not yet a target of Trump's tweets. Efforts to further cut costs are already underway. I will continue to press for more innovative ways to make the F-35 even more affordable. Central to this effort will be fulfilling — not cutting — our commitment to build these combat jets at full production of 80 aircraft per year starting in fiscal year 2019. I will be working to secure this outcome in coming years' defense bills. Having made the necessary investment, Congress should expedite using the F-35 and reject outright Trump's misguided call to delay deployment. Jeopardizing the F-35 program would lead to increased cost and risk for our military services and allies. The mere suggestion that production should be slowed or stopped threatens to create confusion and uncertainty among the manufacturers and their supply chain. There are more than 75 hardworking and dedicated businesses in Connecticut — and more than 1,250 suppliers across the country — that need to plan production and hire and train new workers now. The dedicated workforce recruited and trained to make these incomparably complex planes deserves respect and assurance in their jobs. Lowering expense, raising efficiency, improving production — all are good goals, we can agree. The entire military contracting and procurement process requires reform to eliminate the cost overruns and delays endemic to weapons production. That's a cause — bigger and broader than any single weapons platform — that should bring us together. It will require more than a tweet, even from the president, to achieve. It's called leadership.

Search Watch Live Home UK Brexit World Business Politics Technology Entertainment Strange News Weather Donald Trump threatens General Motors with 'big border tax!' The President-elect attacks General Motors over its use of Mexican plants and raises the prospect of steep import tariffs. 15:07, UK, Tuesday 03 January 2017 Image Caption: General Motors has come under fire from Mr Trump for having some production outside the US Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail Donald Trump has taken aim at US car giant General Motors in his latest clash with big business as he prepares to take office. The President-elect threatened to impose a "big border tax" on the company for making its Chevy Cruze model in Mexico. GM shares slipped 1% in pre-market trading after Mr Trump made the remarks in a tweet - though they later improved and turned 1% higher shortly after Wall Street opened. Mr Trump wrote: "General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers tax free across border. "Make in USA or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM becomes the latest US industrial giant to feel the brunt of Mr Trump's remarks ahead of his inauguration later this month. Mr Trump has previously taken aim at aerospace manufacturers Lockheed and Boeing over contracts with the US government he has claimed were too expensive. Mr Trump has been critical of car giant Ford in the past over its investments in Mexico. More broadly he has threatened to slap tariffs of 35% on imports of products made by companies that have moved production out of the US, and said he would tear up a major trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Image Caption: Donald Trump has warned US firms about moving jobs abroad Last month he warned that firms shifting jobs away from America could be "making a very expensive mistake" and  would face "retribution or consequence". Mr Trump has also pledged to lower the corporate tax rate and scale back regulations to create a better climate in the US for business. General Motors brands include the Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick as well as Germany's Opel and Britain's Vauxhall. GM said that it makes the sedan model of its Chevy Cruze in the US and that all of those sold in the US were made at a plant in Ohio. A hatchback version is made for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US, it said in a statement.

The aircraft will serve the domestic link on a three times daily basis to ensure crew can secure required flight hours on the airframe ahead of its international debut. Korean Air will initially introduce the Boeing 787-9 into commercial operations on domestic flights from the end of the first quarter of 2017 for crew familiarisation, according to latest schedule changes highlighted by Airlineroute. The Dreamliner will be configured in a three-class seating arrangement and are expected to be mainly used in thinner long-haul markets complementing to Asian carrier’s larger 747-8I, 777-300ER and Airbus A380 equipment. In the latest update of its 2017 flight inventory, Korean Air will introduce the 787-9 on its Seoul Gimpo – Jeju route between March 7, 2017 and March 25, 2017. The aircraft will serve the domestic link on a three times daily basis to ensure crew can secure required flight hours on the airframe ahead of its international debut.  It is not clear when the airline will introduce the type into foreign markets, however, it has already loaded the type on three international routes from the second half of the year. This will see the 787-9 operate three weekly flights between Seoul Incheon and Madrid and four weekly flights between Seoul Incheon and Beijing from the start of August. The aircraft will also substitute an A330-200 on a three weekly Seoul Incheon – Zurich link from October 3, 2017. The Asian carrier has chosen to retain a First Class product onboard the aircraft, according to its aircraft listing, with a small six-seat Premium cabin. It will also fit its aircraft with an 18-seat Business Class cabin and 245 Economy seat to provide a total occupancy for 269 passengers. Korean Air has eleven 787s on order, including a single 787-8 which will be used in a corporate configuration for government flying. The aircraft was among on the first production aircraft, dubbed the ‘terrible teens’ which are much heavier than current production aircraft due to significant retrofits that are now incorporated into original assembly. Nine of its ten 787-9s on order were originally ordered as 787-8 and first due for delivery in 2011, but the order was switched in March that year for the larger variant and deliveries pushed back to this year. An additional order for a single aircraft was added in October 2013, according to Boeing. The initial European route selection for the Dreamliner suggests a move to use the aircraft to right-size capacity to better meet demand. The Seoul Incheon – Madrid route is currently served by a larger 777-300ER, but the introduction of flights to Barcelona from April 2017 may see demand fall a little into the Spanish capital. Meanwhile, in the case of Seoul Incheon – Zurich, the 787-9 will replace an A330-200, retaining a three-class offer but boosting capacity by around 50 seats per flight, albeit with a 25 per cent reduction in Business Class capacity.

News Business Business Comment Government is failing to boost exporters despite millions spent on ad campaign The number of British businesses selling products abroad hasn't changed in the last two years and Brexit will make things harder James Moore @JimMooreJourno Tuesday 3 January 2017 11:51 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Too many British businesses are reluctant to join the nation's exporters Getty Images The battering Brexit delivered to the pound appears to have had one benefit: It has made exports cheaper, and thus helped to narrow Britain’s trade deficit with the rest of the world from the gigantic to the merely large.  According to the Office for National Statistics it fell from £5.8bn in September to £2bn in October. A reason to feel cheerful, as some of the Brexit backing media would have you believe, amid excitable talk of record exports?  Hold on to your shipping containers for just a moment. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales (ICEAW) has just released the results of a survey that looks at the Government’s attempts to stimulate exports over a rather longer term. The picture it paints is not a pretty one.  Read more FTSE 100 nears record high as companies take advantage of pound fall UK arms exports to Saudi Arabia ‘must end now’ Tariffs on UK car exports to EU would be 'disastrous' for jobs The ICAEW says that despite a £1tn export target and an extensive Government ad campaign designed to encourage businesses to contribute to reaching it, only 53 per cent of them are actually selling their produce abroad, unchanged from 2014.  Meanwhile nearly all (96 per cent) of the non-exporters that the organisation spoke to have no plans to sell overseas in the next 12 months.  “Come talk to us about exporting,” say the ads. “It’s great!” Or something like that.  Unfortunately the limited number of businesses that are thinking of exporting don’t think much of the idea of approaching the Government for help.  The ICAEW, which talked to 647 members working in private businesses, reports that less than a fifth of would-be exporters would use Government departments which promote international trade, such as the Department for International Trade, for information and advice. It looks very much like the millions of pounds that have been pumped into the campaign over the past two years have been wasted.  So what to do? The ICAEW wants the Government to change its approach, and start funnelling money directly to exporters rather than pouring it into the pockets of ad agencies and broadcasters. It proposes a voucher scheme to help with the (high) cost of researching and entering new markets. That might prove to be rather more cost effective than the current strategy.  If ministers don't like that idea they could, at the very least, talk to some of the businesses that are considering exporting, but aren’t considering approaching government for help, to ask why. And to ascertain what might encourage them to do so in future.  Business picture of the day 31 show all Business picture of the day 1/31 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles.

Getty 31/31 Philip Hammond ditches George Osborne's 15% corporation tax cut target - Monday October 3 Chancellor Philip Hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor George Osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the UK’s Brexit vote. In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty The trouble is it's often hard to get a message like this through to a government which might very well prefer to point to the figures as evidence of a Brexit export bump. Even if the Office for National Statistics says it’s far to early to read anything into one month of data.  It gets worse when you consider that a large number of the ICAEW members who responded to the survey cited Europe as a key market.  Brexit is going to make exporting into that market very much more difficult. Even if the Government faces down the blinkered backers of a “hard” Brexit, firms will still face the new annoyance of customs checks they didn’t previously encounter, not to mention other barriers and bureaucracy that Brexit will impose on them. Just ask Norway, which is still a part of the single market, a benefit British firms are unlikely to enjoy after this country's EU membership has been consigned to history.  More about: Export exporter ICAEW Department for International Trade British economy Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

News Business Business News UK manufacturing growth hits highest level since June 2014 Purchasing Managers Index shows increased orders from home and abroad but cost pressures have also risen Ben Chapman Tuesday 3 January 2017 13:00 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Manufacturers reported increased orders in December despite warnings of gathering clouds on the horizon Reuters UK manufacturing is growing at its strongest rate in two-and-a-half-years, a new survey showed on Tuesday. The UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index hit 56.1 in December, up from 53.4 in November and far ahead of analysts expectations of 53.3 and the survey’s long-run average of 51.5. The number is consistent with an increase in output of 1.5 per cent in the quarter. New orders from both home and abroad fuelled the expansion, said Markit who carried out the survey. However, the report sounded a note of caution as cost pressures on factories also increased, as a weakened pound raised import prices while fuel costs have also risen. This is expected to result in higher prices for shoppers in 2017. Read more Manufacturing slows unexpectedly in November Britain’s economy has so far performed better than many economists predicted in the wake of June’s Brexit vote. Consumer spending has remained buoyant, partly fuelled by record credit card debt. “The boost to competitiveness from the weak exchange rate has undoubtedly been a key driver of the recent turnaround, while the domestic market has remained a strong contributor to new business wins,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit. “Of the companies citing a cause of higher costs, 75 per cent linked the increase to the exchange rate,” Dobson said.

Comment Comment Theresa May’s Government must come clean on a dire defence dilemma - Robert Fox We need a cold, hard look at our defence needs, what we can afford and what can be done with allies ROBERT FOX Tuesday 3 January 2017 11:37 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard Theresa May: expected to announce cutbacks in the UK’s armed forces this year PA Sooner rather than later in this new year, the May Government will have to come clean and announce further cutbacks in the UK’s defences and armed forces. With the slide of the dollar against the pound since June 24, the defence programme looks all but unaffordable, with as many holes in its projections as a Gruyère cheese. From this year on, the huge amounts of equipment, maintenance and support, paid for in dollars, will cost between a quarter and a third more than was budgeted for a year ago. The assumption for many programmes was an exchange rate of $1.51 to the pound. It is now $1.22. This shoves up the price enormously of the 50 new Apache helicopters and the nine P-8A patrol aircraft ordered from Boeing for £6.5 billion last summer. The slide in the pound makes the plans to buy an unspecified number of F-35 fighters for the new aircraft carriers all but unviable. Interestingly enough, Donald Trump seems to think that the $1.5 trillion F-35 programme may be unaffordable for the US too. The present plans on the table are unaffordable at the new prices, particularly if you take the plan to renew the Trident missile system into consideration. By some estimates the whole package could cost £200 billion.  It cannot all be done on a current budget of about £35 billion a year. More to the point, there are projected cuts in personnel. Some serving soldiers are talking about “living with an Army of around 70,000”. The present notional fighting strength is 80,000. Some think the real fighting strength could slip to around 65,000 or slightly lower by 2020. This is the heart of the matter because it raises the question of what we in the UK want, or need, our armed forces for in the mid-21st century? It is something about which most of our politicians, of whatever stripe, and civil servants, seem to have only the haziest notion.  Certainly, we are not asking for big battalions to invade Crimea, or charge recklessly into Iraq, which the UK did twice in 12 years, each time with a force of 45,000.  Read more Sword and body armour among 400 items stolen from Ministry of Defence What is needed is a proper cold, hard look at what we require in defence and security needs, what we can afford, and what can be done with allies. But didn’t we have all this with the so-called Strategic Defence Review of Blair in 1998 and Cameron in 2010 and 2015? To call the reviews strategic is almost an offence against the Trade Descriptions Act. All three reviews led to cuts, and the first item civil servants look at is personnel. “It’s easier to get rid of people than break big equipment contracts,” a former permanent secretary once told me. Not one of the reviews was costed properly, which is part of today’s maelstrom. As for strategic vision or the lack of it, Cameron’s last review made scant mention of the world’s second military power, China. At the centre of Britain’s strategic and defence crisis is the echo chamber that so many of the defence establishment now seem to inhabit. They reiterate their own comforting views that reinforce and flatter their own positions. One of the strongest conclusions of the Chilcot inquiry was that those in charge were reluctant to admit to themselves and others when things were going wrong in Iraq and Afghanistan.  They preferred to kid themselves rather than act on uncomfortable truths. It is time for the kidding to stop.

The assertion about his hacking expertise was a little hard to believe, given that Trump famously doesn't use a computer, and when the issue of cybersecurity comes up, he tends to refer to "the cyber" and tout his young son's supposed wizardry as a reason to be confused and afraid of what these new-fangled machines can do. "I have a son — he's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers. It's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough," he said at one of his debates with Hillary Clinton. His latest remarks simply must be quoted in full to be appreciated: If you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old fashioned way because I'll tell you what, no computer is safe. I have a boy who's 10 years old, he can do anything with a computer. You want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier. Perhaps this is a shrewd job-creation initiative, since in Trump's vision half the American population would have to be employed as couriers to deliver the emails the other half will write. And although Trump is blowing off intelligence briefings, he's got some news to break this week. While we wait for the transformation that will result from our new courier-based economy, he'll tell us what's really going on with the Russians. "Hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don't know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation," he said. Asked what he knew that others didn't, he said, "You'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday." As exciting as that prospect may be, I have some bad news: There will be no revelations of what Trump has discovered about the hacking. Not on Tuesday, not on Wednesday, not ever. This is just one example of a disturbing reality that we haven't yet figured out how to deal with: the fact that we can trust almost nothing that comes out of the mouth of the man who is about to be president of the United States. This fact has highlighted the insufficiency of the press' normal way of doing things. For instance, since the president is the most powerful person on earth, pretty much everything he says is, by definition, news. But with Trump, that has led to an entirely new genre of story, which comes down to "Trump Tweets Thing." Since he hasn't held a press conference since July and may never hold one again, reporters are left with his Twitter feed as almost the only source of presidential communication. So they write entire stories about tweets he sends, often without the context that would allow audiences to understand how ludicrous so much of what he claims is. As we try to figure out what's going on, even Trump's closest aides can't really be trusted to tell us what he's thinking or what he'll do, not because they're necessarily lying in a particular moment (they may or may not be) but because even if they're telling the truth as they believe it right then, Trump may contradict them or take another position within hours or even minutes. The confusion this creates is just what Trump wants, whether it's about specific facts or the general feeling of rootlessness we'll get from his rule. Media scholar Jay Rosen calls what Trump is doing "verification in reverse," a process by which he "takes facts that have been nailed down, and introduces doubt about them, which then releases energy (controversy, resistance, ready-to-hate news coverage) which in turn helps power a movement among those who wanted the established facts repealed, as it were." So we're left with a dizzying combination of inaccessibility, communication primarily via a Twitter feed that combines desperately insecure pleading about what a great landslide he achieved (yes, he's still talking about that) with absurd falsehoods, and occasional mini-campaigns meant to cast Trump as racking up heroic accomplishments that don't actually exist. My favorite early example came over Air Force One. Trump tweeted a complaint about the cost of the new versions of the plane (which is still in the development phase), pretending that cost estimates some analysts had made of what we might eventually spend actually represented money we're already spending. The show reached its final act with a meeting between Trump and the company's CEO, as I described here: The chief executive of Boeing comes to meet with Trump and says to him, Oh yes, we'll certainly work hard to bring in the plane for less than $4 billion. He's not making any promises that need to be kept, because as he knows well (though Trump may or may not), military contracting, especially for a complex system such as these planes, is a spectacularly complicated process that plays out over years or even decades and involves not just the White House but also a large Pentagon bureaucracy and Congress — and the latter two are more important to the eventual outcome. But in the short term, what's the result? The chief executive steps out to the cameras after his meeting with Trump and makes clear that Boeing is pledging to do right by the taxpayer, resulting in a whole lot of headlines suggesting that Trump's terrific negotiating skills have given those taxpayers a great deal, when in fact precisely nothing has changed. Trump hasn't actually saved a penny on Air Force One. It was all theater. We've seen similar kinds of showmanship on economic issues, as when Trump claimed that because of his brilliant leadership, Sprint had agreed to bring 5,000 jobs to America. In fact, this was part of an investment Sprint's parent company made last year. But Trump got a raft of glowing headlines out of the story anyway, despite the fact that he was being disingenuous about those jobs. Can you actually govern this way? We just don't know, because no one has ever tried. So far it's working well enough, and I have an idea about where he's going next: He'll claim that all the economic progress under Barack Obama was his doing. Right now the economy is doing extremely well by most measures — unemployment is at 4.6 percent, over 15 million jobs have been created since the Great Recession, inflation is almost non-existent, wages are growing, and GDP growth in the third quarter was a healthy 3.5 percent. During the campaign, Trump described the economy as a nightmare of endless suffering and despair, but he'll now characterize it as a dream of boundless growth and opportunity, brought about by his extraordinary leadership. Not long ago he tweeted, "The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald!" This was despite the fact that the Index has been rising steadily since 2009; December's number was just the latest uptick in a long rise. Some time in March, you can expect Trump to take credit for the arrival of spring. When he does so, it's incumbent upon the media to provide context — not in the 14th paragraph of a story, but right up top, along with whatever claim Trump is making. That means the story should read, "Trump takes credit for continuation of good economy," not "Trump touts good economic news." His spin has to be reported, but his spin doesn't have to be adopted. And when he says he'll do something — like release his tax returns (which he is never, repeat, never going to do) or reveal important new facts about Russian hacking — and then tries to get away with not following through, we all have to hold him to account. Trump exists in a world where facts are irrelevant, lying is permissible, and words are nothing but tools to "win" every encounter and establish his dominance. The question for the rest of us is whether we submit, or hold on to some connection to reality. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

The returns showed a deep red-blue divide between rural and urban areas, as usual emphasized by the divide delineated by the Cascades. Predictably, a new bill has been submitted in the state House of Representatives suggesting that Eastern and Western Washington are just too different to be part of the same state. State Reps. Matt Shea and Bob McCaslin from Spokane Valley and David Taylor of Moxee are proposing to split Washington into two states by making the land east of the Cascades into a new state named Liberty. No one thinks the bill will go anywhere, least of all the hometown newspaper, the Spokane Spokesman-Review, which points to the long, failed history of such schemes and calls it a folly. Disturbing, though, is the rationale put forth by the politicians. The bill says, “Since statehood, the lifestyles, culture, and economics of eastern and western Washington have been very different. The urbanization and rapid growth in the western portions of the state has progressively heightened this divergence of cultural and economic values between the western and eastern portions of the state.” The reaction by some in liberal Seattle was mocking and hostile (see The Stranger’s response by Sean Nelson), one sign of a kind of psychic secessionism going on in Seattle as many seek to hunker down in the sanctuary of the liberal bubble. But the city does not end at the city limits. Read environmental history and you’ll learn that the cities shape the suburbs, exurbs and rural areas, and vice versa. William Cronon’s epic book, Nature’s Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West, is a classic work about the expansive, transformative power of cities that extend far out into the hinterlands, and the symbiotic relationships that result. Cities are vast ecosystems, more than just measures of density or amenities. Seattle needs Eastern Washington in the most basic ways — power, agriculture, access, wine! — and Eastern Washington needs the West Side’s ports, culture, markets, jobs and tax money. While being separate states doesn’t preclude any of these things, it complicates them, not to mention the management of resources. The idea that our differences of “lifestyles,” “culture” and “values” seems to be coded dog whistling — and born of ignorance. The implication is that the state must be defined by ideological or racial, ethnic or religious affiliations. That is in conflict with the concept of the so-called State of Liberty. If liberty means being free of having to deal with people who are different than you, how is that ultimately liberating? Shades of this thinking showed up in a recent article where my colleague David Kroman reported on a trip to Ritzville in Adams County following the November election. He asked folks in a local coffee shop about the election. Their notion of urban people seemed to focus on the perception that certain people (read: African Americans) were looking for a government handout. Which is a funny point of view given how much of the economic activity and employment in Eastern Washington is government dependent. That contradiction, when pointed out, only elicited chuckles. The problems and rifts between urban and rural are anything but new, and rural America has been in one crisis or another for over 100 years. Cities are growing and their economies are becoming less directly dependent on rural economies, but the landscape of agriculture itself is changing: automation, consolidation and corporatization. Those are problems we have in the big city too, whether you’re a Boeing machinist or an Amazon warehouse worker. There seems to be a sense on the part of some rural folks that they’re the only ones who work hard. Urbanites might not have dirt under their fingernails unless they’re working a neighborhood p-patch, but most people I know in Seattle work their asses off. Even the rich ones. For the urban middle and working classes especially, big city life is not easy, even in these boom times. The problem is, rural resentment of lazy city folk and urban resentment of the hicks is the function of separation and disconnection. Which takes me back to the 1980s when I was an editor at an independent magazine that sought to connect the whole state. Washington magazine was founded in Bellevue by Longview Publishing and operated out of Seattle, but editorially we covered all of Washington. Our editorial goal was to lift what we called “the Cascade Curtain.” In those days, there was a sense of rivalry — Huskies vs. Cougars, Dryside vs. Wetside, apples vs. salmon — defined by the Cascade ridge line. The differences then were more a subject of humor, and badges of belonging. There wasn’t the kind of polarization we see now, even politically. The Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, after all, was Tom Foley, a Democrat from Spokane. The governor of Washington was John Spellman, a moderate Republican from Seattle. Both things are hard to conceive of now. Yes, politics in Olympia is nasty — it has always been: An 1863 Seattle newspaper described the territorial capital as a “political trading post or slaughter house” of “official imbecility.” So the state has one longstanding thing in common: dislike of Olympia. I suppose if you are an Eastern legislator who only comes over the mountains during session, your view of Wetside humanity might be skewed. And if you’re a Seattleite who has never visited Eastern Washington because …  —  well, why? — it might be because you’re a smug urban snob who needs to get out more. Washington magazine, long since deceased, gave me a chance to work with writers and photographers all over the state — it was lavishly illustrated and my boss was an old LIFE magazine hand, Ken Gouldthorpe, who was a tireless promoter of state unity (he later headed the state’s tourism division under Gov. Booth Gardner). I had a chance to poke around every corner of Washington, from Oysterville to Usk. Our biggest subscriber penetration, percentage-wise, was Central Washington, from Wentachee to the Tri-Cities — people who knew the state because they traveled in both directions regularly. But what I remember was the sense that people in Washington have a lot in common and are deeply interconnected. Farm kids moved to the city for jobs; city people retired to the country. People in Eastern Washington came West to buy appliances. People in the West went over the mountains to hunt and fish. There was beauty everywhere, and a common devotion to that. In the mid-1980s, the magazine hooked up with a program being revived by the Washington Association of Wheat Growers called the Farm-City Swap. People filled out an application in the magazine to spend a weekend on a wheat ranch in Eastern Washington and agreed to host a farm family at their place in the winter after harvest. Tons of people applied and were linked up — think Match.com. I got matched to a farm near Connell in Franklin County and took my family there. We rode a combine and “helped” with the harvest. We ate as heartily as if we were actually working in the fields, we attended a local church service, and made a run to see Palouse Falls. Most of all, we were impressed by our wonderful hosts — a matriarch who ran things from the family kitchen with the authority of Captain Kirk. We learned about the complexity of the government’s farm program, and why a college degree from WSU was important to keep ahead of business and technological trends. I remember her son who ran the harvest telling me that farming was 24/7 — but that it wasn’t a job, but a way of life. You didn’t count hours, or days off, or overtime. You just did what was necessary each day, and enjoyed the downtime when it came — not unlike the life of a writer, I thought. I remember talking to Swappers including farmers from Eastern Washington who were surprised at the commonalities they found with growers like the tulip farmers of the Skagit Valley or with island dwellers who had similar senses of self-reliance. Living on a farm in the middle of wheat country is a bit like island living. We can lecture each other about the right way to live, we can settle into our prejudices — reinforced, often, by the very media that are supposed to connect us. But nothing substitutes for spending time with each other, learning how others live, finding human commonalities that live outside the voting booth. It behooves us to see each other as three-dimensional, complicated beings, not just the cutouts presented on TV or Twitter. Dividing the state is exactly the wrong answer.

Photo by Angela Lewis Foster /Times Free Press. HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Donald Trump has only hinted at the future of NASA. But his campaign suggestions — more deep space exploration, less Earth science — seem to bode well for Alabama and for Marshall Space Flight Center. The center's 6,000-person workforce is a key part of Huntsville's economy. And deep space exploration plays to Marshall's strengths as NASA's propulsion center and manager of the Space Launch System (SLS), the new rocket capable of going beyond Earth orbit to deep space. NASA employees here say they heard the question often over the holidays: "How do you feel about Trump?" One employee's answer seemed to stand out: "We're certainly better positioned than last time." The last time the White House changed occupants, incoming President Barack Obama canceled the NASA rocket program being developed in Huntsville. Constellation, as it was called, was designed for America's space goals under Obama's predecessor, former President George W. Bush. It was to enable a permanent moon base to support missions to "Mars and other destinations." Constellation employed 500 NASA civil service workers and nearly 2,000 contractor employees in Huntsville. In the budget fight that followed, only the NASA employees kept their jobs. Obama cut Constellation from his 2010 budget after a study panel found it behind schedule and over-budget. That finding fit with Obama's preference to spend money on Earth science, including climate change research, and developing commercial space companies like SpaceX and Orbital ATK. Those companies are now sometimes referred to as "new space." During Obama's two terms, SpaceX would receive more than $4 billion in government funding to help develop a rocket and capsule that now supplies the International Space Station and will eventually fly astronauts there. But a Senate led by Sen. Richard Shelby and other NASA-state lawmakers forced Obama to also fund a sort of Constellation-light program NASA named the Space Launch System. The SLS booster and Orion capsule are being built by what are called "legacy" space companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. "It seems to me the re-election of Sen. (Richard) Shelby will have more impact on Huntsville than Mr. Trump," George Washington University space policy expert John Logsdon said two days after the election. Logsdon spoke before Sen. Jeff Sessions emerged as Trump's choice for Attorney General and one of his closest advisers. Sessions even has the power to influence NASA's next administrator, according to the Wall Street Journal. During the campaign, Trump surrogate and former Congressman Robert Walker said Trump wants NASA focused on deep space again, not climate science. Talk started about returning to the moon as a first step to Mars. Now, America's government and commercial space workforce waits to see, first, who Trump chooses to lead NASA. That will be a clue to the agency's direction for the next four years. Candidates mentioned for the job include a congressman, Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla), who favors a return to the moon; former NASA associate administrator Dan Cooke; and former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin. They also like deep space missions. Since the election, the space press has also closely followed the appointments to Trump's NASA transition team. Early reports said Sessions had tilted its makeup toward deep space and the projects NASA in Alabama does best. More recently, advocates for "new space" got Trump's ear and were added to the transition team for "balance." As for Trump, space isn't a priority yet. He tweeted during the campaign that he was "very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians." That was a reference to NASA having to pay for rides to the space station aboard Russia's Soyuz rocket. But Trump also told a young boy who asked about NASA during a town hall that, "Right now, we have bigger problems - you understand that? We've got to fix our potholes." The agency's future is a question with three parts: What will be its mission under Trump? Who will decide? And who will provide the rockets, probes, and crew quarters for that mission? The first two questions are about national strategy; the third will essentially be a fight over government funding. Here's a fourth question to consider as Trump's NASA plan unfolds. Will a return to the moon, even permanently, excite the young people now dubbed "the Mars generation"? Huntsville attorney Mark McDaniel was on the NASA Advisory Council when George W. Bush was president. He says Bush's old plan might make a good new plan. "I personally think deep space is something the government should do," McDaniel said, noting that the moon is deep space. "We talked about that when I was on the Advisory Council. The key word (in Bush's plan) was 'beyond.' We were going to the moon, Mars and beyond. "If you go back and it's in preparation for going to Mars, an asteroid or beyond Mars, that's great," McDaniel said. "We as a nation have to do things that have never been done before."If you say we're just going back to the moon," McDaniel said, "been there, done that."

By Victoria McGrane Globe Staff  January 03, 2017 WASHINGTON — From the boardroom to the campaign trail, unpredictability has been Donald Trump’s defining trait. Trump’s presidential transition has been similarly marked by unconventional twists and turns. The reality-TV-style auditioning of key Cabinet candidates. Dissonant signals on where he stands on climate change and the use of torture. Twitter blasts at odd hours about the nation’s nuclear arsenal and foreign policy. Kanye. Advertisement His unpredictability — coming after a campaign promise to shake up Washington — is roiling Washington’s lobbyists and intelligentsia, handing those whose business it is to shape the policy-making process in Washington the toughest job they’ve had in decades. “The amount of uncertainty here is just enormous,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. As the weeks tick down to the president-elect’s inauguration, to a certain extent, he said, “we’re all trying to figure out how to do our jobs.” Get Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell.

So the real estate mogul’s surprise victory sent many lobbyists scrambling to make connections and build relationships with Trump’s close advisers. View Story Trump tweets about N. Korean missiles Donald Trump responded to a North Korean report that it is preparing to launch an ICBM. And scramble they must. He has outlined an ambitious legislative agenda but not been clear on the order of his priorities or policy details. Adding to the unknowns: his incoming administration is not made up of the usual suspects. “He’s completely upended the political establishment,” said one Republican lobbyist with ties to Trump’s inner circle. The people who have had a lock on Washington’s levers of power for the last two decades, many of them alumnus of the Clinton or George W. Bush administrations, are now “outside looking in,” said this lobbyist. Advertisement Little-known rank-and-file lawmakers like Representative Chris Collins of New York, the first member of Congress to endorse Trump who is now serving as the main congressional liaison to Trump’s transition team, are suddenly ascendant power brokers. Meanwhile, Trump — known for prizing loyalty — has complicated relations with many of the GOP elite who were less enthusiastic about his candidacy, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. And then there is Trump himself, the consummate Washington outsider who has never held elected office before storming the highest office in the land. He arrives in Washington with few of the well-established ideological beliefs that typically serve as guideposts to those trying to figure out what a president will do. “President-elect Donald Trump isn’t bound by the same partisan constraints that shackled his predecessors. He won without the explicit backing of many leading Republicans, giving him more flexibility to chart his own course in office,” CGCN Group, a Republican lobbying firm whose major clients include Boeing and Microsoft, wrote to clients in a recent memo on the 2017 outlook. “Public affairs executives must figure out how to adapt to this unpredictably or risk irrelevance.” Trump has been providing observers with a lot of conflicting tea leaves to read. In early December, the president-elect unexpectedly sat down with former vice president and global warming guru Al Gore — a meeting that was initially meant to be just between Gore and Trump’s highly influential daughter Ivanka to discuss “climate issues,” a cause she has hinted she might pursue. Gore emerged from the golden elevators proclaiming the meeting “productive.” A few days later, Trump — who has previously called global warming a “hoax” — tapped a climate change skeptic, Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, as his nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a move widely interpreted as a signal Trump wants to roll back climate policies enacted by the Obama administration. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed repeatedly to bring back waterboarding as an interrogation technique for terror suspects, which many critics consider torture. But at the end of November, Trump indicated that a conversation with retired Marine Corps General James Mattis had affected his thinking on the issue, though it remains unclear whether he will seek to revive the banned tactic. Trump ‘won without the explicit backing of many leading Republicans, giving him more flexibility to chart his own course.’ CGCN Group, Republican lobbying firm  “He said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful,’ ” Trump told The New York Times. “I was very impressed by that answer.” Trump later named Mattis as his pick for defense secretary. Lobbyists point to the waterboarding instance as an example of a Trump’s willingness to turn on a dime with big decisions — or what critics say is his tendency to be swayed by whoever spoke to him last. It also highlights his self-described process of collecting many opinions on key issues, then making a final decision on “gut feeling.” Trump “is more than most presidents . . . influenced by practicality, and how does it move him,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and president of QGA Public Affairs, a prominent lobbying and communications firm whose clients include AT&T and US Steel. Feehery and other lobbyists say this increases the importance of crafting the right narrative around issues they are pushing for clients, and on building public support as opposed to working behind-the-scenes connections. Warring power centers have emerged within Trump’s fledgling administration, further complicating efforts to devise what the new administration’s policy priorities will be — since it’s obscuring who will control the agenda. Will it be Trump himself, despite the fact he showed little appetite for policy details during the election? Will it be his adult children? His incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus? Or maybe Vice President-elect Mike Pence? “I think it’s kind of a jump ball right now,” said Feehery. “There are a lot of minuscule issues that Donald Trump probably doesn’t care about [but] that are very important to some key industries, so people are trying to figure out who’s going to be the decider on those things.” Some things are becoming clearer with time. The American Enterprise Institute’s Strain said Trump’s Cabinet picks telegraph in broad strokes likely policy priorities. His choice of Georgia conservative Tom Price, one of the fiercest critics of the Affordable Care Act, to lead the Health and Human Services Department signals the president-elect is serious about his pledge to repeal that law, said Strain. Likewise, picking Bush administration veteran Elaine Chao, a savvy player of the Washington game, as his nominee to be the next secretary of transportation lends heft to his promise to push a big infrastructure package. But Trump passed over a major critic of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulations when naming his Treasury secretary nominee, suggesting that rolling back that law “is lower on the list of priorities,” said Strain. Still, the actual details of Trump’s proposals remain murkier than usual. George W. Bush campaigned on wanting to enact a big tax cut. When he took office in 2001, “people knew what the basic contours of that were,” said Strain, who was critical of Trump during the campaign. “We do not have that with the president-elect. We do not have a defined starting point” on his tax proposal, among others, he said. Trump has repeatedly sown confusion about his tax plan, most recently when his Treasury secretary pick described features that conflict with the proposal Trump outlined during the campaign. The uncertainty extends beyond Washington’s influence class and think tanks to those charged with steering the economy. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen said last month that members of the Fed’s policy-making committee discussed Trump’s economic plans during their most recent meeting in Washington. Their conclusion: “There is considerable uncertainty about how economic policies may change and what effect they will have on the economy,” said Yellen, speaking at a press conference following the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates for only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. “We’re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment.” The sheer ambition of Trump’s policy agenda adds to the uncertainty, Strain said. Immigration reform, repealing and replacing the health care law, a major tax code overhaul, and new infrastructure spending — each one is a big ticket item that will likely consume healthy amounts of time to negotiate and pass through Congress. And all are likely to be far harder to accomplish than many lawmakers and commentators are currently acknowledging, some observers say. Congressional Republicans are not united in how — and when, and if — to replace the Affordable Care Act. One faction wants to just repeal the law and leave it at that. Others believe Republicans need to replace it with something, but there’s also debate over whether the GOP can pass legislation repealing the measure now but have its demise delayed a few years to buy them time to devise a replacement program. And for many legislative items (though probably not all of the health care law repeal), Senate Republicans will need to gain the support of several Democrats for passage, further complicating matters. The GOP will control 52 Senate seats this year; most bills require a super-majority of 60 votes to succeed. This is where Trump’s reputation for being a deal-maker could come into play, and some insiders are betting that his business background and non-ideological sensibilities will lead him to try to make deals across the aisle. “[D]on’t overlook his ability to forge unconventional alliances,” CGCN, the lobbying firm, advised clients. Still, as the first person to win the presidency with no elected or military experience, how Trump’s business skills will translate in the political context, and how his volatile temperament will respond to the give-and-take of politics, remain two big unknowns. For now, much of Washington is in wait-and-see mode, confident that some of these questions will shake out in the early days of the Trump administration but also bracing for a more tumultuous four years than this town has seen in awhile. For some, it’s a refreshing change. “It’s much more exciting. It’s much more unpredictable. I like that,” said Feehery. “I think we’ve been in an ideological rut that has been very counterproductive. That’s why people have become disgusted with Washington.” Victoria McGrane can be reached at victoria.mcgrane@globe.com. Follow her on Twitter @vgmac. Loading comments...

According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

Later this month, the two companies will reveal the final tally for last year’s orders and deliveries, but both look set to fall short of their goal of achieving a book to bill of about one — essentially replacing almost every aircraft delivery with a new order. This would be the first time since 2009 that either aircraft maker has fallen below the threshold of one, according to aerospace analyst Rob Stallard of Vertical Research Partners. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BOE ▼ 158.61 -0.16 -0.10% “Airline demand indicators are easing,” he said in a recent note to clients. “We could be near or past the peak in this upcycle.” Neither company is including the recent multibillion-dollar orders from IranAir as firm sales, although contracts were signed in mid-December. By December 20, Boeing had 470 orders net of cancellations, against expected deliveries of about 750 aircraft. This compares with 868 net orders in 2015 and 762 deliveries. Airbus had net orders of 410 at the end of November, against 1,185 in 2015, with an order for five more A320 single aisle aircraft announced last month. It had delivered 577 aircraft by the end of November, against a goal of 670 and 635 in 2015. On a brighter note, a late December push will bring Airbus very close to its 2016 target of delivering 50 of its newest twin aisle, the A350 mid-range jet. Having delivered 34 by the end of November, the company is expected to have delivered 48-49 of the passenger jets by December 31, according to Sandy Morris, aerospace analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank. The impact of missing the A350 delivery target will be minimal, he said. “You can say they missed the delivery target or you can look at it and say the A350 has gone into service with six or seven airlines and it seems to be performing absolutely fine,” he said. “That is the most important thing.”© Bloomberg An Airbus SE A350 XWB passenger jet at the China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai, China Deliveries of the A350 were held up earlier this year because of difficulties with French cabin supplier Zodiac. However one big Airbus supplier said the problems with lavatory doors and passenger seats appeared to have been overcome by early December and management at the aircraft maker’s Toulouse headquarters were “sounding pretty bullish”. The group is also struggling to catch up on deliveries of its new A320neo aircraft, after difficulties with engine supplier Pratt & Whitney, and has had to step up deliveries of its existing generation A320 to compensate. While deliveries are expected to accelerate in 2017, the industry is preparing for a slowdown in orders as airlines adjust to rising oil prices and a deceleration of passenger traffic growth. Iata, the airline industry lobby group, is forecasting traffic in 2017 to slow from this year’s 5.9 to 5.1 per cent, while capacity is still showing signs of growing more quickly at 5.6 per cent. However, this is still a slowdown on 2016’s 6.2 per cent expansion. The rate of deferrals and cancellations also appears to be picking up. United Continental announced last month that it would defer 61 Boeing 737 deliveries from 2017-2018 while Southwest has also pushed back delivery of more than 60 737 single-aisle jets. If enough airlines follow suit, this could have an impact on longer-term profit expectations for Boeing and Airbus.

If you struggle to get a handle on some of President-elect Donald Trump's comments, here's a hint: Don't take him literally. (File photo by Evan Vucci, AP) By MARTIN WISCKOL / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Trump's shifting positions Immigration deportations July 29, 2014: Trump told CNN he would deport the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, unveiling a major campaign theme. Sept. 2, 2016: "Obviously, I want to get the gang members out, the drug peddlers out. ... And then we're going to make a decision (on other undocumented immigrants) at a later date once everything is stabilized." Muslim ban Dec. 7, 2015: Trump calls for a ""total and complete shutdown" of Muslims entering the country. Oct. 9, 2016: "The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world." ISIS and U.S. generals Nov. 12, 2015: "I know more about ISIS than the generals do." Sept. 7, 2016: "I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS." Nuclear warfare Sept. 26, 2016 (debate): "I would certainly not do first strike." Sept. 26, 2016 (same debate): "I can't take anything off the table." Climate change Sept. 24, 2015 (tweet): "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive." May 17, 2016: "At a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else," Trump said in regards to the Paris Agreement on climate change. Nov. 22, 2016: "I think there is some connectivity" between humans and climate change, he told the New York Times. As for the Paris Agreement, he said, "I have an open mind to it." Abortion Oct. 24, 1999: On Meet the Press, Trump said he was "very pro-choice." March 30, 2016: When MSNBC pressed him on his current opposition to abortion rights and what should be done to women if they disregard some future abortion ban, he said the "answer is that there has to be some form of punishment" to the women. March 30, 2016: Less than two hours after the above statement, Trump said the person who performed the illegal abortion "would be held responsible, not the woman." Prosecute Hillary Clinton Oct. 9, 2016 (debate): "If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation." Nov. 22, 2016: "I don't want to hurt the Clintons. I really don't. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways." If you struggle to get a handle on some of President-elect Donald Trump's comments, here's a hint: Don't take him literally. Sometimes Trump shoots from the hip, before he's thought things through. Sometimes, at least during the campaign, he'd repeat lines that roused the crowd. And there’s a growing perception that sometimes, he's doing what he’s spent his career doing – being a negotiator, not a typical politician whose words you take at face value. "Part of what he may be doing at times is taking a hardline negotiating position as a starting point," said UC Irvine political scientist Carole Uhlaner. Initial policy stances on undocumented immigrants and Muslims entering the country, both of which have softened in recent months, may have served as such starting points. "Also, people not knowing when to take you seriously can be an advantage," she said. Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel said fellow committee members have been discussing how to interpret Trump’s comments for more than a year. He agreed that the president-elect is essentially a negotiator. “It’s a different way of statecraft,” the Surfside resident said, adding that Trump’s tweets are about tone rather than precision. “The media has taken him literally, but they never took him seriously,” he said. “The voters took him seriously, but not literally. They didn’t expect a 40-foot wall for 3000 miles along the border. It was symbolic. ... It’s what he actually does that matters to me.” Steel said Trump’s controversial call with the Taiwanese president – which drew criticism from China – was a “masterful” shot over the bow that may be the prelude to a better trade deal. But other Trump comments are clearly not strategic policy ploys. In March, an interviewer described a scenario in which abortion was outlawed and asked Trump what should be done with women who had abortions anyway. Trump said they should be punished – but within two hours, backpedaled and said it was the abortionists who should be penalized. Then there are instances where he appears to say things simply for effect. His campaign vow to hire a special prosecutor to go after Hillary Clinton – which frequently led to the “Lock her up” chant popular at rallies – is something he walked away from once elected. “He says what he thinks will get a good response from whoever he’s talking to,” said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles. Sonenshein agrees with Steel that it’s Trump’s actions rather than his words that people should be paying attention to. “I don’t think he takes his own words seriously,’ Sonenshein said. “To me, it’s a whole lot of work to figure out what he means when it might just be a passing thought.” LEFT VS. RIGHT Many Democrats are alarmed by both the policy and style of the president elect, even while they question if he has any core beliefs. Howard Katz, chairman of the Democratic Party of Riverside County, is among those. He dismisses the notion that the skills of a business negotiator are transferable to politics and diplomacy, especially when it comes to staking out extreme starting points. “The problem with those extreme positions with an adversary is that it might end negotiations right away,” said Katz, who spent 30 years with IBM, including a stint negotiating to site factories abroad. “Business and diplomacy are far different from one another. Diplomacy is about consensus and business is cutthroat.” While Trump differs from his predecessors in that he has no governmental or military experience, Katz said the president elect is no different from others in terms of needing to catch up on many aspects of the office. “But every other man I’ve seen take the job has been humble enough not to say, ‘I know better than everybody else. I know better than the generals. I don’t need daily briefings,’” Katz said. Katz disagrees that Trump’s call with the Taiwanese president was a wise move, saying such behavior could result in China shifting its orders for jets from Boeing to the European Airbus consortium. Over the next 20 years, China is expected to buy $1 trillion worth of Boeing aircraft, and in 2016 ordered 163 jets costing $11 billion, according the CNN. Boeing has estimated the China orders support 150,000 jobs. Katz also criticizes Trump’s tweet that “the United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability,” saying it could lead to an arms race. “I think we should be extremely concerned by his spontaneity,” he said. “You may end up inciting people to violence that you cannot contain.” But Republican John Cruz applauded that Trump tweet, noting that it came just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin had said he would enhance his country’s nuclear forces. “That was Trump telling Putin, ‘You don’t want to go there – we’re not going to be at a disadvantage,’” the San Clemente lawyer said. “I think he sent just the right message. I think leaders would be much less likely to challenge the U.S. because of his posture and tone.” Cruz, who supports a path to legalization for those in the country illegally, was initially favoring the presidential candidacies of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. But he cast his ballot for Trump and says he has become more “comfortable and confident” with the president elect since the election, thanks to his tone becoming “more measured and presidential.” EVOLVING VIEWS Cruz likes the direction Trump seems to be taking in terms of those in the country without documents, signaling that the president elect is apparently moving away from his initial plan to deport all 11 million. Trump has also made comments about visas for Muslims, climate change and the use of torture that also indicate he may be evolving to softer positions than those touted in the primaries. “I do get the feeling that he’s moderating on some things,” said Jodi Balma, a political scientist at Fullerton College. “But I don’t know what he’s going to do. I don’t know how his decision-making process works.” Fellow political scientist Uhlaner understands the struggle to make sense of Trump’s statements. “He doesn’t filter his comments the way leaders usually do and until he does, it would be a mistake to take every comment equally seriously,” she said. “If he were to put himself in a position where there were questions and answers, it would be a lot easier to understand exactly what he meant. “Instead, we’re left to read the tea leaves of his tweets.” Contact the writer: mwisckol@ocregister.com Related Links Lansner: Will Trump help the economy? 17 trends to watch in 2017 Trump adopting same behavior he criticized Clinton for Gingrich: Trump's ditching 'drain the swamp' Trump says he'll shutter foundation to avoid 'appearance of conflict' Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular 4-year-old Irvine boy killed in car accident Update: 5 people shot in Santa Ana on Saturday night Runners pay tribute to Carrie Fisher in Star Wars Half Marathon at Disneyland Surfer pulled unconscious from water at Bolsa Chica State Beach, later dies 4 men injured in 3 unrelated Santa Ana shootings Related Links Lansner: Will Trump help the economy? 17 trends to watch in 2017 Trump adopting same behavior he criticized Clinton for Gingrich: Trump's ditching 'drain the swamp' Trump says he'll shutter foundation to avoid 'appearance of conflict' User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

If you struggle to get a handle on some of President-elect Donald Trump's comments, here's a hint: Don't take him literally. (File photo by Evan Vucci, AP) By MARTIN WISCKOL / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Trump's shifting positions Immigration deportations July 29, 2014: Trump told CNN he would deport the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, unveiling a major campaign theme. Sept. 2, 2016: "Obviously, I want to get the gang members out, the drug peddlers out. ... And then we're going to make a decision (on other undocumented immigrants) at a later date once everything is stabilized." Muslim ban Dec. 7, 2015: Trump calls for a ""total and complete shutdown" of Muslims entering the country. Oct. 9, 2016: "The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world." ISIS and U.S. generals Nov. 12, 2015: "I know more about ISIS than the generals do." Sept. 7, 2016: "I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS." Nuclear warfare Sept. 26, 2016 (debate): "I would certainly not do first strike." Sept. 26, 2016 (same debate): "I can't take anything off the table." Climate change Sept. 24, 2015 (tweet): "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive." May 17, 2016: "At a minimum I will be renegotiating those agreements, at a minimum. And at a maximum I may do something else," Trump said in regards to the Paris Agreement on climate change. Nov. 22, 2016: "I think there is some connectivity" between humans and climate change, he told the New York Times. As for the Paris Agreement, he said, "I have an open mind to it." Abortion Oct. 24, 1999: On Meet the Press, Trump said he was "very pro-choice." March 30, 2016: When MSNBC pressed him on his current opposition to abortion rights and what should be done to women if they disregard some future abortion ban, he said the "answer is that there has to be some form of punishment" to the women. March 30, 2016: Less than two hours after the above statement, Trump said the person who performed the illegal abortion "would be held responsible, not the woman." Prosecute Hillary Clinton Oct. 9, 2016 (debate): "If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation." Nov. 22, 2016: "I don't want to hurt the Clintons. I really don't. She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways." If you struggle to get a handle on some of President-elect Donald Trump's comments, here's a hint: Don't take him literally. Sometimes Trump shoots from the hip, before he's thought things through. Sometimes, at least during the campaign, he'd repeat lines that roused the crowd. And there’s a growing perception that sometimes, he's doing what he’s spent his career doing – being a negotiator, not a typical politician whose words you take at face value. "Part of what he may be doing at times is taking a hardline negotiating position as a starting point," said UC Irvine political scientist Carole Uhlaner. Initial policy stances on undocumented immigrants and Muslims entering the country, both of which have softened in recent months, may have served as such starting points. "Also, people not knowing when to take you seriously can be an advantage," she said. Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel said fellow committee members have been discussing how to interpret Trump’s comments for more than a year. He agreed that the president-elect is essentially a negotiator. “It’s a different way of statecraft,” the Surfside resident said, adding that Trump’s tweets are about tone rather than precision. “The media has taken him literally, but they never took him seriously,” he said. “The voters took him seriously, but not literally. They didn’t expect a 40-foot wall for 3000 miles along the border. It was symbolic. ... It’s what he actually does that matters to me.” Steel said Trump’s controversial call with the Taiwanese president – which drew criticism from China – was a “masterful” shot over the bow that may be the prelude to a better trade deal. But other Trump comments are clearly not strategic policy ploys. In March, an interviewer described a scenario in which abortion was outlawed and asked Trump what should be done with women who had abortions anyway. Trump said they should be punished – but within two hours, backpedaled and said it was the abortionists who should be penalized. Then there are instances where he appears to say things simply for effect. His campaign vow to hire a special prosecutor to go after Hillary Clinton – which frequently led to the “Lock her up” chant popular at rallies – is something he walked away from once elected. “He says what he thinks will get a good response from whoever he’s talking to,” said Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles. Sonenshein agrees with Steel that it’s Trump’s actions rather than his words that people should be paying attention to. “I don’t think he takes his own words seriously,’ Sonenshein said. “To me, it’s a whole lot of work to figure out what he means when it might just be a passing thought.” LEFT VS. RIGHT Many Democrats are alarmed by both the policy and style of the president elect, even while they question if he has any core beliefs. Howard Katz, chairman of the Democratic Party of Riverside County, is among those. He dismisses the notion that the skills of a business negotiator are transferable to politics and diplomacy, especially when it comes to staking out extreme starting points. “The problem with those extreme positions with an adversary is that it might end negotiations right away,” said Katz, who spent 30 years with IBM, including a stint negotiating to site factories abroad. “Business and diplomacy are far different from one another. Diplomacy is about consensus and business is cutthroat.” While Trump differs from his predecessors in that he has no governmental or military experience, Katz said the president elect is no different from others in terms of needing to catch up on many aspects of the office. “But every other man I’ve seen take the job has been humble enough not to say, ‘I know better than everybody else. I know better than the generals. I don’t need daily briefings,’” Katz said. Katz disagrees that Trump’s call with the Taiwanese president was a wise move, saying such behavior could result in China shifting its orders for jets from Boeing to the European Airbus consortium. Over the next 20 years, China is expected to buy $1 trillion worth of Boeing aircraft, and in 2016 ordered 163 jets costing $11 billion, according the CNN. Boeing has estimated the China orders support 150,000 jobs. Katz also criticizes Trump’s tweet that “the United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability,” saying it could lead to an arms race. “I think we should be extremely concerned by his spontaneity,” he said. “You may end up inciting people to violence that you cannot contain.” But Republican John Cruz applauded that Trump tweet, noting that it came just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin had said he would enhance his country’s nuclear forces. “That was Trump telling Putin, ‘You don’t want to go there – we’re not going to be at a disadvantage,’” the San Clemente lawyer said. “I think he sent just the right message.

Donald Trump has only hinted at the future of NASA. But his campaign suggestions — more deep space exploration, less Earth science — seem to bode well for Alabama and for Marshall Space Flight Center. The center's 6,000-person workforce is a key part of Huntsville's economy. And deep space exploration plays to Marshall's strengths as NASA's propulsion center and manager of the Space Launch System (SLS), the new rocket capable of going beyond Earth orbit to deep space. NASA employees here say they heard the question often over the holidays: "How do you feel about Trump?" One employee's answer seemed to stand out: "We're certainly better positioned than last time." The last time the White House changed occupants, incoming President Barack Obama canceled the NASA rocket program being developed in Huntsville. Constellation, as it was called, was designed for America's space goals under Obama's predecessor, former President George W. Bush. It was to enable a permanent moon base to support missions to "Mars and other destinations." Constellation employed 500 NASA civil service workers and nearly 2,000 contractor employees in Huntsville. In the budget fight that followed, only the NASA employees kept their jobs. Obama cut Constellation from his 2010 budget after a study panel found it behind schedule and over-budget. That finding fit with Obama's preference to spend money on Earth science, including climate change research, and developing commercial space companies like SpaceX and Orbital ATK. Those companies are now sometimes referred to as "new space." During Obama's two terms, SpaceX would receive more than $4 billion in government funding to help develop a rocket and capsule that now supplies the International Space Station and will eventually fly astronauts there. But a Senate led by Sen. Richard Shelby and other NASA-state lawmakers forced Obama to also fund a sort of Constellation-light program NASA named the Space Launch System. The SLS booster and Orion capsule are being built by what are called "legacy" space companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. "It seems to me the re-election of Sen. (Richard) Shelby will have more impact on Huntsville than Mr. Trump," George Washington University space policy expert John Logsdon said two days after the election. Logsdon spoke before Sen. Jeff Sessions emerged as Trump's choice for Attorney General and one of his closest advisers. Sessions even has the power to influence NASA's next administrator, according to the Wall Street Journal. During the campaign, Trump surrogate and former Congressman Robert Walker said Trump wants NASA focused on deep space again, not climate science. Talk started about returning to the moon as a first step to Mars. Now, America's government and commercial space workforce waits to see, first, who Trump chooses to lead NASA. That will be a clue to the agency's direction for the next four years. Candidates mentioned for the job include a congressman, Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla), who favors a return to the moon; former NASA associate administrator Dan Cooke; and former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin. They also like deep space missions. Since the election, the space press has also closely followed the appointments to Trump's NASA transition team. Early reports said Sessions had tilted its makeup toward deep space and the projects NASA in Alabama does best. More recently, advocates for "new space" got Trump's ear and were added to the transition team for "balance." As for Trump, space isn't a priority yet. He tweeted during the campaign that he was "very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians." That was a reference to NASA having to pay for rides to the space station aboard Russia's Soyuz rocket. But Trump also told a young boy who asked about NASA during a town hall that, "Right now, we have bigger problems - you understand that? We've got to fix our potholes." The agency's future is a question with three parts: What will be its mission under Trump? Who will decide? And who will provide the rockets, probes, and crew quarters for that mission? The first two questions are about national strategy; the third will essentially be a fight over government funding. Here's a fourth question to consider as Trump's NASA plan unfolds. Will a return to the moon, even permanently, excite the young people now dubbed "the Mars generation"? Huntsville attorney Mark McDaniel was on the NASA Advisory Council when George W. Bush was president. He says Bush's old plan might make a good new plan. "I personally think deep space is something the government should do," McDaniel said, noting that the moon is deep space. "We talked about that when I was on the Advisory Council. The key word (in Bush's plan) was 'beyond.' We were going to the moon, Mars and beyond.

(AP) - Donald Trump has only hinted at the future of NASA. But his campaign suggestions - more deep space exploration, less Earth science - seem to bode well for Alabama and for Marshall Space Flight Center. The center's 6,000-person workforce is a key part of Huntsville's economy. And deep space exploration plays to Marshall's strengths as NASA's propulsion center and manager of the Space Launch System (SLS), the new rocket capable of going beyond Earth orbit to deep space. NASA employees here say they heard the question often over the holidays: "How do you feel about Trump?" One employee's answer seemed to stand out: "We're certainly better positioned than last time." The last time the White House changed occupants, incoming President Barack Obama canceled the NASA rocket program being developed in Huntsville. Constellation, as it was called, was designed for America's space goals under Obama's predecessor, former President George W. Bush. It was to enable a permanent moon base to support missions to "Mars and other destinations." Constellation employed 500 NASA civil service workers and nearly 2,000 contractor employees in Huntsville. In the budget fight that followed, only the NASA employees kept their jobs. Obama cut Constellation from his 2010 budget after a study panel found it behind schedule and over-budget. That finding fit with Obama's preference to spend money on Earth science, including climate change research, and developing commercial space companies like SpaceX and Orbital ATK. Those companies are now sometimes referred to as "new space." During Obama's two terms, SpaceX would receive more than $4 billion in government funding to help develop a rocket and capsule that now supplies the International Space Station and will eventually fly astronauts there. But a Senate led by Sen. Richard Shelby and other NASA-state lawmakers forced Obama to also fund a sort of Constellation-light program NASA named the Space Launch System. The SLS booster and Orion capsule are being built by what are called "legacy" space companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. "It seems to me the re-election of Sen. (Richard) Shelby will have more impact on Huntsville than Mr. Trump," George Washington University space policy expert John Logsdon said two days after the election. Logsdon spoke before Sen. Jeff Sessions emerged as Trump's choice for Attorney General and one of his closest advisers. Sessions even has the power to influence NASA's next administrator, according to the Wall Street Journal. During the campaign, Trump surrogate and former Congressman Robert Walker said Trump wants NASA focused on deep space again, not climate science. Talk started about returning to the moon as a first step to Mars. Now, America's government and commercial space workforce waits to see, first, who Trump chooses to lead NASA. That will be a clue to the agency's direction for the next four years. Candidates mentioned for the job include a congressman, Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla), who favors a return to the moon; former NASA associate administrator Dan Cooke; and former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin. They also like deep space missions. Since the election, the space press has also closely followed the appointments to Trump's NASA transition team. Early reports said Sessions had tilted its makeup toward deep space and the projects NASA in Alabama does best. More recently, advocates for "new space" got Trump's ear and were added to the transition team for "balance." As for Trump, space isn't a priority yet. He tweeted during the campaign that he was "very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians." That was a reference to NASA having to pay for rides to the space station aboard Russia's Soyuz rocket. But Trump also told a young boy who asked about NASA during a town hall that, "Right now, we have bigger problems - you understand that? We've got to fix our potholes." The agency's future is a question with three parts: What will be its mission under Trump? Who will decide? And who will provide the rockets, probes, and crew quarters for that mission? The first two questions are about national strategy; the third will essentially be a fight over government funding. Here's a fourth question to consider as Trump's NASA plan unfolds. Will a return to the moon, even permanently, excite the young people now dubbed "the Mars generation"? Huntsville attorney Mark McDaniel was on the NASA Advisory Council when George W. Bush was president. He says Bush's old plan might make a good new plan. "I personally think deep space is something the government should do," McDaniel said, noting that the moon is deep space. "We talked about that when I was on the Advisory Council. The key word (in Bush's plan) was 'beyond.' We were going to the moon, Mars and beyond. "If you go back and it's in preparation for going to Mars, an asteroid or beyond Mars, that's great," McDaniel said. "We as a nation have to do things that have never been done before."If you say we're just going back to the moon," McDaniel said, "been there, done that." Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. Check out Delta's new Canadian airliner that's trying to challenge Boeing and Airbus Benjamin Zhang Jan. 2, 2017, 11:26 AM 1,272,671 facebook linkedin twitter email print Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider In April, Bombardier Aerospace announced a mega order with Delta Air Lines for 75 of the company's C Series airliners in a deal worth up to $5.6 billion. Shortly after the deal's announcement, Bombardier flew one of its C Series demonstrators down to Delta's Atlanta headquarters for journalists and the airline's staff to get a closer look. Although Bombardier has been a global leader in business and regional jets, the C Series is the first product from the Canadian airplane to compete against Boeing and Airbus in the mainline market. The decision to enter the market with the C Series was a major financial gamble for Bombardier, with a program price tag of $5.5 billion. Since its inception more than a decade ago, the aircraft has been beset by a series of development delays and slow sales. In 2015, the airplane maker was forced to write down $4.4 billion and take a $1 billion bailout from the Quebec government. Even as it struggled to close a sale, Bombardier was credited with building an aircraft that's one of the most capable on the market today — besting rivals Boeing and Airbus in terms of efficiency and ability. With the Delta order, Bombardier has not only found a US launch customer for the C Series, but it has the blockbuster deal it needed to validate the attractiveness of aircraft to other prospective buyers. The Bombardier C Series entered service in July with Swiss Global Airlines. Here's a closer look at the airliner: View As: One Page Slides Bombardier offers two version of the C Series: a 130-seat CS300 and a smaller 108-seat CS100. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Delta opted for the smaller CS100, but expect the airline to switch some of its order to the larger jet down the road. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider According to Bombardier, the C Series' greatest selling points are its efficiency and cabin comfort. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider A major contributor to the Bombardier's efficiency is its lightweight aluminum and composite body. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider In addition, its pair of Pratt & Whitney PW1500G geared turbofan engines are some of the most fuel efficient on the market and help make the airplane 15% cheaper to operate than aircraft currently in production. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider According to Bombardier, the C Series also emits 20% less carbon dioxide during operation and is the quietest airliner on the market. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider In January of 2016, then Delta CEO Richard Anderson cited the airplane's engines as a major reason for the airline's interest in the C Series. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider With a range of more than 3,500 miles, the CS100 allows Delta to operate routes its smaller jets had not been able to reach before. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Step inside the Bombardier's cabin and you'll find a surprisingly spacious interior for a relatively small 108-seat aircraft. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Enter the jet from the front and ... Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider ... you'll see the front galley to your left ... Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider ... as well as the first-class bathroom with a changing table. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Up front are the CS100's business-class seats. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Look toward the back of the plane and you see the CS100's five-abreast seating configuration in economy class. That means there's only one middle seat per row as opposed to two per row on the rival Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family jets. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Since the aircraft presented to the press was one of Bombardier's demonstrators, the interior did not have Delta's seats, lighting, and in-flight entertainment systems. But the cabin layout is accurate. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Even with Delta's specified interior, the CS100 should have the widest economy seats on the market at 19 inches. But the seat pitch should remain Delta's standard 30 to 31 inches, which is solid but not industry-leading. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider In addition, Bombardier claims that the C Series' windows are 50% larger than its rivals. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Here's the view from the CS100's window. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Bombardier designed the CS100's overhead bins to open 5 inches lower, which makes it easier to load baggage. The overhead bins are also designed to hold oversize carry-on luggage. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider What doesn't fit in the overhead bins can be stored down here in the belly cargo hold. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider In the cockpit, the C Series features five large, 15.1-inch displays. Here's Capt. Steve Paradis, who helped fly the plane down to Atlanta from Montreal. Benjamin Zhang/ Business Insider Instead of control yokes, the Bombardier is flown using side sticks. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider The position of each side stick can be monitored on the LCD displays. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider The Bombardier CS100 is a full fly-by-wire aircraft, which means that the side sticks have no physical connection to the airplane's control surfaces. Instead, the aircraft is flown through computer inputs. Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider Delta is expected to receive its first CS100 in 2018.

Troubled by that trend, a Republican in the House and a Democrat in the Senate will file bills Tuesday to strengthen the state's open records law. The Texas Public Information Act was once touted as among the strongest in the nation, but recent court rulings and decades of attorney general opinions have chipped away at it. Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, R-Southlake, and Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, are carrying the identical bills, which will take aim at two rulings open government experts say advance corporate interests at the expense of the public interest. The first decision, in Boeing vs. Paxton, essentially made secret contracts and other documents that detail billions in deals between private businesses and all branches of Texas government, from local school boards all the way up to the governor's office. The Supreme Court ruled, essentially, that contracts should be kept secret from the public to protect companies whose competitors could gain an advantage from their publication. In McAllen, for instance, taxpayers can't find out how much the city paid Latin pop singer Enrique Iglesias to sing at a holiday show — the sort of transaction that before last year could unquestionably be released to the public. "To me, that is so against the entire principle of accountability and transparency," Capriglione said. "This is taxpayer dollars that must be disclosed." The ruling also gave companies the power to invoke the law, meaning they can step in on a citizen's records request.  "Now, effectively any business can say, 'Hey, you know what? I don't want that information released,' " Capriglione said. With the help of open government advocates and news organizations, the two lawmakers also intend to press reset after Greater Houston Partnership vs. Paxton. That 2015 ruling undid a three-decade-old precedent requiring nonprofits that use public funds, essentially acting like governmental bodies, to open their books to the public. Private entities that perform government services on behalf of governments abound in Texas, and with respect to public records, were treated much like a state agency or city. But last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Greater Houston Partnership did not have to disclose its finances even though it handled economic development for the city of Houston and was funded, in part, by public money. Watson said that ruling could allow cities to outsource work to shroud their use of taxpayer dollars. "You can't do government activity wrapped in the cloak of a private entity, so that you avoid open access to records and access to open government," he said. "There have been some troubling trends with regard to open records and open government," Watson said. Ironically, the rulings obscuring government contracts and spending came the same year lawmakers  passed sweeping reforms to increase transparency and oversight of government contracts. The reforms were spurred by news reports that found an Austin-based technology company, 21CT, had procured a multimillion-dollar contract without competition and with the help of a top-level state official with ties to the company.  The documents used in that reporting, which prompted several high-profile resignations and led to the cancellation of a $90 million contract extension with 21CT, would be kept secret because of the Boeing vs. Paxton ruling.  The Legislature moving to reverse public records rulings is unusual. And the rulings indicate a souring of the court's sentiment toward the interests of news organizations, which have in recent years lost key libel and records lawsuits. Kelley Shannon, executive director of the Freedom of Information Foundation, said those setbacks have compelled groups that might have once sought help from the courts to appeal to lawmakers. Those groups include the Texas Newspaper Association, the Texas Association of Broadcasters and various cities and counties, she said. "The common theme is a lot of court rulings have muddied the waters on the Texas Public Information Act," Shannon said.  Some of the records setbacks on Shannon's radar might seem obscure but have become broad obstacles to the release of public information. For instance, a court ruling that governments must withhold birthdays in public records has, among other things, made it difficult for media outlets to distinguish between two people of the same name in arrest records.  Similarly, citizens and journalists have had trouble finding candidates' birth dates, which are necessary to do criminal background checks or ensure a candidate meets age requirements to run for public office. "We're trying to get it back to where the Texas Public Information Act is one of the strongest in the country and is not to be tampered with and is to be liberally construed to lead to the release of public information," Shannon said.  View Comments Tags Texas Legislature Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

More recently, advocates for "new space" got Trump's ear and were added to the transition team for "balance." As for Trump, space isn't a priority yet. He tweeted during the campaign that he was "very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians." That was a reference to NASA having to pay for rides to the space station aboard Russia's Soyuz rocket. But Trump also told a young boy who asked about NASA during a town hall that, "Right now, we have bigger problems - you understand that? We've got to fix our potholes." Three-part question The agency's future is a question with three parts: What will be its mission under Trump? Who will decide? And who will provide the rockets, probes, and crew quarters for that mission? The first two questions are about national strategy; the third will essentially be a fight over government funding. Here's a fourth question to consider as Trump's NASA plan unfolds. Will a return to the moon, even permanently, excite the young people now dubbed "the Mars generation"? Huntsville attorney Mark McDaniel was on the NASA Advisory Council when George W. Bush was president. He says Bush's old plan might make a good new plan. "I personally think deep space is something the government should do," McDaniel said, noting that the moon is deep space. "We talked about that when I was on the Advisory Council. The key word (in Bush's plan) was 'beyond.' We were going to the moon, Mars and beyond. "If you go back and it's in preparation for going to Mars, an asteroid or beyond Mars, that's great," McDaniel said. "We as a nation have to do things that have never been done before."If you say we're just going back to the moon," McDaniel said, "been there, done that."  TALKING POLITICS Alabama/California Conversation Project We asked Alabama Trump voters to talk politics, values with California liberals Civic-minded Donald Trump voters in Alabama agreed to have a deep, serious, respectful conversation with Hillary Clinton voters from one of the most liberal places in America, the San Francisco Bay Area.

By Alan Levin / Bloomberg News President-elect Donald Trump won’t end the onslaught of posts on Twitter that fed his unconventional campaign, even after taking on the formalized duties of the Oval Office later this month. Making news and issuing statements on social media sites that also include Facebook and Instagram will “absolutely” continue, despite earlier promises by Mr. Trump to cut back, incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “You know what? The fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results,” Mr. Spicer said. In recent tweets alone, Mr. Trump has hinted he’d like to change decades of policy on nuclear weapons; praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin even after accusations by intelligence agencies that Russia attempted to tamper with U.S. elections; and said the United Nations is a “club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.” Days after his victory on Nov. 8, Mr. Trump said in an interview on CBS’s “60 Minutes” that he was rethinking his use of social media, which had been a potent weapon during more than a year on the campaign trail. “I’m going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I’m going to be very restrained,” Mr. Trump said. Since then, during the countdown to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, he’s been seen as showing little sign that he intends to follow that pledge. On Dec. 28, the incoming president tweeted that he was trying to disregard statements by President Barack Obama that he considered “inflammatory.” “Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!” Mr. Trump said in the post. After Mr. Putin said on Dec. 30 that he wouldn’t respond in kind to an Obama administration order expelling 35 Russian diplomats in response to that government’s hacking of Democratic Party officials, Mr. Trump tweeted: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!” A day after praising Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump raised eyebrows by wishing a “Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies.” New Year’s Day brought a more conciliatory greeting “to all Americans” that cast ahead to “a wonderful & prosperous 2017 as we work together.” Mr. Trump’s tweets have also targeted specific companies, including Lockheed Martin for what the president-elect termed “out of control” costs for the F-35 fighter jet, and Boeing for “ridiculous” costs to build a new 747 Air Force One for future presidents. “Cancel order!” Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post Dec. 6, sending Boeing shares lower. The media-conscious president-elect has also quickly adopted a role as a cheerleader for an economy on the rebound. “The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter last week, noting that it reached a 15-year high. Mr. Spicer was asked on “This Week” about Mr. Trump’s Twitter statement Dec. 22 that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capacity until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” “You know, with all due respect, I think it freaks the mainstream media out that he has this following of over 45 plus million people that follow him on social media, that he can have a direct conversation,” he said. “He doesn’t have to have it funneled through the media.” Despite his voracious use of Twitter, the president-elect appears to be leaning toward old tech to ensure the security of sensitive messages. “It’s very important, if you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way because I’ll tell you what, no computer is safe,” Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday in response to questions about Russia’s alleged hacking of Democrats during the presidential election. Mr. Trump, who doesn’t email or surf the internet, said days earlier that computers “have complicated lives very greatly.” Mr. Trump currently has 18.3 million followers on Twitter, 16.8 million on Facebook and 4.5 million on Instagram. He has tweeted more than 34,000 times since joining the social media platform in 2009. “Trump has his own way of communicating with America,” Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican who was the first member of Congress to endorse Mr. Trump, said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” In other news, two people familiar with the matter said Mr. Trump is considering George Conway, a longtime corporate lawyer and the husband of senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, to be U.S. solicitor general, the government’s top appellate lawyer. Also, Mr. Trump’s advisers said last week that the choice of Roman Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan, a critic of Mr. Trump’s immigration policies, to participate in the inaugural ceremony next month was a demonstration of the president-elect’s determination to reach out to people who may not agree with him. Also attending will be Latino evangelical leader Samuel Rodriguez, who condemned Mr. Trump’s “deplorable rhetoric on Hispanics.” They will be joined by the Rev. Franklin Graham.

In the latest of a series of snipes directed at publicly traded companies via Twitter, President-elect Donald Trump fired across the bow of GM stock (whose CEO serves on Trump’s strategic and policy forum), sending shares plummeting in pre-market trading. GM stock has since recovered, pushing higher by 0.5%. Source: William Oliver via Flickr (Modified) Trump threatened to hit General Motors with a “big border tax” for “sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.” GM responded to Trump’s tweets in a statement, informing the president-elect that it sells very little Mexican-made vehicles in the U.S.: “General Motors manufactures the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.” And while General Motors did issue more Mexican-made Cruzes to meet demand for its initial rollout of the vehicle, GM has since switched production of its sedans sold in the U.S. to its Ohio plant. The 10 Best Fidelity Funds for 2017 According to GM spokesperson Patrick Morrissey, only about 4,500 of the 190,000 Cruzes sold in the U.S. in 2017 were made in Mexico, amounting to 2.4% of its Cruze sales. That, according to United Auto Workers President Glenn Johnson, is barely a day’s worth of production at GM’s Lordstown facility. Bottom Line on GM Stock GM stock isn’t the first to come under fire from Trump — both Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) were called out for pricey defense contracts, with both stocks taking a short-term hit. Trump’s threats are an extension of his campaign pledge to bring production back to the States, and he has warned before that he would levy a 35% tariff on companies outsourcing production. That threat has shaken some automakers to their core, with Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) announcing today that it is cancelling its planned $1.6 billion Mexico factory, instead investing $700 million in a Michigan factory. But as Johnson put it, Trump’s tweets simply make for good news … and great dip-buying opportunities for investors who see through the tweet storms. As of this writing, John Kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

According to Reuters, customs spokesman Huang Songping said China is the biggest loser in the anti-globalization trend. He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

The Wall Street Journal. 2:10 Legal experts: Trump's business plan falls short CNN Money 3:21 UP NEXT Ford Motor said Tuesday it will cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and invest $700 million at a Michigan factory after President-elect Donald Trump had harshly criticized the Mexico investment plan. The second-largest U.S. automaker said it would build new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles at the Flat Rock, Michigan plant and add 700 jobs. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the decision to cancel the new Mexico factory was the result of sagging demand for small cars in North America and not because Trump was elected president. He told Fox Business that the automaker would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. "There was no quid pro quo because there was no negotiation" with Trump over the decision to cancel the plant, Fields said. Fields told reporters the decision related to the need to "fully utilize capacity at existing facilities" amid declining sales of small and medium sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion. Fields also endorsed "pro-growth" tax and regulatory policies advocated by Trump and the Republican-led Congress. "This is a vote of confidence for President-Elect Trump and some of the policies he may be pursuing," Fields said. Trump repeatedly said during the election campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico, which he called an "absolute disgrace" and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on imported Ford vehicles. Ford executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. told reporters he spoke with Trump to notify him of the decision. The company said the decision was influenced by Trump's policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations but that there were no negotiations over the decision announced on Tuesday. By contrast, Trump's team held talks with United Technologies Corp in November before the company agreed to keep about 800 jobs at its Carrier air conditioning unit in Indiana out of 2,100 set to go to Mexico. Trump has also held high profile meetings with the chief executives of Boeing and Lockheed Martin to talk about the cost of military contracts. Also on Tuesday, Trump threatened to impose a "big border tax" on General Motors for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico. The New York businessman, who has vowed to bring back American jobs that have been outsourced overseas and be tough on illegal immigration from Mexico, takes office on Jan. 20. Fields said Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020 -- taking on companies like Tesla Motors Inc, Volkswagen AG and GM -- and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020 as the auto industry faces rising fuel efficiency mandates. Ford will add 700 jobs at the Flat Rock plant, Fields said, to cheers from union workers gathered at the factory for the announcement. TRUMP PREDICTION Ford in April announced it would invest $1.6 billion in the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to build small cars. The company said it will shift production from Michigan of its Focus to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. When Trump announced his campaign in June, 2015, he said Ford would cancel its planned Mexico investments. "They'll say,'Mr. President we've decided to move the plant back to the United States - we're not going to build it in Mexico.' That's it. They have no choice," Trump said. Trump tweeted a link on Tuesday to a story about the decision. Ford shares rose 3.3 percent to $12.54, up $0.41 a share, while the Mexican peso fell on Tuesday to touch its weakest level in seven weeks. Ford said it will add two new unnamed products at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where the Focus is manufactured today.

A single angry tweet from Donald Trump can quickly cost a company billions of dollars in stock market value, as Boeing Co. and General Motors Co. have discovered. Communications experts say the president-elect’s bullying style and his adept use of social media often leave companies with only one realistic path – to bow down and give him the win he craves, even if it is not quite the truth.

The order books of manufacturers often provide leading indications about the tenor of demand among businesses and consumers at any given point in time. Another advantage inherent in the ISM manufacturing survey data is its timeliness. The monthly reports are released on the first business day of each month. To be fair, the survey respondents are mostly filling out their surveys in the first half each month. For example, most of the surveys for the December ISM gauge, released today, would have been completed by around mid-December.  Still, firms reporting on their own order books, production, employment, etc., even with a few weeks’ lag, are providing more up-to-date intelligence than most of the high-profile government statistical releases. Finally, the ISM report is compiled differently than most other major economic data releases. For employment, retail sales, factory orders, etc., firms report the levels of their own activity and these are summed up into an aggregate level (with the monthly change typically providing the lead news headlines).  In contrast, the ISM surveys are compiled into diffusion indices, a process that essentially means one firm, one vote. The ISM responses are divided into those firms reporting an increase in activity (say, production), those reporting a decline, and those reporting no change.  If the number of firms reporting an increase is equal to the number reporting a decrease, the index will register 50, the break-even mark. Anything above 50 means that there are more firms reporting gains than declines and vice versa.  Thus, while swings in activity at a few giant firms (for example, Wal-Mart for retail sales, or Boeing for factory orders) can have a massive impact on the aggregates for most economic variables, the ISM gauges measure the breadth of expansion/contraction and thus provide a different angle on measuring the economy, and, as it turns out, a helpful one. Which brings us back to today's December ISM manufacturing survey report. The diffusion index rose by 1.5 to 54.7, comfortably above the break-even mark of 50, but certainly not an extraordinary level of activity.  What is noteworthy, however, is the ongoing recovery in manufacturing activity in recent months, as the headline measure posted its fourth straight monthly increase. Purchasing managers reported broad-based gains in new orders and production, as well as rising price pressures for their raw material inputs.  Of course, the evidence so far is preliminary and tentative. We will want to see confirmation in other more official data, such as employment, retail sales, and GDP, over the next several months.  However, given the long and mostly accurate track record of the ISM manufacturing survey over the past almost 70 years, it probably would not be a good idea to bet against it.   Stephen Stanley is the chief economist for Amherst Pierpont. Stanley is a frequent guest on CNBC and Bloomberg TV, where he has provided on-air commentary regarding the various economic indicators in U.S. financial markets.   The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the views of The Hill.  Tags Economic indicators, ISM Report On Business, Purchasing Managers' Index, Data, economy, Economic data, American manufacturing   View the discussion thread.

(AP Photo/Ariel Schalit) Expert: Trump uses 'completely meaningless' figure for F-35 cost By Jacqueline Klimas (@jacqklimas) • 1/3/17 4:10 PM Jacqueline Klimas Defense Correspondent The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/HeadshotKlimas_Jacque.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More President-elect Trump's assertion that the contract for the F-35 is worth $1.5 trillion is "completely meaningless," according to one analyst. Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, said the number Trump used during a speech on New Year's Eve, which has been cited by others over the years, is one that has been "created out of nowhere." In a video posted online Monday, Trump spoke about the next-generation aircraft with supporters at Mar-a-Lago and gave the contract number, which has been cited by others in the past. "And now we have a contract, the F-35 fighter. You saw that right? $1.5 trillion. But it's slightly over budget, like $400 million. These numbers are crazy. All I can tell you is we're going to do a good job," Trump said.

But the contract for the F-35 is not for $1.5 trillion. Instead, estimates have suggested that the full lifecycle costs of the Lockheed Martin aircraft, including future maintenance over the next several decades, will be just above $1 trillion. The actual total procurement contract, which is spread out over batches, will be less. "You can get to whatever you like if you include every ounce of gas you're going to put in the plane," Aboulafia said. "Coming up with random headlines doesn't serve anybody's purpose." The expensive procurement program has been in Trump's crosshairs since winning the election. Trump tweeted about its "out of control" costs and met with Lockheed Martin's CEO to discuss the program. He also announced on Twitter that he had asked Boeing to price out a comparable F/A-18 Super Hornet because of the "tremendous cost" of the F-35. The F-35 Joint Program Office did not respond to a request for the total value of the program. Several reports in December said the cost overruns for the program are actually $530 million, $130 million more than the figure Trump cited. CNN reported on Monday that during that same speech, Trump discussed his efforts to reduce the cost of the Air Force One replacement, which will be built by Boeing. He said he met with military leaders after the election who told him the overall cost of the program will be $4 billion. Trump then said he will reduce the overall program cost to $3 billion, and said the generals he met with were "beautiful" and made "Tom Cruise look like dirt."

Carlos Osorio/AP hide caption toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Ford CEO Mark Fields addresses employees in Flat Rock, Mich., on Tuesday, about changing plans to build a new factory in Mexico. Carlos Osorio/AP Ford and General Motors both reacted Tuesday to President-elect Donald Trump's continued criticism of U.S. companies manufacturing products in Mexico. Ford announced it would cancel its $1.6 billion plans to build a plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and instead invest an additional $700 million to expand an existing plant in Michigan to make autonomous and electric vehicles. That comes on the heels of another decision in November to keep production of some small SUVs at its plant in Kentucky. That announcement came a couple of hours after Trump took to Twitter to criticize General Motors: "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM responded that only a small number of hatchback models are manufactured in Mexico and sold at U.S. car dealers. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." Article continues after sponsorship Why did Ford change its mind? The move marks a departure for Ford, whose CEO last month said it was looking forward to working with the Trump administration on trade but that it very likely wouldn't change plans for its $1.6 billion factory. Now CEO Mark Fields tells NPR that Trump's rhetoric was a factor in reversing the earlier decision, but one of several factors. He says the carmaker was influenced by promises of new tax and regulatory reforms and the prospect of keeping jobs at home. "Ford is a global automaker, but our home ... is right here in the United States," he said. What is the significance of this change? It means 700 additional Ford jobs will come to Michigan, and Ford says every factory job is likely to create another seven related jobs. "We've created 28,000 jobs and we've invested $12 billion in the U.S. in our plants in the last five years," Fields said in a press conference. Shifting a factory itself would not be news but for the fact that it is highly unusual for companies to respond to direct, public pressure from an incoming president. "I know from talking to business people that no major firm wants to be a subject of a Trump tweet," says Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He says companies realize Trump controls the Justice Department, the Defense Department, the IRS, Treasury and regulatory agencies, and "the amount of control that intersects with what companies are doing is enormous." Will such moves inspire retaliatory trade barriers that hurt other U.S. firms and cost American jobs? Trump has pledged to rework U.S. trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has also called for high tariffs on companies that manufacture products overseas and then import them for sale in the U.S. The question is how broad such tariffs would be, and whether American trading partners would object and retaliate with similar measures. So far, Trump has (or claims to have) put pressure on American companies including Carrier, Sprint, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and GM. But Hufbauer says if Trump makes good on actually raising tariffs, "I think some form of retaliation [from other countries] is almost certain." Who's next, and what is the possible economic impact? So far, tweeting trade and other corporate policy has played well for Trump. He has targeted Boeing for a potentially large contract to build a new Air Force One, and he criticized Lockheed Martin for its expensive F-35 fighter jet contracts. Hufbauer says it remains unclear what the economic impact of all this will be. So far, the tweets have gotten a massive amount of media attention, and that may mean it will continue and that others — consumer brands in particular — could find themselves targets. "Some people may wrongly think this is the way to create jobs in the U.S.," Hufbauer says. "My estimate is that this kind of thing [companies responding to tweets] is not going to have a major effect," and it is not in keeping with a well-functioning economy," says David Dollar, senior fellow for the Brookings Institution. president elect donald trump Ford General Motors Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

Ford had come under heavy criticism from Donald Trump during the election campaign for plans to expand production in Mexico. But at a news conference on Tuesday, Ford CEO Mark Fields said the company is optimistic that Trump and the new Republican-controlled Congress would pursue growth policies that will strengthen U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing. Fields said that confidence, and a desire to make maximum use of existing plants, had prompted the decision to expand a factory in Flat Rock, Mich., for electric and hybrid vehicles. The announcement brought cheers from the hundreds of workers in the audience at the news conference, held at the Flat Rock plant. “I don’t know if you can really understand the impact of this investment,” said Jimmy Settles, a vice president of the United Auto Workers union, who represents Ford workers and spoke after Fields. “This is the equivalent to a new assembly plant.” Fields said Ford planned to use the Flat Rock plant to produce gas-electric hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck and the Mustang sports car, as well as a new battery-powered sport utility vehicle. The plant also makes the standard Ford Mustang and the Lincoln Continental. The Mexican plant was to be in San Luis Potosí and would produce small cars. Ford will still move production of its Focus compact to Mexico. The company said it will make that car at an existing plant in Hermosillo. The Focus is currently made in Wayne, Mich. “We are encouraged by the pro-growth policies that President-elect Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue,” Fields said. “And we believe that these tax and regulatory reforms are critically important to boost U.S. competitiveness, and, of course, drive a resurgence in American manufacturing and high-tech innovation.” Trump’s vows to protect manufacturing jobs and his portrayal of the North American Free Trade Agreement as a job-killer in the United States helped him win the support of working-class voters, including many factory workers in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky. Ford’s unexpected news came hours after Trump turned his sights on General Motors. In a Twitter post Tuesday morning, Trump suggested that GM should pay a tax for producing certain versions of a Chevrolet compact car at a plant in Mexico. “General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,” Trump wrote. “Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” GM makes most Cruzes at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, but last summer it disclosed plans to produce a hatchback version at a factory in Ramos Arizpe, about 100 miles south of the Texas border. The company said it exported most of the Cruze hatchbacks from Mexico to “global markets” and ships “a small number” to the United States. Until now, Trump has said little about GM, which is investing billions of dollars to expand production in Mexico. He named GM’s chief executive, Mary Barra, to an economic policy board that is supposed to advise him on the economy after he takes office. The attack on GM is the latest by Trump on a big U.S. corporation. In recent weeks, he has criticized Boeing over the cost of a new Air Force One and did the same to Lockheed Martin about the cost of developing a new F-35 fighter jet. During the campaign, he railed against Carrier and its decision to close a plant in Indianapolis and open one in Mexico. Carrier recently agreed to keep about 850 jobs in Indianapolis, although it is still moving about 1,000 to Mexico. Trump also slammed Ford for its plan to shift small-car production to Mexico, while using U.S. plants to produce larger vehicles like pickup trucks and SUVs. Ford officials have said the change will not result in a loss of jobs at U.S. plants. After the election, Ford’s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., told Trump in a phone call that the company had decided to cancel plans to move production of a small Lincoln SUV to Mexico from Kentucky. Trump then erroneously said on Twitter that Ford had decided not to move a “Lincoln plant” to Mexico from Kentucky.

Carlos Osorio/AP Ford and General Motors both reacted Tuesday to President-elect Donald Trump's continued criticism of U.S. companies manufacturing products in Mexico. Ford announced it would cancel its $1.6 billion plans to build a plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and instead invest an additional $700 million to expand an existing plant in Michigan to make autonomous and electric vehicles. That comes on the heels of another decision in November to keep production of some small SUVs at its plant in Kentucky. That announcement came a couple of hours after Trump took to Twitter to criticize General Motors: "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM responded that only a small number of hatchback models are manufactured in Mexico and sold at U.S. car dealers. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." Article continues after sponsorship Why did Ford change its mind? The move marks a departure for Ford, whose CEO last month said it was looking forward to working with the Trump administration on trade but that it very likely wouldn't change plans for its $1.6 billion factory. Now CEO Mark Fields tells NPR that Trump's rhetoric was a factor in reversing the earlier decision, but one of several factors. He says the carmaker was influenced by promises of new tax and regulatory reforms and the prospect of keeping jobs at home. "Ford is a global automaker, but our home ... is right here in the United States," he said. What is the significance of this change? It means 700 additional Ford jobs will come to Michigan, and Ford says every factory job is likely to create another seven related jobs. "We've created 28,000 jobs and we've invested $12 billion in the U.S. in our plants in the last five years," Fields said in a press conference. Shifting a factory itself would not be news but for the fact that it is highly unusual for companies to respond to direct, public pressure from an incoming president. "I know from talking to business people that no major firm wants to be a subject of a Trump tweet," says Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He says companies realize Trump controls the Justice Department, the Defense Department, the IRS, Treasury and regulatory agencies, and "the amount of control that intersects with what companies are doing is enormous." Will such moves inspire retaliatory trade barriers that hurt other U.S. firms and cost American jobs? Trump has pledged to rework U.S. trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has also called for high tariffs on companies that manufacture products overseas and then import them for sale in the U.S. The question is how broad such tariffs would be, and whether American trading partners would object and retaliate with similar measures. So far, Trump has (or claims to have) put pressure on American companies including Carrier, Sprint, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and GM. But Hufbauer says if Trump makes good on actually raising tariffs, "I think some form of retaliation [from other countries] is almost certain." Who's next, and what is the possible economic impact? So far, tweeting trade and other corporate policy has played well for Trump. He has targeted Boeing for a potentially large contract to build a new Air Force One, and he criticized Lockheed Martin for its expensive F-35 fighter jet contracts. Hufbauer says it remains unclear what the economic impact of all this will be. So far, the tweets have gotten a massive amount of media attention, and that may mean it will continue and that others — consumer brands in particular — could find themselves targets. "Some people may wrongly think this is the way to create jobs in the U.S.," Hufbauer says.

By Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Charlie Savage and Jennifer Steinhauer / The New York Times That didn’t take long. Before the new members could even be sworn in, Senate Republicans revealed the parliamentary language that congressional Republicans will use to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act, without fear of a filibuster by Democrats in the coming months. The instructions are simple and vague: The Senate Finance and the Health Committees, along with the House Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees, have until Jan. 27 to “report changes in laws” within their jurisdiction “to reduce the deficit by not less than $1,000,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2017 through 2026.” Translation: The Senate and House have barely more than three weeks to complete legislation that reduces the deficit slightly over the next decade and, in the process, guts the Affordable Care Act beyond repair. Debate will begin on the Senate floor on Wednesday, bypassing the Senate Budget Committee to speed passage. Mr. Trump took to Twitter today to amplify the message. The rate increases, revealed in October, had long been predicted in Arizona, where many insurers had announced plans to drop out of the marketplace, and they affect a small fraction of residents. But they fit the Republican narrative that the law has made health care worse for Americans, despite the fact that it has provided coverage to tens of millions of previously uninsured people. Left unsaid: What will happen to more than 20 million Americans now insured under the Affordable Care Act, or to the 27 percent of Americans with pre-existing medical conditions who, under the health care act, cannot be denied coverage by insurance companies? Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner buy a home in Washington Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner have purchased a $5.5 million house in Washington, less than two blocks from the residence the Obama family will soon occupy, according to the magazine Washingtonian. The home, which sold on Dec. 22, features six bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms and an elaborate wooden and glass stairwell. The home has French doors that overlook a stone patio and a yard in the neighborhood of Kalorama, one of the fanciest in the nation’s capital. Two outdoor stairwells lead to a front door that opens up on three stories and almost 7,000 square feet of space. Salonlike rooms give way to lower rooms that look appropriate for the parents of three young children, all of whom will have to make an adjustment from their more intimate Manhattan apartment. The relative proximity of the home to the West Wing of the White House — about a mile and a half — indicates the couple will be having a say in the affairs of state. The Clintons will attend Trump’s swearing in She called Mr. Trump “unfit” to be the commander-in-chief. He called her a “nasty woman.” But Mrs. Clinton will be attending Mr. Trump’s inauguration, along with her husband. It is customary for former presidents and first ladies to observe the peaceful transfer of power in person. Former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, will also be in Washington on Jan. 20 for the inaugural festivities. Not since Al Gore shared the stage with Mr. Bush in 2001 has such an awkward pairing occurred at an inauguration. Mr. Gore won the popular vote in 2000 and only conceded the loss after the United States Supreme Court intervened to stop a recount in Florida. Mrs. Clinton’s loss was less contested, but her victory total in the popular vote, by 2,864,974 million votes, dwarfed Mr. Gore’s 543,895 margin in 2000. Mrs. Clinton’s total popular vote was the largest for a losing candidate since 1876. Trump to Obama: No more releases from Guantánamo It has been a busy day for the president-elect on Twitter, but he took the time to prepare his supporters for a late flurry of transfers from Guantánamo Bay that Mr. Obama plans in the coming days. The New York Times reported last month that the Obama administration had deals to transfer about 18 of the remaining 59 detainees before Mr. Obama leaves office on Jan. 20. If all goes as planned, most would go to three gulf nations — Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — and be placed in custodial rehabilitation programs. One would go to Italy. All of the men set to leave the prison are on a list of those recommended for transfer, if security conditions can be met in the receiving country, by six United States security agencies. Most have been held for about 14 years in wartime detention without trial and are from unstable countries, like Yemen, which complicated efforts to find a place to send them. While Mr. Obama failed to fulfill his vow to close the Guantánamo prison, he refused to place any new detainees there and has whittled its population from the 242 prisoners he inherited from the administration of President George W. Bush. Mr. Trump has vowed to keep the prison open and “load it up with some bad dudes.” Civil rights activists occupy Sessions’s office The protest season is beginning even before the swearing in. Officials of the N.A.A.C.P. and its Alabama chapter occupied Mr. Sessions’s office in Mobile, Ala., demanding that the senator withdraw his name from consideration to be the next attorney general. Trump picks U.S. trade representative Mr. Trump, whose campaign for the White House was centered on an anti-trade and anti-globalization message, today selected Robert E. Lighthizer, an international trade lawyer who has argued in favor of protectionist policies in some cases, as his United States trade representative. In Mr. Lighthizer, a top trade attorney representing multinational companies at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who was a trade official for Ronald Reagan, Mr. Trump has selected a seasoned negotiator who is intimately familiar with the benefits of global agreements. But Mr. Lighthizer has also been outspoken in pointing out their potential harm to United States interests. It is not clear what role he will play in the Trump administration now that the president-elect has created a White House National Trade Council and placed Peter Navarro, an economist who is a leading critic of China, at its helm. Mr. Lighthizer has also been harshly critical of China, and in a 2010 Op-Ed article in The New York Times, he presaged some of Mr. Trump’s talk on trade. “Given the Tea Party’s desire to restore America’s greatness, it will push Washington to stand up to China and re-establish American pre-eminence, even at the cost of the country’s free-trade record,” Mr. Lighthizer wrote. At the same time, he has lobbied on behalf of major American corporations to pry open foreign markets. In response to the announcement, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and an ardent free-trade supporter, appears to have given up on the kinds of expansive multilateral trade deals, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that he once championed. What is left of the free-trade caucus now appears content with small deals with individual countries. “The incoming Trump administration has a unique opportunity to pursue new, bilateral trade pacts of the highest caliber that can be submitted to Congress for an up-or-down vote with no amendments,” Mr. Hatch wrote. And speaking of trade ... The president-elect, who targeted Boeing on its Air Force One upgrade, Lockheed on its advanced military fighter jet and, of course, Carrier on its Indianapolis furnace plant, seems to have taken a shine to General Motors. In fact, it was President Obama who saved the Lordstown, Ohio, G.M. plant in 2009, with the auto bailout, visiting the factory that year to take a Chevrolet Cruze for a spin on the plant floor. And G.M. has now responded: G.M. imports hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, which was only a small percentage of the 172,000 Cruzes sold through November, said Patrick Morrissey, a spokesman. Obama’s mission: Save the Affordable Care Act With less than three weeks left before he leaves office, Mr. Obama has a more immediate concern in Congress: how to prevent Mr. Trump and Republicans from rolling back his domestic accomplishments, especially the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Obama, who returned on Monday from a two-week vacation in Hawaii, plans to make a rare visit to Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning to huddle privately with House and Senate Democrats and discuss how to thwart the coming Republican assault on his legacy. Democrats are strategizing about the best way to block the repeal of the health care law, as well as attempts to cut Medicare or Medicaid, and Mr. Obama has made it clear that he will use his remaining days in the White House to secure as many of his priorities as possible. Mr. Pence will make a return to the Capitol — where he served for many years as a House member from Indiana — on Wednesday. He will be there to “discuss next steps to repeal and replace #Obamacare,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on Monday on Twitter. Bipartisan letter to Trump: Sell your businesses A handful of Republicans — including several former governors and members of Congress — have joined with liberal ethics activists in pressing Mr. Trump to sell his business assets to prevent White House conflicts that could be “seriously damaging” to the presidency. The letter sent to Mr. Trump includes the signatures of two former Republican governors, five former Republican members of the House and a collection of prominent ethicists, including Peter Schweizer, the editor at large of Breitbart and the author of “Clinton Cash,” a book that criticized Hillary Clinton’s connections to the Clinton Foundation. In a number of cases, the Republicans who signed the letter have been critics of Mr. Trump since before the election, such as former Representatives Peter Smith of Vermont and Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma. Some Republican signers, such as Arne Carlson, a former governor of Minnesota, and Christine Todd Whitman, a former governor of New Jersey, supported Mrs. Clinton for president. But the letter suggests that Mr. Trump is beginning to face calls from a broadening universe of people to take more aggressive steps to eliminate potential conflicts, such as selling off his real estate holdings and businesses before taking office. “The only way to solve the problems you face remains divesting into a blind trust managed by an independent trustee or the equivalent,” the letter says. “As long as you continue to maintain ownership of the Trump Organization, no other steps that you take will prevent the serious conflicts of interest.” The letter was organized by two former White House ethics lawyers — Richard W. Painter, who served under George W. Bush, and Norman Eisen, who served in the Obama administration — as well as Fred Wertheimer, the founder of an ethics in government group called Democracy 21.

Carlos Osorio/AP Ford and General Motors both reacted Tuesday to President-elect Donald Trump's continued criticism of U.S. companies manufacturing products in Mexico. Ford announced it would cancel its $1.6 billion plans to build a plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and instead invest an additional $700 million to expand an existing plant in Michigan to make autonomous and electric vehicles. That comes on the heels of another decision in November to keep production of some small SUVs at its plant in Kentucky. That announcement came a couple of hours after Trump took to Twitter to criticize General Motors: "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM responded that only a small number of hatchback models are manufactured in Mexico and sold at U.S. car dealers. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." Article continues after sponsorship Why did Ford change its mind? The move marks a departure for Ford, whose CEO last month said it was looking forward to working with the Trump administration on trade but that it very likely wouldn't change plans for its $1.6 billion factory. Now CEO Mark Fields tells NPR that Trump's rhetoric was a factor in reversing the earlier decision, but one of several factors. He says the carmaker was influenced by promises of new tax and regulatory reforms and the prospect of keeping jobs at home. "Ford is a global automaker, but our home ... is right here in the United States," he said. What is the significance of this change? It means 700 additional Ford jobs will come to Michigan, and Ford says every factory job is likely to create another seven related jobs. "We've created 28,000 jobs and we've invested $12 billion in the U.S. in our plants in the last five years," Fields said in a press conference. Shifting a factory itself would not be news but for the fact that it is highly unusual for companies to respond to direct, public pressure from an incoming president. "I know from talking to business people that no major firm wants to be a subject of a Trump tweet," says Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He says companies realize Trump controls the Justice Department, the Defense Department, the IRS, Treasury and regulatory agencies, and "the amount of control that intersects with what companies are doing is enormous." Will such moves inspire retaliatory trade barriers that hurt other U.S. firms and cost American jobs? Trump has pledged to rework U.S. trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump has also called for high tariffs on companies that manufacture products overseas and then import them for sale in the U.S. The question is how broad such tariffs would be, and whether American trading partners would object and retaliate with similar measures. So far, Trump has (or claims to have) put pressure on American companies including Carrier, Sprint, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and GM. But Hufbauer says if Trump makes good on actually raising tariffs, "I think some form of retaliation [from other countries] is almost certain." Who's next, and what is the possible economic impact? So far, tweeting trade and other corporate policy has played well for Trump. He has targeted Boeing for a potentially large contract to build a new Air Force One, and he criticized Lockheed Martin for its expensive F-35 fighter jet contracts. Hufbauer says it remains unclear what the economic impact of all this will be. So far, the tweets have gotten a massive amount of media attention, and that may mean it will continue and that others — consumer brands in particular — could find themselves targets. "Some people may wrongly think this is the way to create jobs in the U.S.," Hufbauer says. "My estimate is that this kind of thing [companies responding to tweets] is not going to have a major effect," and it is not in keeping with a well-functioning economy," says David Dollar, senior fellow for the Brookings Institution. president elect donald trump Ford General Motors Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Chided by Trump, Ford scraps Mexico factory, adds Michigan jobs By Reuters Published: 17:26 EST, 3 January 2017 | Updated: 17:26 EST, 3 January 2017 e-mail 10 shares By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson FLAT ROCK, Mich./WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Tuesday scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Donald Trump, as the U.S. president-elect turned his attention toward rival General Motors Co with the threat of a "big border tax" over compact cars made in Mexico. Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move "a vote of confidence" in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said Ford would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project Trump urged the automaker to abandon and called an "absolute disgrace" during the election campaign. The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there. Trump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment. In a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States. Trump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20. Mexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment. "Obviously, this isn't a good decision for us," said Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford's investment in Flat Rock. Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus. Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent. TRUMP NOTIFIED Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress. "Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing," Fields said. Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields' announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan. Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020. GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.

Unfortunately, fog grounded their fighter jet in Millington, but there was still fun to be had. With 70 years of aviation excellence, the Blue Angels fly to showcase the pride of the United States Navy and Marine Corps. A total of 17 officers serve voluntarily. Two pilots were in Millington in advance of the Memphis Air Show, which is coming in May. It’s been three years since their last show. Despite the weather, the crowd came out in full force. Debbie Smith said she has been watching the Blue Angels since she was six years old when her father was in the service. Her family continued their tradition and drove down from Tipton County to meet the team. “Every time they came to where he was stationed, we went to see the Blue Angels,” Smith said. Her grandson Hunter May enjoys the thrill of seeing the Boeing FA18s race through the air. “When they do those crazy stunts, when they cross and almost crash into each other, it's dangerous,” he said. Lt. Brandon Hempler said that while serving in the Navy or Marine Corps, pilots with a dream of becoming a Blue Angel must submit an application as they would any other job. “And then we interview with the team, and if you're selected it's one of the happiest days of your life,” Hempler said. Safety is always a top priority. Hempler said nervousness is always part of the show. “It's good to have a little bit of nervousness so you know you're doing it right,” he said. Lt. David Steppe believes community outreach sets the Blue Angels apart from any other air show team. “Inspiring that 3 or 4-year-old kid who comes up and spending if it's two minutes, then they got to spend two minutes with a Blue Angel,” Steppe said.

He said the company would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected.Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend $1.6 billion to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project that Trump urged the company to abandon and described as an "absolute disgrace" during the election campaign. The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million in the Flat Rock, Michigan factory plant and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there.Trump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show that he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment. Investors on Tuesday sold off shares of Kansas City Southern railroad, a company that is heavily dependent on shipping goods across the U.S.-Mexico border. In a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States.Trump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20. Such remarks have signalled an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming U.S. president into the affairs of U.S. corporations.Mexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has made sure that the company will reimburse the state for any costs associated with the investment. Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus. GM shares were up 0.5 percent, or $0.17, to $35.00. Ford shares rose 3.3 percent, or $0.40 a share, to $12.53.TRUMP NOTIFIED Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress."Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing," Fields said.Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on imported Ford vehicles.Trump during the campaign also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc (UTX.N), Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana.Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over the decision to cancel the Mexico plant or invest in Michigan.Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020.GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields as he announced the new jobs.

Ford is canceling plans to build a new $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and will invest $700 million in a Michigan plant to build new electric and autonomous vehicles. The factory will get 700 new jobs. | AP Business / Corporate Ford dumps plan for Mexico plant amid pressure from Trump AFP-JIJI Jan 4, 2017 Article history Online: Jan 04, 2017 Last Modified: Jan 04, 2017 PRINT SHARE WASHINGTON – Ford scuttled a plan to build a new factory in Mexico Tuesday following criticism from Donald Trump, and just hours after the president-elect attacked General Motors for importing Mexican-made cars into the U.S. Following months of criticism from Trump for its investments in Mexico, Ford said it was spiking a plan to build a new $1.6 billion plant in San Luis Potosi, and would instead invest $700 million over the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan to build electric and self-driving vehicles. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the second-biggest U.S. automaker was hopeful Trump’s policies will boost the U.S. manufacturing environment. “It’s literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that he has been outlining and that’s why we’re making this decision to invest here in the U.S. and our plant here in Michigan,” Fields told CNN. Earlier, GM became the latest multinational to end up in Trump’s line of fire — via Twitter as usual — with the president-elect threatening to impose a tariff on GM’s imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze cars to the U.S. Trump took to Twitter again to crow about the Ford reversal. He posted a Fox News story with Ford’s logo touting the announcement. In a second Twitter message, Trump said: “Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world’s great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.” Ford said Tuesday’s moves would result in the additional of 700 new U.S. jobs during the next four years. Ford said it would continue to develop its next-generation Ford Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. “This will make way for two new iconic products at Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where Focus is manufactured today — safeguarding approximately 3,500 U.S. jobs,” Ford said. The moves signal the president-elect, who has blamed international trade agreements for killing millions of U.S. jobs, likely will loom large over next week’s Detroit auto show, when the U.S. industry’s biggest executives gather to show off their new models. Meanwhile, GM responded to Trump’s Twitter attack with a statement emphasizing that the vast majority of its Cruze cars sold in the U.S. are made in Ohio, with just a small percentage imported from a plant across the southern border. “All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio,” the auto giant said. “GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.” Of 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the U.S., only 4,500 were hatchbacks made in Mexico, said a GM spokesman. What is clear is that automakers and other multinationals are leery of Trump’s tough talk on trade and his willingness to single out individual companies by name if they fail to toe the line: Carrier, Boeing and Lockheed have all been the subject of Twitter attacks in recent weeks. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to impose a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and he has also pledged to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Trump charged that NAFTA and other trade agreements were responsible for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. NAFTA permits cars to be sold duty-free within the U.S., Canada and Mexico if they are at 65 percent made in the bloc. Earlier Tuesday Trump announced his nomination of protectionist lawyer Robert Lighthizer to serve as U.S. trade representative, saying he “will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity.” Lighthizer served as deputy U.S. trade representative when Ronald Reagan was president in the 1980s, when the focus was on attacking Japan for its huge exports into the U.S. market. Lighthizer said in the statement: “I am fully committed to President-elect Trump’s mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans.” Leading business lobbies such as the Business Roundtable have cautioned other governments could retaliate against the U.S. for tariffs, threatening key markets for U.S. companies. “Any significant tariff increase within the North American region would impact the auto industry greatly and that just really makes the industry . . . much less competitive,” said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. Automakers are also worried about a trade war with China. Shanghai authorities last month fined the Chinese unit of General Motors nearly $29 million over alleged monopolistic pricing behavior. The penalty comes in the midst of a war of words between Trump and Chinese media, after the billionaire Republican businessman suggested he may reject the “one China” policy unless Beijing makes concessions on trade and other matters.

The Detroit-based company said in November it planned to cut a shift at its Cruze plant in Ohio and furlough 1,200 workers there due to weak demand for small cars. Glenn Johnson, president of United Auto Workers Local 1112, which represents GM workers in Lordstown, said in an interview at the time of the layoffs he didn’t know if his plant had the tooling in place to make the hatchback version of the Cruze. The hatchback version sells in small numbers and probably would not rescue an entire shift, he said. Trump has made a point of pressuring large US manufacturers into keeping production in the US. He criticized Ford during the presidential campaign for moving production of the Ford Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico. In November, he said on Twitter he talked with Chairman Bill Ford and got the automaker to commit to keeping production of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle in Kentucky instead of Mexico. At the time, Trump indicated he’d saved the plant. In reality, the plant was not scheduled to close. Its employees assemble the Ford Escape SUV, a better-selling model. More than 5,000 employees work nearly around the clock on three crews to meet demand for the two SUVs.

PHOTO: REUTERS PublishedJan 4, 2017, 5:06 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4PmV Copy FLAT ROCK, Mich./WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - Ford Motor Co on Tuesday (Jan 3) scrapped a planned Mexican car factory and added 700 jobs in Michigan following criticism by Donald Trump, as the US president-elect turned his attention toward rival General Motors Co with the threat of a "big border tax"over compact cars made in Mexico. Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move "a vote of confidence"in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in the North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant. He said the company would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. Ford will cancel plans unveiled in April to spend US$1.6 billion (S$2.3 billion) to build the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a project that Trump urged the company to abandon and described as an "absolute disgrace" during the election campaign. The No. 2 US automaker also said it would invest US$700 million in the Flat Rock, Michigan factory plant and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there. Trump's efforts to browbeat the US car industry show that he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment. Investors on Tuesday sold off shares of Kansas City Southern railroad, a company that is heavily dependent on shipping goods across the US-Mexico border. In a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!" GM, the largest US automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States. Trump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan 20. Such remarks have signaled an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming U.S. president into the affairs of U.S. corporations. Mexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has made sure that the company will reimburse the state for any costs associated with the investment. Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save US$500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus. GM shares were up 0.5 per cent, or US$0.17, to US$35.00. Ford shares rose 3.3 per cent, or US$0.40 a share, to US$12.53. TRUMP NOTIFIED Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress. "Our view is that we see a more positive US manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing," Fields said. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on imported Ford vehicles. Trump during the campaign also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration. Since winning the Nov 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over the decision to cancel the Mexico plant or invest in Michigan. Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile (482-km) driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020. GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields as he announced the new jobs. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 and the majority of it in 2020, Fields said.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million to expand the Flat Rock, Michigan factory and would make new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles there. Trump's efforts to browbeat the U.S. car industry show he may go further than other modern presidents to try to influence corporate decisions, especially those related to trade and investment. In a Twitter post hours before Ford's announcement, Trump wrote, "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said making some of the Cruze cars in the plant in Coahuila, Mexico was part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell those vehicles in the United States. Trump's GM tweet was his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs even before he takes office on Jan. 20. Mexico's government said it regrets Ford's decision and has ensured that the company will reimburse San Luis Potosi state for any costs associated with the investment. "Obviously, this isn't a good decision for us," said Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo. Ford said it still will shift production from Michigan of its Focus compact car to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Fields said he expects Michigan to give incentives for Ford's investment in Flat Rock. Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said the automaker will save $500 million by not opening the new plant in the near term, but will have some undisclosed costs to retool the other Mexican plant to build the Focus. Ford shares closed up about 3.8 percent. GM shares rose about 0.9 percent. TRUMP NOTIFIED Top Ford executives personally notified Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence of their decision. Fields praised tax and regulatory proposals advocated by Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress. "Our view is that we see a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and the pro-growth policies and proposals that he's talking about, so this is a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies that they may be pursuing," Fields said. Union workers gathered at the Flat Rock factory cheered Fields' announcement. Hiring of the 700 new workers there will probably start in 2018 with the majority of it in 2020, Fields said. Trump said during the presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on imported Ford vehicles. Trump also accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the United States and vowed to build a border wall to combat illegal immigration. Since winning the Nov. 8 election, Trump has targeted a wide range of American companies also including United Technologies Inc , Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp . Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. Trump previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Fields said there were no negotiations between Ford and the incoming president over canceling the Mexico plant or investing in Michigan.

Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020. GM said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, about 185,500, were built at its Lordstown, Ohio plant. About 4,500 hatchback Cruze versions were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States.

Following months of criticism from Trump for its investments in Mexico, Ford said it was spiking a plan to build a new $1.6 billion plant in San Luis Potosi, and would instead invest $700 million over the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan to build electric and self-driving vehicles. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the second-biggest US automaker was hopeful Trump’s policies will boost the US manufacturing environment. “It’s literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that he has been outlining and that’s why we’re making this decision to invest here in the US and our plant here in Michigan,” Fields told CNN. Earlier, GM became the latest multinational to end up in Trump’s line of fire — via Twitter as usual — with the president-elect threatening to impose and tariff on GM’s imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze cars to the US. Trump took to Twitter again to crow about the Ford reversal. He posted a Fox News story with Ford’s logo touting the announcement. In a second Twitter message, Trump said: Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world’s great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.” Ford said Tuesday’s moves would result in the additional of 700 new US jobs during the next four years. Ford said it would continue to develop its next generation Ford Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. “This will make way for two new iconic products at Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where Focus is manufactured today — safeguarding approximately 3,500 US jobs,” Ford said. The moves signal the president-elect, who has blamed international trade agreements for killing millions of US jobs, likely will loom large over next week’s Detroit auto show, when the US industry’s biggest executives gather to show off their new models. – Trade war coming? – Meanwhile, GM responded to Trump’s Twitter attack with a statement emphasizing that the vast majority of its Cruze cars sold in the US are made in Ohio, with just a small percentage imported from a plant across the southern border. “All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio,” the auto giant said. “GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US.” Of 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the US, only 4,500 were hatchbacks made in Mexico, said a GM spokesman. What is clear is that automakers and other multinationals are leery of Trump’s tough talk on trade and his willingness to single out individual companies by name if they fail to toe the line: Carrier, Boeing and Lockheed have all be the subject of Twitter attacks in recent weeks. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to impose a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and he has also pledged to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Trump charged that NAFTA and other trade agreements were responsible for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. NAFTA permits cars to be sold duty-free within the US, Canada and Mexico if they are at 65 percent made in the bloc. Earlier Tuesday Trump announced his nomination of protectionist lawyer Robert Lighthizer to serve as US trade representative, saying he “will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity.” Lighthizer served as deputy US trade representative when Ronald Reagan was president in the 1980s, when the focus was on attacking Japan for its huge exports into the US market. Lighthizer said in the statement: “I am fully committed to President-elect Trump’s mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans.” Leading business lobbies such as the Business Roundtable have cautioned other governments could retaliate against the US for tariffs, threatening key markets for US companies. “Any significant tariff increase within the North American region would impact the auto industry greatly and that just really makes the industry … much less competitive,” said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. Automakers are also worried about trade war with China. Shanghai authorities last month fined the Chinese unit of General Motors nearly $29 million over alleged monopolistic pricing behavior. The penalty comes in the midst of a war of words between Trump and Chinese media, after the billionaire Republican businessman suggested he may reject the One China policy unless Beijing makes concessions on trade and other matters.

Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move "a vote of confidence" in Trump, but primarily a response to a decline in North American demand for small cars like those that would have been made at the Mexican plant.

The S&P 500 SPX, +0.18% also finished off its best levels, adding 19 points, or 0.9%, to end at 2,257.83. The index had been up as much as 25 points in early morning action. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  climbed 45.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at 5,429.08. “Stocks started with a bit of a rally as the market tried to make up for some of the losses from last week,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. However, the strong start out of the gate soon fizzled as oil turned weak. Crude futures CLG7, +0.40%  fell more than 2% after jumping as much as 2.6% as a deal by OPEC to limit output went into effect. The choppy action was the latest reminder of how the market has struggled in recent sessions with the Dow unable to break above 20,000, a key psychological milestone that some analysts see as a resistance level for the market. “Once you get closer to 20,000, historically it’s been hard to get through on the first pass,” said Kepner. Still, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion’s share of the market’s postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth. That thesis is still viewed as intact, although the size and speed of the recent rally could lead investors to take profits. “There are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump’s policies don’t come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising,” said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was “fairly optimistic” about U.S. stocks. Read: Stock-market bulls wary of new-year hangover In addition to Trump’s policies, investors will be monitoring the president-elect’s Twitter feed, which he has used to take shots at specific companies. On Tuesday, he criticized General Motors Co. GM, -0.45% in a tweet, writing that the company “is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” While the stock fell in premarket trading, it subsequently turned higher, rising 0.9%. The tweet followed similar statements against Boeing Co. BA, +0.34%  and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +0.76%   “Trump is making it both easy and difficult for stock pickers,” said Andersen. “We’re getting surgical precision when it comes to commentary on specific companies, but we’re still getting our sea legs with how to interpret this data. It could be more symbolic than concrete in its meaning, but we don’t know. We’re in a steep learning curve with him.” In other company news, Xerox Corp. XRX, +1.59%  jumped 20% after Credit Suisse upgraded the company to “outperform.” What Trump's North Korea tweets mean(1:36) U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter again to plant a foreign-policy flag—this time on North Korea.

Economic news: In the latest economic data, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index climbed to 54.7% in December from 53.2%. The reading was higher than expected, and the highest level in two years. Separately, a read on construction spending rose 0.9% in November, above expectations and the sixth increase of the past seven months.

REUTERS/Rebecca Cook Ford Motor Co. assembly workers listen during a news conference as Ford president and CEO Mark Fields makes a major announcement at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, U.S. January 3, 2017. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A FLAT ROCK, Mich./WASHINGTON: Ford Motor Co said Tuesday it will cancel a planned US$1.6 billion factory in Mexico and invest US$700 million at a Michigan factory, after President-elect Donald Trump had harshly criticized the Mexico investment plan. The second largest U.S. automaker said it would build new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles at the Flat Rock, Michigan plant and add 700 jobs. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the decision to cancel the new Mexico factory was the result of sagging demand for small cars in North America and not because Trump was elected president. He told Fox Business that the automaker would have made the same decision even if Trump had not been elected. "There was no quid pro quo because there was no negotiation" with Trump over the decision to cancel the plant, Fields said. Fields told reporters the decision related to the need to "fully utilize capacity at existing facilities" amid declining sales of small and medium sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion. Fields also endorsed "pro growth" tax and regulatory policies advocated by Trump and the Republican-led Congress. "This is a vote of confidence for President-Elect Trump and some of the policies he may be pursuing," Fields said. Trump repeatedly said during the election campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico, which he called an "absolute disgrace" and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on imported Ford vehicles. Ford executive chairman Bill Ford Jr. told reporters he spoke with Trump to notify him of the decision. The company said the decision was influenced by Trump's policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations but that there were no negotiations over the decision announced on Tuesday. By contrast, Trump's team held talks with United Technologies Corp in November before the company agreed to keep about 800 jobs at its Carrier air conditioning unit in Indiana out of 2,100 set to go to Mexico. Trump has also held high profile meetings with the chief executives of Boeing and Lockheed Martin to talk about the cost of military contracts. Also on Tuesday, Trump threatened to impose a "big border tax" on General Motors Co for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico. The New York businessman, who has vowed to bring back American jobs that have been outsourced overseas and be tough on illegal immigration from Mexico, takes office on Jan. 20. Fields said Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile driving range at the Michigan plant by 2020 - taking on companies like Tesla Motors Inc , Volkswagen AG and GM - and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford also plans new hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck, Mustang and police vehicles by 2020 as the auto industry faces rising fuel efficiency mandates. Ford will add 700 jobs at the Flat Rock plant, Fields said, to cheers from union workers gathered at the factory for the announcement. TRUMP PREDICTION Ford in April announced it would invest US$1.6 billion in the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to build small cars. The company said it will shift production from Michigan of its Focus to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. When Trump announced his campaign in June, 2015, he said Ford would cancel its planned Mexico investments. "They’ll say,‘Mr. President we’ve decided to move the plant back to the United States — we’re not going to build it in Mexico.’ That’s it. They have no choice," Trump said. Trump tweeted a link on Tuesday to a story about the decision. Ford shares rose 3.3 percent to US$12.54, up US$0.41 a share, while the Mexican peso fell on Tuesday to touch its weakest level in seven weeks. Ford said it will add two new unnamed products at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where the Focus is manufactured today.

The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatch. BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: January 3, 2017 1:02 pm Follow @ATownPolitics DETROIT | In another tweet targeting a U.S. company, President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to slap a tax on General Motors for importing compact cars to the U.S. from Mexico. But GM makes the vast majority of compact Chevrolet Cruzes at a sprawling complex in Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland.

In another tweet targeting GM, President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to slap a tax on the U.S. automaker for importing compact cars to the U.S. from Mexico. But GM makes the vast majority of compact Chevrolet Cruzes at a sprawling factory complex in Lordstown, Ohio, near Cleveland. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File) Trump tweeted early Tuesday that GM is sending Mexican-made Cruzes to the U.S. tax-free. He told GM to make the cars in the U.S. “or pay big border tax!” GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it sold only about 4,500 of them in the U.S. last year, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. The company sold about 172,000 Cruzes through November. The hatchback, which went on sale in the U.S. in the fall, is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. GM shares fell by about 1 percent in premarket trading immediately after the tweet, but bounced into positive territory after the market opened Tuesday. Cruze hatchback production amounts to less than a day of output at the Lordstown plant, said Glenn Johnson, president of a United Auto Workers union local at the factory. The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. “It makes for news, that’s all,” Johnson said of Trump’s tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatch. GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the compact car, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the U.S. are now made in Ohio, he said. The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax companies that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the U.S. under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last year Trump went after Ford for plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the Detroit-area factory that now makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant is to get a new small pickup truck and SUV. Ford’s CEO says the company will not change the plans. Trump’s targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy’s have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Last year Trump touted a deal to keep 800 jobs at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis from going to Mexico. He has promised to lower corporate tax rates to preserve factory jobs inside the United States, while threatening harsh penalties for companies that produce goods overseas to save on labor costs. On Twitter, Trump warned that he will impose a 35 percent tariff on the goods imported by companies that outsource production. In November, GM said it would lay off about 1,250 workers at the Lordstown plant due to sagging demand for cars as U.S. buyers take advantage of low gasoline prices to buy trucks and SUVs. The workers on the third shift at Lordstown will go in indefinite layoff starting Jan. 23, although some may move to other GM factories. Sales of the Cruze were down more than 18 percent through November. Shifting demand from cars to trucks and SUVS is forcing General Motors to lay off more than 2,000 workers. Last month, 61.5 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales were trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp., and analysts say there’s no sign that will change anytime soon.

BOUDETTE / THE NEW YORK TIMES Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Ford Motor said Tuesday that it was canceling plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and would instead invest $700 million to increase production in Michigan. Ford had come under heavy criticism from Donald Trump during the election campaign for plans to expand production in Mexico. But at a news conference on Tuesday, Ford’s chief executive, Mark Fields, said the company was optimistic that Trump and the new Republican-controlled Congress would pursue growth policies that will strengthen U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing. Fields said that confidence, and a desire to maximize use of existing plants, had prompted the decision to expand a factory in Flat Rock, Michigan, for electric and hybrid vehicles. The announcement bought cheers from the hundreds of workers in the audience at the news conference, held at the Flat Rock plant. “I don’t know if you can really understand the impact of this investment,” said Jimmy Settles, a vice president of the United Auto Workers union, who represents Ford workers and spoke after Fields. “This is the equivalent to a new assembly plant.” Fields said Ford planned to use the Flat Rock plant to produce gas-electric hybrid versions of its F-150 pickup truck and the Mustang sports car, as well as a new battery-powered sport utility vehicle. The plant also makes the standard Ford Mustang and the Lincoln Continental. The Mexican plant was to be in San Luis Potosí and would produce small cars. Ford will still move production of its Focus compact to Mexico. The company said it would make that car at an existing plant in Hermosillo. The Focus is currently made in Wayne, Michigan. “We are encouraged by the pro-growth policies that President-elect Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue,” Fields said. “And we believe that these tax and regulatory reforms are critically important to boost U.S. competitiveness, and, of course, drive a resurgence in American manufacturing and high-tech innovation.” Trump’s vows to protect manufacturing jobs, and his portrayal of the North American Free Trade Agreement as a job-killer in the United States, helped him win the support of working-class voters, including many factory workers in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky. Ford’s unexpected news came hours after Trump turned his sights on General Motors. In a Twitter post Tuesday morning, Trump suggested GM should pay a tax for producing certain versions of a Chevrolet compact car at a plant in Mexico. “General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,” Trump wrote. “Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” GM makes most Cruzes at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, but last summer it disclosed plans to produce a hatchback version at a factory in Ramos Arizpe, about 100 miles south of the Texas border. In a statement, the company said it exported most of the Cruze hatchbacks from Mexico to “global markets” and ships “a small number” to the United States. Until now, Trump has said little about GM, which is investing billions of dollars to expand production in Mexico. He named GM’s chief executive, Mary Barra, to an economic policy board that is supposed to advise him on the economy after he takes office. The attack on GM is the latest by Trump on a big U.S. corporation. In recent weeks, he has criticized Boeing over the cost of a new Air Force One and did the same to Lockheed Martin about the cost of developing a new F-35 fighter jet. During the campaign, he railed against Carrier and its decision to close a plant in Indianapolis and open one in Mexico. Carrier recently agreed to keep about 850 jobs in Indianapolis, although it is still moving about 1,000 to Mexico. Trump also slammed Ford for its plan to shift small-car production to Mexico, while using U.S. plants to produce larger vehicles like pickup trucks and SUVs. Ford officials have said the change will not result in a loss of jobs at U.S. plants. After the election, Ford’s chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., told Trump in a phone call that the company had decided to cancel plans to move production of a small Lincoln SUV to Mexico from Kentucky. Trump then erroneously said on Twitter that Ford had decided not to move a “Lincoln plant” to Mexico from Kentucky.

Ford Motors executives say they are 'hopeful' President-elect Trump's policies match his words on US manufacturing. Following months of criticism from Trump for its investments in Mexico, Ford said it was spiking a plan to build a new $1.6 billion plant in San Luis Potosi, and would instead invest $700 million over the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan to build electric and self-driving vehicles. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the second-biggest US automaker was hopeful Trump's policies will boost the US manufacturing environment. "It's literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that he has been outlining and that's why we're making this decision to invest here in the US and our plant here in Michigan," Fields told CNN. Earlier, GM became the latest multinational to end up in Trump's line of fire -- via Twitter as usual -- with the president-elect threatening to impose and tariff on GM's imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze cars to the US. Trump took to Twitter again to crow about the Ford reversal. He posted a Fox News story with Ford's logo touting the announcement. In a second Twitter message, Trump said: Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION." Ford said Tuesday's moves would result in the additional of 700 new US jobs during the next four years. Ford said it would continue to develop its next generation Ford Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. "This will make way for two new iconic products at Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where Focus is manufactured today -- safeguarding approximately 3,500 US jobs," Ford said. The moves signal the president-elect, who has blamed international trade agreements for killing millions of US jobs, likely will loom large over next week's Detroit auto show, when the US industry's biggest executives gather to show off their new models. Meanwhile, GM responded to Trump's Twitter attack with a statement emphasizing that the vast majority of its Cruze cars sold in the US are made in Ohio, with just a small percentage imported from a plant across the southern border. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio," the auto giant said. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US." Of 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the US, only 4,500 were hatchbacks made in Mexico, said a GM spokesman. What is clear is that automakers and other multinationals are leery of Trump's tough talk on trade and his willingness to single out individual companies by name if they fail to toe the line: Carrier, Boeing and Lockheed have all be the subject of Twitter attacks in recent weeks. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to impose a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and he has also pledged to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Trump charged that NAFTA and other trade agreements were responsible for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. NAFTA permits cars to be sold duty-free within the US, Canada and Mexico if they are at 65 percent made in the bloc. Earlier Tuesday Trump announced his nomination of protectionist lawyer Robert Lighthizer to serve as US trade representative, saying he "will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity." Lighthizer served as deputy US trade representative when Ronald Reagan was president in the 1980s, when the focus was on attacking Japan for its huge exports into the US market. Lighthizer said in the statement: "I am fully committed to President-elect Trump's mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans." Leading business lobbies such as the Business Roundtable have cautioned other governments could retaliate against the US for tariffs, threatening key markets for US companies. "Any significant tariff increase within the North American region would impact the auto industry greatly and that just really makes the industry ... much less competitive," said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. Automakers are also worried about trade war with China. Shanghai authorities last month fined the Chinese unit of General Motors nearly $29 million over alleged monopolistic pricing behavior. The penalty comes in the midst of a war of words between Trump and Chinese media, after the billionaire Republican businessman suggested he may reject the One China policy unless Beijing makes concessions on trade and other matters.

The S&P 500 SPX, +0.18% also finished off its best levels, adding 19 points, or 0.9%, to end at 2,257.83. The index had been up as much as 25 points in early morning action. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  climbed 45.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at 5,429.08. “Stocks started with a bit of a rally as the market tried to make up for some of the losses from last week,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. However, the strong start out of the gate soon fizzled as oil turned weak. Crude futures CLG7, +0.40%  fell more than 2% after jumping as much as 2.6% as a deal by OPEC to limit output went into effect. The choppy action was the latest reminder of how the market has struggled in recent sessions with the Dow unable to break above 20,000, a key psychological milestone that some analysts see as a resistance level for the market. “Once you get closer to 20,000, historically it’s been hard to get through on the first pass,” said Kepner. Still, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion’s share of the market’s postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth. That thesis is still viewed as intact, although the size and speed of the recent rally could lead investors to take profits. “There are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump’s policies don’t come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising,” said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was “fairly optimistic” about U.S. stocks.

On Tuesday, he criticized General Motors Co. GM, -0.45% in a tweet, writing that the company “is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” While the stock fell in premarket trading, it subsequently turned higher, rising 0.9%. The tweet followed similar statements against Boeing Co. BA, +0.34%  and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +0.76%   “Trump is making it both easy and difficult for stock pickers,” said Andersen. “We’re getting surgical precision when it comes to commentary on specific companies, but we’re still getting our sea legs with how to interpret this data. It could be more symbolic than concrete in its meaning, but we don’t know. We’re in a steep learning curve with him.” In other company news, Xerox Corp.

The reading was higher than expected, and the highest level in two years. Separately, a read on construction spending rose 0.9% in November, above expectations and the sixth increase of the past seven months.

Trump, who won the presidency in part with tough talk on trade, has shown his willingness to single out individual companies by name if they displease him, and Ford seems to be the latest to fall in line. Also on Tuesday, Trump nominated Reagan-era protectionist lawyer Robert Lighthizer to serve as US trade representative, signaling he intends to make good on pledges to renegotiate trade deals he blames for killing millions of American jobs. Ford is adding 700 US jobs and investing $700 million during the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan ©Gabriel Bouys (AFP/File) The moves likely will loom large over next week's Detroit auto show, when the US industry's top executives gather to show off their new models. The president-elect, who has previously taken to Twitter to slam Boeing and Lockheed Martin, made GM his latest target in a breakfast-hour tweet threatening to impose tariff on imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze models into the US. - About-face at Ford - A couple of hours later, Ford announced it was scuttling plans for a new $1.6 billion factory in San Luis Potosi, and instead invest $700 million over the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan to build electric and self-driving vehicles. The Ford decision was an about-face after the second-biggest US automaker repeatedly rebuffed Trump's criticism over its plans for the Mexico plant during and after the presidential campaign. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the decision reflected the hope that Trump's policies will boost the US manufacturing environment. "It's literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that he has been outlining and that's why we're making this decision to invest here in the US and our plant here in Michigan," Fields told CNN. He said company chairman Bill Ford spoke Tuesday morning to Trump, and that he himself had spoken to Vice-President-elect Pence about the move, which Ford said would result in 700 new US jobs over four years. The new plant, announced in April, was expected to employ 2,800 by 2020. Mexico's government said it "regrets" Ford's decision, and that the company gave assurances it would repay "any expenditures made by the state government to facilitate this investment." - Another win for Trump? - Trump took to Twitter again to crow about the Ford reversal: "Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION." Ford's decision creates a "political headline win for Trump, Ford and the UAW," yet the diminished demand for small cars also makes it a positive decision in terms of business rationale, investment bank RBC Capital Markets said in a note. Meanwhile, GM responded to Trump's Twitter attack with a statement emphasizing that the vast majority of its Cruze cars sold in the US are made in Ohio, with just a small percentage imported from a plant across the southern border. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio," the auto giant said. Of 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the US, only 4,500 were hatchbacks made in Mexico, said a GM spokesman. - Trade war coming? - Tough talk on trade helped Trump win election, and on the campaign trail he threatened to impose a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico. He has also pledged to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, blaming NAFTA and other trade agreements for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. The appointment of Lighthizer as his top trade negotiator suggests Trump plans to follow through on that rhetoric. Lighthizer served as deputy US trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s, when the focus was on attacking Japan for its huge exports into the US market. But leading business lobbies such as the Business Roundtable have cautioned that US trading partners could retaliate against any new tariffs, threatening key US markets. "Any significant tariff increase within the North American region would impact the auto industry greatly and that just really makes the industry... much less competitive," said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. Automakers are also worried that Trump's tough rhetoric towards China could trigger a full-scale trade war if the Republican makes good on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Beijing. GM became the latest multinational to end up in the line of fire of US President-elect Donald Trump (L), seen December 31, 2016, threatening via Twitter to impose and tariff on GM's imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze cars to the US ©DON EMMERT (AFP/File) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

"This is a critically important program that has [had] its problems in the past," Cook said. "We are confident in the capabilities of the F-35." President-elect Donald Trump has been sharply critical of the costs of the F-35 program in recent tweets, and has stated that he has asked Boeing to price out an upgraded F-18 Super-Hornet jet that could replace the F-35 in critical roles for the US Navy. The program is now projected to cost $400 billion for 2,457 jets, making it nearly $200 billion over budget though estimates of the eventual total cost have run as high as $1.5 trillion. The aircraft has already had problems with its software, cannon, ejection seat, helmet and other key components. © Flickr/ Airman Magazine CEO Tells Trump Lockheed Martin Committed to Cut Cost of F-35 ProgramHowever, Cook said the F-35 jet remained crucial to future US air power and to the security of allied nations that were also buying the aircraft. "This is an aircraft that the services are counting on not just the US but other countries as well," he added. Israel received its first two F-35 jets on Monday. ...

Mr Trump had used Ford as a whipping boy during his presidential campaign, suggesting that it was moving manufacturing jobs to Mexico which should have been for US workers and vowed to slap a 35pc tariff on Ford vehicles made in Mexico but sold in the US. He has repeatedly called for a rework of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said that building the Michigan plant in the US was a “vote of confidence” in the US economy. The company had previously fought back against Trump’s rhetoric, saying it did not plan to cut any US jobs. Ford Motor Company president and chief executive Mark Fields pictured at Tuesday's press conference Credit: REBECCA COOK Instead of now building its Focus model in Mexico, it will build it in the US, creating an estimated 700 jobs, although the company denied that Mr Trump had influenced its decision. “Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation,” Mr Trump tweeted following the news. The motor giant's announcement came shortly after the president elect hit out at General Motors via Twitter, suggesting it was sending its “Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers tax free across border [sic]”. He went on to say that the company, which makes Chevrolet, Cadillac and Vauxhall cars, should “make in USA or pay big border tax”. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 General Motors released a statement following Mr Trump’s tweet, which said its Chevrolet Cruze sedan model is manufactured in Lordstown, Ohio. It added that the hatchback model is built in Mexico for global markets, including a “small number” sold in the US. A Ford Focus on an assembly line at the company's existing assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan Credit:  SAUL LOEB The saga is the latest in a line of trade deals being played out in the public arena since Mr Trump was elected president of the United States in November. In recent weeks Mr Trump has also called for the scrapping of multi-billion dollar plans for Boeing to build a new Air Force One, calling the costs "ridiculous and totally out of control", and threatened to cancel the F-35 jetfighter program with Lockheed Martin. He also slammed agricultural machinery manufacturer Rexnord for moving its Indiana jobs to Mexico, with the loss of 300 jobs. “This is happening all over our country,” Mr Trump said on Twitter on December 2. Other companies in Mr Trump’s crosshairs include Amazon, which he accused of not paying “fair taxes”, T Mobile, whose service was “terrible”, he said, and department store Macy, whose stock is in “total free fall”.   Mr Trump named steel industry lawyer Robert Lighthizer as his US trade representative on Tuesday. Mr Lighthizer, an experienced trade official, served as the deputy US trade representative under Ronald Reagan where he played a part in developing US trade policy. He is a hard critic of China’s trade practices, suggesting that the country has failed to live up to commitments made in 2001 when it joined the World Trade Organization and that more aggressive tactics are needed to "force change in the system", even if it means deviating from WTO rules. Mr Lighthizer will be responsible for better deals aimed at reducing US trade deficits.

Finance Search Ford scuttles Mexico plant as Trump targets GMAFP – Tue, Jan 3, 2017 7:30 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo Ford is adding 700 US jobs and investing $700 million during the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan Ford scuttled a plan to build a new factory in Mexico Tuesday following criticism from Donald Trump, and just hours after the president-elect attacked General Motors for importing Mexican-made cars into the US. Following months of criticism from Trump for its investments in Mexico, Ford said it was spiking a plan to build a new $1.6 billion plant in San Luis Potosi, and would instead invest $700 million over the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan to build electric and self-driving vehicles. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the second-biggest US automaker was hopeful Trump's policies will boost the US manufacturing environment. "It's literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that he has been outlining and that's why we're making this decision to invest here in the US and our plant here in Michigan," Fields told CNN. Earlier, GM became the latest multinational to end up in Trump's line of fire -- via Twitter as usual -- with the president-elect threatening to impose and tariff on GM's imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze cars to the US. Trump took to Twitter again to crow about the Ford reversal. He posted a Fox News story with Ford's logo touting the announcement. In a second Twitter message, Trump said: Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION." Ford said Tuesday's moves would result in the additional of 700 new US jobs during the next four years. Ford said it would continue to develop its next generation Ford Focus at an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. "This will make way for two new iconic products at Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan, where Focus is manufactured today -- safeguarding approximately 3,500 US jobs," Ford said. The moves signal the president-elect, who has blamed international trade agreements for killing millions of US jobs, likely will loom large over next week's Detroit auto show, when the US industry's biggest executives gather to show off their new models. - Trade war coming? - Meanwhile, GM responded to Trump's Twitter attack with a statement emphasizing that the vast majority of its Cruze cars sold in the US are made in Ohio, with just a small percentage imported from a plant across the southern border. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio," the auto giant said. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US." Of 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the US, only 4,500 were hatchbacks made in Mexico, said a GM spokesman. What is clear is that automakers and other multinationals are leery of Trump's tough talk on trade and his willingness to single out individual companies by name if they fail to toe the line: Carrier, Boeing and Lockheed have all be the subject of Twitter attacks in recent weeks. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to impose a 35 percent import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and he has also pledged to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Trump charged that NAFTA and other trade agreements were responsible for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. NAFTA permits cars to be sold duty-free within the US, Canada and Mexico if they are at 65 percent made in the bloc. Earlier Tuesday Trump announced his nomination of protectionist lawyer Robert Lighthizer to serve as US trade representative, saying he "will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity." Lighthizer served as deputy US trade representative when Ronald Reagan was president in the 1980s, when the focus was on attacking Japan for its huge exports into the US market. Lighthizer said in the statement: "I am fully committed to President-elect Trump's mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies which will benefit all Americans." Leading business lobbies such as the Business Roundtable have cautioned other governments could retaliate against the US for tariffs, threatening key markets for US companies. "Any significant tariff increase within the North American region would impact the auto industry greatly and that just really makes the industry ... much less competitive," said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. Automakers are also worried about trade war with China. Shanghai authorities last month fined the Chinese unit of General Motors nearly $29 million over alleged monopolistic pricing behavior. The penalty comes in the midst of a war of words between Trump and Chinese media, after the billionaire Republican businessman suggested he may reject the One China policy unless Beijing makes concessions on trade and other matters.

By Tom Hoban HBJ Columnist For only the second time since 1928, Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress. Like the first two years of President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama’s terms under friendly Democrat control, legislation has a chance of passing that might not in other circumstances. Many in commercial real estate are cautiously optimistic about the future as early signals from President-elect Trump indicate his interest in repatriating overseas capital, increasing infrastructure investment and creating a culture of regulatory changes designed to get banks back into the game of lending to small- and medium-sized businesses. Of the anticipated changes, repealing or modifying Dodd-Frank Act as well as temporary tax incentives that might repatriate the estimated $1.3 trillion in corporate funds sitting in overseas accounts might be the two most important to ordinary Americans and commercial real estate investors alike. Dodd-Frank is the regulatory act that came behind the bank failures during the recession. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, sums up the effect of Dodd-Frank today by noting that it accomplished it’s primary objective in making banks safer, “but we aren’t making enough loans.” Banks need to get back into the business they’re designed for and repealing or modifying Dodd-Frank would be a good step. Pair that with repatriation of overseas capital would be another good step. In the Pacific Northwest, there is already anticipation by most economists that we can expect net in-migration for the foreseeable future, which supports growth. Our challenges in the Puget Sound area, specifically, are around reacting to growth wisely, which is why President-elect Trump’s pairing of repatriation of overseas corporate cash with infrastructure spending is important. The Puget Sound region needs more roads and affordable housing. Another viable north-south corridor to serve the eastern part of Snohomish, King and Pierce counties — along with the expansion of light rail — needs to be planned soon. Otherwise,we’ll lose the chance to keep great jobs here because we’ve created long commutes and expensive housing that drives business away. What we should begin to worry about is Boeing. President-elect Trump didn’t need Washington state to win and even our sitting Republican members of the house (both of our Senators are Democrats) were on the fence in their support from what was dubbed a Ted Cruz state going into the Republican Convention this summer. Most of the country’s governors and over half of the state houses are in Republican hands. So we lack any real political muscle in Washington, D.C., at the moment if other states want to plant the seeds for a Boeing expansion in their backyard the way seeds were sown before Washington lost the second 787 plant to South Carolina in 2008. In the meantime, every category of commercial real estate today in the Puget Sound is experiencing some degree of good health, with the exception of office buildings in the urban areas of downtown Everett and parts of Tacoma. Even these, though, are on the come-back now. Everett, in particular, stands to see a surge in demand if and when Paine Field opens up commercial passenger service. A Trump presidency that simultaneously repatriates corporate cash and invests in infrastructure could only help. Tom Hoban is CEO of The Coast Group of Companies.

Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter Compartir U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump - Photo: Reuters 03/01/2017 12:03 Reuters -A +A President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose a "big border tax" on General Motors Co for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico, an arrangement the largest U.S. automaker defended as part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell them in the United States. Trump's comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on Jan. 20, signaling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming U.S. president into corporate affairs. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Trump's tweet came hours before GM's rival Ford Motor Co announced it would cancel a planned US$1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest US$700 million at a Michigan factory, after it also came under criticism from the Republican president-elect for its Mexican investment plans. Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., said he personally notified Trump of the decision, but after Trump's early-morning GM tweet. GM, the world's No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to US$35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump's tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM's rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors. But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind," Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest US$350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the US$5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit's Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM's U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November. GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs.   Compartir TAGS General Motors, Chevrolet Cruze, Ford, donald trump, tax, twitter Comentarios MÁS EN English Ir a la sección de English Ostrich gets loose in Tamaulipas NBA: League eyes growth in Mexico, looks at possible franchise Subway station opens Wrestling Museum in Mexico City NOTICIAS DEL DÍA Ir a la portada Avalan solicitud de 8 candidatos independientes en Edomex Aprueban a 36 aspirantes a independientes en Coahuila Policías recorren con vecinos delegación Álvaro Obregón Resuelven problemas de movilidad, seguridad, balizamiento y semaforización VIVEUSA La provocativa foto de Selena que desató polémica Filtran informe de “actos sexuales perversos” de Trump ¿Por qué Paris Hilton no recibirá herencia de su familia?   Directorio Contáctanos Código de Ética Cómo cubrimos la Violencia Publicidad Aviso Legal Aviso Privacidad Mapa del Sitio Historia Aviso de Privacidad: EL UNIVERSAL, COMPAÑÍA PERIODÍSTICA NACIONAL, S.A.

On a separate note, Ford announced Tuesday it is cancelling plans to build a US$1.6 billion plant in Mexico and instead will boost US production of electric vehicles. “Ford today announced it is cancelling plans for the new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico,” the company said in a statement. At the same time, Ford is adding 700 US jobs and investing $700 million during the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan so that it can build self-driving and electric vehicles.

Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. His latest comments come as a congressional Republican tax proposal meant to boost US manufacturing faces mounting pressure from industries that rely heavily on imported goods or parts. Last month, 81 industry groups including several automaker groups rejected the proposal, known as “border adjustability.” The policy would help manufacturers by exempting export revenues from corporate taxes. But it would tax imports, hitting import-dependent industries. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there.

Ford's move came as the incoming President warned motor rivals General Motors Co (GM) that it faced hefty border taxes if it decided to manufacture some of its vehicles in Mexico.

"General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers – tax free across border,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “Make in USA or pay big border tax!" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Every Chevrolet Cruze sedan is built in Ohio and most of GM’s Mexican-made hatchbacks are “exported to global markets,” GM spokesman Tony Cervone told Bloomberg. Cervone declined to comment on whether the company planned to talk to Trump, although GM CEO Mary Barra is among the panel of business leaders giving the president-elect strategic advice on the economy after he takes office. The Detroit-based company had announced it planned to lay off 2,000 employees at two US auto plants, including one in Lordstown, Ohio, where it builds the compact Chevrolet Cruze, due to weak demand for small cars. Ohio Democrats weighed in on the Trump tweet over the Cruze sedan. .@realDonaldTrump The Republican Congress is merely following your lead on ethics. And BTW -- the Chevy Cruze is made in Lordstown, Ohio. pic.twitter.com/uD4Y99AvSW— Ohio Dems (@OHDems) January 3, 2017 A trend among Detroit’s automakers is to have smaller cars manufactured in Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and have higher-paid American workers build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. General Motors was one of the US corporations helped by government bailouts during the Obama administration following the financial crisis in 2008. The company was able to reorganize after filing for bankruptcy in 2009, with the US Treasury investing $49.5 billion in the company through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). GM has reported annual profits since 2010, and the Treasury recovered $39 billion when the company sold shares in December 2013.

In November, Trump tweeted that he talked to Chairman Bill Ford and got the automaker to commit to keeping production of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle in century instead of Mexico, and indicated he saved the plant. As it turned out, the plant makes Ford Escape SUVs and was not scheduled to close. #Ford small cars production moving out of US to Mexico https://t.co/hzg1QST7m2pic.twitter.com/VzUVI7mdun— RT America (@RT_America) November 16, 2016 On Tuesday, Ford announced it was canceling plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico and would be investing $700 million in Michigan instead. The move is a “vote of confidence” in Trump’s pledge to create a pro-business environment, Ford CEO Mark Fields told CNN, but added that it wasn’t the result of a special deal with the president-elect. “We didn’t cut a deal with Trump,” said Fields. “We did it for our business.” The deal won’t affect US jobs because the automaker will be putting new vehicles in the Michigan plants as part of a $700 million investment for more electric and self-driving cars. The automaker said it plans to build a self-driving car by 2021.

REUTERS/Rebecca Cook U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump arrive for a New Year's Eve celebration with members and guests at the Mar-a-lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. December 31, 2016. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A DETROIT/WASHINGTON: President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose a "big border tax" on General Motors Co for making some of its Chevrolet Cruze compact cars in Mexico, an arrangement the largest U.S. automaker defended as part of its strategy to serve global customers, not sell them in the United States. Trump's comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on Jan. 20, signaling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming U.S. president into corporate affairs. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Trump's tweet came hours before GM's rival Ford Motor Co announced it would cancel a planned US$1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest US$700 million at a Michigan factory, after it also came under criticism from the Republican president-elect for its Mexican investment plans. Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., said he personally notified Trump of the decision, but after Trump's early-morning GM tweet. GM, the world's No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." it said in a statement posed on its website. The Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to US$35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump's tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM's rival Ford Motor Co , United Technologies Inc , Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp . Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors. But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind," Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest US$350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the US$5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico. Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit's Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM's U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November. GM will halt the third shift at the Lordstown plant on Jan. 23, cutting 1,250 jobs.

But GM makes the vast majority of compact Chevrolet Cruzes at a sprawling complex in Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland. Trump tweeted early Tuesday that GM is sending Mexican-made Cruzes to the U.S. tax-free. He told GM to make the cars in the U.S. “or pay big border tax!” GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it sold only about 4,500 of them in the U.S. last year, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. The company sold about 172,000 Cruzes through November. The hatchback, which went on sale in the U.S. in the fall, is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. GM shares fell by about 1 percent in premarket trading immediately after the tweet, but bounced into positive territory after the market opened Tuesday. Cruze hatchback production amounts to less than a day of output at the Lordstown plant, said Glenn Johnson, president of a United Auto Workers union local at the factory. The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. “It makes for news, that’s all,” Johnson said of Trump’s tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatch. GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the compact car, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the U.S. are now made in Ohio, he said. The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax companies that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the U.S. under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last year Trump went after Ford for plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the Detroit-area factory that now makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant is to get a new small pickup truck and SUV. Ford’s CEO says the company will not change the plans. Ford cancels plan to build new Mexican plant, adds US jobs Trump’s targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy’s have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Last year Trump touted a deal to keep 800 jobs at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis from going to Mexico. He has promised to lower corporate tax rates to preserve factory jobs inside the United States, while threatening harsh penalties for companies that produce goods overseas to save on labor costs. On Twitter, Trump warned that he will impose a 35 percent tariff on the goods imported by companies that outsource production. In November, GM said it would lay off about 1,250 workers at the Lordstown plant due to sagging demand for cars as U.S. buyers take advantage of low gasoline prices to buy trucks and SUVs. The workers on the third shift at Lordstown will go in indefinite layoff starting Jan. 23, although some may move to other GM factories. Sales of the Cruze were down more than 18 percent through November. Shifting demand from cars to trucks and SUVS is forcing General Motors to lay off more than 2,000 workers. Last month, 61.5 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales were trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp., and analysts say there’s no sign that will change anytime soon.

Schoen | @johnwschoen Tuesday, 3 Jan 2017 | 11:56 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump's threats to selectively penalize U.S. manufacturers for moving production offshore may be difficult to enforce. But for companies that depend on the U.S. government for a big chunk of revenues, his Twitter rants are hard to ignore. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter on Tuesday. Trump tweet In response, GM said it makes its Cruze sedan in the United States and that all of those sold in the United States are made in a plant in Lordstown, Ohio. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." the company said in a statement. GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it sold only about 4,500 of them in the U.S. last year, spokesman Patrick Morrissey told The Associated Press. The company sold about 172,000 Cruzes through November. The hatchback, which went on sale in the U.S. in the fall, is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. The Trump tweet was another in a series of threats to slap a tax on companies that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the U.S. under the North American Free Trade Agreement. show chapters Cramer: Trump will lose NAFTA battle    Tuesday, 3 Jan 2017 | 9:14 AM ET | 03:45 Last year, Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence engineered a deal to keep 800 jobs at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis from going to Mexico. Trump has also taken Ford to task for plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico, even though the Detroit-area factory that now makes Focuses will continue to make pickups and SUVs. On Tuesday, Ford announced that it will cancel production of a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Flat Rock, Michigan. Trump's other targets have included Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy's. It remains to be seen whether Trump can selectively penalize individual companies with higher taxes. As part of a broader corporate tax reform, he has also proposed tax penalties for companies that move production offshore. Such a move would face opposition from many industries. Regardless of how his new administration makes good on those threats, companies that rely heavily on federal contracts will remain leery of getting off on the wrong foot with the new administration. In the 2015 fiscal year, for example, General Motors generated more than $236 million in sales to the federal government, according to the General Service Administration. That's just a small fraction of the company's $152 billion in 2015 global revenues. But it's a big enough chunk of business to help ensure that Trump has the company's attention. GM isn't even on the list of top 100 federal contractors, according to GSA data. Those companies are even more likely to follow Trump closely on Twitter. While thousands of companies from dozens of industries do business with the federal government every year, the biggest contracts go to defense and health-care companies. John W.

X Donald Trump attacks GM over Chevy Cruze production in Mexico Threat of ‘big border tax’ comes as Ford cancels plans for $1.6bn Mexico plant and adds jobs in Michigan Tue, Jan 3, 2017, 16:00 Updated: Tue, Jan 3, 2017, 17:04 GM chief executive Mary Barra: will be among business leaders giving Donald Trump advice on the economy. Photograph: Rebecca Cook/Reuters         US president-elect Donald Trump has criticised General Motors (GM) for building a version of the Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico, saying the largest US car maker should build the car at home or face a hefty tariff. His comments came as rival Ford said Tuesday it will cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and will invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after it had come under harsh criticism from Mr Trump for its Mexican investment plans. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border,” Mr Trump tweeted on Tuesday. “Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” GM said it made its Cruze sedan in the United States and that all of those sold in the US are made in a plant in Ohio. “GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US,” it said in a statement posed on its website without giving numbers. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit’s “Big Three” car makers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labour costs, while using higher-paid US workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned to lay off 2,000 employees at two US plants in early 2017, including the one in Ohio. US small car sales have been hit by lagging consumer demand and low fuel prices. GM’s US Cruze sales are down 18 per cent. Interventionist Mr Trump’s tweet is the latest example of interventionist behaviour toward US companies that have included Boeing, Lockheed Martin and United Technologies. Ford, the second largest US car manufacturer, said Tuesday it would build new electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles at its Michigan plant. ADVERTISEMENT Chief executive Mark Fields on Tuesday said the decision to cancel the new plant in Mexico was in part related to the need to “fully utilise capacity at existing facilities” amid declining sales of small and medium sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion. He also used the occasion to endorse “pro growth” tax and regulatory policies advocated by Trump and the Republican led Congress. Trump repeatedly said during the election campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open the new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on imported Ford vehicles. Ford chairman Bill Ford jnr said he spoke to Donald Trump Tuesday morning to tell him of the decision to invest in the US and cancel the Mexican plant. A Ford source said the decision was influenced by Trump’s policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations but there were no negotiations between Ford and the Republican over the decision to cancel the Mexico plant or invest in Michigan, the source said. Mr Fields said Ford will build a battery electric SUV with a 300-mile driving range at the Flat Rock, Michigan plant by 2020, and will launch production there by 2021 of a fully autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel or a brake pedal for use in ride services fleets. Ford will add 700 jobs at the Michigan plant in Flat Rock, Mr Fields said, to cheers from union workers gathered at the factory for the announcement. Ford in April announced it would invest $1.6 billion to build a new plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico to build small cars. The company said Wednesday it will shift production from Michigan of its Focus to an existing plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. The president-elect’s threats against Mexican-built vehicles have the potential to affect the nine global car makers, including Toyota Motor and Nissan that have announced more than $24 billion in Mexico investments since 2010. Volkswagen’s Audi, BMW and Daimler each build or plan to assemble luxury vehicles, engines or heavy trucks in the country. The Trump transition team has said GM chief executive Mary Barra will be among the panel of business leaders giving him strategic advice on the economy and job creation after he takes office. – Bloomberg / Reuters       Topics: Donald Trump Mary Barra Chevrolet Mexico Ohio Read More Employment in IDA-backed firms reaches record high German inflation expected to more than double in December Manufacturing shakes off Brexit as growth picks up A work in progress: Brexit explained in 11 questions Irish property prices to increase by at least 8% in 2017 More than 2,000 jobs saved by examinership in 2016 Survey shows German factory growth close to three-year high in December Chris Johns: Forecasts provide a buffer against inconvenient uncertainty Brexit fears to weigh heavily on Irish firms in 2017 Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor Retail & Services Irish retailers angry as State leaves them out in the cold Rugby Ulster unable to build on start as Exeter end European adventure Economy We could be looking at ‘hard Brexit’.

(The Associated Press) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press Follow on Twitter on January 03, 2017 at 7:36 AM, updated January 03, 2017 at 7:49 AM comments DETROIT -- In another tweet targeting a U.S. company, President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to slap a tax on General Motors for importing compact cars to the U.S. from Mexico. But GM makes the vast majority of compact Chevrolet Cruzes at a sprawling complex in Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland. Trump tweeted early Tuesday that GM is sending Mexican-made Cruzes to the U.S. tax-free. He told GM to make the cars in the U.S. "or pay big border tax!" GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it sold only about 4,500 of them in the U.S. last year, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. The company sold about 172,000 Cruzes through November. The hatchback, which went on sale in the U.S. in the fall, is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. GM shares fell by about 1 percent in premarket trading immediately after the tweet, but bounced into positive territory after the market opened Tuesday. Cruze hatchback production amounts to less than a day of output at the Lordstown plant, said Glenn Johnson, president of a United Auto Workers union local at the factory. The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. "It makes for news, that's all," Johnson said of Trump's tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatch. GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the compact car, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the U.S. are now made in Ohio, he said. The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax companies that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the U.S. under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last year Trump went after Ford for plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the Detroit-area factory that now makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant is to get a new small pickup truck and SUV. Ford's CEO says the company will not change the plans. Trump's targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy's have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Last year Trump touted a deal to keep 800 jobs at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis from going to Mexico. He has promised to lower corporate tax rates to preserve factory jobs inside the United States, while threatening harsh penalties for companies that produce goods overseas to save on labor costs. On Twitter, Trump warned that he will impose a 35 percent tariff on the goods imported by companies that outsource production. In November, GM said it would lay off about 1,250 workers at the Lordstown plant due to sagging demand for cars as U.S. buyers take advantage of low gasoline prices to buy trucks and SUVs. The workers on the third shift at Lordstown will go in indefinite layoff starting Jan. 23, although some may move to other GM factories. Sales of the Cruze were down more than 18 percent through November. Shifting demand from cars to trucks and SUVS is forcing General Motors to lay off more than 2,000 workers. Last month, 61.5 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales were trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp., and analysts say there's no sign that will change anytime soon. -The Associated Press Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. "It makes for news, that's all," Johnson said of Trump's tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatch. GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the compact car, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the U.S. are now made in Ohio, he said. What's ahead for the Dallas economy in 2017? Potential collisions at business, government intersection The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax companies that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the U.S. under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last year Trump went after Ford for plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the Detroit-area factory that now makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant is to get a new small pickup truck and SUV. Ford's CEO says the company will not change the plans. Trump's targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy's have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Last year Trump touted a deal to keep 800 jobs at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis from going to Mexico. He has promised to lower corporate tax rates to preserve factory jobs inside the United States, while threatening harsh penalties for companies that produce goods overseas to save on labor costs. On Twitter, Trump warned that he will impose a 35 percent tariff on the goods imported by companies that outsource production. In November, GM said it would lay off about 1,250 workers at the Lordstown plant due to sagging demand for cars as U.S. buyers take advantage of low gasoline prices to buy trucks and SUVs. The workers on the third shift at Lordstown will go in indefinite layoff starting Jan. 23, although some may move to other GM factories. Sales of the Cruze were down more than 18 percent through November. Shifting demand from cars to trucks and SUVS is forcing General Motors to lay off more than 2,000 workers. Last month, 61.5 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales were trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp., and analysts say there's no sign that will change anytime soon.

PA Images 15:27 3 Jan 2017 Newstalk 15:27 Tuesday 3 January 2017 Donald Trump has taken aim at US car giant General Motors in his latest clash with big business as he prepares to take office. The President-elect threatened to impose a "big border tax" on the company for making its Chevrolet Cruze model in Mexico. GM shares slipped 1% in pre-market trading after Mr Trump made the remarks in a tweet - though they later improved and turned 1% higher shortly after Wall Street opened. Mr Trump wrote: General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 GM becomes the latest US industrial giant to feel the brunt of Mr Trump's remarks ahead of his inauguration later this month. Mr Trump has previously taken aim at aerospace manufacturers Lockheed and Boeing over contracts with the US government he has claimed were too expensive. Mr Trump has been critical of car giant Ford in the past over its investments in Mexico. More broadly he has threatened to slap tariffs of 35% on imports of products made by companies that have moved production out of the US, and said he would tear up a major trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Last month he warned that firms shifting jobs away from America could be "making a very expensive mistake" and would face "retribution or consequence". Mr Trump has also pledged to lower the corporate tax rate and scale back regulations to create a better climate in the US for business. General Motors brands include the Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick as well as Germany's Opel and Britain's Vauxhall. GM said that it makes the sedan model of its Chevy Cruze in the US and that all of those sold in the US were made at a plant in Ohio. A hatchback version is made for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US, it said in a statement. 15:27 3 Jan 2017 Newstalk 15:27 Tuesday 3 January 2017 3 Related articles Trading with Trump: Changing how the US does business US Republicans call off plan to 'effectively destroy' ethics body Trump warns North Korea over intercontinental missile tests most popular latest sport The most expensive street in Ireland has been named "I was pissed off": Dublin club footballer fuming that GAA player-coach contract was leaked onto social media Senegal beat Tunisia 2-0 in the African Nations Cup Brendan Rodgers aiming to keep Celtic progressing in 2017 site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Akin Oyedele Business InsiderJanuary 3, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share President-elect Donald Trump sent out a tweet Tuesday morning threatening to tax General Motors for manufacturing abroad. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border," Trump tweeted. "Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" In a statement, however, GM said most Chevy Cruze vehicles sold in the US were manufactured in Ohio. It added that the company produced an international version of the Cruze, the model to which Trump was most likely referring, in Mexico and did sell some of those vehicles in the US. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US," GM said. Shares of the automaker slipped by about 1% in premarket trading after the tweet. Since his election, Trump has used Twitter to encourage several large companies to keep production and jobs in the US. Indiana said it would provide up to $7 million in tax incentives to the air-conditioner maker Carrier to persuade it to keep hundreds of jobs in Indiana that were originally planned to be sent to Mexico. Late last year, several of Trump's tweets about public companies moved the markets. He said the cost of Boeing's contract to develop a new Air Force One was "exorbitant," sending the company's shares lower. His tweet calling for the US to expand its nuclear capability until the "world comes to its senses regarding nukes" spiked a uranium exchange-traded fund. Trump also commented that the cost of the F-35 fighter-jet program was out of control, sending shares of Lockheed Martin down 4%. Trump said last month that he had sold all of his stocks in June.

DETROIT — In another tweet targeting a U.S. company, President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to slap a tax on General Motors for importing compact cars to the U.S. from Mexico. But GM makes the vast majority of compact Chevrolet Cruzes at a sprawling complex in Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland.

He told GM to make the cars in the U.S. “or pay big border tax!” GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it sold only about 4,500 of them in the U.S. last year, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. The company sold about 172,000 Cruzes through November. The hatchback, which went on sale in the U.S. in the fall, is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said.

Scott Gamm Jan 3, 2017 9:51 AM EST U.S. stocks rallied early Tuesday, the first trading session of 2017, building on last year's gains. President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter to slam General Motors (GM) for producing its Cruze model in Mexico. Trump reiterated the need for a "border tax" in order to keep manufacturing jobs in the U.S. General Motors responded saying only its Cruze hatchback vehicle, that is sold overseas, is made in Mexico. U.S.-sold Cruze models are made in Ohio. Last month, Trump tweeted about Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) . Oil prices rose to an 18-month high as production cuts between OPEC and non-OPEC members took effect. Brent crude eclipsed $58 a barrel. The cuts were agreed to in December. Twitter (TWTR) shares were in focus after its China head Kathy Chen stepped down after only eight months on the job. Twitter is blocked in China. This is the latest executive to leave Twitter.

"The Boss" is questioning whether President-elect Donald Trump is ready to take office. By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer DETROIT (AP) - In another tweet targeting a U.S. company, President-elect Donald Trump threatened Tuesday to slap a tax on General Motors for importing compact cars to the U.S. from Mexico. But GM imports only a small percentage of its Chevrolet Cruze small cars from Mexico, with the vast majority made at a sprawling factory complex in Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland. Trump tweeted early Tuesday that GM is sending Mexican-made Cruzes to the U.S. tax-free. He told GM to make the cars in the U.S. "or pay big border tax!" GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it sold only about 4,500 of them in the U.S. last year, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. The company sold about 172,000 Cruzes through November. The hatchback, which went on sale in the U.S. in the fall, is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. Cruze hatchback production amounts to less than a day of output at the Lordstown plant, said Glenn Johnson, president of a United Auto Workers union local at the factory. The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. "It makes for news, that's all," Johnson said of Trump's tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatchback model. Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said the GM tweet wasn't about just one company. "I think he generally made it very clear he wants to bring American jobs home. He doesn't want jobs to leave this country," he said. Immediately after the tweet, which was posted around 7:35 a.m., GM shares fell about 1 percent in premarket trading. But by early afternoon they had rebounded and were up 0.5 percent to $35.01. The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax companies that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the U.S. Trump's targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy's have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Last year Trump went after Ford Motor Co. for plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the Detroit-area factory that now makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant is to get a new small pickup truck and SUV. Ford announced Tuesday that Focus production is still going to Mexico, but it would scrap plans for a new $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Instead, it will invest $700 million at a Michigan plant to make autonomous and electric vehicles, creating 700 U.S. jobs. Last year Trump touted a deal to keep 800 jobs at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis from going to Mexico. He has promised to lower corporate tax rates to preserve factory jobs inside the United States, while threatening harsh penalties for companies that produce goods overseas to save on labor costs. On Twitter, Trump warned that he will impose a 35 percent tariff on the goods imported by companies that outsource production. Nearly every automaker produces small cars in Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs. Companies have said it's difficult to make lower-margin small cars profitably in the U.S. due to higher wages here. Last year, GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler made about 1.6 million vehicles in Mexico, about 17 percent of the vehicles produced overall in North America, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. That's projected to rise to 2.5 million, or about 26 percent, by 2022. Automakers and parts supply companies have added 12,000 U.S. jobs in the past year, according to government statistics. GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the compact car, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the U.S. are now made in Ohio, he said. In November, GM said it would lay off about 1,250 workers at the Lordstown plant due to sagging demand for cars as U.S. buyers take advantage of low gasoline prices to buy trucks and SUVs. The workers on the third shift at Lordstown will go in indefinite layoff starting Jan. 23, although some may move to other GM factories. Workers on two shifts will continue making the Cruze in Ohio even though its sales were down more than 18 percent through November. Shifting demand from cars to trucks and SUVS is forcing General Motors to lay off more than 2,000 workers. Last month, 61.5 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales were trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp., and analysts say there's no sign that will change anytime soon. Josh Boak and Christopher S.

But GM makes the vast majority of compact Chevrolet Cruzes at a sprawling complex in Lordstown, Ohio, east of Cleveland. Trump tweeted early Tuesday that GM is sending Mexican-made Cruzes to the U.S. tax-free. He told GM to make the cars in the U.S. “or pay big border tax!” GM imports only hatchback versions of the Cruze from a factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, and it sold only about 4,500 of them in the U.S. last year, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. The company sold about 172,000 Cruzes through November. The hatchback, which went on sale in the U.S. in the fall, is built in Mexico for global distribution, Morrissey said. GM shares fell by about 1 percent in premarket trading immediately after the tweet, but bounced into positive territory after the market opened Tuesday. Cruze hatchback production amounts to less than a day of output at the Lordstown plant, said Glenn Johnson, president of a United Auto Workers union local at the factory. The union, he said, is not protesting the move to build the hatch in Mexico. “It makes for news, that’s all,” Johnson said of Trump’s tweet. The Lordstown factory, he said, is not equipped to build the hatch. GM did import some Cruze sedans from Mexico last year to meet demand as it was rolling out a new version of the compact car, Morrissey said, but that has stopped and all sedans sold in the U.S. are now made in Ohio, he said. The tweet was the latest threat from Trump to tax companies that move production to Mexico and ship products back to the U.S. under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Last year Trump went after Ford for plans to shift production of the compact Focus to Mexico. Jobs at the Detroit-area factory that now makes Focuses would be preserved because the plant is to get a new small pickup truck and SUV. Ford’s CEO says the company will not change the plans. Trump’s targets have ranged from U.S. retailers and defense contractors, to tech companies. Amazon.com, Boeing and Macy’s have been the subject of Trump tweets in the past. Last year Trump touted a deal to keep 800 jobs at the Carrier furnace factory in Indianapolis from going to Mexico. He has promised to lower corporate tax rates to preserve factory jobs inside the United States, while threatening harsh penalties for companies that produce goods overseas to save on labor costs. On Twitter, Trump warned that he will impose a 35 percent tariff on the goods imported by companies that outsource production. In November, GM said it would lay off about 1,250 workers at the Lordstown plant due to sagging demand for cars as U.S. buyers take advantage of low gasoline prices to buy trucks and SUVs. The workers on the third shift at Lordstown will go in indefinite layoff starting Jan. 23, although some may move to other GM factories. Sales of the Cruze were down more than 18 percent through November. Shifting demand from cars to trucks and SUVS is forcing General Motors to lay off more than 2,000 workers. Last month, 61.5 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales were trucks and SUVs, according to Autodata Corp., and analysts say there’s no sign that will change anytime soon.

Stranger still, the tweet targeted a company run by one of his own policy advisors. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!” Trump wrote in his tweet. It was not immediately clear why Trump had GM on his mind. The car manufacturer announced in March 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Coahuila, Mexico, a move that takes advantage of the country’s low labor costs. The company also still makes the model at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Trump team seeks records on Canada, Mexico border walls President-elect Donald Trump has fixated on preventing American jobs from moving to Mexico. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) GM noted this in a statement replying to Trump's threat. "All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM's assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio," the statement said. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." 17 photos view gallery Donald Trump's road to the White House as President-elect The tweet took an immediate toll on the company’s stock, which dipped 16 cents per share in pre-market trading within minutes of the message. But it jumped 1.8% once early trading began. Trump says Sprint will bring 5,000 jobs back to U.S. GM CEO Mary Barra is part of Trump’s economic advisory team. She said in a December statement that she joined the group because it “offers us a seat at an important table where we can contribute to a constructive and open dialogue about key policy issues.” Just hours after Trump's GM tweet, Ford announced it would cancel plans to build a $1.6 billion plan in Mexico, and instead invest $700 million to expand its plant in Flat Rock, Mich. and hire 700 new workers there. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Ford CEO Mark Fields called the move "a vote of confidence for President-elect Trump and some of the policies he may be pursuing." Trump, who started his presidential campaign in a speech that vilified Mexican immigration and trade, has obsessed over preventing American companies from moving work there. He has repeatedly threatened to spike taxes for companies that outsource jobs. Trump taps Australian millionaire CEO for manufacturing council Trump in December credited himself for preventing Carrier, an Indiana-based air conditioner manufacturer, from moving 1,100 jobs to Mexico. But the real figure of rescued jobs was closer to 800, and the company still plans to move more than 500 positions south of the border. GM's CEO is a Trump financial advisor. (Paul Sancya/AP) Chuck Jones, the leader of the United Steelworkers union, accused Trump of “lying his ass off” about his role is saving Carrier jobs. Trump then personally targeted Jones on Twitter, writing that the union head had “done a terrible job representing workers.” Since winning the presidency, Trump has also made a habit of direct calling out American businesses on Twitter. He tweeted last month that he had asked Boeing about manufacturing new fighter jets that would "price-out" one of its competitors, Lockheed Martin.  Otherwise on Twitter Tuesday, Trump targeted Obamacare in the morning, calling it "lousy healthcare." In an afternoon tweet, he should there should be "no further releases" of prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. Obama, Congress trying for plan to save Affordable Care Act "These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield," he wrote. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama would stick by his plans to release more Gitmo prisoners before leaving office.  Tags: donald trump taxes and spending mexico Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

 Trump fires a warning shot at GM: 'Make in USA or pay big border tax!' Akin Oyedele Jan. 3, 2017, 7:57 AM 22,113 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mark Wallheiser / Stringer President-elect Donald Trump sent out a tweet Tuesday morning threatening to tax General Motors for manufacturing abroad. "General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border," Trump tweeted. "Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" In a statement, however, GM said most Chevy Cruze vehicles sold in the US were manufactured in Ohio. It added that the company produced an international version of the Cruze, the model to which Trump was most likely referring, in Mexico and did sell some of those vehicles in the US. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US," GM said. Shares of the automaker briefly slipped by about 1% in premarket trading after the tweet. Since his election, Trump has used Twitter to encourage large companies to keep production and jobs in the US. Indiana said it would provide up to $7 million in tax incentives to the air-conditioner maker Carrier to persuade it to keep hundreds of jobs in Indiana that were originally planned to be sent to Mexico. Late last year, several of Trump's tweets about public companies moved the markets. He said the cost of Boeing's contract to develop a new Air Force One was "exorbitant," sending the company's shares lower. His tweet calling for the US to expand its nuclear capability until the "world comes to its senses regarding nukes" spiked a uranium exchange-traded fund. Trump also commented that the cost of the F-35 fighter-jet program was out of control, sending shares of Lockheed Martin down 4%. Trump said last month that he had sold all of his stocks in June.
