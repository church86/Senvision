Next generation commercial drones achieve a complete replacement of existing commercial airfreight delivery systems, they are used for 3D mapping, commercial pipeline observation, border patrol, package delivery, photography, and agriculture are more energy efficient, last longer and have a significantly lower cost of operation than manned aircraft. Drones markets promise to grow significantly because of the more economical visualization and navigation provided by systems. Visualization includes mapping from the air, inspection from the air, surveillance from the air, and package delivery from the air. The unmanned aircraft equipped with cameras are able to do things that cannot be done in any other way. This bodes well for market development. Unmanned aircraft systems promise to achieve a more significant aspect of commercial market presence. Army Unmanned Aircraft Systems flying of 3 million flight hours gives drones market credibility. Eighty eight percent of those hours were logged in combat situations in Iraq and Afghanistan, paving the way for commercial drone markets to develop. Quantities of fielded systems increase as application usefulness increases. Police departments, the oil and gas industry, border patrol, and utilities are all using commercial drones. Units are used for agriculture. Vendors continue to improve the capabilities of these drone aircraft as more air miles are logged. Their ability to support the commercial endeavors is increasing. Unmanned aircraft have fundamentally changed the accuracy of utility and oil and gas inspections. They are set to fundamentally change how agriculture is conducted. Japan and Australia have been using drones in agriculture since the 1980s. Worldwide markets are evolving for several compelling applications. High value crops are a target of agricultural robotic development. What could be tastier than a strawberry, perfectly formed, and perfectly ripened? New agricultural robots are able to improve the delivery of consistent quality food, and to implement efficiency in managing food production. For Complete Report Visit@ http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/commercial-unmanned-aerial-systems-market Strawberries are a high profit crop. A new generation of drones has just been born. Strawberry spraying with the world’s most advanced technology is able to give maximum performance to a farm. Harvesting robots can use pictures from drones to optimize the productivity of the farming business by determining fruit ripeness from the air. Growers can get the best results in a berry farm using automated process. Automated picking collection systems improve labor productivity, give speed and agility to harvest operations. The robotic platforms are capable of site-specific spraying. The capability is targeted spraying only on foliage and selected targets. It can be used for selective harvesting of fruit. The robots detect the fruit, sense its ripeness, then move to grasp and softly detach only ripe fruit. Drone commercial uses will provide billions of dollars in economic growth. Centers of excellence are evolving worldwide. For the most part, open-use policies are in effect worldwide. Except in the US, Drones are currently mostly banned in the US. The US is more restrictive, it could take months, even years before the FAA offers preliminary guidelines on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft systems Commercial drones are set to build highways in the sky. The market will only evolve past the early adopter stage after the industry finds ways to build navigation infrastructure that is safe and that works. Roads in the sky will create altitude differences that function as bridges to separate the drones from each other when they are flying at angles to each other. This type of navigation needs to be defined by industry standards groups, much as the software industry has been able to develop industry stands that provide the base for a market, so also, the commercial drone manufacturers need to come together with representatives from each company and from all the governments to decide on the highways in the sky. Another aspect of commercial drone markets is the safety issue. If drones become so prevalent that they fall out of the sky on people or homes, this becomes a problem for the people hit or the people who own the homes that are destroyed. As the air crashes from so long ago in the 1920’s to yesterday illustrate, people are deterred from commercial drone use by air crashes. Crashes can virtually destroy what is promising to be a burgeoning industry of commercial drones. The drone industry is going to need to find a way to prevent injuries on the ground before anyone will support the burgeoning industry in any significant way. In unpopulated areas like to Alaskan oil fields oil pipelines, and utility high wires, there is plenty of space for the drones to make a market. In vast agricultural land areas, drones promise to be able to be used without any danger to humans. The drones create new uses for automated process. The drones are less expensive than manned vehicles and more useful. They are useful in agricultural applications where the cameras are able to do spotting in a manner that is more efficient than the humans can do. Unmanned aircraft systems are achieving a level of relatively early maturity. Fleets of unmanned aircraft systems have begun to evolve. The U.S. Army has achieved one million flight hours for its unmanned aircraft systems fleet. Unmanned aerial systems have good handling characteristics. UAS units are designed to perform high-speed, long-endurance, more covert, multi-mission intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and precision-strike missions over land or sea. Drone units feature a variety of internal loads, including 2,000 lb payload, an Electro-optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor, and an all-weather GA-ASI Lynx® synthetic aperture radar/ground moving target indicator (SAR/GMTI), maximizing long loiter capabilities. UAS offers the business persistent situational awareness and mission affordability. For the cost of one manned fighter aircraft, multiple-swarm configured units can cover an area of interest, providing 24/7 ISR coverage, target identification, neutralization, mission flexibility, and attrition tolerance. Some drone UAS have the capability to support manned aircraft missions if desired.

Unmanned aircraft systems promise to achieve a more significant aspect of commercial market presence. Army Unmanned Aircraft Systems flying of 3 million flight hours gives drones market credibility. Eighty eight percent of those hours were logged in combat situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to Susan Eustis, leader of the team that prepared the study, â€œQuantities of fielded systems increase. Police departments, the oil and gas industry, border patrol, and utilities are all using commercial drones. Units are used for agriculture. Vendors continue to improve the capabilities of these drone aircraft. Their ability to support the commercial endeavors is increasing. Unmanned aircraft have fundamentally changed the accuracy of utility and oil and gas inspections. They are set to fundamentally change how agriculture is conducted.â€ Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) markets at $609 million in 2014 are forecast to reach $4.8 billion dollars, worldwide by 2021. This is a sizable market growth with oil and gas mapping, utility line inspection, package delivery, and agricultural applications accounting for virtually all the unit sales. Drones can provide more information at less cost than a human inspection team can.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home World news In win for Boeing and GE, Donald Trump says he wants to revive export bank In win for Boeing and GE, Donald Trump says he wants to revive export bank Trump first told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill two vacancies on the agency's five-member board that have prevented the bank from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over $10 million. By: Reuters | Washington | Published: April 13, 2017 9:50 AM The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enables them to purchase American-made goods. (Reuters) President Donald Trump plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, his office said, a victory for American manufacturers like Boeing Co and General Electric Co which have overseas customers that use the agency’s government-backed loans to purchase their products. Trump first told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill two vacancies on the agency’s five-member board that have prevented the bank from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over $10 million. Trump’s picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. Trump told the Journal that the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank being “featherbedding” for wealthy corporations. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enables them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank’s acting chairman, Charles “CJ” Hall, was not immediately available for comment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who have worked in Congress to kill the bank, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump’s about-face on the export bank comes after meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation’s aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Trump also met at the White House on Feb. 23 with GE CEO Jeff Immelt and Caterpillar Inc CEO Mark Sutton, both vocal supporters of the bank. Also Watch: It is not known if they discussed the bank at those meetings. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. “This is an encouraging development on a key competitive issue for U.S manufacturers and their extensive supply chains,” Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said in statement to Reuters. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which includes companies like Ingersoll-Rand Plc , United States Steel Corp and Pfizer Inc, cheered the move. “Manufacturers are encouraged by President Trump’s vocal support for the bank,” said NAM Vice President of International Economic Affairs Linda Dempsey in a statement. A 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in Congress allowed the bank’s charter to expire for five months. After overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the bank’s charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines. Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity, two groups funded by the Republican donor Koch brothers, worked aggressively for years to kill the bank. Brothers Charles and David Koch have opposed the bank for what they call damaging interference into the free market by government. Nathan Nascimento, Freedom Partners vice president of policy, called the bank on Wednesday “the epitome of what’s wrong with Washington.” Also Watch: “Reopening the flood gates to Ex-Im’s corporate welfare is a bad deal for hardworking taxpayers and a bad deal for American businesses,” he said. The Club for Growth, which spends heavily in electing conservative candidates and was one of the few groups to campaign against Trump during the Republican primary in 2016, also lamented the change in position. “Ex-Im has a long history of cronyism and corruption that is well-known to many in the Trump Administration, and while we hoped it would be done away with, the administration now has taken on the almost impossible challenge of reforming a federal agency whose mission has been to pick winners and losers with taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Doug Sachtleben said in a statement to Reuters.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, his office said, a victory for American manufacturers like Boeing Co and General Electric Co which have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products. Trump first told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill two vacancies on the agency's five-member board that have prevented the bank from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over $10 million. Trump's picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. Trump told the Journal that the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank being "featherbedding" for wealthy corporations. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enables them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank's acting chairman, Charles "CJ" Hall, was not immediately available for comment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who have worked in Congress to kill the bank, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump's about-face on the export bank comes after meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation's aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Trump also met at the White House on Feb. 23 with GE CEO Jeff Immelt and Caterpillar Inc CEO Mark Sutton, both vocal supporters of the bank. It is not known if they discussed the bank at those meetings. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. "This is an encouraging development on a key competitive issue for U.S manufacturers and their extensive supply chains," Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said in statement to Reuters. The US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which includes companies like Ingersoll-Rand Plc , United States Steel Corp and Pfizer Inc, cheered the move.

Trump's picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. Trump told the Journal that the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank being "featherbedding" for wealthy corporations. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enables them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank’s acting chairman, Charles “CJ” Hall, was not immediately available for comment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who have worked in Congress to kill the bank, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump's about-face on the export bank comes after meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation's aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Trump also met at the White House on Feb. 23 with GE CEO Jeff Immelt and Caterpillar Inc <CAT.N> CEO Mark Sutton, both vocal supporters of the bank. It is not known if they discussed the bank at those meetings. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. "This is an encouraging development on a key competitive issue for U.S manufacturers and their extensive supply chains," Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said in statement to Reuters. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which includes companies like Ingersoll-Rand Plc <IR.N>, United States Steel Corp <X.N> and Pfizer Inc <PFE.N>, cheered the move. “Manufacturers are encouraged by President Trump’s vocal support for the bank,” said NAM Vice President of International Economic Affairs Linda Dempsey in a statement. A 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in Congress allowed the bank's charter to expire for five months. After overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the bank's charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines. Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity, two groups funded by the Republican donor Koch brothers, worked aggressively for years to kill the bank. Brothers Charles and David Koch have opposed the bank for what they call damaging interference into the free market by government. Nathan Nascimento, Freedom Partners vice president of policy, called the bank on Wednesday "the epitome of what's wrong with Washington." "Reopening the flood gates to Ex-Im’s corporate welfare is a bad deal for hardworking taxpayers and a bad deal for American businesses,” he said. The Club for Growth, which spends heavily in electing conservative candidates and was one of the few groups to campaign against Trump during the Republican primary in 2016, also lamented the change in position. "Ex-Im has a long history of cronyism and corruption that is well-known to many in the Trump Administration, and while we hoped it would be done away with, the administration now has taken on the almost impossible challenge of reforming a federal agency whose mission has been to pick winners and losers with taxpayer dollars," spokesman Doug Sachtleben said in a statement to Reuters.

The Atlanta-based carrier, known as an influential and shrewd aircraft buyer, is studying its twin-aisle orders amid signs the long-range travel market is saturated, Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive officer, said during a quarterly earnings call yesterday. While he didn’t name Airbus, Delta has no twin-aisle orders pending with Boeing, according to the US company’s online database. Word of the review intensified concerns that demand for long-haul planes is weakening as a long jet-buying binge draws to close. American Airlines Group Inc last year deferred its order for Airbus A350 jets, while  United Continental Holdings Inc said it may swap its purchase for smaller planes. “It definitely contributes to what’s been a building caution, or wall of worry around the wide-body market,” said Ken Herbert, an aerospace analyst at Canaccord Genuity. ‘Excess capacity’ Airbus out-duelled Boeing for Delta’s 50-jet order in 2014 and is slated to begin delivering the first of 25 Airbus A350s later this year. They are intended to replace the Boeing 747 jumbos that once shuttled Delta’s passengers to Asia. The airline had also ordered 25 of Airbus’s A330neo, which has yet to fly, as a replacement for its oldest Boeing 767 planes. “We continue to see excess capacity in wide-bodies as we look to the future for the industry as a whole,” Bastian said. “We continue to look internally as to what that means for Delta,” he said, adding that the airline is in discussions with planemakers. “You could anticipate some reductions, I think, broadly over the next several years,” he said. Although Delta only has outstanding wide-body orders with Airbus, shares of both duopolist planemakers reacted to Bastian’s remarks. Boeing fell 1.4 per cent to US$176.05, the second-biggest slide among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Airbus ended the day rising 0.9 per cent, paring earlier gains of as much as 1.5 per cent. “It’s not appropriate for us to comment on our customers’ internal analyses,” Mary Anne Greczyn, a spokeswoman for Airbus, said by email. “However, as a leading aircraft manufacturer, Airbus continually engages our customers around the world to help optimise their fleet needs.” US market The prospect of Delta postponing or canceling the wide-body order adds to the uncertainty over Airbus’s efforts to make inroads in the US with its next-generation models. Such moves “would not be welcome by Airbus, especially from one of the Big Three US airlines where its wide-body market penetration is not particularly strong,” said aviation consultant Scott Hamilton. Delta’s latest review doesn’t necessarily mean Airbus will lose business, Hamilton said. The airline could defer orders to a schedule that better fits its demand forecast. It could also shift the mix to other models such as a lighter-weight regional A330 or narrow-body A321neo, Hamilton said. The carrier is thought to be considering issuing a request for proposals for single-aisle aircraft that would pit Boeing’s 737 Max against Airbus’s A320neo family, Hamilton said. Delta will also need a mid-market aircraft, such as the regional A330 or the so-called 797 under consideration at Boeing. “At face value, the Delta statement might seem alarming,” he said by email. “But as so often becomes the case, the ‘review’ may not be what it seems.” American, United American is scheduled to take the first of 22 Airbus A350 XWBs next year, said Joshua Freed, a spokesman, who declined further comment. The planes were ordered by US Airways Group, which merged with American in 2013. American last year delayed delivery of the advanced Airbus jetliners by an average 26 months. United said last year it was reviewing its purchase of Airbus’s A350-1000s. Sales of twin-aisle jets have slowed as the market absorbs a surplus after Boeing and Airbus boosted output at a 16 per cent annual pace from 2011 through 2015, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. Late last year, Boeing announced a second cut to the production rate of its 777 jetliner amid a sales drought, while Airbus’s A330neo orders have stalled, he said. In December, Delta scrapped a longstanding order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners that it inherited in its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines. At the time, the airline said the decision was consistent with the need “to prudently address our wide-body aircraft needs.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week United Airlines CEO won’t resign Asia’s worst performing currency is back on investors’ radar Trump sees global gains from ‘chemistry’ with China’s Xi Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Ringgit continues uptrend to open higher Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Malaysian-based I Synergy puts expansion plan in place Petronas pitches RM4.4b offshore gas project stake to oil firms, sources say Stocks spooked, safe-haven assets jump as US missiles strike Syria Demand for Malaysian palm oil set to rebound, says Council Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Malala becomes honourary Canadian citizen Reuters Video: US tells Russia ‘you are isolating yourselves’ by backing Assad Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Bloomberg Video: Zhang Yimou on why ‘The Great Wall’ bombed at the box office Bloomberg Video: Former ambassador surprised by fast Trump Syria decision Related Articles Saudi carrier flynas signs deal for 80 Airbus planes Delta, United, Emirates lead the way on in-flight Wi-Fi YouTube star says kicked off Delta flight for speaking Arabic Delta axes hundreds of flights, delays many more after computer glitch (VIDEO) Delta grounding lifted, but travel chaos not over (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

New York City to Boston, for example. Or Houston to Dallas. Tampa to Miami. The obvious choice might be to drive. But what if you could show up at an airport at one of those cities, bypass security checkpoints, board a small hybrid-electric plane with luggage in hand, and be on the ground at your destination in about an hour – all for about $25 (£20) each way? A company called Zunum Aero hopes to make that a reality, so travellers who normally take a car, bus or train for regional trips won't think twice about flying. The Washington state-based start-up says that since 2013, it has been developing a fleet of hybrid-electric planes that would make those kinds of inexpensive, short-haul flights possible. Read more This man will save you thousands of pounds on flights The company has some heavyweight investor partners, including Boeing’s HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures, subsidiaries of their respective companies. It also faces a number of competitors and obstacles, particularly battery limitations. But if successful, it could significantly change regional air travel, where options have shrivelled and costs have crept up in recent decades. “Think of it as Tesla of the air”,  said Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures. “[Or] think of it as an electric bus in the air”. Zunum Aero emerged from “stealth mode” on Wednesday to announce its ambitious goals: to be flying routes of up to 700 miles – think Atlanta to Washington DC – by the mid-2020s and then routes of up to 1,000 miles – think Los Angeles to Seattle – by 2030. President’s fleet: Silicon Valley is keen to offer its answer to conventional vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (Getty) The start-up also laid out an array of promises: door-to-door travel times cut in half; lower operating costs; airfares that would be 40 to 80 per cent lower. All on quiet hybrid aircraft that would produce 80 per cent less emissions. Indeed, part of the company name was inspired by “tzunuum”, the Mayan word for the hummingbird, for the bird's speed and efficiency. “To be perfectly honest, we’ve been wanting to tell the story for four years,” Zunum Aero chief executive Ashish Kumar told The Washington Post. “What we’ve been building towards is really exciting and we believe fundamentally is going to change the shape of regional aviation.” Kumar thinks operating costs for the company’s hybrid-electric planes could be 40 to 80 per cent lower than for conventional aircraft. A small range-extending generator, he adds, would be integrated into early planes, kicking in on longer flights where battery power isn’t enough. The eventual goal would be for battery technology to become advanced enough to have planes relying entirely on electricity, eliminating fuel costs altogether.

Flying often means allotting extra time for getting to the airport, going through security and then boarding. Also, the airline industry’s shift to larger planes and big-city hubs created what Kumar calls a “regional transport gap”. Flights from midsize cities are now often routed through hubs, meaning door-to-door times for those trips are no better than they were 50 years ago, Kumar said. And air options for smaller communities have been dwindling or disappearing, he added. Today, 97 per cent of US air traffic comes from 2 per cent of the more than 5,000 airports in the country, according to a forecast by the Federal Aviation Administration. About 95 per cent of trips under 500 miles are taken by car, according to research by the US Department of Transportation. For trips between 500 and 750 miles, about 61 per cent of travellers drive and 34 per cent fly. For trips between 750 and 1,000 miles, a little more than half of travellers fly and 42 per cent drive. Zunum Aero’s Kumar and his team think this is where electric-hybrid planes can step in. Whereas a Boeing 737 today seats anywhere from 85 to more than 200 passengers, a Zunum plane would have from 10 to 50 seats. Because smaller aircraft are subject to fewer security regulations, those passengers would likely be able to skip long security queues. Removing luggage check-in options also would save on time on the ground, he said. The resulting trip would feel more like a cross between private corporate air travel and hopping on a bus. Still, the company is not without its competitors and detractors. This year, a Massachusetts-based start-up called Wright Electric announced similar plans to roll out “zero-emissions electric airliners designed to save money and our planet” within a decade. But the company, which is backed by start-up accelerator Y Combinator, has said it is relying on continued advances in battery technology. This is “not there yet” according to Graham Warwick, technology editor of Aviation Weekly. Speaking to the BBC last month he said: “It’s projected to come but it needs a significant improvement. Nobody thinks that is going to happen anytime soon.” It remains too early to tell what the commercial aviation industry will look like by the mid-2020s and whether one-way fares in the $25 range would be feasible then. Even now, it is not unheard of for low-cost carriers such as Frontier or Spirit to offer double-digit airfares on domestic routes. That hasn't stopped others from diving into hybrid-electric aerospace projects. Airbus has also been developing E-Fan, its hybrid electric aircraft since 2014. In 2015 it became the first all-electric twin-engine plane to cross the English Channel. Though the E-Fan has only two seats, Airbus is hoping the technology will lead to the development of a regional airliner or helicopter. Plans for helicopter-esque electric VTOL – vertical take-off and landing – aircraft have also been emerging from Silicon Valley. According to Andrew J. Hawkins of New York-based tech website The Verge companies such as Uber and Airbus are working on developing their own VTOLs. Read more Boeing is making a major change to its planes that could end jet lag Budget air travel loses its final luxury This year is one of the safest for air travel in history Air travellers know why shops want to see their boarding passes- “Because nothing says ‘I'm very rich and I hate traffic’ like a flying car project,” Hawkins wrote for the technology site. In a statement, Boeing HorizonX said it was confident in investing in Zunum Aero “because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space.” Simi compared the push for hybrid-electric planes to the airline industry’s advancement from strictly propeller planes to jet aircraft. “It’s that type of transformation,” said SImi. “We’re very excited about where this is going. It’s still very early, of course. We now have a seat at the table at what we believe is going to be an amazing change.”  © The Washington Post More about: Aviation air travel America electric Zunum Aero Boeing Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Get up close and personal with Boeing’s svelte new spacesuit Posted 9 hours ago by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Google Home has stopped answering to that annoying Burger King ad For its upcoming crewed spaceflight missions, Boeing worked with David Clark Company, a Massachusetts-based company that makes flight and aviation suits, as well as headsets for pilots to come up with brand new spacesuits. The goal was to create a new kind of spacesuit for a new kind of astronaut – Boeing wants to be a leader in the new business of commercial crewed orbital missions, and the crew of its CST-100 Starliner, which aims to begin flying next year, needed updated equipment to match. We got the chance to speak directly with Boeing Starliner Crew and Mission Systems lead Chris Ferguson, himself a former astronaut who visited the International Space Station three times. The suit is a big improvement according to Ferguson, compared to the ones he used to wear, especially with regards to astronaut mobility thanks to the lightness of the materials used. Visually, you can tell that it’s much-reduced in terms of sheer mass, and that reduction was made possible by focusing on what really matters for the astronauts, and by taking out stuff they won’t need for EVA activities – otherwise known as spacewalks. From touchscreen gloves, to lightweight shoes that have more in common with today’s lightweight sneakers than with industrial boots, the new spacesuit is an exercise in minimalism, functionality, comfort and safety. Travis Ripps, a systems engineer lead for David Clark Company, explained to me that everything, from the slack in the rear and at the knees to allow for given when astronauts are in their seated position during launch, to a zip across the stomach to prevent bunching when bent at the mid-section, is designed to make sure you get solid pressurization without unduly impeding the astronaut’s ability to do their jobs. boeing-spacesuit boeing-spacesuit147A0661 boeing-spacesuit147A0662 boeing-spacesuit147A0663 boeing-spacesuit147A0664 boeing-spacesuit147A0665 boeing-spacesuit147A0666 boeing-spacesuit147A0667 boeing-spacesuit147A0668 boeing-spacesuit147A0669 boeing-spacesuit147A0670 boeing-spacesuit147A0671 boeing-spacesuit147A0672 boeing-spacesuit147A0656 boeing-spacesuit147A0657  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Even sizing is kept to a minimum in terms of complexity: the spacesuit can be modified on the fly to fit a number of different frames, and just six total sizes can pretty much run the gamut in terms of addressing the needs of different-sized human astronauts. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Boomerang Joins The Subscription Games | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Science Popular Posts Featured Stories Boomerang Joins The Subscription Games | Crunch Report VIDEO | 4:35 | Crunch Report Accenture, can I ask you a few questions? 12 hours ago | Jonathan Shieber Justin Kan’s new startup Atrium is raising $10 million to disrupt the legal industry 12 hours ago | Ryan Lawler Don’t run commercials designed to trigger smart assistants 14 hours ago | Brian Heater Facebook Messenger hits 1.2 billion monthly users, up from 1B in July 14 hours ago | Josh Constine Latest From TechCrunch Uber reportedly tracked Lyft drivers using a secret software program named ‘Hell’ 1 hour ago | Catherine Shu Elmodis raises a $4.9M round to find the soul of a new machine 3 hours ago | John Biggs A radio signal hack is what made those Dallas warning sirens go nuts 3 hours ago | Taylor Hatmaker Crunch Report | Boomerang Joins The Subscription Games 4 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Comment moderation powered by Up Next Google Home has stopped answering to that annoying Burger King ad Posted 10 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Software Engineer in Test @ ThoughtSpot at ThoughtSpot (San Francisco, CA, United States) Engineering Program Manager @ Brava Home at Brava Home (San Francisco, CA, United States) Global Supply Manager @ Brava Home at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Backend Java Engineer @ Returnly at Returnly (Larkspur, California 94939, United States) Senior Frontend Engineer @ Onfleet at Onfleet (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip Activations Blog International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

SEE: WATCH: To infinity and beyond! Humans go to Mars The Deep Space Gateway, which will be powered by a Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) system would deliver the habitat to cislunar space near the moon. The gateway is also help in critical research and open opportunities for global government or commercial partnership in deep space. The Deep Space Gateway could be the solution for Mars missions. The Deep Space Transport vehicle could be hosted by using the same organization that International Space Station uses for their commercial operations. Humans will travel in the Deep Space Transport vehicle to Mars and once they are near Mars, crews could deploy a lander for surface missions or conduct other scientific and robotic missions in orbit.  “The ability to simultaneously launch humans and cargo on SLS would allow us to assemble the gateway in four launches in the early 2020s,” says Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing’s space exploration division. The transport vehicle would be equipped with a habitat specifically designed to protect passengers from deep space’s harsh environment and its own robust SEP bus.

(Photo credit: Norsk Titanium)Norsk Titanium announced this week that it has received an order from Boeing to produce structural components, 3D printed in titanium, for the 787 Dreamliner. According to the Norway-based additive manufacturing firm, Boeing’s purchase order represents the first time AM parts will be used to bear structural stresses in a commercial aircraft. The company says it partnered with Boeing to design the parts and submit them to an extensive testing program to gain FAA certification. According to Reuters, Boeing’s contract is a cost cutting strategy aimed at reducing the production expense of the Dreamliner, which uses titanium extensively due to the 787’s carbon-fiber fuselage and wings. Using their proprietary Rapid Plasma Deposition (RPD) process, Norsk’s Vice President of Marketing, Chip Yates, told Reuters that he estimates Boeing could shave between $2-3 million off the cost of the 144 Dreamliners Boeing typically produces each year. Those savings, the company says, are due its RPD process creating parts that are 80 percent production ready out of the printer and therefore require relatively little post-processing. That saving would also be contingent on the FAA approving the material properties and production process for printed parts later this year, thereby allowing Norsk to expand from four initial 787 parts to thousands without needing to certify each part separately. Production of the 3D printed titanium components will begin in Norway, the company says, but it plans to move the program to its 67,000-square-foot facility in Plattsburgh, New York by year’s end. www.norsktitanium.com Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Posted by Mike McLeod Editor, Design Engineering Magazine All posts by Mike McLeod Tags Related Rolls-Royce engine successfully powers Boeing’s Dreamliner Strategic partnership aims to deliver 3D printed aerospace parts Mercedes-Benz Trucks pioneers 3D printing for plastic spare parts Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The tax on imports would apply to both finished goods and component parts, such as these wings for the 787. (Mike Siegel/Seattle Times) Print Email The Seattle Times By The Seattle Times The Oregonian on April 12, 2017 at 7:55 AM, updated April 12, 2017 at 8:26 AM comments SEATTLE -- Boeing has joined the push for a sweeping, Republican-backed reform of the U.S. corporate tax system that would reduce the tax rate substantially while imposing a tax on imports and exempting exports. CEO Dennis Muilenburg and the 330-company Aerospace Industries Association that he leads are lobbying hard for a comprehensive overhaul that would include what's known as a "border adjustment tax." Championed by some in President Donald Trump's administration and by House Speaker Paul Ryan, the idea has drawn stiff opposition not only from companies like Wal-Mart that import a lot of the goods they sell but also from free-trade hawks on the right such as billionaires Charles and David Koch, longtime funders of the Republican Party and conservative causes. With the global aviation business critically dependent on free trade, this makes Boeing and Trump "pretty strange bedfellows," noted Alan Tonelson, a fierce critic of U.S. trade policy and supporter of the tax proposal who blogs about economics and politics. Officials at Washington state's Department of Commerce, normally in sync with Boeing, a big employer in the region, are alarmed at the proposal, which many see as imposing a tariff on imported goods. "This kind of thing could start a trade war. It's very unpredictable," said Brian Bonlender, the Commerce Department's director. "We, as the most trade-dependent state in the country, are likely to be the most impacted by unintended consequences." Boeing also operations in Oregon, where it employs more than 1,600 in Gresham. The 87-acre plant produces parts for Boeing's 737, 767, 777 and 787 jets.  American auto dealers and the country's largest retailers, fearing higher consumer prices, are also opposed to the idea. So is Boeing's archrival, Airbus, which calls it protectionism. Oregon-based Columbia Sportswear and most of the U.S. outdoor and athletic apparel and footwear makers have mobilized to defeat the plan, which they claim is so onerous it will slash their profits by as much as 70 percent and potentially put some of them out of business. Columbia takes border tax fight to Capitol Hill So what's in it for the nation's largest exporter, which last year sold 68 percent of its commercial jets to foreign companies? Wouldn't this radical reshaping of federal business taxes risk retaliation from the corners of the globe that provide most of its customers -- China and Europe? And how would an import tax affect Boeing's global supply chain, which features foreign partners building major pieces of planes such as the 787? The proposed border adjustment tax was being discussed only in the most esoteric academic circles before Trump won the presidential race. Yet now a plan to implement it is being championed in Congress by Ryan and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady. Reportedly, it has won the support of Trump's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon. The proposal represents a sharp structural shift in how companies are taxed -- from taxing bottom-line corporate profits, to assessing taxes on revenue generated exclusively in the U.S. If the Ryan plan becomes law, every time an item is sold to an end user within the U.S., the sales revenue would be taxable at 20 percent, with deductions allowed for domestic labor and inventory costs. Besides the lower tax rate -- down from 35 percent today -- there's another attraction for a company like Boeing that spends billions of dollars on factory buildings and manufacturing equipment. Capital investment would be immediately deductible in the year the money is spent, instead of being accounted for through depreciation over many years. The "border adjustment" element of the plan works like this: A company's sales of products exported from the U.S. are exempt from the tax entirely. By contrast, because the cost of imported goods is not deductible from a company's revenues (unlike domestic inventory costs), the company would pay 20 cents in tax for every dollar in sales of imported goods. The tax on imports would apply to both finished goods and component parts, such as the wings of the 787 that Boeing imports from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan. For a smaller-scale example, consider Everett, Wash.-based aerospace company AvtechTyee, which supplies Boeing with parts called tie rods that are used to support overhead stow bins and other fixtures on the 787 Dreamliner. The tie rods are finished in Everett, but the shaft is a long, carbon-composite tube fabricated in Tijuana, Mexico. That's not an unusual situation. In 2012, Boeing even invited smaller suppliers to attend a workshop in Chicago to learn how to shave costs by outsourcing work to Mexico. When AvtechtTyee sells the tie rods to Boeing, it will pay a 20 percent tax and won't be able to deduct the cost of the composite tubes. (AvtechTyee declined to comment.) Boeing plans to make more parts in Gresham The tax's most prominent academic advocate, Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at the University of California at Berkeley, rejects the notion that the tax is protectionist or will cause prices to rise. Auerbach, who has consulted with Ryan and Brady on their proposal, insisted in an interview that the import tax ultimately won't make a difference to either Boeing or AvtechTyee or the U.S. consumer. The theory goes like this: When this system is introduced, foreign consumers or companies will want to buy more of the tax-free exports while Americans will want to buy fewer of the imports with the tax added to the price. Both these factors will cause the dollar to rise in value against foreign currencies. Auerbach and other proponents of the system contend that the dollar will appreciate 20 percent in tandem with the tax, so Boeing or AvtechTyee would be buying their imports with a stronger dollar, exactly offsetting the impact of the import charge. He says the same will apply to U.S. consumers buying items from China at Wal-Mart: The dollar's rise will exactly counter the import tax and those imported goods won't be more expensive, he contends. "They'll pay the border tax, but with dollars that are more valuable," Auerbach said. Then consider the implications if Boeing sells a 777 jet to Gulf airline Emirates with no tax to pay, and another 777 to American Airlines with a 20 percent tax added. Auerbach said that with no tax, Boeing will likely sell the plane 20 percent cheaper to Emirates than to American. However, his assumed parallel 20 percent rise in the value of the dollar would mean Emirates will have to pay that much more for the dollars it uses to buy the planes -- which will effectively extinguish the price differential, he said. Overall, Auerbach insisted the expected rise of the dollar means the tax, counterintuitively, won't create an increase in exports or a decline in imports -- though he said Trump's talk about imposing tariffs "hasn't helped" get that message across. "It won't affect the trade balance with other countries," Auerbach said. "It's not protectionist." This raises the question: If this tax won't shift the trade balance, what's it for? Auerbach says the new tax system would bring two big gains. It would end a form of corporate-tax avoidance that happens when companies overstate costs and understate profits at overseas subsidiaries. Because only sales in the U.S. are taxed, overseas transactions are simply irrelevant to this tax system. Secondly, it should make it more profitable for a company to manufacture in the U.S. rather than overseas. That's the counterintuitive theory. If it's true, Boeing could be among the very biggest winners. The tax on its imported parts would have minimal impact. And according to an analysis by former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, now a professor at Harvard, a company like Boeing -- able to deduct much of its costs for inventory and labor that create its bulging pipeline of tax-free exported aircraft -- could end up with "annual multibillion-dollar refunds." "Businesses that invest heavily, hire extensively and export a large part of their product would have negative taxable income on a chronic basis," Summers predicted in a Washington Post op-ed piece in January. In contrast, he projected that for retailers that import a lot of their goods, "the taxes will substantially exceed 100 percent of profits, even if there is some offset from a stronger dollar." No wonder Boeing is gung-ho and Wal-Mart is worried. Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers said the company considers the border adjustment tax "the right approach" and that "the more competitive corporate rate will be beneficial to businesses." But skeptics abound. While the dollar is indeed likely to become more valuable relative to other currencies if the tax is implemented, many observers think it won't necessarily rise enough. Many other factors besides tax policy may affect the currency rate. Economist William Gale, in a Brookings Institution paper on the tax, cites the risk that if the exchange rate does not adjust fully, the rise in consumer prices would "hit low-income households disproportionately." And there is plenty of worry about the tax's impact even within the aerospace world. If the dollar fails to fully adjust, net exporters like Boeing would do extremely well, but importers including many aerospace suppliers could be hurt. For tax purposes, Boeing wouldn't be able to deduct the price it paid to Mitsubishi for the 787 wings, though that would likely be more than offset by the jet maker's much lower overall tax rate. But at a company such as AvtechTyee, the price it charges Boeing for its tie rods might have to rise as it pays the tax. If a domestic producer could manufacture similar tie rods to AvtechTyee's but with U.S.-made carbon tubes at the same cost, that rival would pay less tax and gain a pricing advantage. Most worrying for the industry is that the tax may be seen overseas as antithetical to free trade and globalization, which is the bedrock of the sustained growth of aviation. Gale's paper, among others, points out a detail that could be the spark for a damaging trade war: U.S. domestic producers of any item are allowed to deduct their labor costs when paying the tax, while a foreign firm selling the same item in the U.S. won't be able to. That difference is incompatible with World Trade Organization rules, which require that taxes be applied the same to imports as to goods produced domestically. Auerbach calls the WTO status of that provision "an open question." But Adam Pilarski, an economist and aviation expert with aircraft consultancy Avitas, said there's no doubt: "Any way you call it, it's a tariff." "Any time you mess with tariffs, you are risking a trade war," he added. "This is very, very dangerous." At an aviation-finance conference of the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading last month in San Diego, many of the U.S. bankers and jet-setting business people attending were positive about Trump's push to lower corporate taxes and cut regulation. But major players from overseas expressed concern about encroachments on free trade. Aengus Kelly, chief executive of the world's largest aircraft lessor, Aercap, pointed out that free trade and open-skies agreements -- the ability to set up an airline and fly just about anywhere -- created top Boeing customers like Europe's discount carrier Ryanair. He said the proposed tax revamp could have negative consequences for Boeing. "You think China will keep buying Boeing airplanes if there's a border adjustment tax?" Kelly said. "I'm not so sure." Airbus sales chief John Leahy said in an interview that Europeans in the globalized aviation business are "shocked" by the growing U.S. support for what they see as trade barriers. "It's a little disappointing that some U.S. manufacturers seem to think they'll get a competitive advantage by getting on board with protectionism. It's very shortsighted," he said. Aviation industry analyst Scott Hamilton said Airbus could be hit by the tax on imported parts that it assembles in Mobile, Alabama, and on the European-built jets it sells to U.S. carriers. "You can bet if the border tax applies to Airbus in any form, the EU will retaliate," Hamilton said. Washington state commerce director Bonlender said that even if an outright trade war is averted, "Companies contemplating investing in the U.S. will hold off until they see how this whole thing plays out." He said a manufacturer considering setting up a plant here to serve the Asian market will hesitate to go forward before knowing how Asian countries will respond to any import tax. He worries too that if other countries perceive the tax as protectionist and retaliate accordingly, the tax might perversely encourage companies to put their manufacturing plants outside the U.S. That prospect was raised last summer by the chief executive of GE, Jeffrey Immelt, who told students at New York University that in an increasingly protectionist world it would be logical for multinational companies like his "to localize production in big end-use markets." In other words, if a country erects tariff barriers, a multinational can avoid them by producing in that country, provided the market is big enough. The Chinese airplane market is huge. Boeing currently projects that over the next 20 years it will sell up to a third of its aircraft in China. If China were to retaliate for the import tax by slapping tariffs on Boeing planes built in the U.S., it would give Airbus a big sales advantage -- and Boeing an incentive to build planes for the Chinese market in China. --The Seattle Times Video of the Day Nominate your company for a Top Workplaces award Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

The ordered parts will be used for the 787 Dreamliner. The parts will currently be made in Norway with plans for Boeing to build their own 3D manufacturing facilities in the USA by the end of the year. The procedure being used by Norsk Titanium is called the Rapid Plasma Deposition (RPD) process and its approval is the first of its kind. The two companies have been working closely to obtain approval from the FAA on the usage of four parts manufactured in such an unconventional way. Finally, with the parts ordered, the way is being paved for more parts to be manufactured and used that are 3D printed. In the future, if the FAA approves the overall production process, they will no longer need individual certification of each part that is manufactured using the RPD 3D process, a significant departure from the forging and machining currently used to make parts. Boeing has stated that the order with Norsk Titanium will save between $2-3 million per aircraft. This is a significant step as aircraft fuel nozzles had already begun being 3D printed, but this specific arrangement with Norsk Titanium is the first time that parts that are structurally integral to the aircraft and will bear some of the stresses of flight will be used.

The contract announced on Monday is a major step in Boeing’s effort to boost the profitability of the 787 and a sign of growing industrial acceptance of the durability of 3-D printed metal parts, allowing them to replace pieces made with more expensive traditional manufacturing in demanding aerospace applications. Strong, lightweight titanium alloy is seven times more costly than aluminum, and accounts for about $17 million of the cost of a $265 million Dreamliner, industry sources say. Boeing has been trying to reduce titanium costs on the 787, which requires more of the metal than other models because of its carbon-fiber fuselage and wings. Titanium also is used extensively on Airbus Group SE’s rival A350 jet. “This means $2 million to $3 million in savings for each Dreamliner, at least,” starting in 2018 when many more parts are being printed, Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium’s vice president of marketing, said in a telephone interview. Boeing builds 144 Dreamliners in a typical year. The company declined to comment on the estimate but said Norsk’s technology would help reduce costs. The Dreamliner turned profitable last year after racking up nearly $29 billion in production-related losses. Norsk worked with Boeing for more than a year to design four 787 parts and obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification for them, Yates said. Norsk expects the U.S. regulatory agency will approve the material properties and production process for printed parts later this year. That will “open up the floodgates,” Yates said, by allowing Norsk to print thousands of other parts for each Dreamliner, without each part requiring separate FAA approval, resulting in the millions in expecting savings per plane. “You’re talking about tons, literally,” on the 787 that would be printed instead of made with traditional, expensive forging and machining, he said. General Electric Co is already printing metal fuel nozzles for aircraft engines. But Norsk and Boeing said the titanium parts are the first printed structural components designed to bear the stress of an airframe in flight. Norsk said it will print initially in Norway, but aims to have nine printers running by year-end at a 67,000-square-foot (6,220-square-meter) facility in Plattsburgh, New York.

The comments from Boeing 737 MAX chief project engineer and deputy programme manager Michael Teal came as the smaller 737 MAX 9 completed its first airport taxi test in Seattle on Wednesday. That aircraft will make its first test flight in Seattle on Thursday, weather permitting, he said. Boeing began marketing the 737 MAX 10X as an option to customers this year but has yet to receive any orders for the fuel-efficient single-aisle jetliner, which competes against the popular Airbus SE <AIR.PA> A321neo. Teal said the design of the 737 MAX 10X would be firmed up by the end of this year and customers could receive the aircraft in 2020 depending on orders. “We’ll determine (the delivery date) when we launch that program when the customers show the interest and they buy the airplane,” he said on a conference call with reporters. “Sales teams are out meeting with customers today.” He did not specify at what date deliveries by 2020 would become unlikely if orders were not received. Boeing in March said it had approached India’s SpiceJet Ltd <SPJT.BO> and Jet Airways Ltd <JET.NS> as it gauged interest in the aircraft. However, the heads of two major aircraft leasing companies have said the MAX 10X holds no particular attraction for their customers and would eat into rentals of other MAX models. The 737 MAX 10X has a body 66 inches (167 centimetres) longer than the second-largest family member, the 737 MAX 9, and adds 12 seats. It will require longer landing gear as a result. Teal said the landing gear were still in the development stage, with several concepts in prototype testing. “We won’t hit the firm configuration on the gear and really the complete airplane until the end of this year,” he said. “All of the development tests are proving positive and we are well on our way to firming up that configuration and moving forward into production.” The first 737 MAX 9 customer delivery is expected next year, while the first 737 MAX 8 should be delivered next month, Teal said.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:05 PM, April 13, 2017 SYDNEY - Boeing Co <BA.N> could begin delivering the 737 MAX 10X aircraft in 2020 if airlines start ordering the largest version of its 737 MAX family this year, a senior executive of the aeroplane manufacturer said on Thursday. The comments from Boeing 737 MAX chief project engineer and deputy program manager Michael Teal came as the smaller 737 MAX 9 completed its first airport taxi test in Seattle on Wednesday. That aircraft will make its first test flight in Seattle on Thursday, weather permitting, he said. Boeing began marketing the 737 MAX 10X as an option to customers this year but has yet to receive any orders for the fuel-efficient single-aisle jetliner, which competes against the popular Airbus SE <AIR.PA> A321neo. Teal said the design of the 737 MAX 10X would be firmed up by the end of this year and customers could receive the aircraft in 2020 depending on orders. "We'll determine (the delivery date) when we launch that program when the customers show the interest and they buy the airplane," he said on a conference call with reporters. "Sales teams are out meeting with customers today." He did not specify at what date deliveries by 2020 would become unlikely if orders were not received. Boeing in March said it had approached India's SpiceJet Ltd <SPJT.BO> and Jet Airways Ltd <JET.NS> as it gauged interest in the aircraft. However, the heads of two major aircraft leasing companies have said the MAX 10X holds no particular attraction for their customers and would eat into rentals of other MAX models. The 737 MAX 10X has a body 66 inches (167 centimeters) longer than the second-largest family member, the 737 MAX 9, and adds 12 seats. It will require longer landing gear as a result. Teal said the landing gear were still in the development stage, with several concepts in prototype testing. "We won't hit the firm configuration on the gear and really the complete airplane until the end of this year," he said. "All of the development tests are proving positive and we are well on our way to firming up that configuration and moving forward into production." The first 737 MAX 9 customer delivery is expected next year, while the first 737 MAX 8 should be delivered next month, Teal said.

FIONA MACDONALD 13 APR 2017   For the past year, it's been hard not to get caught up in the hype surrounding the 'impossible' EM Drive - the fuel-less propulsion system that defies Newton's third law, and yet continues to produce a small but unexplained amount of thrust in test after test. Things got particularly interesting in December, when the Chinese government claimed they were already testing an EM Drive in space, and an anonymous source told the IB Times that the US was doing the same thing on board the military's mysterious space plane, X-37B. Five months later and those rumours are still circulating on blogs and news sites. So what's going on?   In case you've missed it, X-37B, or Boeing X-37, is a solar-powered, unmanned space plane that's been orbiting Earth for more than a record-breaking 678 days straight... but we still don't really know what it's doing up there. Launched by the US Air Force in May 2015, the government has remained relatively tight-lipped about how long the plane will stay in space, and exactly what its purpose is. Naturally, there's no shortage of conspiracy theories out there, covering everything from spying on the Middle East, space bombing (which isn't actually possible), and keeping tabs on China's ill-fated space station. But the US military has always maintained that the mission is less about spying, and instead will "explore reusable space vehicle technologies in support of long-term objectives".  Which is where the EM Drive rumours come in - the basic idea is that there's an EM Drive on board X-37B, allowing scientists back on Earth to remotely test the controversial propulsion system in space without gravity and friction interfering. The EM Drive is a little like the Kardashian of the science world - it hasn't been proven to actually do anything as yet, but, still, we can't stop reading about it.   The appeal lies in the fact that the propulsion system theoretically works not by burning up heavy rocket fuel, but by bouncing microwaves back and forth to produce thrust. On paper, that suggests a similar propulsion system capable of generating enough 'push' could get humans to Mars in a ridiculous 70 days, and could revolutionise space travel as we know it. But that's if it actually works at all.  Early tests, including a recent NASA study published in the Journal of Propulsion and Power, have shown that the EM Drive does produce thrust, but no one has been able to rule out that it isn't caused by an artefact or interference. "Thrust data from forward, reverse, and null suggested that the system was consistently performing at 1.2 ± 0.1 mN/kW, which was very close to the average impulsive performance measured in air," the NASA team wrote in their paper. "A number of error sources were considered and discussed." But even researchers experimenting on the drive struggle to explain how it might work, seeing as it appears to defy Newton's third law of motion: that every action must have an equal and opposite reaction. That means something has to be pushed out from one end in order to produce thrust the other direction. The EM Drive has no propellants to blast out, and so technically shouldn't be able to produce thrust. One of the best ways to get to the bottom of all this would be to reduce the effect of variables such as friction and air pressure and test the drive in space - which is why the Chinese government and a US inventor, have all expressed interest in doing just that (and in China's case, may already be doing it). But what about the US military and X-37B rumours? To be clear, the US government hasn't confirmed it's even interested in testing out the EM Drive in space at this early stage, and it's not clear whether or not they had access to a completed design back in 2015 when X-37B launched. But there is some scant evidence behind the rumours. Other than the anonymous tip off reported by IB Times last year, a lot of speculation is based on a technology transfer contract approved by the UK Ministry of Defence and signed by Boeing back in 2007. The contract itself doesn't give much away, but it does specify that it allows Boeing - the creator of X-37B - to research the EM Drive for 10 years. There have also been rumours in the past that Boeing was working with the EM Drive's inventor, British engineer Roger Shawyer - although Boeing has later said they're no longer interested in the device. What the US government has said is that X-37B is officially testing a Hall-effect thruster built by Aerojet Rocketdyne. A Hall-effect thrust is another promising new propulsion system being investigated by NASA, which is capable of generating force of 60 millinewtons per kilowatt, an order of magnitude more than the EM Drive. But it still relies on propellants, so doesn't overcome the problem of future missions being weighed down by rocket fuel. So, where does this leave us? The reality is there's not a whole lot of evidence to go on when it comes to an EM Drive being tested on X-37B, and so everyone needs to chill out until we hear something official, or see the results of some of these rumoured space tests make it to a peer-reviewed journal. But the fact that the space plane is testing out at least one innovative propulsion system is a good sign for the future of space travel in general. And if any of these rumours do turn out to be true, it would be pretty huge. Let's face it, the quicker we can figure out if the EM Drive really works or not, the quicker we can move on with our lives.  More From ScienceAlert Learn How to Make Professional Apps With the Ultimate Android Development Bundle Go from beginner to expert. 48 minutes ago Astronomers Have Discovered a Sizeable Object Lurking at the Edge of Our Solar System Planet Nine's got a friend. 1 hour ago Gravity Might Destroy the Possibility of Electromagnetic Symmetry in the Universe Electromagnetism is broken. 3 hours ago Engineers Just Submitted an Incredible Proposal to Turn the US Border Wall Into a Hyperloop Hyperloop FTW! 5 hours ago NASA Just Put Earth Up for Adoption, Because We've Really Messed It Up Free to good home: one planet. 23 hours ago Physicists Say They've Created a Fluid With 'Negative Mass' Holy crap. 1 day ago Australian Scientists Discover More Than 50 New Spider Species on a Single Expedition Fantastic news for everybody! 1 day ago     LOAD MORE

Trump first told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill two vacancies on the agency's five-member board that have prevented the bank from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over $10 million. Trump's picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. Trump told the Journal that the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank being "featherbedding" for wealthy corporations. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enables them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank´s acting chairman, Charles "CJ" Hall, was not immediately available for comment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who have worked in Congress to kill the bank, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump's about-face on the export bank comes after meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation's aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Trump also met at the White House on Feb. 23 with GE CEO Jeff Immelt and Caterpillar Inc CEO Mark Sutton, both vocal supporters of the bank. It is not known if they discussed the bank at those meetings. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. "This is an encouraging development on a key competitive issue for U.S manufacturers and their extensive supply chains," Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said in statement to Reuters. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which includes companies like Ingersoll-Rand Plc , United States Steel Corp and Pfizer Inc, cheered the move. "Manufacturers are encouraged by President Trump´s vocal support for the bank," said NAM Vice President of International Economic Affairs Linda Dempsey in a statement. A 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in Congress allowed the bank's charter to expire for five months. After overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the bank's charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines. Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity, two groups funded by the Republican donor Koch brothers, worked aggressively for years to kill the bank. Brothers Charles and David Koch have opposed the bank for what they call damaging interference into the free market by government. Nathan Nascimento, Freedom Partners vice president of policy, called the bank on Wednesday "the epitome of what's wrong with Washington." "Reopening the flood gates to Ex-Im´s corporate welfare is a bad deal for hardworking taxpayers and a bad deal for American businesses," he said. The Club for Growth, which spends heavily in electing conservative candidates and was one of the few groups to campaign against Trump during the Republican primary in 2016, also lamented the change in position. "Ex-Im has a long history of cronyism and corruption that is well-known to many in the Trump Administration, and while we hoped it would be done away with, the administration now has taken on the almost impossible challenge of reforming a federal agency whose mission has been to pick winners and losers with taxpayer dollars," spokesman Doug Sachtleben said in a statement to Reuters.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript A rare U.S.-Iran business deal. Boeing signed a tentative agreement valued at $3 billion to sell 30 737 MAX jets to Iran's Aseman Airlines. And Aseman has options to buy another 30 airplanes. It's the first major business deal between an American and Iranian company since President Donald Trump took office. Trump has been critical of Iran, saying he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact. Boeing said it negotiated the deal after getting permission from Washington. But this deal will still be subject to U.S. government approvals. After the Obama administration agreed to the sanctions deal, Boeing agreed to sell 80 aircraft to Iran's flag carrier, Iran Air. Trump so far has not weighed in the aircraft deals. Boeing cited something dear to Trump's heart - Commerce Department data suggesting that a sale would create or sustain about 18,000 jobs in the U.S. Boeing shares ascending at the market open, adding to their 14 percent gain this year.

Passengers on board flight QF29 from Melbourne to Hong Kong were about an hour from their destination when the drama unfolded last Friday, lasting about two minutes. The airline said customers experienced "unexpected in-flight turbulence" on the Boeing 747. "We notified the ATSB (Australian Transport Safety Bureau) of the occurrence, and our own teams are also reviewing the event," a spokeswoman said. The ATSB said the flight crew had to disconnect the autopilot and manoeuvre the aircraft after the warning. It classified the incident as serious. The "stick-shaker" warning is a device that causes the flight's control yoke to shake noisily and warn the pilot of an imminent stall. According to Boeing it takes a physical, rather than visual, form so that crew members will be alerted even if they are not looking at the panel at the time. © AAP 2017 Disasters Accidents Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Trump Now Seems More Bullish For China Than Anyone Had Imagined April 12, 2017 10:35am NASDAQ:MCHI ShareTweet Crisis averted—for now. Last week President Donald Trump met for the first time with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his luxury Palm Beach estate Mar-a-Lago, where the two leaders discussed North Korea and trade, among other topics. Several times before I’ve commented on the implications of a possible U.S.-China trade war in response to Trump’s repeated calls to raise tariffs on goods shipped in from the Asian giant. On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to name China a currency manipulator and even suggested that, were he to become president, he would serve Xi a “McDonald’s hamburger” instead of a big state dinner. I’m happy to say that no Big Macs appeared to be on the menu last week. Nor were there any immediate signs of a disastrous trade war. In a much-needed win for Trump, the two leaders agreed on a 100-day assessment of the trade imbalance between the world’s two largest economies. In addition, Xi pledged to give the U.S. better market access to important Chinese industries such as financials and consumer staples. Specifically, he conceded to lift China’s ban on U.S. beef imports, in place since 2003. Perhaps Trump is the master negotiator he’s always claimed to be. As encouraging as this news is, it will likely take a while before significant improvement can be made in balancing trade between the two nations. In 2016, the U.S. trade deficit with China stood at a staggering $347 billion, down from $367 billion in 2015. click to enlarge China’s Importance as a Trading Partner Should Only Increase My use of the word “crisis” above was not made lightly. China is currently America’s third-largest export market after Canada and Mexico, having bought $116 billion worth of U.S. merchandise in 2016. That’s up from $19 billion in 2001, an increase of 510 percent. The U.S., in other words, really can’t afford a trade war with such an important trading partner. On Tuesday, the president tweeted that China would get a “far better” deal with the U.S. “if they solve the North Korean problem.” But then, it’s the U.S. that’s seeking a better deal from the Chinese, not the other way around. I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2017 Among the most valuable U.S. exports to China are, in descending order, oilseeds and grains, aerospace products and parts, motor vehicles and electronic components such as semiconductors. Since 2010, China has been the world’s top purchaser of light vehicles manufactured by General Motors, and today it’s an exploding market for aerospace and defense companies. Between 2010 and 2015, China surpassed Japan, the U.K., Canada and France to become the number one importer of U.S aerospace and defense equipment, according to Deloitte. The Asian country spent $16.48 billion on American-made civilian aircrafts, engines and aviation parts in 2015, up more than 180 percent from five years earlier. Boeing is currently China’s leading provider of commercial jets. Back in September, the Chicago-based aerospace company announced that China was in need of more than 6,800 new aircrafts over the next 20 years, an ongoing enterprise valued at roughly $1 trillion. So crucial is the Chinese market that Boeing, in cooperation with Chinese aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), just began construction on a Boeing 737 completion center in the island-city of Zhoushan. The center is Boeing’s first-ever overseas facility. By 2018, it should be capable of delivering as many as 100 737s per year. Demand for health care goods and services is also set to expand dramatically as the country’s population ages. By 2030, an estimated 345 million Chinese will be over the age of 60, necessitating even more medicines, treatments and medical devices. Once this 100-day assessment period ends, my hope is that the U.S. and China can continue to work on strengthening trade. China should continue to be a valuable partner as its gross domestic product (GDP) grows and its citizens’ incomes rise. As I shared with you in February, Morgan Stanley projects the country to become a high-income nation sometime between 2024 and 2027. Looking ahead, the Asian country could conceivably become America’s number one export market—provided Trump can hash out a better trade deal without inciting retaliatory trade blockades. The iShares MSCI China Index Fund (NASDAQ:MCHI) was trading at $50.20 per share on Wednesday morning, up $0.2 (+0.40%). Year-to-date, MCHI has gained 14.80%, versus a 5.01% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

While previously the company had said it would offer the Extended Range ('fat tank') variant of its CH-47F Chinook, Steve Barlage, senior manager of Vertical Lift Global Sales and Deputy Country Team Leader for Germany and Israel, said it is currently briefing the Luftwaffe on what solutions it might be able to offer ahead of the release of formal request for proposals (RFP). "It would be premature for us to talk about what our actual offer is going to be, as we haven't yet received the solicitation," Barlage said, adding, "What we have been doing is bringing the Luftwaffe up to speed on what our current offerings could be, and to help them understand the variations between the standard CH-47F and the extended-range aircraft, and what the Block 2 might actually be, and what we can do in terms of unique modifications [avionics, communications equipment, etc]. "It is a requirements-driven programme, rather than trying to shoehorn an airplane to fit the requirements. We want to make sure that we can offer the right product, at the right price, and to the right schedule," he said. Germany is expected to issue a formal RFP for an expected 41 helicopters (with options to take the buy-up to 60) in 2018, with the selected platform entering Bundeswehr service in about 2023. "The question is 'what are the requirements in Germany?', and they are basically unknown at this time," Barlage said. "Everybody is currently working on what they think they are going to be, versus what the Germans are actually going to be asking for. From our perspective, our offer is going to be broad enough that we can modify and put the customer's unique requirements into the airframe - we are talking about adaptability, flexibility, and affordability."

Maryville University is launching an aggressive effort designed to do just that. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union, aviation giant Boeing, and Scott Air Force base have all hosted STEM programs for metro area students. Maryville University is opening a center for access and achievement to help youngsters in low income school districts succeed in science, technology, engineering and math. Maryville already offers young scholars from St. Louis area schools, including those in the Ferguson Florissant district, access to science and robotics programs, and that's not all. The goal is to reach children as early as possible and inspire them to reach their full potential. This summer Maryville University will be teaching 200 middle and high school students how to make apps on their own iPads.

Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday: RUSSIA Russian President Vladimir Putin says trust has eroded between the United States and Russia under Trump as Moscow gives an unusually hostile reception to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a face-off over Syria. Russia blocks a Western effort at the U.N. Security Council to condemn last week's deadly gas attack in Syria. ECONOMIC ISSUES Trump says his administration will not label China a currency manipulator, backing away from a campaign promise, even as he says the dollar is "getting too strong" and eventually will hurt the U.S. economy. Trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen to a new four-year term as Federal Reserve chair. Trump plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, his office says, a victory for American manufacturers like Boeing Co and General Electric Co which have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products. NATO Trump says NATO is not obsolete, as he had declared on the campaign trail last year, but that alliance members still need to pay their fair share for the security umbrella. NORTH KOREA The Trump administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including an oil embargo, banning its airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials say. Chinese President Xi Jinping calls for peaceful resolution of rising tension on the Korean peninsula in a telephone conversation with Trump, as a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group heads toward the region. TAXES House Speaker Paul Ryan's tax reform blueprint appears to be losing its status as the likely framework for the first major tax overhaul since 1986, with rival approaches emerging from the White House and Congress. Trump says he does not like the "border adjustment" tax formulated by Ryan and other Republicans in the House of Representatives and wants to call it an "import tax" or "reciprocal tax." HEALTHCARE Trump tells the Wall Street Journal he might consider withholding billions of dollars of Obamacare payments to health insurers to force Democrats back to the negotiating table on healthcare. POSSIBLE CONFLICTS A Democratic senator is pressing Deutsche Bank to release information about issues including Trump's debt and any bank meetings with Trump administration officials, saying he had "great concern" about possible conflicts of interest. SPICER White House spokesman Sean Spicer says he had let Trump down with his "inexcusable and reprehensible" comments comparing the use of poison gas by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to the atrocities of Adolf Hitler.

Go on admit it. In the public consciousness, the word “apprentice” is linked with the phrase: “You’re fired.” But it wasn’t always like this. Apprenticeships were once prized by generations of strivers, who understood that they offered a passport to a skilled job and a better life for them and their family. An apprentice wasn’t somebody who tried to browbeat their opponents in an attempt to win Lord Sugar’s approval. They were the ultimate team players who kept the wheels of industry turning. The decline of apprenticeships in the 1980s and early 1990s was one of the saddest signs of Britain’s industrial decay. While our rivals – notably in Germany – believed that the long-term nurturing of the workforce could yield benefits, Britain fell behind. Today, the EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, is exasperated by the number of skilled engineering vacancies that remain stubbornly hard to fill. Every time I meet an experienced business leader in the manufacturing sector, they express fears about how they will replace staff nearing retirement. They are also worried about the lack of girls taking STEM (science, technology engineering and mathematics) subjects. The absence of women in engineering is posing a long-term threat to our economy. Brexit is certainly concentrating minds about our lack of home-grown talent. For decades, careers advisers have not been steering sufficient numbers of young people towards engineering. Sadly, many outside the sector believe engineering jobs vanished with the traditional ‘smoke stack’ industries. A trip, for example, to the University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre with Boeing would quickly change their minds. The AMRC helps manufacturers of all sizes raise their game by introducing the most advanced techniques. The AMRC is helping Rolls-Royce to transform the production of components for passenger jets. This is light years from the world of rags and spanners. So you might think that there would be universal approval for a new Government initiative which aims to create millions of apprentices. But the Apprenticeship Levy, which has come into force this month, has proved controversial. Following the 2015 General Election, the Government set a target of achieving three million new apprenticeship “starts” by 2020. It announced plans for the new levy on large employers. The Enterprise Act 2016 introduced greater legal protection for the term ‘apprenticeship’ and established the Institute for Apprenticeships; which administers apprenticeship standards. A levy-paying employer can receive funds to spend on apprenticeships. The Government believes this bold move will ensure we have a workforce that will prosper in the post-Brexit world. But this smacks of asking industry, and training providers, to move from famine to feast with alarming speed. Is it wise to flood the economy with millions of apprentices, without any real assessment of which sectors have the greatest need? The focus should be on the quality of training – and the potential for career progression – rather than sheer weight of numbers. According to the CBI, companies will pay a colossal £3bn a year into the levy. Will they really be getting value for money? I doubt it. And I’m not the only voice of dissent. The House of Commons Sub-Committee on Education, Skills and the Economy has highlighted a “worrying lack of focus on the sectors of the economy where training or upskilling are, and will be, most needed” in connection with the apprenticeship levy. The committee concluded: “The three million target and the apprenticeship levy are likely to improve skills levels in the economy, but are not sufficient in themselves. They are both blunt instruments that risk being unduly focused on simply raising participation.” A report from the EEF found that more than a third of manufacturers did not see any benefits from the apprenticeship levy. The CBI is worried about the lack of “fully-developed success measures and long-term goals” linked to the levy, as well as ineffective careers guidance in schools. This is the biggest stumbling block, which the MPs highlighted. The absence of deep-rooted ties between many employers and schools makes it hard to see how the scheme will work as planned. A smarter approach would involve carrying out a study to establish the sectors where apprentices are needed the most. The Government could then target support in those areas. It should also order careers advisers to take pupils around our world-leading manufacturing plants. It shouldn’t be long before this problem starts to correct itself. I fear the Government has gone to work with a blunderbuss, when a scalpel was required. Greg Wright is the deputy business editor of the The Yorkshire Post.

His wife Svetlana, 44, son Konstantin, 10, and four-year-old daughter Diana were among 71 people killed in a plane crash caused by a mistake made by Swiss air traffic controller Peter Nielsen in 2002. In a chilling, dark, revenge killing that has inspired new Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Aftermath, Vitaly, now 61, spent weeks hunting Nielsen down. And after confronting him at his home, Vitaly stabbed him to death in front of Nielsen’s three children. Yet Vitaly insists he had not set out with murder in mind. He says: “I went to Nielsen as a father who loves his children so he could see the photos of my dead children and, next to them, his kids, who were alive.” Vitaly killed air traffic controller after jet crash (Photo: AFP) The Tupolev Tu-154 passenger jet were killed collided with a Boeing 757 cargo jet in 2002 (Photo: Getty) Arnold Schwarzenegger in new film Aftermath (Photo: FREE TO USE) But in the confrontation on February 24, 2004, the photos fell to the ground and Vitaly snapped, claiming he felt like his son and daughter were being “thrown around in their coffins”. He then repeatedly plunged the 14cm blade into the heart, stomach and face of 36-year-old Nielsen. The tragic chain of events was the basis for Aftermath, with Terminator star Arnie, 69, playing traumatised husband and father Roman who, like Vitaly, exacts the ultimate revenge. The film’s British director Elliott Lester says dad-of-five Arnie was hugely affected by the role. “Arnie knew this could have been his own family. In one scene the central character finds his daughter’s body and Arnie knew that it could have been his daughter, Christina. So he had no problem accessing the emotions. “In another scene, Roman is in a room filled with body bags and he knows his family are there next to him. Arnie just sobbed. Normally it takes actors a long time to work up the tears, some even have to put drops in their eyes, but there was none of that with Arnie. “It touched everybody watching. There wasn’t a dry eye on set the day we filmed that scene. He was very affected by ­Vitaly’s story.” Victim Peter Nielsen (Photo: CREDIT : LARS LINDSKOV) Read More The heartbreaking multiple tragedies behind true-life plane crash that drove a dad to murder The horrific crash which wrecked Vit­aly’s life happened over Uberlingen, a city in southern Germany, on July 1, 2002. A Boeing 757 cargo jet collided with a Tupolev Tu-154 passenger jet at 35,000ft. All 60 passengers, including 45 children, and nine crew on Bashkirian Airlines Flight 2937 died. As did the two men flying DHL Flight 611 from Italy to Belgium. One of the pilots was Captain Paul Phillips, 47, from Liverpool. Svetlana, Konstantin and Diana Kaloyev, who lived in Vladikavkaz in southern Russia, had been heading to Barcelona for a month’s holiday with engineer Vitaly, who was working in Spain. When he learned of the disaster, Vitaly went to the scene and found the body of his daughter, still intact as trees had broken her fall, two miles from the crash site. Svetlana’s body had landed in a corn field, while Konstantin’s body had hit the road in front of a bus shelter. Vitaly’s grief was overwhelming. In an online eulogy for his son, he wrote: “He would have become a good, well-educated person, useful to society, were it not for this tragedy, which I cannot get over. I have no strength.” Read More Tragic MTV star Clay Adler saves "four or five lives" with dying wish of organ donation after desert suicide Kaloyev went to the scene of the crash and found the bodies of his wife, son and daughter (Photo: Reuters) Two Russian planes collided, killing everyone on board, following a mistake by air traffic controller Peter Nielsen (Photo: REUTERS/Dmitry Petrochenko) Vitaly stopped work, stopped shaving and always wore black. He returned to the family home in Vladikavkas and turned it into a shrine to his dead family. Photos show beds covered with dolls, a schoolboy’s chessboard and boxes of his wife’s favourite scent. He spent his life savings on an elaborate tombstone. At the time of the crash Nielsen, part of Swiss air traffic control, had been manning two workstations while a colleague rested. He only realised the two planes were on a collision course a minute before impact, and only gave the pilots 43 seconds to react. An investigation found he told the passenger plane crew to descend by 1,000ft but a second after they changed course the in-built traffic collision avoidance system – TCAS – told them to climb instead.

Had both aircraft followed the automated instructions, the collision would not have happened. But unaware of the TCAS instructions, Nielsen repeated his order to the Russian crew and they ignored the automated warning. The Boeing’s tail stabiliser sliced through Flight 2937 just ahead of the wings. The Russian plane broke up in mid-air, while the pilots of the cargo plane endured a terrifying three-minute plunge to the ground. Nielsen, who quit his job and suffered a nervous breakdown, admitted he was to blame. He said: “As a father, I sense that this loss leaves a gap that will hurt.” Vitaly used a private investigator to track Nielsen down to his home in Kloten, near Zürich. He sat outside until Nielsen emerged, then carried out the attack. He was arrested in Switzerland and charged with murder . During his trial, he said: “I have been living in the cemetery for almost two years, sitting behind their graves. I cannot live any more, I simply exist.” In October 2005, he was found guilty and sentenced to eight years in prison but served three years after an appeal. Vitaly got a hero’s welcome when he returned to Vladikavkaz. He is now a deputy minister of construction. He took justice into his own hands but Vitaly has said killing Nielsen “didn’t make me feel any better”. Aftermath is in cinemas now.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close The Associated Press President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with business leaders in the State Department Library on the White House complex in Washington, Tuesday, April 11, 2017.   (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) 3 big ways Trump is starting to sound like Obama on the economy By Max Ehrenfreund • Washington Post 8 hrs ago (…) President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with business leaders in the State Department Library on the White House complex in Washington, Tuesday, April 11, 2017.   (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The Associated Press President Donald Trump's economic policy appears to be moving closer to former President Barack Obama's. In an interview Wednesday with the Wall Street Journal, Trump reversed his stance on three economic issues, moving closer to the policies of his predecessor. Trump has continually changed his policies since launching his presidential campaign in 2015, and whether his latest statements represent a shift or a one-off set of comments remains to be seen. But if Trump follows through on his latest promises, he'll have adopted a large segment of Obama's economic platform. 1. The Export-Import Bank. Trump on Wednesday said he supports the Export-Import Bank, an agency that subsidizes U.S. exports and is detested by conservative lawmakers. The right points out that much of the bank's aid goes to large corporations such as Boeing, which conservatives say don't need help from the government. During the campaign, Trump initially opposed the bank, calling it "feather bedding." "I don't like it because I don't think it's necessary," he said in 2015. The bank mainly helps "a few companies — and these are companies that can do very well without it." Later in the campaign, though, Trump seemed to moderate that opposition, and a pair of Democratic senators said earlier this year the president had told them he had come around to supporting the agency. Trump acknowledged his position had changed in his interview with the Wall Street Journal. "It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped," Trump said. "Instinctively, you would say, 'Isn't that a ridiculous thing.' ... But actually, it's a very good thing." Obama and many mainstream Republicans also supported the Export-Import Bank, arguing that the United States must compete with other countries that have similar agencies for promoting exports. 2. China. During the campaign, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. On the 83rd day, he told the Wall Street Journal that Beijing is not manipulating its currency. "They're not currency manipulators," Trump said. Countries can manipulate the currency in order to make their exports cheaper and give their factories and workers an advantage. When countries buy up foreign currencies and sell their own, the price of their own currencies on the global market falls, allowing their exports to trade at a discount.

This was also Obama's view. Although he, like Trump, accused China of manipulation as a candidate, his administration never formally declared China a manipulator. Trump's Treasury Department is scheduled to release a report on currency manipulation in the coming days. 3. Janet Yellen. Perhaps the most consequential endorsement Trump gave Obama in the interview was a compliment to Janet Yellen, who Obama nominated to be chair of the Federal Reserve. During the campaign, Trump accused Yellen of manipulating interest rates to help Obama politically, as lower rates boosted economic growth. He suggested to the Washington Post that Yellen and her colleagues' policy of maintaining interest rates near zero could inflate a "bubble where you go into a very massive recession." But asked on Wednesday whether he would look for a replacement for Yellen when her term expires next year, the president declined to say, suggesting Yellen might be allowed to stay on. "I like her. I respect her," Trump said. "It's very early." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business. Get twice-daily updates on what the St. Louis business community is talking about.

Sprunk)  see less | View Image Page MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, GA, UNITED STATES 04.08.2017 Story by Airman 1st Class Lauren Sprunk  Moody Air Force Base ✔ ✗ Subscribe 6 Growing up, they sat outside their father’s job watching him fly, dreaming of doing the same one day. The older brother joined the Air Force and earned his wings and his little brother followed close in his footsteps. When the older brother was assigned the A-10C Thunderbolt II, his little brother jumped in his shoes, chasing the same experience. Once he was stationed at Moody Air Force Base, his little brother followed, bringing them the closest they’d been since childhood. For the first time, his little brother was no longer following in his shadow, but on his wing, soaring through the sky right by his side. They were not only brothers, they were partners, wingmen. Maj. Matthew Shelly, 23d Wing director of inspections and a pilot with the 74th Fighter Squadron, and his little brother, Capt. Christopher Shelly, 76th Fighter Squadron chief of standards and evaluations, flew in formation together for the first time, April 8, 2017, over Moody Air Force Base, Ga. “Flying with my little brother was super cool,” said Matt. “It was like when were kids and would go out on adventures on our bikes armed with sling-shots and water guns to fight imaginary bad guys in the woods. “Only this time, we were riding 40,000 pound A-10s and armed with BDU-33 bombs and 30 mm rounds to shoot imaginary bad guys on the bombing range.” With a father who was an avid pilot for Boeing Company, the Shelly brothers learned to fly at a young age and both became civilian private pilots in high school. After being involved in Air Force ROTC, Matt began his career as a pilot in the Air Force. Witnessing Matt’s new lifestyle, Chris soon decided he wanted to be a part of it. “I had always thought about joining the military as a pilot,” said Chris. “But, the moment I knew I really wanted to pursue it was when I attended Matt’s drop night and saw that he was assigned the A-10. I saw the camaraderie that all of the pilots had and I decided that was what I wanted to do.” With his dream in sight, he turned to his older brother for advice. Matt knew that his little brother wanted to be in the cockpit of the world famous “hawg,” so he advised him to join the Air Force Reserve. By taking that route, he was able to decide for himself what unit he wanted to be a part of, what aircraft to fly, and where he wanted to live. “I would be lying if I said that I would be an A-10 pilot without my brother’s help,” said Chris. “Ever since I joined the Air Force, I’ve called him for advice. Even today, as I go through [pilot certification] upgrades he’s already been through, I look through his past experiences to see the best path to take.” Once he joined the reserve, Chris was able to select not only the same aircraft as his brother, but become part of his Flying Tigers team at Moody, a very rare opportunity for both of them. Since Chris arrived here more than two years ago, the brothers have been trying to schedule their flight together, but, until now, schedule conflicts and various circumstances have always stood in their way. During their flight, Matt fulfilled the position of flight lead, a role that came natural to him given their relationship. “As the flight lead, it is my job to ensure my wingman knows where to be and what to kill, but along with that, it is the flight lead’s responsibility to protect and guide the wingman,” said Matt. “I think it is natural for a big brother to want to protect his little brother. It ended up being just like when we were kids and it was my job to make sure the neighbor kids didn’t pick on my brothers.” Although Matt has served as his little brother’s guardian against others, they have always been competitive with each other, a rivalry that stood out during their flight. “Our relationship is exactly the same now as when were kids,” said Matt. “Sibling rivalry is still alive and well in the Shelly family and that came out on the bombing range. Turns out, I am the better bomber by 5 to 1, but Chris is better at shooting the gun, so we were both able to go home with bragging rights.” Although their day was one to remember and a very cool experience for the both of them personally, it was also monumental for the Air Force. Their experience demonstrated the existence of total force integration, the use of multiple components of the Air Force, which can include active duty, reserve or guard, to maintain and grow the force’s operational capability and functionality. While very unique to have two brothers flying together, it is not rare to have active duty Airmen and reservists training and fighting together in order to achieve the overall mission. Despite how often they work, Airmen, especially fighter pilots, are a total force family, something Matt was able to say after witnessing it during his flight with his brother. “Flying with my little brother really opened my perspective on how special it is to be a part of a fighter squadron,” said Matt. “It was crazy how familiar it was flying with my brother. That may be because I am always flying with my brother, maybe not my biological brother, but every wingman that has ever flown on my wing, whether they’re active duty, reservist, or guardsman, qualifies as my brother in every sense of the term.” LEAVE A COMMENT NEWS INFO Date Taken: 04.08.2017 Date Posted: 04.12.2017 16:36 Story ID: 230185 Location: MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, GA, US  Hometown: WICHITA, KS, US Web Views: 51 Downloads: 1 Podcast Hits: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN   This work, Pilots take brotherhood to new heights, by A1C Lauren Sprunk, identified by DVIDS, is free of known copyright restrictions under U.S. copyright law.

(David Goldman/AP) Delta Air tops profit estimate, may cut wide-body jet orders Add to ... Ankit Ajmera Bengaluru — Reuters Published Wednesday, Apr. 12, 2017 5:04PM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Apr. 12, 2017 5:05PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Delta Air Lines Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday and said it may consider reducing its orders for wide-body aircraft as the industry struggles with excess capacity. The No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic had $17.64-billion worth of pending orders for wide-body aircraft with France’s Airbus Group SE at current list prices, according to the planemaker’s order book. “We continue to see excess capacity in wide-bodies as we look to the future for the industry as a whole,” Delta Chief Executive Edward Bastian said on a conference call with analysts. “We’re in discussion with our OEM partners on what that means. And you could anticipate some reductions ... broadly over the next several years.” The carrier had no pending orders for wide-body jets with Boeing Co, the recent order book of the world’s biggest planemaker showed. Delta forecast second-quarter passenger unit revenue, a closely watched revenue measure, to increase 1-3 per cent, citing improving demand and average fares. The company also said March marked the first month of positive passenger unit revenue since November 2015, and it expected the measure to remain positive throughout the rest of the year. “We will keep our full-year capacity growth capped at 1 per cent to support this unit revenue momentum and the company’s return to margin expansion,” Delta President Glen Hauenstein said in a statement. The company’s shares closed down 0.5 pct at $45.05, after rising as much as much as 4.2 per cent earlier in the day. Delta said it canceled about 4,000 flights earlier this month due to severe weather in Atlanta, and that it would reduce its second-quarter pre-tax income by $125-million. However, the company forecast second-quarter operating margin in a range of 17-19 per cent, which was higher than the expectations of some analysts. “Investors may view the company’s (second-quarter passenger unit revenue) guidance as ‘aggressive’ given recent guidance missteps, but the guidance was still much better than expectations especially when considered the storm impact,” Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said. Becker was expecting Delta’s operating margins in a range of 15.5-17.5 per cent. Delta cut its first-quarter passenger unit revenue forecast twice this year, citing slower-than-expected improvement in average fare prices for flights booked at the last minute. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 77 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 75 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Max Ehrenfreund By Max Ehrenfreund April 12 at 5:27 PM Follow @MaxEhrenfreund President Trump and then-President Barack Obama in the White House in November. (Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency) President Trump's economic policy appears to be moving closer to former president Barack Obama's. In an interview Wednesday with the Wall Street Journal, Trump reversed his stance on three economic issues, moving closer to the policies of his predecessor. Trump has continually changed his policies since launching his presidential campaign in 2015, and whether his latest statements represent a shift or a one-off set of comments remains to be seen. But if Trump follows through on his latest promises, he'll have adopted a large segment of Obama's economic platform. 1. The Export-Import Bank Trump on Wednesday said he supports the Export-Import Bank, an agency that subsidizes U.S. exports and is detested by conservative lawmakers. The right points out that much of the bank's aid goes to large corporations such as Boeing, which conservatives say don't need help from the government. During the campaign, Trump initially opposed the bank, calling it “feather bedding.” “I don’t like it because I don’t think it’s necessary,” he said in 2015. The bank mainly helps “a few companies — and these are companies that can do very well without it.” Later in the campaign, though, Trump seemed to moderate that opposition, and a pair of Democratic senators said earlier this year the president had told them he had come around to supporting the agency. Trump acknowledged his position had changed in his interview with the Wall Street Journal. “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped,” Trump said. “Instinctively, you would say, ‘Isn’t that a ridiculous thing.' ... But actually, it’s a very good thing.” Obama and many mainstream Republicans also supported the Export-Import Bank, arguing that the United States must compete with other countries that have similar agencies for promoting exports. 2. China During the campaign, Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. On the 83rd day, he told the Wall Street Journal that Beijing is not manipulating its currency. “They’re not currency manipulators,” Trump said. Countries can manipulate the currency to make their exports cheaper and give their factories and workers an advantage. When countries buy up foreign currencies and sell their own, the price of their own currencies on the global market falls, allowing their exports to trade at a discount. Most economists agree that China has manipulated its currency in the past but has not continued the practice. This was also Obama's view. Although he, like Trump, accused China of manipulation as a candidate, his administration never formally declared China a manipulator. Trump's Treasury Department is scheduled to release a report on currency manipulation in the coming days. President Trump spoke highly of Chinese President Xi during a press conference at the White House on April 12, but avoided commenting directly on the decision not to label China a currency manipulator. "We're going to see," he said when asked if a deal was struck. (White House) 3. Janet L. Yellen Perhaps the most consequential endorsement Trump gave Obama in the interview was a compliment to Janet L. Yellen, whom Obama nominated to be chair of the Federal Reserve. During the campaign, Trump accused Yellen of manipulating interest rates to help Obama politically, as lower rates boosted economic growth. He suggested to The Washington Post that Yellen and her colleagues' policy of maintaining interest rates near zero could inflate a “bubble where you go into a very massive recession.” But asked on Wednesday whether he would look for a replacement for Yellen when her term expires next year, the president declined to say, suggesting Yellen might be allowed to stay on. “I like her. I respect her,” Trump said. “It’s very early.” business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

While you were sleeping: US bank stocks drop in pre-earning season jitters Nevil Gibson Thursday April 13, 2017 Share Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley Investment Management Play NBR radio on Stocks on Wall Street fell, dragged lower by bank shares a day before Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase kick off the earnings reporting season. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 59.44 points, or 0.3%, to 20,591.86, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.4% to 2344.93. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5% to 5836.16. The Dow’s drop was led by manufacturing exporters Caterpillar, down 2.3%, and Boeing, down 1.4%. Citigroup, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are all set to report their first-quarter earnings before the stock market opens on Thursday, unofficially launching earnings season. Nevertheless, US companies are expected to report their strongest quarterly earnings since 2011, as of March 31, according to FactSet. Solid first-quarter results are needed to support the post-election stocks rally. If stocks are to remain at these levels, earnings must live up to expectations, analysts say. “The market has priced in this earnings recovery,” Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told Dow Jones. He adds that stocks seem to be in “quiet season” ahead of the onslaught of first-quarter earnings and that’s led to some stalling in stock prices. “The good news is, usually when the markets have stalled going into earnings season, it sets up for a good period for stocks during earnings,” he says. Focus on the economy While geopolitical worries from the Middle East to the Korean Peninsula, as well as the timing of US tax reforms and the French presidential election, have attracted investors’ attention, mostly they have focused on the health of the US economy. “Markets are thrown a geopolitical curveball from time to time but economic data is good and there is still every reason to believe in risk,” says Geoffrey Yu, head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management. United Airlines’ stock erased all of its post-passenger eviction scandal losses, advancing as much as 1.4% in intraday trade before closing down 1.1%. This came on the heels of Tuesday’s stock plunge, which wiped about $US255 million off the company’s market cap. Whole Foods Market rose 1,7% after Bloomberg reported Amazon had shown an interest in the retail chain but did not go ahead with the deal. The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note ticked lower to 2.294% from 2.298% on Tuesday. The WSJ Dollar Index fell 0.3% after President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that the dollar “is getting too strong.” Oil prices ended a six-session streak of gains after federal data showed crude output continued its relentless growth. US crude futures settled down 0.54% at $US53.11 a barrel. European stocks recovered, led by oil companies and car makers. The Stoxx Europe 600 index picked up 0.2% to close at 381.90, ending at its highest close since early December 2015. Germany’s DAX 30 rose 0.1%, France’s CAC 40 was down marginally and the UK’s FTSE 100 was down 0.2%.

We also knew that Trump is thoroughly impressionable, meaning that when the lobbyists, the bankers, and the special interests got his ear — and this being the swamp, that was inevitable — they could probably win him over. So when Trump said early in the campaign that he didn't think the Export-Import Bank (at that point it was in liquidation) should exist because the private sector can and does finance exports, I didn't get too excited. He was correct on the specific matter, but his personality suggested that this wouldn't last. His budget chief Mick Mulvaney said on CNBC (transcript via Reason) Wednesday that Trump was now pro-Ex-Im, and the president himself professed his love for Boeing's bank to the Wall Street Journal: The president said he planned to fill two vacancies on the bank's board, which has been effectively paralyzed with three open seats on its five-member board. "It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies," Mr. Trump said. "But also, maybe more important, other countries give [assistance]. When other countries give it we lose a tremendous amount of business." ... "Instinctively, you would say, 'Isn't that a ridiculous thing,'" Mr. Trump said of the Ex-Im Bank. "But actually, it's a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money." His argumentation here couldn't be less sound. He makes three points. All faulty to the extreme. 1) Starting at the end: "it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money." Ex-Im, if proper accounting methods are used, loses a tiny bit of money, according to the Government Accountability Office. But Trump seems to be seeing this government agency as a money-maker for the government. Is this what he meant by running the government like a business? That he was going to displace private sector players (and Ex-Im does displace private-sector financiers) in profitable business in order to profit? Why stop at export finance? Why not open a federal casino? Golf course? Or national health insurer? Also from the Washington Examiner Trump's coal push grinds into high gear Cabinet officials spread out to push clean coal, coal power plants and coal mining. By John Siciliano • 04/13/17 12:01 AM Also, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made money until they didn't, and then they crashed and were bailed out by the taxpayer. Corporate welfare's costs aren't mostly budgetary, but distortionary. I make these arguments at more length here. 2) "other countries give [assistance]. When other countries give it we lose a tremendous amount of business. ..." Most Ex-Im financing is not issued to counter foreign government financing, according to Ex-Im's own documents. Also, foreign governments harm themselves when they subsidize their own exports. Two economists estimate that China harms its economy by 3 percent when it subsidizes its exports. Also from the Washington Examiner Gorsuch begins first day at Supreme Court Justices on Thursday will decide whether to hear cases involving the First Amendment and police shootings. By Ryan Lovelace • 04/13/17 12:01 AM Does Trump know that Ex-Im mostly subsidizes the Chinese government? 3) "lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies. ..." In a typical year, less than 20 percent of Ex-Im's money subsidizes small exporters. In a typical year, about 40 percent of Ex-Im's money subsidizes Boeing exports. This isn't a small-business agency. Even the agency's "small-business" program subsidizes big business. And about 99 percent of small U.S. businesses never get support from Ex-Im. Ex-Im doesn't help the economy. It doesn't drain the swamp. It does boost the president's power to pick winners and losers, and maybe that's why Trump likes it. Timothy P.

Search Watch Live Home UK Brexit Trump World Business Politics Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Security fears scupper £1bn China bid for UK engineer Doncasters Dubai International Capital is to keep hold of the UK engineering firm after the collapse of Xinwei talks, Sky News learns. 06:16, UK, Thursday 13 April 2017 Image: Doncasters is a specialist engineering firm Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail By Mark Kleinman, City Editor A £1bn-plus Chinese takeover of Doncasters Group, one of the UK's oldest engineering firms, has been called off amid US security concerns over the company's defence operations. Sky News has learnt that Dubai International Capital (DIC), Doncasters' owner, has abandoned talks with Beijing Xinwei, a telecoms technology provider. DIC's decision - reached after months of talks - is understood to have been motivated at least in part because of indications from US officials that they would not approve the takeover, City sources said on Wednesday Although its defence business, which makes missile fins and components for weapons launch systems, accounts for less than 5% of total revenues, Doncasters is said to have found separating the division from its wider engineering business fraught with difficulty. Midlands-based Doncasters specialises in working with metals and alloys that are difficult to shape, and employs more than 5,000 people in the UK, US and elsewhere. The company was founded in 1778 when Daniel Doncaster set up a hand-tool casting business in Sheffield, and counts Boeing and Rolls Royce among the customers of its broader aerospace business. In a memo to staff sent in the last few days and seen by Sky News, Doncasters said the sale process had been terminated but did not name Xinwei as the prospective buyer, nor the reasons for calling off the talks. "The DIC Board has voted unanimously to retain full ownership of Doncasters and has closed any ongoing discussions with potential buyers. "While considering a sale of Doncasters, DIC has discussed the company's progress and potential with its financial partners who agree that the business is in a healthy position with significant growth potential." The memo said that DIC's own investors, whose identities are undisclosed, had "expressed confidence in the performance of Doncasters and are supportive of extending DIC's credit agreements". It acknowledged that pursuing the company's existing strategy under DIC's ownership would "best allow Doncasters to continue to serve its customers' best interests without disruption", adding that DIC had "no plans to re-enter into any sale process for several years". Doncasters, which had been the subject of an auction led by Goldman Sachs, is the latest company to face intensifying scrutiny over a possible Chinese takeover. In the UK, Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, ordered a national security probe this week into the takeover of Sepura - which makes communications equipment for the emergency services - by Hytera Communications, a Chinese company. Ministers previously intervened to prevent a Chinese takeover of Sheffield Forgemasters, which makes parts for the UK's fleet of nuclear submarines. The Chinese tycoon behind Xinwei, Wang Jing, was once ranked among the world's richest men. His interest in Doncasters came ahead of proposals, due to be published shortly, for tighter control of foreign investment in the UK's critical national infrastructure. A recently published industrial strategy green paper did not address the issue, which has drawn the attention of Theresa May and her officials. In 2015, the British manufacturer made underlying pre-tax profit of about £120m, sharply lower than the previous year.

Brunell  Entrepreneurs remain key to America's success Guest Column   April 12, 2017 | LXXVII No 3 | View PDF American entrepreneurs’ ability to invent, create and bring products and services to market makes our nation great. Their success generates the tax revenue that fund our schools and puts people to work. Many “big businesses” started in the imaginations of immigrants who came to our country — a place of boundless possibilities. America is a land where your station in life doesn’t matter and where hard work, innovation and perseverance are the keys to success. The story of M&Ms is a good example. Today, the Mars Company is a global giant marketing its candy and products in 100 nations. But it didn’t start that way. Mars was founded in 1911 in Tacoma, Washing, where Frank C. Mars made his first candies in his kitchen. The company was in business for 30 years before its star took off. World War II soldiers started carrying candy-coated chocolate pieces that didn’t melt in their packs. The candy was called M&Ms, and the company’s most famous slogan boasted, “It melts in your mouth, not in your hand.” Today, Mars produces two billion M&Ms an hour. Like all successful businesses, their leaders take calculated risks, constantly innovate, add diverse product lines, and hire and retain top-notch workers. They survive on dedication, new ideas and a strong work ethic. Simply, they believe in what they are doing. While some elected officials want government to exert more control over business and dictate which products and services are marketed, the bureaucracy is not known for creativity, innovation or risk taking. In fact, those traits are often discouraged by government agencies in favor of command and control rulemaking. Just look at what happened in the former Soviet Union with central government planning, or what is currently going on in Venezuela. Store shelves are empty and people go without. We often forget our successes came about because someone had a better idea and worked long hours perfecting it. They didn’t work eight-hour shifts, and there was no overtime pay. Creative people like Pullman’s Ed Schweitzer invent products in garages in evenings and on weekends. Schweitzer developed a digital device to redirect electricity when high-voltage transmission systems fail. Since 1982, Schweitzer Engineering Labs’ (SEL) cutting edge products are known worldwide. SEL is employee owned, remains headquartered in Pullman, Washington and has more than 4,600 employees in 24 countries. Twenty years ago, who would have imagined Boeing would be manufacturing jetliners made of carbon fibers rather than aluminum? But Boeing just delivered its 500th carbon-fiber passenger jet from its assembly lines in Everett, Washington, and Charleston, South Carolina. Boeing leaders bet the company’s future on the 787 “Dreamliner” — a risk those in government would not likely take. Family-owned businesses remain America’s economic backbone. According to the University of Vermont, there are 5.5 million family-owned businesses in our country that contribute $8.3 trillion to our economy, employ 63 percent of the people in our workforce and are responsible for 78 percent of all new jobs. Many are people like successful Olympia fishing guide Rob Nowowiejski, who often leaves home before sun up and returns after sunset. If they don’t operate by the rules and provide good service, they are out of business. In the best of times, businesses are subject to the whims of consumers, competition and volatile economic cycles. Too often those pressures are lost on people in government or elected to public office who think businesses can simply pass along higher taxes and regulatory costs to their customers and still survive. Elected officials and the government bureaucracy should take care not to smother the innovation, creativity and opportunities that made America great.

Jesse Walker|Apr. 12, 2017 12:35 pm DonkeyHotey/FlickrWere you hoping, against the odds, that Donald Trump would do an about-face and decide that he wants to kill the Export-Import Bank? If so, I'm afraid I'll have to be the bearer of disillusioning news: OMB chief Mick Mulvaney has now confirmed that the White House wants the bank to "continue to exist." Some background: The Ex-Im Bank uses tax money to finance and insure foreign purchases of American exports. Boeing and the bank's other beneficiaries think this is a great set-up; the foes of corporate welfare are less impressed. Some early drafts of the Trump budget suggested that the program might be among the items marked for death, but when the actual document was released the bank turned out to be very much alive. Apparently, America's most explicitly mercantilist president in years isn't about to eliminate a mercantilist institution. Go figure. After I wrote about that last month, I heard some maybe-he'll-get-to-it-later rumblings from some hopeful Trump disciples. Well, CNBC's John Harwood just asked Mulvaney about the bank; the short version of his answer is that Trump is more interested in "putting some people on there who are reformers" than in dismantling it. For the longer version, read on: HARWOOD: Have you accepted as a matter of administration policy that you're going to take money from taxpayers and give it to the Ex-Im Bank? MULVANEY: Yeah. We did talk about the Ex-Im Bank because, as you know, I was a fairly significant critic of that in my time on the House. And I'm very comfortable with where we got, which is I believe I have a commitment this from this president. He is interested in putting some people on there who are reformers, and who want to make sure the bank sticks to its knitting and doesn't experience some of the mission creep that many of our critics have seen. Secondly, he's given me and Gary Cohn permission to start talking to other export credit facilities around the world to see if we can lower the level of government interference in the marketplace from all sides. HARWOOD: But Ex-Im is going to continue to exist. MULVANEY: Yeah, it's going to continue to exist. That "mission creep" comment was a nice touch. The bank has been subsidizing corporate giants for decades. Just what original mission is Mulvaney pretending that they're going to restore? Other choice bits from the interview include Mulvaney's estimate of how much Trump will spend on infrastructure ("I'm assuming a $200 billion number") and his response when asked about Trump's pledge to eliminate the national debt ("It's fairly safe to assume that was hyperbole"). To read the whole thing, go here. Update: And now we have it straight from the horse's mouth. The Wall Street Journal has just interviewed the president, and it reports that Trump has "made a full reversal from the campaign by stating his support for the U.S. Export-Import Bank": As he courted these limited-government voters during the campaign, Mr. Trump said the agency was unnecessary, and referred to it as "featherbedding" for politicians and big companies. "Instinctively, you would say, 'Isn't that a ridiculous thing,'" Mr. Trump [now says] of the Ex-Im Bank. "But actually, it's a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money."

Apparently, the Indian Air Force (IAF) has expressed reservations on the Advanced Hawk, jointly developed by UK’s BAE Systems and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., because it is looking for a more intermediate jet trainer and not an advanced version, sources told BusinessLine. Sources also said the IAF has decided not to place an order for the advanced trainers because of alleged bribery charges on Rolls-Royce dating back to 2005. The Advanced Hawk is powered by Rolls-Royce engines. The ‘Advanced Hawk’ was unveiled at Aero India 2017 in February. The Navy has also not placed an order for the advanced version of Hawk. So efforts are now on to export it to other countries, sources said. Besides, the UK is also keen to field the Eurofighter Typhoon for the Indian Navy’s plan to procure 57 new carrier-based fighters. However, the competition is going to be tough with Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin’s F-16 already in the race, sources said. On Thursday, British Secretary of State for Defence Michael Fallon will meet Defence Minister Arun Jaitley for the India-UK Strategic Dialogue. Fallon, who is here on a four-day visit, said on Wednesday that during his trip he will try to “better understand” the requirements of Indian armed forces. “I am here at this time not just to pass on our experience but to better understand your requirements, what is it that India really wants,” Fallon said at an an event organised by the Observer Research Foundation. Export hub The UK is planning to make India an export hub for its military armaments even as it is keen on boosting bilateral defence ties with increasing sale of equipment. “I am here not just to see what more we can ‘Make In India’ or make with India, but to see what more we can design, develop, add value with India and export together to third countries and to new markets,” he said. Both sides will also seek to take forward the Defence and International Security Partnership, which was finalised during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the UK in November 2015. During UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s visit to India last year, both sides had instructed the India-UK Defence Consultative Group to advance the defence cooperation agenda, including the UK’s proposals for capability partnerships, through a range of activities, including military-to-military cooperation, training, exchange of subject matter experts, research and technology linkages as well as defence manufacturing.

Able UK’s yard in Seaton, Hartlepool , has won a contract to dismantle Shell’s Delta Platform, which is the heaviest single structure in the North Sea. The platform is one of four which was built on the Brent oil and gas fields off the north-east coast of Scotland. It sits midway between the Shetland Islands and Norway. To carry out the dismantling work, the Delta Platform will be removed from the sea using the world’s largest construction vessel, the Pioneering Spirit. The ship, which is as long as six Boeing 747s, is designed to install and remove large oil and gas platforms in a single lift. It can lift platforms weighing 48,000 tonnes and it cost €2.6bn (£2.21bn) to build. The Pioneering Spirit will be used to remove the Delta Platform from the North Sea (Photo: Able UK) Neil Etherington, business development director at Able UK, said: “The Brent decommissioning project is almost certainly the most significant project of its type to date and of crucial importance to us is the fact that Able was selected against an initial longlist of 131 potential disposal yards. “We are now, of course, only weeks away from the receipt of the first structure – the Delta topside – and this follows the investment of £28m, essentially in a new specialist quay designed to accommodate the needs of the new ‘single piece’ removal techniques. “We believe that this re-affirms Able’s position as the UK market leader and puts us in a strong position to secure new business in a business sector that is set to see significant growth over the coming years.” Read More More than 400 new jobs to be created at EE centres at Cobalt, Sunderland and Darlington The £28m investment was made to create the yard’s new Quay 6. Its construction involved 193,000 man hours, and involved 106 workers over a year. The 7,500sq m quay will not only be used for carrying out the decommissioning of the Shell Brent platforms but will be used to attract similar projects to the area in the future. The decommissioning work will be carried out by many workers who were originally trained to build oil platforms. Over the last five years Able has invested over £100m across in a range of projects, mainly based on its sites on the Humber and the Tees.

Lindsey Graham gives a thumbs up after going on a test flight in a Lockheed Martin T-50A at the Lockheed Martin Greenville Operations 244 Terminal on Monday, April 10, 2017. Josh Morgan Greenville News Politics & Government April 12, 2017 7:10 AM Graham urges Trump to buy Lockheed jets at company’s Upstate site By Maayan Schechter Greenville News LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham urged President Donald Trump on Monday to choose defense contractor Lockheed Martin to build the next training fighter jet for the U.S. Air Force as part of a pitch to secure the contract. In front of Lockheed executives and elected officials, Graham called it a "good deal" for the U.S. and taxpayers. "Buy these planes," Graham directed at Trump while at Lockheed's Greenville facility at the South Carolina Technology and Aviation Center, or SCTAC, formerly the Donaldson Center. "I want to rebuild the military, I want to spend more on the military, but I also want to get value for our money. This investment, to me, is about as sound as the Air Force can make." Lockheed Martin and three other aerospace companies, that include Boeing/SAAB, have for months been engaged in a bidding war hoping to win a contract, 350 jets, to build a new training jet for the U.S. Air Force. A contract win for Lockheed would mean $8 billion to $10 billion in business and roughly 200 additional new competitive-wage jobs over the next 16 years at SCTAC. The Greenville facility already employs roughly 450 people. Lockheed Martin entered the U.S. Air Force Advanced Training Pilot Program last year with its T-50A fighter jet, developed with Korea Aerospace Industries, or KAI, to train pilots to fly F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter planes. The Air Force's current jet trainer, the T-38 Talon, has been used since the 1950s, and is not capable of the performance needed to train pilots to fly fifth generation planes, officials said. Lockheed already has two T-50A fighter jets at its Greenville facility, with more than 100 hours of documented flying time. Lockheed Martin facility in Greenville 'ideal' for F-16 shift Officials said there are 140 T-50 planes, which the T-50A is based off of, already training more than 2,000 South Korean pilots and logging more than 142,000 flight hours. Graham and U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, who attended Lockheed Martin's event Monday aimed to promote exposure of the T-50A, said a contract win for Lockheed would show a stronger partnership with South Korea, given North Korea's continued threat level. In addition to growing concern over the communist party's increase in nuclear capabilities, North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile off its coast last week ahead of Trump and Chinese President Xi Junping's meeting. "We have threats that are just unprecedented. The American people should know the level of threat (of North Korea)," Wilson said in front of KAI President and CEO Sung-Yong Ha and Ahn Ho-young, South Korea's ambassador to the U.S. Graham said if the Air Force decides to buy Lockheed Martin jets it will be a wise use of taxpayer dollars. He, along with Wilson, said the contract would be a true testament to South Carolina and Greenville workers. "It will get us to where we need to go in terms of having the finest Air Force in the world, continuing to have the finest Air Force in the world, and be a good purchase. It'd be a good price," he said. Lockheed's bid Lockheed Martin entered its proposal for the training competition on March 30, which consisted of hundreds of pages and dozens of binders and CD's – all put on display Monday in a glass-covered case. Orlando Carvalho, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin aeronautics, called the contractor's proposal ahead of schedule, low cost and low risk. "The T-50A uniquely balances maturity, with fifth generation capability, which will deliver ahead of schedule and on cost," he said. "Simply put, we are ready now." Lockheed Martin announcement 'perfect' timing for Greenville Tech program If Lockheed is awarded the contract, the jet's fuselage, wings and tail would be assembled in a Sacheon, South Korean factory, then shipped in two containers through the Panama Canal and delivered at the Port of Charleston, The Greenville News reported. The rest of the plane, which includes the cockpit, interior and software, would be assembled in Greenville. Lockheed would fly T-50A test runs out of its Greenville facility for the length of the contract. A contract is expected to be awarded by the end of this year or early 2018. Dale Bennett, executive vice president of Lockheed Rotary and Mission Systems, said while the award of the contract is important, it's "about training the pilot." "We've trained over 29,000 pilots in the world in 25 different countries," the University of South Carolina graduate said. "So we know how to do this. We know the art of learning." Future of F-16 in Greenville Should Lockheed Martin win the U.S. Air Force contract to build new trainer jets, the estimated 200 potential jobs that win could mean would be added onto an expected 250 jobs aimed at F-16 production in Greenville. The company confirmed last month its plans to shift F-16 production from its Fort Worth, Texas facility to Greenville in the next two years after the last F-16 in Fort Worth is delivered in September. The shift makes way for expanded F-35 Joint Strike Fighter production in Fort Worth. Last month, news reports indicated the Trump administration plans to move forward with the sale of 19 F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain, despite previous administration concerns over the country's human rights. The State Department declined to comment on the sale to The News. Rod Mclean, vice president and general manager of the F-16/F-22 Integrated Fighter Group, said Lockheed hopes to secure the contract with Bahrain by the first of next year given the sale's support from Congress.

BRUCE WEAVER/AFP/Getty Images The $250 billion space industry is dominated by governments and the telecommunications sector. However, a new, more entrepreneurial sector is emerging known in aerospace circles as NewSpace. Headlines surrounding the emerging commercial spaceflight focus on high profile entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Paul Allen, and Sir Richard Branson. NewSpace generally refers to lesser known names with nimbler approaches to space related services and products. Besides rocket launch companies, the sector also includes new satellite companies, technology focused finance groups, business accelerators and space habitats. Looking to Launch The launch sector was traditionally dominated by government contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Additional diversity might yield benefits for entrepreneurs and organizations looking to lower the price of access to space. Launch focused astroepreneurs such as Bezos, Musk, Branson, and Allen are expanding the space transportation infrastructure to not only make money but to increase access to space. And with several new launch vehicles debuting, 2017 could be a strong year. It’s worth addressing the difference between suborbital and orbital spaceflight. Suborbital vehicles only have a capability to fly to lower altitudes of space, which officially start at 62miles/100 kilometers above sea level. In terms of orbital vehicles, “For a 200 km circular orbit the orbital velocity is 7780 m/s (28000 km/h or 17400 mph).” Elon Musk announced that SpaceX’s next orbital rocket, the Falcon Heavy, might have its first flight this summer. We might also see a return to powered flights by Virgin Galactic, whose suborbital vehicle, SpaceShip Two is designed to carry paying flight participants to the edge of space. Microsoft co-Founder Paul Allen is tackling launch in a different way: air launch. Allen funded suborbital vehicle SpaceShipOne, which won the first XPRIZE competition in 2004. Allen is currently financing Stratolaunch Systems, whose carrier aircraft will be able to launch rockets from underneath the aircraft allowing launch from virtually anywhere (albeit with proper government permissions and licensing). Blue Origin, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is developing suborbital and orbital launch capabilities. Bezos is bullish enough on space that he recently announced he sells one billion dollars of Amazon stock a year to personally finance Blue Origin. Why does Space Access Matter? By lowering the cost of space access, space could be the gateway to unimaginable opportunities and potential solutions for all of us here on the earth. Hoyt Davidson, head of space focused investment bank Near Earth LLC, shared with me, “The Earth cannot do Quadrillion. Space can.” It’s not solely about economics as space is an enabler that yields tremendous benefits including knowledge, jobs, technology, and other intangible benefits. SmallSats are In A new breed of satellites known as SmallSats are emerging that are significantly smaller and less expensive than the ones we traditionally think of that, for example, deliver satellite tv. SmallSats range from a few ounces to several hundred pounds and can be used for a plethora of new applications including but not limited to tracking cargo ships, water conservation, testing pharmaceutical experiments and deforestation monitoring. The logic is that these new data streams from space could yield new insights that will help generate new insights and economic activity. Investing in Space Besides launch costs, one of the constraints for the NewSpace sector is access to capital. Most banks are unable to lend to startups, so astropreneurs typically leverage self-funding, government grants, angel investments and venture capital. In the past few years, space startups have started to use crowdfunding to raise modest amount of funds. Dedicated funding platforms focused on technology startups such as Orbitmuse, Propel(x) and Space Angels Network are becoming more a viable option for astropreneurs. In my experience as a space investor, I look for strong team and customer traction to help mitigate some of the technology and market risks that many space startups face. Space investors today tend to share a common social thread of a passion for space. However, investors are still looking for a return on their investment. NewSpace today tends to attract more patient capital because of the relatively few amount of available exit strategies in NewSpace. I’m optimistic that astropreneurs will generate exit strategies that attract more investors to this nascent sector. Accelerating the Space Ecosystem Space accelerators are emerging in NewSpace services to help facilitate the growth of space focused startups. Examples include Starburst Accelerators, LightSpeed Innovations and Silicon Valley Space Center. Accelerators vary in how they work, but they can help startups avoid common pitfalls and grow rapidly. Making in Zero-G In extended microgravity, researchers are discovering that materials often behave differently than they do on Earth. We may also be able to manufacture products and materials in new ways that would be incredibly difficult on Earth. We’ve only just started to scratch the surface on the myriad of benefits that could result from leveraging microgravity. Floating Factories and Habitats Astropreneurs are at various stages of development in regards to space habitats, which include space stations. Nevada based Bigelow Aerospace is developing inflatable structures derived from technology licensed from NASA. Texas based NanoRacks and Axiom Space also have aspirations for their own private space habitats. Who would use a space habitat and for what purposes? Users might include nations that don’t have their own space program. I could also envision private organizations leasing space habitats for manufacturing, research, tourism, and any other possibilities one could dream up. The NewSpace sector is a relatively small part of the space industry, but it could become hugely influential as its stakeholders garner increased visibility with their respective efforts. Even though the entire space sector is still in its early days, NewSpace is worth watching for both inspiration and investment. Robert Jacobson is a expert on the emerging entrepreneurial space industry who spoke at XPRIZE, US Air Force Futures Forum, and numerous space industry conferences. A 2016 graduate of International Space University’s Space Studies Program, Robert is writing a book on ways to grow the space sector to a trillion plus dollar global industry. Jacobson is co-founder of Aerospace & Defense Forum, a global aerospace community and SpatialTrust that develops robust systems for better land governance. Music plays an important part of Robert’s life through performance & composition. Disclosure: he previously worked on the management team of Space Angels Network and currently serves as a mentor for LightSpeed. SEE ALSO: Want to Leave the Planet?

Luoyang Sunrui Wanji Titanium CDM Group (Shanghai CDM Titanium Industry) Shaanxi Jin Han Precious Metals   One trend in market is increased usage of carbon fiber composites. The new generation of large passenger aircraft, such as A350 and A380 from Airbus and the B787 from Boeing use larger volumes of CFRP in the airframe component of aircraft. CFRPs are well-suited with titanium, but not with other metals such as aluminum, which ensures that titanium will remain a key material in their manufacture. Carbon fiber is woven with a textile material and resin such as epoxy resin and allowed to cure. The resulting material has high tensile strength due to high strength-to-weight ratio. CFRPs are popularly used in the manufacture of expensive sports cars, which required strong and lightweight materials. Expensive, racing motorbikes and bicycles tend to have CFRP forks, frames, and handlebars to maintain minimum weight and retain high tensile strength. The aerospace industry has accepted the use of CFRP in the manufacture of aircraft. Europe recently developed a fighter aircraft whose airframe is 70% carbon fiber composite, resulting in a plane that is 30% lighter in weight than if it had been constructed from other metals.

Luoyang Sunrui Wanji Titanium CDM Group (Shanghai CDM Titanium Industry) Shaanxi Jin Han Precious Metals   One trend in market is increased usage of carbon fiber composites. The new generation of large passenger aircraft, such as A350 and A380 from Airbus and the B787 from Boeing use larger volumes of CFRP in the airframe component of aircraft. CFRPs are well-suited with titanium, but not with other metals such as aluminum, which ensures that titanium will remain a key material in their manufacture. Carbon fiber is woven with a textile material and resin such as epoxy resin and allowed to cure. The resulting material has high tensile strength due to high strength-to-weight ratio. CFRPs are popularly used in the manufacture of expensive sports cars, which required strong and lightweight materials. Expensive, racing motorbikes and bicycles tend to have CFRP forks, frames, and handlebars to maintain minimum weight and retain high tensile strength. The aerospace industry has accepted the use of CFRP in the manufacture of aircraft. Europe recently developed a fighter aircraft whose airframe is 70% carbon fiber composite, resulting in a plane that is 30% lighter in weight than if it had been constructed from other metals.

Titanium is expensive to refine, process, and fabricate. In terms of processing cost of materials per cubic inch compared with aluminum, titanium is 4 to 5 times more expensive to refine and more than 9 to 10 times expensive to form ingots and fabricate finished products. Refining titanium metal into ingot is a slow and energy-intensive process that requires significant capital. Refining the ore into titanium metal is capital intensive as it is a multistep and high-temperature batch process. Due to the high reactivity of titanium, an extraction process similar to that for aluminum has not yet been developed.

Lightsabers -- the favored weapon of the Jedi in "Star Wars" films -- will remain in the fictional realm for now, but after decades of development, laser weapons are now here and are being deployed on military vehicles and planes. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon -- all the big defense players -- are developing prototypes for the Pentagon. The Navy has since 2014 been testing a 30-kilowatt laser on one of its warships, the USS Ponce. Lockheed Martin has just announced a 60-kilowatt laser weapon that soon will be installed on an Army truck for operational testing against mortars and small drones. The weapon can take out a drone from a distance of about 500 yards (meters) by keeping its beam locked onto the target for a few seconds, Jim Murdoch, an international business development director at Lockheed, told reporters this week. But unlike in the movies, the laser beam is invisible to the naked eye. By focusing the beam onto a target, the technology rapidly heats the inside of an incoming mortar round, causing it to explode mid-air. An impressive feat considering the round is moving at hundreds of miles per hour. The laser weapon can also pierce the outer skin of a drone, taking out key circuits and making it crash. For the moment, the lasers being tested are all of about this same power. Defeating a missile Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, sees that relatively small output increasing rapidly. Within just a few years, he expects far more powerful prototypes of more than 150 kilowatts. Such a laser could knock out a missile sideways on, where it is most vulnerable. He said special operations forces want to test such a system by 2020 on an AC-130 gunship that specialises in ground support for troops. And within six to eight years, US forces could begin using laser systems of more than 300 kilowatts, he added. That degree of power could knock out an incoming missile head-on. Eventually, reality will increasingly catch up with fiction. The US military is also weighing the possibility of mounting lasers on drones flying at very high altitudes, making them capable of shooting down ballistic missiles shortly after launch. Another bonus for the military from lasers is the promise of seemingly unending and cheap firepower. Unlike conventional canons that need shells, laser canons are limited only by the amount of electricity that can be generated. Gunzinger deems lasers as especially promising on warplanes, which could potentially get an unlimited reservoir of firepower to defend against adversaries´ missiles. "An aircraft doesn´t have to return to base to upload more weapons. It could refuel and continue to operate with its nearly unlimited magazine," he said. Physical constraints But before laser technology can be integrated into combat planes, it must first be shrunk in size. Currently, engineers are running into physical limitations on how much portable power can be produced and ways of cooling the technology. Lockheed wants to increase the power of its truck-mounted laser. "For a vehicle like this, there will be some engineering limits," said Murdoch. "We will run out of space ... that´s the kind of challenge we are working." But industry reps and military officials say there´s only one thing stopping lasers from garnering widespread operational use: government funding. Congress is cautious. Lawmakers recall a lengthy program that cost more than $5 billion in which a Boeing 747 was retrofitted to carry a laser gun supposedly capable of shooting down enemy missiles. The program was scrapped in 2012 over concerns it could never be operationally viable. The laser beam used in that technology was generated by chemicals so was not strong enough to take out a missile. 0 0 Laser weapons edge toward use in US military was posted in amazing of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on April 08, 2017 and was last updated on April 08, 2017.

He won a BMW by acing the 7th hole at Harbour Town Golf Links in the Monday pro-am at the RBC Heritage Presented by Boeing. “My girlfriend came up and told me, ‘You know, you can win me this BMW if you hit a hole in one,’ ” Mabry said. “I had not paid any attention, but that’s what I did.” Now he thinks she’ll tell him to go buy a lottery ticket, to “see how that works out.” But BMW’s big prize is like taking sand to the beach. Mabry owns two car dealerships back home in Virginia: Lynchburg Nissan and Lynchburg Mazda, as well as Lynchburg Polaris. He drives a Nissan Armada but now has won outright any BMW of his choice up to $50,000. “I’m still trying to decide what I’m going to do,” he said. “I’m not sure. This is an unusual circumstance.” The Heritage has been dangling the prize for six years, and Mabry is the first winner. He’s used to being on the other end of the deal. “I’ve put up probably 100 cars for charity hole-in-one prizes, and I’ve never been able to give one away,” he said. He’s a 16-handicapper who plays golf several times a month. At 54, he’s been playing about 30 years. This was his fifth Heritage Monday pro-am. He used a pitching wedge to reach the middle pin-placement at 146 yards, playing with professional Brooks Blackburn. He plans to stay through two rounds of the Heritage, unless he has to leave early for the arrival of his first grandchild. “This could be a really good week,” he said.

Shijian 13, which was developed by the China Academy of Space Technology and based on its DFH-3B communications satellite platform, was lifted atop by a Long March 3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province. The satellite, which weighs 4.6 metric tons, is expected to stay for 15 years in a geostationary orbit about 36,000 kilometers above Earth, the academy said. The satellite features a Ka-band broadband communications system capable of transmitting 20 gigabytes of data per second, making it the most powerful communications satellite the nation has developed. Zhao Jian, a space program official at the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, which oversees China's space programs, said the transmission capacity of Shijian 13 exceeds the total capacity of all of the country's previous communications satellites. He said that in addition to its communications missions, the satellite will also be tasked with conducting space-to-ground laser communications experiments. Zhou Zhicheng, head of the China Academy of Space Technology's Institute of Telecommunication Satellite, said Shijian 13 would use electric propulsion after it enters orbit, which will extensively reduce the chemical fuel the satellite carries. Currently, most satellites rely on chemical propulsion, which requires a lot of fuel that occupies a large proportion of carrying capacity, and restricts the number and weight of scientific instruments a satellite can carry. Zhou said Shijian 13 is able to cover most parts of China's land territory and will help to enable passengers on jetliners and high-speed trains to use the internet. The use of Ka-band broadband allows Shijian 13 to transmit high-resolution video, a feature that previous Chinese satellites do not have. In addition, the Ka-band handheld devices are smaller and more portable than those based on other frequencies, which means they are more convenient to carry and use, Zhou said. He added that developing nations have huge demand for DFH-3B-based communications satellites such as Shijian 13, not only because of its capability, but also because it can accommodate various kinds of equipment in accordance with clients' requirements. The academy has made seven communications satellites for overseas users, including Pakistan, Venezuela and Laos, and is finalizing export contracts for more than 10 such satellites, he said. However, Zhou said China still needs to catch up with the top developers of communications satellites in the United States and Europe, such as Boeing and Thales Alenia Space, when it comes to satellite technology and capacity. In response, the country will develop several new types of advanced communications satellites, including multimedia broadcasting satellites and ultra-large-capacity broadband satellites, he said. In June, the Shijian 18 communications satellite, the first to be developed based on China's new-generation DFH-5 satellite platform, will be launched by a Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province, according to Zhao. He said the overall capability of the Shijian 18 will be better than that of all communications satellites currently used by other nations, and its service will improve internet connectivity and accessibility for Chinese users as well as reduce users' costs. China now operates 16 communications satellites, according to Zhou.

He goes back to the galley and maybe fetches himself a bottle of scotch and comes back to the coskpit. The plane is silent. Culture of Malaysia - history, people, clothing Introduction Nowadays responsible business is becoming increasingly more important to every organization in order to. If the disappearance of this flight is not just a plane accident then hijacking or terrorism would be the next option. Looking at info on this article the following stands out: What could make a plane disappear from civilian radar while at 86,555 feet yet still be visible on military radar? ONE THING, and it looks like a UFO (as some have speculated) only it’s attached to a boeing jet – the antenna on a . Air Force AWACS plane. How could the AWAC can do it ? Remember 966 incident? After the 966 incident, all Boeing aircraft (and possibly all Airbus) are installed with a remote control system to counter terrorist hijacking. Since then all Boeings can be remote controlled by ground control tower. A similar remote control system is used to control the pilotless spy aircraft and drones. Suppose that the plane indeed crossed the Malacca strait and then also crossed Sumatra. Well, Sumatra is Indonesian territory if it entered Indonesian airspace, then shouldn 8767 t it have been picked up by Indonesian military radar? Actually, if you let the water in the pressure would be equal inside and out. I don 8767 t know if you could do this through the pressurization system or if you would have to crack a door. Any aviation experts have any thoughts? Third theory, however, is more plausible. When a plane runs out of fuel and is not controlled, it will enter free-fall. There 8767 s no real terminal velocity for an aircraft, since it will disintegrate before achieving Vt. Therefore, the aircraft will break up before hitting the surface at high speed, and this impact will cause any large parts to break up into debris. «New malaysian essays on terrorism» in pictures.

But there’s one flip-flop he won’t make. By Matthew Nussbaum 04/12/17 06:08 PM EDT President Donald Trump made a number of promises on the campaign trail and his recent reversals fit his reputation for unpredictability. | AP Photo Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print Donald Trump promised to be open-minded on a number of issues. Over the past week, he’s delivered. The man who pledged to cut deals rather than adhere to any ideology — or to any detailed policy platform — has, in recent days, demonstrated an incredible willingness to bend his past positions, or abandon them entirely. Sometimes he offers an explanation; sometimes not. But after an embarrassing failure to deliver on his promise to repeal Obamacare, Trump is making sure the world knows he does not share the hard-line proclivities of the House conservatives who derailed the health care deal and have proved a thorn in the side of Republican leaders. Story Continued Below From health care and the Export-Import Bank to NATO and to China’s alleged currency manipulation, Trump has made moves that would leave a more traditional politician labeled a flip-flopper. But for Trump, who sold himself in part on a businessman’s flexibility, the moves fit his reputation for unpredictability. “I said it was obsolete,” Trump said of NATO during a news conference with Jens Stoltenberg, the body’s secretary general on Wednesday, referring to a comment he made during the campaign. “It’s no longer obsolete.” Trump chalked up the change to what he said is a new NATO focus on terrorism. But NATO has long made combating global terrorism a priority, and fought alongside the U.S. in its campaigns against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, and many NATO member states have aided the campaign against the Islamic State. Trump reverses on NATO: ‘It’s no longer obsolete’ By Nolan D. McCaskill and Cristiano Lima On China, too, Trump has changed his posture. He regularly, and gleefully, lambasted China on the campaign trail, painting it as a prime culprit for Americans’ economic woes and vowing to toughen up trading policy with the world’s second-largest economy — first and foremost by labeling the nation a currency manipulator. “They’re not currency manipulators,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. He said any currency manipulation has ceased and suggested such a label would hurt the prospects of working with China to declaw a nuclear-armed and increasingly belligerent North Korea. And, after a few days with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump is now praising Xi as a willing partner. “I’ve spent a lot of time with him over the last two days,” Trump said at Wednesday’s news conference, referring to last week’s meeting. “President Xi wants to do the right thing. We had a very good bonding, I think we had a very good chemistry together. I think he wants to help us with North Korea. We talked trade, we talked a lot of things.” “I was very impressed with President Xi and I think he means well and I think he wants to help,” Trump added. “We’ll see whether or not he does.” In another change in the Wall Street Journal interview, Trump declared he now supports the Export-Import Bank. The bank, which guarantees loans for U.S. companies, has become a target of many conservatives but is supported by major American companies like Boeing. Putin and Tillerson agree that U.S.–Russia relationship isn't going so well By Louis Nelson “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies,” Trump told the WSJ on the Ex-Im bank. In his most significant shift, Trump — who pledged to keep the United States out of protracted conflicts in the Middle East — deepened U.S. military involvement in Syria last week with a barrage of missile strikes on a Syrian air base in response to a poison gas attack on civilians. Trump explained that shift by pointing to the images of those killed in the attack, particularly the children, whom he mentioned again at his news conference on Wednesday. Trump was by no means alone in the Syria shift. A number of Republicans in Congress who opposed airstrikes in response to chemical weapons use under former President Barack Obama have supported Trump’s move. And on health care, Trump also seems to be waffling. After telling congressional Republicans he would abandon repeal efforts and move on to tax reform if they couldn’t reach an agreement on the American Health Care Act, he now seems to be mulling a return to health care. “We're going to have a phenomenal tax reform, but I have to do health care first,” Trump told Fox News this week. “I want to do it first to really do it right.” Even Trump’s media habits shifted on Wednesday. After sticking to friendly reporters in his previous news conferences with foreign leaders, including conservative media outlets and Mark Halperin, Trump on Wednesday called on two mainstream reporters from prominent national outlets — Jeff Mason of Reuters and Anita Kumar of McClatchy newspapers.

He deftly handled both questions, as well as those from the foreign press, avoiding any of the eyebrow-raising comments that have emerged at his past news conferences, such as his joke about the U.S. wiretapping German chancellor Angela Merkel. But on one weighty foreign policy issue, Trump has declined to move. That’s his stance toward Russian President Vladimir Putin, who throughout the campaign Trump declined to attack and often praised. The Russian government conducted an influence campaign to aid Trump during the presidential election, the U.S. intelligence community concluded. But tensions with Russia have increased in recent days as Moscow continues to support Bashar Assad’s ruthless campaign in Syria. Trump was asked multiple times Wednesday if his opinion of Putin has changed. He avoided the question, though he left the door open for a future shift. “I’ll also see about Putin over a period of time,” Trump said of the Russian strongman. “It would be a fantastic thing if we got along with Putin and if we got along with Russia,” Trump added. “And that could happen, and it may not happen, and it may be just the opposite. I can only tell you what I would like to do. I would love to be able to get along with everybody.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Matthew Nussbaum mnussbaum@politico.com @MatthewNussbaum This story tagged under: White House China Syria Economy Middle East Russia Foreign Policy Donald Trump NATO Vladimir Putin Xi Jinping Bashar Assad President Donald Trump Donald Trump Presidency Trump Russia scandal Missing out on the latest scoops?

Analysts described rising anxiety over geopolitical issues, as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Russia President Vladimir Putin but made little apparent progress towards a joint strategy on Syria following last week's US missile strikes on the war-torn country. Investors also are perturbed at the lack of progress on Trump's economic agenda, especially promised tax cuts that had garnered great investor enthusiasm. "I think the rally in stocks has run into some headwinds, certainly geopolitical concerns, Syria, Russia and so forth," said Alan Skrainka, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth Management. "But mostly it's concerns about the Trump administration ability to get a tax plan passed." The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 percent to close the session at 20,591.86. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.4 per cent to end at 2,344.93, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 0.5 per cent to 5,836.16. Industrial shares were under pressure, with Caterpillar losing 2.3 per cent, Boeing falling 1.4 per cent and United Technologies down 0.8 per cent. United Airlines lost 1.1 per cent as chief executive Oscar Munoz apologised again after the airline forcibly removed a passenger on an overbooked flight Sunday. But Munoz said he had no plans to step down. Tesla Motors slumped 3.9 per cent following news that a group of investors are lobbying the company to add new, independent members to the board to offset the influence of chief executive and co-founder Elon Musk. BlackBerry Limited surged 16 per cent as it announced it won US$814.9 million in an arbitration ruling from Qualcomm on royalty overpayments. Qualcomm shed 3.5 per cent.

The German-born executive told Reuters in an interview he was far from bored after five years in the job, during which the company has gone through sweeping governance changes as well as a reorganisation whose final step was approved on Wednesday. "It is up to shareholders and the board to decide. I am 58 now and I am not close to retirement. (Former CEO) Louis (Gallois) retired from the company aged 68, which is not my benchmark, but in 2019 I will only be 60," he said. Enders was speaking after shareholders approved a change in the name of the company's Dutch-registered top entity to Airbus SE from Airbus Group SE, completing an overhaul which saw the group merge with its main jetmaking division earlier this year. The recent shake-up saw Frenchman Fabrice Bregier, who runs the planemaking business, add the new role of chief operating officer of the unified company, with an official No. 2 role. Uncertainty over Enders' plans could test what is often painted as a guarded relationship between him and Bregier, a tandem seen as vital to keeping the Franco-German-led aerospace company on track as it breaks away from years of in-fighting. Although Bregier is widely viewed as the main candidate to replace Enders, his status as heir apparent has not officially been confirmed and a delayed handover could allow others to develop the profile needed to be considered, analysts say. Bregier has said he is focussed on running the airplane business, which is the main rival to U.S. planemaker Boeing , and his new company-wide operational duties. Enders is expected to let the board know around March next year whether he would like to stay in the 3 million euros ($3.2 mln) a year post, giving the company a year to polish its succession plans. Asked whether he would seek a new mandate from 2019, Enders said, "It depends on many things. If it were boring then that would be a different story, but this company has plenty of challenges - sometimes more than I would like - and it is a fascinating one and I am still relatively young, but we will see. There is no need to take any decision on that now."

Passengers on board flight QF29 from Melbourne to Hong Kong were about an hour from their destination when the drama unfolded last Friday, lasting about two minutes. The airline said customers had experienced “unexpected in-flight turbulence” on the Boeing 747. Non-stop Sydney-to-London flights could happen by 2022, says Qantas Read more “We notified the [Australian Transport Safety Bureau] of the occurrence, and our own teams are also reviewing the event,” a spokeswoman said. The Aviation Herald reported that plane was about to enter a holding pattern about 60 nautical miles south-east of Hong Kong at the time and was travelling between 340 knots and 290 knots. The ATSB said the flight crew had to disconnect the autopilot and manoeuvre the aircraft after the warning. It classified the incident as serious. The plane landed about 24 minutes later and one passenger was taken to hospital for minor injuries. The “stick-shaker” warning is a device that causes the flight’s control yoke to shake noisily and warn the pilot of an imminent stall. According to Boeing it takes a physical, rather than visual, form so crew members will be alerted even if they are not looking at the panel at the time.

Manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced in a Wednesday statement that up to 300 F-16C/D aircraft of the Block 40-52 production lines will have their service lives extended. Susan Ouzts, vice president of Lockheed’s F-16 program, said in a media release, "This accomplishment is the result of more than seven years of test, development, design, analysis and partnership between the US Air Force and Lockheed Martin … Combined with F-16 avionics modernization programs like the F-16V, SLEP modifications demonstrate that the Fighting Falcon remains a highly capable and affordable 4th generation option for the US Air Force and international F-16 customers."  © Flickr/ Expert Infantry US Air Force to Deploy Squadron of 12 F-16 Combat Jets to S Korea in February With modernization, the service will be able to operate the Block 40-52 aircraft safely past the year 2048, which comes as Washington looks to save money on some of its big ticket weapons, particularly the pricey F-35 program, which has been called the most expensive weapons system in history. The US Navy recently decided to buy an advanced fleet of the stealth jets, worth $400 billion, to replace the aging fleet of Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, despite protest from President Donald Trump.  © AP Photo/ Trump May Not Like it, But US Navy Proceeds With F-35 Buy Lockheed Martin also manufacturers the F-35, and saw its shares drop up to 5 percent in December after Trump wrote on Twitter that costs for the program were "out of control." An agreement with Lockheed CEO Marilyn Hewson was later reached to drop the price of the next 90 F-35s 8 percent, to $728 million apiece. The defense manufacturer said in a statement, "President Trump's personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price … The agreement was reached in a matter of weeks and represents significant savings over previous contracts. This is a good deal for the American taxpayer, our country, our company and our suppliers." ...

REUTERS There are many reasons for the sorry state of commercial aviation in America. When it comes to your routinely terrible flight — not to mention the sort of exceptional horror that took place aboard United Airlines Flight 3411 this past weekend — regulatory failures as well as consolidation, which the authorities have allowed to occur unabated for decades, can be blamed. People in Silicon Valley pride themselves on their capacity to upend entrenched industries. Uber defeated taxi cartels. Airbnb made getting a room cheaper and more accessible. Streaming services are undoing the cable business. Yet the airline industry has not just stubbornly resisted innovation to improve customer service — in many ways, technology has only fueled the industry’s race to the bottom. Everything about United Flight 3411 — overselling, underpaying for seats when they are oversold, a cultish refusal to offer immediate contrition, an overall attitude that brutish capitalism is the best that non-elite customers can expect from this fallen world — is baked into the airline industry’s business model. And that business model has been accelerated by technology. Travel search engines rank airlines based on price rather than friendliness or quality of service. Online checking, airport kiosks and apps allow airlines to serve customers with fewer and fewer workers. What we are witnessing is the basest, ugliest form of tech-abetted, bottom-seeking capitalism — one concerned with prices and profits above all else, with little regard for quality of service, or even for the dignity of customers. “The airline industry has been on a steady nose dive when it comes to customer service for nearly 40 years,” said Henry Harteveldt, the president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry research firm. He noted that US carriers were improving on some metrics — on-time service is up, baggage loss is down and prices keep getting better. What keeps deteriorating are comfort and quality of service for low-end passengers — most people. Legroom keeps shrinking. Airlines keep tacking on separate fees for amenities we used to consider part of the flight. And customers keep going along with it. “Consumers have shown that they’re willing to put up with an awful lot, including lack of legroom, lack of amenities, mediocre or worse customer service, dirty airplanes and more to save money,” Harteveldt said. “And the airline industry has evolved to meet that desire” for cheap fares. Part of the problem is how we buy tickets today. The whole system is mercilessly transactional. When you search online, you look for price and travel times, and perhaps you consider some airline loyalty scheme. How the airline treats you — isn’t often part of the transaction. As a result, airlines have little incentive to reform themselves. “Airline executives will tell you they don’t view themselves as being service companies,” Harteveldt said. “They want Wall Street to view them as industrial companies, and they want consumers to view them as transportation providers. Customer service is just not what the airlines are about.” You can see this in United’s initial response to what happened on Flight 3411: “I apologise for having to re-accommodate these customers,” Oscar Munoz, United’s chief executive, said in a statement dripping with all the warmth of a ransom note. In a letter to employees, he repeatedly suggested that the customer, not the airline, was at fault. After all, the passenger was offered a bountiful $1,000 in United vouchers for his trouble. It was an offer he couldn’t refuse; as a United spokesman said, the passenger was “asked several times, politely,” for his seat before anyone beat him up. It took two days — and a plunge in United’s stock price — for the airline to offer a real apology. “I want you to know that we take full responsibility and we will work to make it right,” Munoz said in a statement on Tuesday. Can technology improve how airlines work? Some people have ideas for how that may happen. One of them is obvious and sensible: customer reviews. Last year, TripAdvisor, the travel reviews site that has become indispensable for hotel bookings, began rating airlines. Its new rankings, released this week, show that over all, airlines get an average rating of 3.7 out of 5 from customers. Emirates and Singapore Airlines are rated the best in the world, JetBlue and Alaska, made TripAdvisor’s top 10 list. But Delta was the only major US airline to receive TripAdvisor’s seal of approval. United and American Airlines did not meet the site’s minimum threshold, though Bryan Saltzburg, senior vice president for TripAdvisor’s global flight business, said that the two have been improving. One can imagine how such reviews could prompt improvements in airlines. If instead of just price, travel search engines included prominent warnings from reviewers — “This airline might give you a bloody lip while kicking you from your seat, 1-star!” — that could alter travellers’ calculations in booking. Harassment in air “That would be a good idea — a filter on travel search that says, ‘Click this filter and it might cost you a few dollars more, but we’ll bias you towards airlines that treat their customers well,’” said Paul English, the co-founder of the travel search company Kayak, who now runs another travel start-up, Lola. A bigger disruption would come from altering how we pay for airfares. Some consultants argue that a membership fee could radically improve flying. “We’ve prototyped a subscription airline in the past, and it gets the airline out of the business of reducing service for offering the lowest fares,” said Devin Liddell, the principal brand strategist for Teague, a design firm that works with Boeing. Some start-ups have tried a monthly subscription model, and none have taken off. But airline start-ups face high capital costs. A new business model might work, Liddell said, if an established airline tries it. You might wonder why an airline would dare try such a thing. After all, airlines are doing well, profits are up despite your annoyance about flying. But Liddell warned of long-term competition from other kinds of transportation. If self-driving cars make driving easier and more comfortable, midrange flights would face competition. Counting the time it takes to clear airport security and get to and from the airport, it takes just as long to drive between some places as to fly. If self-driving technology makes driving much more comfortable people might abandon planes for cars, Liddell said. An even longer-term idea is the Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s vision for superfast tunnel travel. It’s a pretty speculative idea, but if it works, airlines would need to radically alter how they work. For now, though, none of that hurts the commercial air business. Airlines are safe from self-driving cars and the Hyperloop. They’re content to feed you ever-worse service for lower prices, because that’s what the web wants. Your only technological hope for better service is your smartphone camera and the viral push of social networks. If you are violently kicked off your flight, at least your fellow passengers will post a video to Facebook.

The German-born executive told Reuters in an interview he was far from bored after five years in the job, during which the company has gone through sweeping governance changes as well as a reorganisation whose final step was approved on Wednesday. "It is up to shareholders and the board to decide. I am 58 now and I am not close to retirement. (Former CEO) Louis (Gallois) retired from the company aged 68, which is not my benchmark, but in 2019 I will only be 60," he said. Enders was speaking after shareholders approved a change in the name of the company's Dutch-registered top entity to Airbus SE from Airbus Group SE, completing an overhaul which saw the group merge with its main jetmaking division earlier this year. The recent shake-up saw Frenchman Fabrice Bregier, who runs the planemaking business, add the new role of chief operating officer of the unified company, with an official No. 2 role. Uncertainty over Enders' plans could test what is often painted as a guarded relationship between him and Bregier, a tandem seen as vital to keeping the Franco-German-led aerospace company on track as it breaks away from years of in-fighting. Although Bregier is widely viewed as the main candidate to replace Enders, his status as heir apparent has not officially been confirmed and a delayed handover could allow others to develop the profile needed to be considered, analysts say. Bregier has said he is focused on running the airplane business, which is the main rival to U.S. planemaker Boeing , and his new company-wide operational duties. Enders is expected to let the board know around March next year whether he would like to stay in the 3 million euros ($3.2 mln) a year post, giving the company a year to polish its succession plans. Asked whether he would seek a new mandate from 2019, Enders said, "It depends on many things. If it were boring then that would be a different story, but this company has plenty of challenges - sometimes more than I would like - and it is a fascinating one and I am still relatively young, but we will see. There is no need to take any decision on that now."

The United States launched missiles at a Syrian airfield last week to retaliate a deadly chemical attack on civilians. The strikes pushed President Donald Trump, who came to power in January calling for warmer ties with Syria's ally Russia, and his administration into confrontation with Moscow. Investors are concerned that these developments could distract Trump from pursuing his pro-business policies such as tax cuts, simpler regulations and higher infrastructure spending, promises that have powered Wall Street to record highs since his election in November. The S&amp;P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average, while gold and VIX, Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to their highest levels in five months. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1635 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 72.27 points, or 0.35 percent, at 20,579.03 and the S&amp;P 500 was down 10.19 points, or 0.43 percent, at 2,343.59. The indexes were on track for their worst one-day percentage decline in over three weeks. The Nasdaq Composite was down 30.18 points, or 0.51 percent, at 5,836.60. The worst hit were financials and industrials, sectors which have outperformed the broader market in the post-election rally. The S&amp;P 500 financial sector was off 0.83 percent, but was the biggest drag on the index due to a drop in bank heavyweights including Wells Fargo and Bank of America . Industrials were off 1 percent, weighed down by General Electric, Union Pacific Corp and Boeing . "Technically, we are due for a breather and if the earnings season disappoints, it could provide the correction that we need," said Josh Jalinski, president of Jalinski Advisory Group. Wells Fargo, along with Citigroup and JPMorgan , will unofficially kick-off the first-quarter earnings season on Thursday, which will also be the last trading day of the week ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Eight of the 11 major S&amp;P sectors were lower. Utilities, consumer staples and telecom services, defensive sectors with slow but predictable growth, were up. Tractor Supply was the biggest percentage loser on the S&amp;P, down nearly 7 percent following a profit warning from the specialty retailer. Delta Air Lines was up 1.3 percent at $45.84, boosted by a better-than-expected quarterly profit and an upbeat forecast for current-quarter passenger unit revenue.

Safe-haven trades gain ground amid foreign-policy jitters. Dow, S&P close below 50-day moving average. Fred Imbert | @foimbert 10 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Markets edge lower at open    17 Hours Ago | 02:50 U.S. equities closed lower on Wednesday as investors assessed the geopolitical landscape. The dollar hit a session low after President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal he thought the currency was getting "too strong." The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance against six major currencies, last traded 0.5 percent lower at 100.23 after hitting its lowest level of the month. As the safe-haven trade continued Wednesday, the 2-year yield fell to session lows around 1.21 percent, while the 10-year yield fell below the psychologically key 2.30 percent level. "Nothing seems to be happening or not happening as fast as people would like it to happen," said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. Other traditional safe-haven assets rose, building on gains from Tuesday' session. Gold futures for June delivery rose $3.90 to settle at $1,275.50 per barrel, while the dollar hit its lowest level since November against the Japanese yen. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 15.66. "There's a lot of uncertainty that's really hard to model. That's why you're seeing this give-and-take [in stocks] and the uptick in volatility," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Dollar index intraday Source: FactSet Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Moscow on Wednesday and received a barrage of criticism from several Russian officials. Tillerson said in a news conference Wednesday that U.S.-Russia relations are at a "low point" and need to improve. "The world's two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship," Tillerson said. All that said, stocks have held their ground this week. The three major indexes are just marginally lower for the week. "We are concerned about Syria and Russia, ... but at the same time we have a very resilient market," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "That could change if one of these geopolitical hotspots heats up, and there's no way to fully price that in." Geopolitical tensions have been brewing ahead of a highly anticipated earnings seasons. Earnings are expected to have grown around 10 percent in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales, meanwhile, are expected to have grown the most since 2011. "We're about to start earnings season and [bank analyst] Dick Bove is telling everyone that the banks are a terrible investment, and they're up first," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. Lucas Jackson | Reuters A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are scheduled to report Thursday morning. Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, posted better-than-expected results, sending its stock higher in the premarket. Investors were also trying to get a sense of the Trump administration's priorities. Trump said in an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday he wants to tackle health care reform before implementing new tax policy. "I have to do healthcare first, I want to do it first to really do it right," Trump said. Stocks rallied after Trump was elected in part because of the prospects of lower taxes, deregulation and fiscal policy. "The market has known this for a while. He didn't say anything new," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. "The question is how far along health care is, because depending on what they get done there, they'll know what kind of tax reform they can get." Financials were among the worst decliners as U.S. Treasury yields fell. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) was closing about 1.4 percent lower. The financials led the post-election market rally on promises of pro-growth policies but were trading lower for the year so far on Wednesday. Boeing and Caterpillar had the greatest negative impact on the Dow, closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 7. The S&P 500 also fell below its 50-day moving average with materials and industrials the worst performers. The index also closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Nov. 8. The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.5 percent. Crude oil prices struggled for gains and settled 0.54 percent lower at $53.11 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a slightly larger-than-expected drawdown of 2.17 million barrels.

In February, Airbus called for further help on Europe’s largest defence project, following penalties for delays and a contract clause allowing buyers to withhold some cash payments. In late March, Airbus held talks with European purchasing governments who decided to maintain the penalties, but did not rule out some short-term flexibility. "We are very grateful that governments have responded to our plea to engage in these discussions, which will hopefully bring significant financial mitigation," Mr Enders told an annual shareholder meeting. The chief executive said the drain on cash from the A400M problems should be reduced beyond 2018, after which the company would demonstrate strong potential for cashflow generation. Mr Enders noted other finiancial headwinds, including delays in deliveries of the A320neo, the plane maker’s latest narrowbody jet, which has been held up by shortages of one type of engine. He cited figures suggesting Airbus, whose main rival is Boeing, gets US$1.5 million more profit for each A320neo, a fuel-saving version of the most popular European jet.

Eric Adams Transportation Date of Publication: 04.12.17. 04.12.17 Time of Publication: 8:30 am. 8:30 am Zunum’s Hybrid Jet Could Finally Make Electric Flight a Reality Zunum Aero Say what you will about the electric Chevrolet Volt, but GM’s engineers created a clever solution to the problem of battery range and recharge time: Give the car its own generator. When the battery winds down to nothing, a small gasoline engine generates the electricity to keep moving. The arrangement extends the car’s range and saves gasoline. Aviation startup Zunum thinks General Motors’ approach might be just the thing to bring electric propulsion to commercial aircraft. The company, based in Kirkland, Washington, is developing the flying equivalent of a Chevy Volt that uses a pair of ducted fans for propulsion. As the battery runs low, a jet fuel-burning turbine fires up to keep the juice flowing. As crazy as it sounds, the aviation industry finds itself fascinated by electric airplanes, which require less fuel and make less noise than conventional aircraft. So far, though, the technology remains hobbled by the limitations of battery technology. The most successful electric airplanes thus far are, like Solar Impulse, wildly impractical or, like the Airbus E-Fan, limited by their range and speed. That two-seater musters just 60 minutes of flight at 137 mph from its 350-pound battery. Related Video Check Out the New Far-Out Fliers of NASA’s Famed X-Plane Program Zunum CEO Ashish Kumar says the hybrid approach could reduce noise by 75 percent and cut airline fuel costs by 40 to 80 percent, and he hopes to get a short-haul commercial plane with a seating capacity of 10 to 50 passengers into service within a decade. He figures the first planes will carry a battery pack good for 175 miles, with the generator extending the aircraft’s range to 700 miles. But he sees that range climbing relatively quickly as battery technology improves. “Power density is growing every year,” he says. Each time customers swap an aging battery for a new one, they’ll see a bump. “For a single airplane flying for 20 years, it’ll grow to 40 percent, 60 percent and eventually may not need the generator at all.” Zunum is working with the University of Illinois to develop the battery technology, with funding from the venture capital arms at Boeing and JetBlue Technology Ventures, two companies exploring alternatives to jet fuel. Airbus, too, is exploring similar technology—called a serial hybrid—after deciding that batteries alone are impractical for large aircraft. But not everyone is optimistic. Getting Airborne Jack Stewart Airbus Swears Its Pod/Car/Drone Is a Serious Idea Definitely Alex Davies Boeing’s Test Protocol for New Planes Is as Brutal As You’d Hope Alex Davies Boom! NASA Wants to Bring Back Supersonic X-Planes “The energy density for batteries isn’t high enough to even get a couple of people off the ground, let alone 30 or 40,” says aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia. And if the hybridization scheme isn’t as efficient as engineers hope, it could require just as much fuel as a conventional jet engine or turboprop—in a much newer, less proven, system. That means it might be wiser to focus on making conventional jet engines and the aircraft that use them more efficient through improved aerodynamics, composite materials, and the like. “Aircraft efficiency improves by one percent every year, as it has every year for the last 60, since the dawn of the jet age,” Aboulafia says. “It will be very hard to suddenly generate double-digit improvements.” What’s more, Aboulafia says there is no market for the small commercial aircraft Zunum is proposing. Regional jets typically carry 60 to 160 passengers and carry passengers from smaller markets to major hubs like Chicago, Dallas, and Atlanta. Kumar’s answer? Remake the system. Small aircraft with low operating costs could allow airlines to fly shorter routes to the thousands of small airports commercial airlines usually ignore. Some 97 percent of air traffic passes through just 2 percent of the country’s 5,000 airports, he says. Flying fewer passengers shorter distances to smaller airports could increase efficiency and reduce travel times. It might even reduce high congestion by encouraging people to fly instead drive. Boeing, at least, likes that idea. “Our interest in Zunum Aero is fundamentally about making sure we’re engaged with promising emerging technologies and business models that could potentially change the marketplace—in this case the smaller regional aircraft transportation system,” says Steve Norlund, head of Boeing’s HorizonX VC arm. So if electric cars never quite offer the range for that annual trip to grandma’s house, maybe it’s time to consider flying instead. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Eric Adams Transportation Date of Publication: 02.10.17. 02.10.17 Time of Publication: 10:00 am. 10:00 am The Troubled F-35 Fighter Jet Rules the Skies in Its Toughest Test Yet Nial Bradshaw/US Air Force It’s been a tough road for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the next generation fighter jet running years behind schedule and billions over budget. But, the Air Force says, better late and crazy expensive than never. In its first serious test, the F-35 proved that given the chance, it can wreak havoc in the skies. That test was Red Flag, the Air Force’s annual, weeks-long, all-hands-on-deck, multinational shakedown of military aviation technology. In the skies over the Nevada desert, drones run recon drills. Electronic-warfare planes jam signals and hunt enemies. Cargo aircraft move crews and supplies in and out of Nellis Air Force Base, outside Las Vegas. Fighter jets on the “blue” team face off against the “Red” forces—specially trained aggressor squadrons that mimic the real-world tactics of US adversaries. Sky Wars Eric Adams New Navy Tech Makes It Easy to Land on a Carrier. Yes, Easy Jack Stewart Watch Darpa’s Creepy ‘Project SideArm’ Pluck a Drone Out of the Air Eric Adams A Stronger, Faster Predator Drone Could Soon Prowl Europe’s Airspace Over 110 sorties, the fleet of 13 F-35A jets (the Air Force-dedicated version of the fighter) posted a simulated kill ratio of 15:1, according to Aviation Week, meaning only one blue aircraft was shot down for every 15 reds the F-35 threw to the ground. The sadists running the drill went hard after the newcomer, using advanced tactics and targeting and jamming technologies, and deploying extra “enemy” F-16s (in adversary-appropriate camouflage). No match, apparently, for the plane’s advanced data-gathering and sensing technologies (like a $400,000 helmet). That didn’t just boost the airmen in the F-35s—pilots flying F-22 Raptors and older F-18s and F-16s enjoyed improved situational awareness, too. Defense News reported that the F-35s stuck around after unloading all their weapons, so other aircraft could crib data from their scanners. The success in the mock combat may not assuage President Trump’s concerns over blown budgets and deadlines. “There are many sighs of relief,” says military analyst Peter Singer. “But the challenge for F-35 has always been something else that won’t be able to change all that much—its costs and, maybe more so, the opportunity costs of what could be bought instead.” In other words: The fact that this thing works doesn’t mean all is forgiven. Even if it had flunked Red Flag, the plane would have lived on, Singer says, because it has safely reached “too big to fail” territory. The question now is how a manned jet born of the 1990s will age in a world of ever smarter, autonomous uncrewed alternatives, and what the competition puts in the air. China and Russia are building comparable jets, and working on sensors designed to track jets like the F-35. The Red Flag success suggests the fighter, which has been fairly accused of being overcomplicated, can keep pace with what some see as simpler, more robust systems like the F-18. “This is an aircraft that depends heavily on things working—sensor data links, weapons systems, etc,” says military analyst Richard Aboulafia. “The simulation didn’t prove that it’s the ultimate dogfighter or has the most powerful missiles, far from it. But it proved that when everything is working it’s a formidable system.” For now, the debate seems settled in favor of the F-35. Here’s hoping that conversation stays academic. Go Back to Top.

But puny propellers don’t cut it for serious jobs, which is why military missions and humanitarian aid drops use unmanned aerial drones that resemble airplanes. Fixed-wing drones can fly further and carry more. The trouble is, winged aircraft can’t takeoff or land vertically like quadcopters, and the hybrid machines that combine the utility of wings and the ease of quads tend to be complex and expensive. Further compounding the challenge, fixed-wing drones need runaways, which you don’t often find in the remote locations where drones are most useful. But you don’t need a runway if you can fling them into the air and pluck them out again with, say, a web. Drone World Brian Barrett Lady Gaga’s Halftime Show Drones Have a Bright Future Joshua Bateman China’s Launching Drones to Fight Back Against Earthquakes Adam Rawnsley and Austin Bodetti The Warbot Builders of the Middle East Spill Their Secrets Aurora Flight Sciences created Project SideArm for Darpa, the Pentagon’s research wing. The engineering brief specified a “self-contained, portable apparatus able to horizontally launch and retrieve UAS of up to 900 pounds from trucks, ships and fixed ground facilities.” Instead of building a makeshift runway to drop supplies in a war zone or natural disaster, you can simply bring this gadget in on a truck, train, or ship. Launching a UAV this way is a lot like casting a stone with a slingshot. Project SideArm catches them much like an arresting cable captures a jet on an aircraft carrier: A hook on the drone catches a cable that hangs below a metal rail. As the snagged UAV slows and swings upward, barbs on the nosecone get caught in the net. Aurora demonstrated the system in December, catching a catapult-fired, 400-pound Lockheed Martin Fury drone. The company remains confident that’ll catch a drone weighing as much as 1,320 pounds. The whole system folds away into a 20-foot shipping container for easy transport. Darpa’s not the only one interested in ditching runways. Zipline, which uses drones to distribute blood to hospitals in rural Rwanda, also uses tail hooks and arresting wires, but flops the drone down onto a mat instead of up into a net. And German researchers recently caught a drone in a net mounted on an an Audi zipping along at 43 mph—instead of bringing the drone down to the car’s velocity, they accelerated to match it. This approach still requires a road, but does makes it possible to design lighter, flexible drones that don’t require heavy landing gear. All of this research might hasten the day when drones deliver stuff to your door. Rather than releasing flocks of drones from distant warehouses, Amazon could fire them from trucks closer to town—but not so close that you’ll see spooky spiders plucking them out of the air near your house.

Financial statements W Resources (LON:WRES) – vendor financing contract   Gold $1,275/oz – Gold price rises on rising geopolitical tensions.  • Trump has sent a clear signal to China and to the world. • Trump tweeted that the US is prepared to “solve the problem” of North Korea accelerating its missile development and nuclear programme unilaterally. • If N Korea launches any missiles in the direction of the US fleet in the South China Seas or even S Korea this may be sufficient provocation for the US to take action. • We believe Trump has given China an ultimatum.  It has suited China to leave N Korea well alone as China will inevitably have to deal with any refugee crisis or fallout from its troublesome neighbour. • China in response has announced that it will switch away from North Korean coal and will buy coal from the US.  Which suggests that either China has completely missed the point of Trump’s message or that China is simply not taking the threat seriously. • Trump may well take that as a bit of an insult and act with the support of other threatened nations.  If the US removes N Korea’s leadership then China may feel obliged to feed the population of N Korea or become hugely preoccupied with a potentially destabilising refugee crisis.  Neither outcome is good for China.   Safe haven assets gain on escalated rhetoric from major players in the geopolitical arena • The US criticised the Kremlin for “shielding” Assad that is said to have used chemical weapons at Khan Sheikhoun. • President Putin called chemical attacks in Syria as “provocations”  hours before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived to Moscow for an official visit. • The US sent the USS Carl Vinson with an escort of guided-missile cruiser and two destroyers after the latest missile test by North Korea last week. • The Vix index measuring the expected S&P 500 Index volatility climbed to the highest since Nov last year when concerns built up ahead of result of US presidential elections. • Additionally, in France a far-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon have been gaining support in the presidential race according to the latest polls. • 2 year French bond yields hit the highest level in Arp on Tuesday (-0.275%) reflecting investors’ nervousness ahead of elections scheduled for 23 Apr. • Gold hit a high of $1,280/oz in early hours today but came off slightly since then settling around $1,275/oz, up nearly $20/oz on Monday. • German 2 year bond yields hit the lowest level in a month (-0.848%). • A sell off in the iron ore market resumed with port inventories remaining close to record high and domestic mines ramping output up. • 62% Fe Qingdao delivered iron ore price fell to $74.4/t (-0.4%) on Tuesday while DCE futures were down 2.5% today at CNY 510.5/t.   Giant, high-grade Tellurium discovery made at ‘Tropic Seamount’ just 1,000m deep in Atlantic Ocean Nautilus Minerals (NUS CN) – C$0.23/s, mkt cap C$152m – Nautilus have the capability   Lucrative nodules • The discovery by the UK Geological Survey is being investigated using submersible robots in the Atlantic 300 miles off the Canary Islands • The tellurium discovered is >50,000 times the grade seen on land. • Tellurium is used in a type of advanced solar panel as well as wind turbines and electronics and this discovery may prove to be a significant advance for the industry. • Marine geologists had expected to find minerals on the seamount which rises 3,000m from the seabed but the concentration of grade has taken many by surprise • The 2,670t of tellurium on the seamount is around 1/12th of global supply and is worth around US$93m at current prices of around US$35,000/t. • Nautilus Minerals (NUS CN) is the only serious listed sub-sea mining company and are using British Engineering contractors to build their deep-sea mining machinery. • Two SP Angel analysts have travelled to see Nautilus’ new subsea machinery being built and tested in Newcastle on Tyne and one of our mining analysts has even travelled to see Nautilus’ drilling a volcanic massive sulphide ‘VMS’ deposit off the black sea. • Nautilus’ sub-sea machinery is impressive and is essentially an upgraded and heavy duty version of kit which is currently in use in the oil and gas industry for digging trenches for cables and pipelines. • The company are preparing to mine at depths of 2,000m so this new tellurium discovery at a mere 1,000m should be a piece of cake, though the mid-Atlantic presents its own challenges. • Chatham Rock, a New Zealand company were refused permission by the NZ authorities to mine phosphate nodules through simple suction dredging on the Chatham Sound off the coast of NZ last year setting sub-sea mining back in the region. • What we don’t get is if sub-sea mining is banned for disturbing the sea bed then why is trawling still allowed where fish trawlers destroy huge areas of seabed stirring up plumes of silt which then cover even larger areas. • Sub-sea mining and suction dredging removes most of the silt plume as it sucks up the silt.  Silt can then be placed back into trenches on the seabed reducing disturbance.   Dow Jones Industrials  -0.03% at 20,651

Gold in soil is a useful indicator for a potential gold deposit lying below and is often reported in parts per billion (ppb). Soil anomalies in tropical weathering terranes with levels greater than 100ppb (0.1g/t) gold are typically considered highly anomalous. • Structural trend: IronRidge are interested in a land position along a particular structural trend which runs down from Burkina Faso and through the Ivory Coast and is proven to host significant gold deposits. IronRidge’ strategic and prospective land position is now growing along strike in both directions around a third party 700Koz and growing gold discovery. • The idea is that anomalies along the shear zone will have caused gold to precipitate out of gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids at various points along the shear.  Sometimes this precipitation may be caused by changes in pressure, PH or some other environmental factor. • The Birimian sequence of rocks hosts some of the world’s largest gold orebodies in splays off the main shear zone and the team is keen to use their expertise to follow indicators to find new deposits in this relatively large and prospective tenement area. *SP Angel act as Nomad and Broker to IronRidge Resources   Mkango Resources* (LON:MKA) 0.06p, Mkt Cap £5m – Financial statements • Mkango Resources, the rare earths project company, have published their results for the year ending December 31 2016. • The results are, perhaps, less meaningful than the progress made last year in bringing Noble Metals on board as an offtake partner and shareholder. • The company is also collaborating with Metalysis on a project to research and develop rare earth alloys and powders for use in 3D printing machines. • This is a particularly interesting project and could lead to some ground breaking work in the development and rapid commercialisation of new alloys. • For example:  Norsk Titanium announced yesterday it is to deliver the world’s first FAA-approved 3D printed structural titanium components to Boeing. • This highlights how fast technology and manufacturing processes are moving with respect to 3D printing indicating that any development in new alloys may lead to future demand for more high value-added alloy powders. • Management recently announced new work plans for Songwe Hill and the Thambani uranium prospect to improve the processing flowsheet at Songwe Hill with a view to reducing costs in the process plant design.  There are always improvements to be found in these things in our experience. • REE market has changed with China now importing significant tonnages of REEs following the depletion of stockpiles sold off at discount prices following the collapse of a particularly large investment scheme in recent years.  This is good news for REEs and it is not easy to see where China is going to buy sufficient stocks of REE concentrates for its future needs. • A World Bank funded airborne survey highlighted a number of new potential REE targets in the Songwe Hill area indicating future potential to add further resources in the area. • The team also acquired rights to technology for the regeneration of hydrochloric acid representing a significant potential cost saving for the Songwe Hill project. • Financial statements: the 2016 statement shows expenses of US$1.15m for 2016 vs US$0.9m for 2015.  Around half of this was G&A while around US$0.5m relates to share-based payments in recognition if contributions made by key personnel to increase their proprietary interest in the company and thereby encourage their continued association with the company. • The revaluation of the unrealised gain on the revaluation of warrants added back US$0.58m though this was less than the US$1.3m added back a year earlier. • The net result was a relatively modest loss of US$0.86m vs US$5.3m a year earlier. • This demonstrates the lean and cost conscious way in which management run the company and its two listings while progressing with the Songwe Hill rare earths project in Malawi. • http://www.sedar.com/ • http://www.mkango.ca/s/financials.asp Conclusion:   Mkango’s valuation looks undervalued and unloved.  The company looks well set to benefit from a forecast rise in rare earth prices and renewed interest in REE supply. *SP Angel acts as Nomad and Broker to Mkango Resources   W Resources (LON:WRES) 0.3p, Mkt Cap £15.8m – vendor financing contract • W Resources report they have awarded vendor financing contracts to allmineral a German company at a contract price of €4.98m. • The jig and mill configuration are designed to upgrade the crushed ore by a factor of 1.5x to achieve an expected 91% metal recovery by rejecting some 55% of the run of mine ore. • The plant has a design capacity of 350tph and could allow the La Parrilla mine to expand to 3.5mtpa from 1.95mtpa. Conclusion:   Tungsten prices are low at around US$200/mtu with new mines such as Hemerdon struggling in this price environment.   Ormonde Mining are working towards construction of their world-class Barruecopardo tungsten mine in Spain but have delayed commissioning till mid-2018, almost certainly due to prevailing market conditions.  We expect more tungsten supply to hit the market from mines in Myanmar and as a byproduct of tin mining so the last thing the tungsten market needs is another new source of supply to absorb.

But we’re doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many,” he said. The many provisions of the Dodd-Frank measure were aimed at decreasing risks in the U.S. financial system. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. Report on regulations In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that will help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will most likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. However, congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on health care and tax reform. Participants in the Tuesday meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores; Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo; Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing; Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM; and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric. The business leaders are part of Trump’s “Strategy and Policy Forum” that last met with him in February. Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. “NAFTA is a disaster. It’s been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we’re going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you,” he said.   Credit : Voice of America (VOA) | Photo Credit: AP Advertisements Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Skype (Opens in new window) Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) About the Author New Delhi Times Bureau - Related News Iraqi Military: Islamic State Only Holds 7 Percent of Country Afghan Official: Russian Advisers Help Taliban in Contested Province UN Security Council to Vote to Close Haiti Peacekeeping Mission Report: US Sought to Monitor Trump Adviser Last Summer Tweet Pin It New Delhi Times A-2/59 Safdarjung Enclave New Delhi 110029, INDIA +91 11 26102520 [email protected] Article Submission Contact Us Terms of Use Privacy Policy About Us Copyright © New Delhi Times , All Rights Reserved 2017, [email protected] Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

Wheelock has said, noting that all human differences are forgotten when both nations work in the spirit of collaboration and respect for diversity. TrendsSpace exploration Humans as species remain fragile creatures whose existence is often decided by the policy makers on Earth. But in fact, human-made borders and demarcation lines evaporate in thin air when viewed from a porthole of the International Space Station, Wheelock who has been in space twice told RT.

Just take a look and you see that thin blue line [atmosphere]. That’s all of our next breath… It’s like biting into an apple and looking at the thickness of the skin. It’s even thinner than that proportionally. And when you see that you begin to realize how fragile we are as humans. And maybe there’s more to this existence than survival or providing for ourselves,” the astronaut noted. “We’re all breathing the same air. We can draw borders, but from space you can’t see them,” he added. The New York native noted that all space travelers take great pride in cooperation between Americans and Russians in space exploration as a “monument of human achievement.” “We always point to the space program because it’s something that we’ve done together and we – as cosmonauts and astronauts – we always point to that. And we say: Come on, guys and gals that make policy, look at what we’ve done together,” Wheelock said. “I’ve never met Putin. I’ve never met Trump. I’ve never met these other leaders... I’m just banking on the heart and soul of Putin when he was a young child; of Trump when he was a young child. Just take yourself back there to when the world was a simpler place and reach out a hand of cooperation and understanding. And celebrate differences. We’re all different,” the astronaut stressed. Yet the astronaut says politicians in the US tend to focus more on disagreements rather than reaching breakthrough with their adversaries. “In the US we have a sarcastic saying: ‘We can put a man on a Moon, but we cannot figure out how to get along with our Russian partners,” Wheelock noted after having served as NASA’s Director of Operations in Russia where he served at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City. Having been responsible for supporting Russia-based training and logistics of NASA astronauts and having served as the primary liaison between Star City and NASA operations in Houston, Wheelock expressed hope that Russians and American will find common ground and overcome their differences. “I have to believe that when it comes to the tough decisions, especially between US and Russia, that the cooler minds, the more logical thinking, the people who understand the history of where we’ve been – good and bad, and the consequences of these things – will understand that it’s better to work together,” he said. Moving away from the political assessment, the astronaut told RT that the future of space exploration and travel lies in the commercial sector with companies like SpaceX, Boeing and Blue Origin who are already doing “amazing things and technology.” Commenting on the human quest to reach the Red Planet, Wheelock told RT that reaching Mars is still some 20-25 years away as modern science still has not figured out the way for the crew to survive the journey which will take several years. Read more RT Space 360: Visit and compare Russian & US modules on the ISS Since space is “terribly unforgiving of mistakes”, the commander of a Mars mission would have to be a perfect balance of analytics, logics and impulse, the American noted. “On that first mission to Mars we ‘re likely going to have a scientist, a poet, who can help keep the scientist and the pilot within themselves and help them to understand the profoundness of what they’re doing, and probably someone like a mechanic, who’s good with just resolving issues that can arise,” he added. Wheelock also praised the realism of RT’s Space 360 project created in cooperation with Russia’s space agency Roscosmos and Energia Rocket and Space Corporation. He noted that virtual reality could become a useful tool to prepare and train crews for various emergencies. “I think it would be great for training. Specially, we can use it onboard for emergency training. We have three big emergencies that we are always prepared for – and hope to never have to react too. The first is fire, rapid decompression, a toxic release into atmosphere inside (the ISS). I see this as a really good way to a virtual reality kind of training through those scenarios; how to react in a particular emergency aboard the station. I think it’s going to be a great training tool.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.

(KAI) has secured contracts worth a combined 280 billion won (US$245 million) to supply parts to Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer S.A. by 2033, the company said Wednesday. In a regulatory filing with the Financial Supervisory Service, the country's sole aircraft manufacturer said it will provide wing parts for three types of Embraer airplanes by the end of 2033. "The delivery deadline may change depending on production volumes of the aircraft," KAI said in the filing without elaborating. Embraer's KC-390 military aircraft (Courtesy of Embraer) (Yonhap) Embraer's E915-E2 passenger jet (Courtesy of Embraer) (Yonhap) The three planes are the Embraer KC-390 military transport aircraft and the E190-E2 and E185-E2 passenger jets. The E190-E2 is the first member of Embraer's second-generation E-Jet family launched in 2013. In the past three years, KAI has reported robust earnings results helped by parts supply deals and exports of military trainer aircraft to emerging countries. KAI's net profit jumped to 268.11 billion won for 2016 from 111.07 billion won in 2014. Its operating profit also surged to 314.96 billion won from 161.25 billion won during the same period. Sales climbed to 3.1 trillion won last year from 2.3 trillion won two years earlier, it said. KAI has provided wing and other key components to aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus, Boeing, Embraer and Bombardier, since its foundation in 1999. Parts supply deals account for one-third of its sales. Separately, KAI's aircraft exports reached a cumulative US$3.4 billion as of Wednesday helped by demand for the KT-1 basic trainers and the T-50 advanced trainer jets sold to such countries as Peru, Indonesia and the Philippines.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Jeff Mason and Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with "something else." At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a "major haircut" for them. "For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else," Trump said on Tuesday. "That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many," he said. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform. On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month's end of sweeping legislation known as the "Financial CHOICE Act" that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul. The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervisory powers and make the director removable at will. It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash. The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation. Participants in Tuesday's meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N); Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo (PEP.N); Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co (BA.N); Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM (IBM.N); and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co (GE.N).

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) New exhibit at flight museum explores the causes of war Dan Catchpole Wed Apr 12th, 2017 2:25pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — You are the head of an African nation where people are dying of thirst. Radical rebels are demanding you step down. What do you do? Negotiate? Mobilize your military? Nothing? The clock is ticking. Thousands of lives — maybe even your own — hang in the balance. The hypothetical scenario is part of the Flying Heritage & Combat Armor Museum’s effort to help visitors explore the factors and decisions that can lead to war. The exhibit “Why War?” unpacks the causes and consequences of armed conflict. The permanent installation opened in early March at the museum’s Paine Field location. “This isn’t People magazine history,” said Adrian Hunt, the collection’s executive director. “This is based on serious scholarship.” Design consultants and museum staff translated that high-level research into material that is simple enough for grade school children to grasp without gutting the topic’s complexity. Greg Cashman, a retired political science professor at Salisbury University in Maryland, guided the exhibit. The installation focuses on the most common factors, identified by decades of empirical research and in case studies, said Cashman, who has spent more than 20 years studying the topic. His textbook “What Causes War?” is read by college students across the country. Those factors include national rivalry, territorial disputes, power shifts and domestic turmoil. Hunt contacted Cashman after reading the book. Cashman said he never expected to work on a project such as this exhibit. “I wasn’t sure how they’d make it work,” he said. “It’s really quite amazing.” The museum hired Seattle-based Belle & Wissell to design the exhibit. The exhibit includes giant touchscreen monitors that allow visitors to explore the causes of various conflicts involving the United States. Then there are the hot-seat scenarios where visitors play national leader in a series of hypothetical scenarios. The collection’s owner, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, wanted the exhibit to talk about the consequences of war, Hunt said. The exhibit includes a room on nuclear war with replicas of Fat Man and Little Boy — the two atomic bombs dropped by U.S. forces on Japan during World War II. On a wall are copies of a letter from Albert Einstein to President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939 discussing the possibilities of developing nuclear weapons and a few pages from Major Robert Lewis’ eyewitness account of dropping the first atomic bomb, Little Boy, on Hiroshima on Aug. 6. After the bomb exploded above the city, the B-29 Enola Gay turned away, and “there in front of our eyes was without a doubt the greatest explosion man has ever witnessed,” wrote Lewis, the Boeing airplane’s co-pilot. Allen owns the originals of the Einstein letter and Lewis account, which are archived for safekeeping. In another room, visitors can explore the human side of conflict, including sculptures crafted out of artillery shells during World War I. Visitors can digitally thumb through interactive displays recounting the wartime experiences of children, women and men. The exhibit is “an explicit change in the direction of the work we do,” Hunt said. It is meant to attract younger visitors and provide context for the painstakingly restored tanks, aircraft and other war machines on display at the museum at Paine Field south of Everett. The museum is looking to add another hangar to accommodate its growing collection. Its two hangars are already crowded with 45 big war machines, including 26 aircraft and 19 tanks, vehicles and weapon systems. “We’re not interested in being the best museum in Everett or in the Pacific Northwest,” he said. “We’re just interested in being the best, period.” Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com; Twitter: @dcatchpole.   Jason Thompson walks by an interactive exhibit of screens about wars.

His most dramatic u-turn was on Nato, which he declared is "no longer obsolete" during a joint news conference with visiting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. China is also not a currency manipulator, he said in another significant shift during an interview with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). And for the first time, Mr Trump said US-Russia relationship is at an all-time low. Here's a quick look at the six issues: 1. NATO Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (left) and US President Donald Trump holding a joint press conference in the East Room at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 12, 2017. PHOTO: AFP For more than a year, Mr Trump said the military alliance was outdated and costing the United States too much money. He suggested replacing it with an alternative organisation focusing on counter-terrorism and repeatedly used the word "obsolete" to describe Nato. As recently as Jan 15, he said in an interview with the Times of London and Germany's Bild that Nato was "obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror" and that critics of his comments had "started saying Trump is right." During the joint press conference with Mr Stoltenberg on Wednesday, Mr Trump said his past comments had led the alliance to make changes that satisfied his concerns. "I complained about that a long time ago, and they made a change - and now they do fight terrorism," he said. "I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete," he added. It is unclear what changes the president was referring to. Nato did add a new assistant secretary general position that focused on intelligence and security in July 2016, but experts said the change did not mark a major shift for the organisation and that Nato has long addressed concerns of terrorism. 2. CHINA A group of China supporters waving Chinese and US flags as they wait for the arrival of Chinese President Xi Jinping at Palm Beach international airport on April 6, 2017. PHOTO: AFP During the presidential campaign, Mr Trump promised to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. On the 83rd day, he told the WSJ that Beijing is not manipulating its currency."They're not currency manipulators," he said. Countries can manipulate the currency in order to make their exports cheaper and give their factories and workers an advantage. When countries buy up foreign currencies and sell their own, the price of their own currencies on the global market falls, allowing their exports to trade at a discount. Most economists agreed that China manipulated its currency in the past but it has not continued the practice. This is also former president Barack Obama's view. Although Mr Obama, like Mr Trump, had accused China of manipulation when he was a presidential candidate, his administration never formally declared China a manipulator. The Treasury Department is scheduled to release a report on currency manipulation in the coming days. 3. RUSSIA It was "certainly possible" that President Vladimir Putin (pictured) knew about the suspected chemical attack in Syria's rebel-held Khan Sheikhun town, said US President Donald Trump. PHOTO: AFP Mr Trump said he has growing concerns about Russia's support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and questioned Moscow's role in a suspected chemical attack in Syria's rebel-held Khan Sheikhun town on April 4. That attack killed at least 87 people including many children. He said it was "certainly possible" that President Vladimir Putin knew about the attack, indicating that Russian officials were present at the Syrian airbase which the US military struck on April 6. "I would like to think that they didn't know, but certainly they could have. They were there. So we'll find out," he said. "We may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia," Mr Trump said. "Right now we are not getting along with Russia at all," he said in stark tones at odds with his former vows to ease the chill in ties with the US nuclear foe. While criticising Russia, Mr Trump said he and Mr Xi Jinping had bonded during the Chinese president's visit to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last week, where they dined together with their wives and held talks. "I think we had a very good chemistry together. I think he wants to help us with North Korea. We talked trade," Mr Trump said. "I was very impressed with President Xi and I think he means well." The two leaders followed up on the summit late on Tuesday with what the White House called a "very productive" telephone call. Before the summit, Mr Trump had predicted a very difficult meeting with Mr Xi over issues like North Korea and trade. 4. SYRIA An unconscious Syrian child receiving treatment at a hospital in Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the northwestern Syrian Idlib province, following a suspected toxic gas attack on April 4, 2017. PHOTO: AFP Mr Trump said it was time to end Syria's "brutal" civil war, as he branded Mr Assad a "butcher". He called on Nato allies to "work together to resolve the disaster" in Syria and thanked them for condemning the suspected chemical attack in Khan Sheikhun town. "Vicious slaughter of innocent civilians with chemical weapons including the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies must be forcefully rejected by any nation that values human life," he said. "That's a butcher. So I felt we had to do something about it. I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing, and it was very, very successfully done," he added. "It is time to end this brutal civil war, defeat terrorists and allow refugees to return home." His comments came just days after the Trump administration seemed to have accepted an ultra-realist approach that would allow the Syrian president to remain in control of his shattered nation. 5. JANET YELLEN During his campaign, Mr Donald Trump had accused Ms Janet Yellen of manipulating interest rates to help Mr Barack Obama politically. PHOTO: REUTERS Perhaps the most consequential endorsement Mr Trump gave Mr Obama in the interview with WSJ was a compliment to Ms Janet Yellen, whom Mr Obama nominated to be chair of the Federal Reserve. During the campaign, Mr Trump had accused Ms Yellen of manipulating interest rates to help Mr Obama politically, as lower rates boosted economic growth. He suggested to the Washington Post that Ms Yellen and her colleagues' policy of maintaining interest rates near zero could inflate a "bubble where you go into a very massive recession." But when asked by the WSJ on Wednesday whether he would look for a replacement for Ms Yellen when her term expires next year, the president suggested that she might be allowed to stay on. "I like her. I respect her," he said. "It's very early." 6. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK Much of the Export-Import Bank's aid goes to large corporations such as Boeing. PHOTO: AFP Mr Trump also told the WSJ he supports the Export-Import Bank, an agency that subsidises US exports and is detested by conservative lawmakers. The right points out that much of the bank's aid goes to large corporations such as Boeing, which conservatives say do not need help from the government. During the presidential campaign, Mr Trump initially opposed the bank, calling it "feather bedding." He said in 2015: "I don't like it because I don't think it's necessary". He said "the bank mainly helps a few companies - and these are companies that can do very well without it." Later in the campaign though, Mr Trump seemed to have moderated that opposition, and two Democratic senators said earlier this year that the president told them he had come around to supporting the agency. Mr Trump acknowledged his position had changed in his interview with the WSJ. "It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped," he said. "Instinctively, you would say 'Isn't that a ridiculous thing.' ... But actually, it's a very good thing." Mr Obama and many mainstream Republicans also supported the Export-Import Bank, arguing that the United States must compete with other countries that have similar agencies for promoting exports.

Lynch Washington - President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with "something else." At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a "major haircut" for them. Share this story President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with business leaders in the State Department Library on the White House complex in Washington, Tuesday, April 11, 2017. AP Photo/Evan Vucci "For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else," Trump said on Tuesday. "That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many," he said. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with US regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. Read also: Should Trump earn a salary? Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform. On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month's end of sweeping legislation known as the "Financial CHOICE Act" that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul. The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervisory powers and make the director removable at will. It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash. The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation. Participants in Tuesday's meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc; Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo; Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co; Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM; and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co. The business leaders are part of Trump's "Strategy and Policy Forum" that last met with him in February. Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. "NAFTA is a disaster. It's been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we're going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you," he said.  Reuters Share this story Recommended For You Most Read 1 Man killed by shark 2 Mantashe holds back as ANCYL slams Mbeki 3 #ZumaBirthday: President says he would step down if asked by ANC 4 Wife shot in hostage drama 5 #HelenZille officially charged over 'pro-colonialism' tweets Advertisement X BUSINESS REPORT About us Contact us Feedback Follow us on INSIDE BUSINESS REPORT Companies Economy Energy Markets Entrepreneurs Technology Careers International Opinion Financial tools EXPLORE IOL News Politics Business Report Personal Finance Sport Entertainment Lifestyle Motoring Travel BUSINESS REPORT WEEKLY Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

The lawsuit, filed in US District Court in Washington, accuses Yahoo senior executives of turning a blind eye as the fund’s manager, Harry Wu, illegally spent millions of dollars on high-end real estate, inflated staff salaries and a museum documenting the history of forced labour camps in China. According to the lawsuit, Mr Wu, a veteran Chinese dissident who died in April 2016, spent less than 4 per cent of the money on humanitarian aid. Read more Yahoo and AOL to be combined by Verizon into new company called Oath The lawsuit demands that Yahoo replenish the trust, which has been significantly depleted. Suzanne Philion, a spokeswoman for Yahoo, declined to comment, saying the company does not discuss litigation. The legal action arrives at an awkward time for Yahoo, which is in the final stages of merger negotiations with Verizon Communications. The discussions have been buffeted by revelations that Yahoo delayed disclosures of huge hacking intrusions that compromised its computer network. The lawsuit is also a reminder of one of the more ignominious episodes in Yahoo’s history. In 2007, the company, based in Silicon Valley, belatedly acknowledged that it had provided Chinese authorities with the identities of subscribers in China whose emails had angered the government. The disclosures led to the jailing of two activists who were given 10-year prison sentences. In a public rebuke, a congressional panel criticised Yahoo’s chief executive at the time, Jerry Yang, and accused him of lying about the company’s cooperation with Chinese security officials. “While technologically and financially you are giants, morally you are pygmies,” Democratic member of the House of Representatives, Tom Lantos, said during a televised hearing in 2007. To settle litigation against the company, Mr Yang subsequently gave $3.2m to relatives of each of the two jailed dissidents. And in an unusual move, the company provided more than $17m for the creation of a humanitarian fund dedicated to helping Chinese activists and their families. To administer the money, Yahoo turned to Mr Wu, a politically connected rights advocate who had spent 19 years in Chinese labour camps before gaining US asylum.

Shareholders Get Millions of Reasons to Vote for Revised Deal With Verizon An irascible, strong-willed figure, Mr Wu ended up spending much of that money on his organisation, the Laogai Research Foundation, which had worked to expose China’s exploitative use of prison labour, especially involving people jailed for political crimes. The expenditures included a $2.5m town house in the Dupont Circle neighbourhood of Washington, a $60,000 raise for Mr Wu and what the lawsuit contends was a no-show job for his wife. Mr Wu, the documents show, also spent $800,000 from the fund to defend himself against a number of lawsuits accusing him of sexual harassment or the misuse of federal grants. According to the foundation’s filings, only $700,000 was distributed to Chinese dissidents or their families, many of whom were forced into poverty by the government in its effort to dissuade others from publicly criticising the ruling Communist Party. Of the original $17.3m, less than $3m is thought to remain. Mr Wu died last year at 79 while on vacation in Honduras. In an interview with The New York Times shortly before his death, he defended his decision to pull back from the fund’s original mission, saying that the intended recipients were too demanding and could not be trusted.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

PHOTO: REUTERS WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with “something else.” At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a “major haircut” for them. “For the bankers in the room, they’ll be very happy because we’re really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else,” Trump said on Tuesday. China will get better U.S. trade deal if it solves North Korea problem: Trump “That will be the minimum. But we’re doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many,” he said. The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank’s rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve. A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process. In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests. That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road. Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform. On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month’s end of sweeping legislation known as the “Financial CHOICE Act” that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul. The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s supervisory powers and make the director removable at will. It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash. The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation. Participants in Tuesday’s meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N); Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo (PEP.N); Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co (BA.N); Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM (IBM.N); and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co (GE.N). Trump, May aim to convince Moscow to end Assad support The business leaders are part of Trump’s “Strategy and Policy Forum” that last met with him in February. Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. “NAFTA is a disaster. It’s been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we’re going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you,” he said.

In particular, Arconic suggests that all shareholders ask Elliott questions on these important points: After three directors on Arconic's Board were added last year at Elliott's recommendation, Elliott has now nominated four more directors. Question: How are other shareholders' interests served by giving Elliott, a 13.2% shareholder, the privilege of nominating seven of Arconic's 13 directors? Elliott suggests that Arconic's Board install Larry Lawson as the new CEO of Arconic. Mr. Lawson has a non-compete agreement with his prior employer that legally restricts him from serving as Arconic's CEO. In fact, Mr. Lawson's prior employer has stated that he is already in violation of the agreement due to his involvement with Elliott. Questions: Does Elliott believe that Mr. Lawson should violate his contractual commitment to his prior employer? Is Mr. Lawson treating his prior employer ethically by violating his non-compete agreement by offering to work for Arconic? Mr. Lawson is on Elliott's payroll. In fact, Elliott has already paid Mr. Lawson approximately $6.6 million in consulting fees and indemnification for breaching his non-compete agreement. In total, Elliott has agreed to pay him approximately $28 million over the course of the next two years, regardless of whether Mr. Lawson becomes Arconic's CEO. Questions: Aren't other shareholders' interests best served by assigning the full Board the responsibility of selecting the CEO? Why should that be Elliott's privilege? How would Elliott propose to resolve the apparent conflict of interest caused by appointing a CEO to whom it is paying tens of millions of dollars on the side? When Elliott began its proxy contest, it produced an analysis indicating that it thought Arconic's Global Rolled Products ("GRP") division, which generated EBITDA of $577 million in 2016, could increase its EBITDA by $750 million. Within a matter of days, Elliott issued multiple revisions of its analysis and now seemingly believes that EBITDA can only be expanded by $245 million.ii Questions: Does the same prescription apply to a division that has an opportunity to increase EBITDA by 42% as one that could more than double its EBITDA? In light of Elliott's admitted, significant analytical error, how can shareholders rely on Elliott's analysis or plans for Arconic's future? Elliott has compared Arconic's Engineered Products Solutions ("EPS") business to that of Precision Castparts ("PCC"). However, EPS is significantly smaller than PCC and does not participate in some of the higher margin segments in which PCC is a market leader. Cowen and Companyiii recently published a report noting "the benchmark that Elliott cites is an unrealistic bar." Questions: Are Elliott's conclusions about margin potential and underperformance well informed? How specifically does Elliott suggest that EPS, despite being much smaller and not participating in some high margin segments, close the margin gap to PCC? Klaus Kleinfeld was appointed as CEO of Alcoa Inc. when the Company was highly levered and the price of aluminum was near an all-time high. In the nine months thereafter, aluminum prices collapsed and Alcoa Inc.'s stock price fell dramatically. Since then, shareholders of Alcoa Inc., now Arconic, have seen Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") of 182%iv, as the Company generated $8 billion in shareholder wealth in eight years.i Alcoa Inc. shareholder return also outperformed both the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the overall S&P Metals & Mining Index since 2009.v Alcoa Inc. was included in these two indices from 2009 until the separation in November 2016, and unlike the broad S&P 500 index, these indices include companies where earnings power and share prices are highly correlated to underlying commodity prices, making these indices the appropriate benchmark for comparison. Questions: How can Elliott ignore the impact of the global financial crisis when evaluating Alcoa Inc.'s shareholder returns? How does providing a comparison to (i) broad market indices that are not directly levered to commodity pricing or (ii) companies that were not comparable to Alcoa Inc. for the vast majority of the time period provide shareholders with any insight into Alcoa Inc.'s relative performance? Shouldn't Elliott focus on relative performance to indices that include large-scale commodity producers with share price correlation to commodity markets (i.e. S&P Metals & Mining and S&P 500 Metals & Mining indices)? Elliott has commended Alcoa Inc. for separating its business into two publicly traded companies, Arconic and Alcoa Corporation. Indeed, Elliott said that Alcoa Inc. would not be fully valued unless the Company took action to split its businesses into two public companies. Now, however, Elliott is using TSR data that deliberately excludes the value created by the separation by measuring Mr. Kleinfeld's performance (and the Alcoa Inc. stock performance) only until the day before the split into two public companies. Questions: Why should shareholders ignore the value created by the successful separation of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation in calculating the value created by the current leadership team? Isn't it disingenuous to suggest that shareholders ignore the successful culmination of the strategic transformation of Alcoa Inc. that was executed by Mr. Kleinfeld and the rest of the management team under the oversight of the Board? The current management team, led by Mr. Kleinfeld, has a strong track record of performance that has been demonstrated before, during and after completing the highly complex separation of Alcoa Inc. Following actions taken to save Alcoa Inc. during the global financial crisis by reducing costs and strengthening the balance sheet, the management team executed a complex transformation of the upstream and downstream businesses. The transformation built Arconic into the company it is today, completing divestitures, organic growth projects and acquisitions to focus on the high growth, high value aerospace and automotive markets. Leadership created a successful culture of innovation and technology, with a strong focus on cost competitiveness and established deep customer partnerships that are the lifeblood of Arconic. Arconic's major customers, including Airbus, Boeing, GE and United Technologies have all expressed their strong support for Mr. Kleinfeld and his continued leadership of Arconic. Question: Why aren't shareholders' interests best served by a management team with a strong and proven execution-focused track record? Wouldn't critical customer relationships be jeopardized by a change in leadership and strategy as Elliott is proposing? Arconic has a substantially new Board; seven of its 12 independent directors have joined the Board in the last 15 months. Three of those directors were added at the recommendation of Elliott. Directors have met with Elliott, other shareholders, customers, suppliers and employees. The Board has engaged in extensive analysis of Elliott's claims and of the strategy, performance and leadership of Arconic. Questions: Why should shareholders doubt the judgment of highly qualified independent directors who have worked diligently to evaluate Elliott's claims and have access to information that Elliott does not? Why aren't shareholders best served by these independent directors, a majority of whom are new, three of whom were recommended by Elliott, and all of whom concluded that Arconic has the right strategy and the right leadership? ​Source: http://www.arconic.com/global/en/home.asp Download PDF Copy Request Quote Comments Tell Us What You Think Do you have a review, update or anything you would like to add to this news story?
