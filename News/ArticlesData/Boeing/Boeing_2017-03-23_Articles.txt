U.S. automakers and other manufacturers that rely on imported components also would be affected by the proposals, which would tax imports at a 20 percent rate, and could split these sectors into winners and losers. The revamp would heighten existing tensions in the aerospace industry, where Boeing's aggressive cost-cutting driven by fierce competition with European rival Airbus has pushed suppliers to lower prices and source more parts and materials abroad. Aerospace components often zigzag through multiple countries and companies before reaching Boeing's factories in Washington and South Carolina. U.S.-based suppliers to Boeing would face a tax on their imports of these parts. Boeing, the top exporter among U.S. manufacturers, would export its jetliners tax free. Boeing and some of its largest suppliers, such as United Technologies Corp, General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc, which also have substantial exports, favor the Republican tax package. The plans, laid out in a blueprint last year and which President Donald Trump has spoken about favorably, aim to boost U.S. manufacturing, and include cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and making capital investments immediately deductible. Lawmakers already are at work drafting a tax bill to introduce by early summer, but it could be delayed if health care changes take longer than expected, according to congressional staff. SUPPLIERS CONCERNED If the proposed 20 percent tax on imported goods had been in effect last year, Norfil Complex Machining, a 40-employee company in Pacific, Washington, likely would have paid more for titanium it imports from Russia. The metal goes into parts Norfil makes for Boeing landing gear that get assembled in Japan. "A lot of Russian titanium goes into planes," said Doren Spinner, Norfil's CEO. His purchase contracts have pricing that adjusts if costs go up, so the tax "would end up affecting what the plane would cost," he says. Other companies said it would be tough to pass higher costs on, and some might move production to low-cost locations abroad. "If the taxes are ridiculous, we'd just have to think of something creative," said Paul Doran, a sales manager at Mifa, a subsidiary of Netherlands-based Aalberts Industries NV that makes precision aluminum parts for aerospace, autos and other industries. "I think most companies would be in the same boat." Colin Frost, chief operating officer at parts and tooling supplier Carr Lane Manufacturing Co in St. Louis, Missouri, said he would consider manufacturing overseas if the tax plan were passed. "We'd end up splitting up the company and I don't think that's necessarily good for the U.S. economy," he said. Boeing said it was too soon to judge the plan's effects on suppliers and so far it appeared likely to benefit the industry as a whole rather than disrupt the supply chain. "These assessments will vary by company, and it's premature to speculate or generalize," Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said. OUTSOURCING CONUNDRUM Boeing was among about 90 companies, including many suppliers, that signed a letter this month from the Aerospace Industries Association urging Congress to overhaul the U.S. tax system. Boeing also is part of the American Made Coalition, an industry group that backs Republican tax proposals. Proponents say tax reform also would strengthen the dollar, offsetting the impact of the import tax for suppliers, and would encourage companies to invest in the United States. The tax overhaul could have cut Boeing's taxable income by an estimated $44.5 billion last year, according to tax experts and a Reuters analysis of Boeing's 2016 deliveries. Two-thirds of Boeing's jetliners were delivered overseas and would be tax exempt. Worth about $89 billion at list prices, they were likely sold at discounts of about 50 percent typical in the industry. Boeing declined to comment on the estimate. Boeing would face import taxes, too. Its 787 Dreamliner, for example, uses major parts from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and Italy's Leonardo SpA. Boeing also would still pay tax on sales to U.S. airlines and the new tax regime would affect its defense and space businesses, which source and sell globally. Yet suppliers say Boeing's vigorous cost-saving has pressed many to outsource production to low-cost countries, which now exposes them to a potential border tax. U.S. aerospace imports have doubled the past decade, with Mexico the fastest-growing source, up 950 percent since 2006. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2n4A8o1) Supply chains would face renewed pressure under the new tax regime, said David Wireman, managing director and co-head of aerospace and defense at consulting firm AlixPartners. "The tax on imports proposed by the new administration would certainly affect the complex decisions on choosing suppliers, and likely would cause manufacturers to change some supplier relationships."

Parker) Military KC-46A lands at Travis for testing By Daily Republic staff From page A3 | March 24, 2017 TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE — The first KC-46A Pegasus air tanker landed at Travis Air Force Base on March 7 for four days of ground and flight testing, according to a 60th Air Mobility Wing statement released late last week. Testing was a combined effort between Boeing Test & Evaluation and the 418th Flight Test Squadron, Detachment 1, both of which are located at the Boeing Facility in Seattle. The KC-46A was at Travis to conduct military and Federal Aviation Administration certification testing, Capt. Dylan Neidorff, 418th Flight Test Squadron KC-46 test operations engineer said in the news release. “We decided to come to Travis since the base is right in the temperature band required for the testing,” Neidorff said, referring to the region’s temperatures that  average between 50 and 70 degrees. Other factors made Travis the best choice, such as the base’s underground tanks that allowed the KC-46 to offload all of its fuel easier, Paul Briedé, test director for Boeing Test & Evaluation, said in the release. The testing comes three months after Travis was announced as one of the next preferred KC-46 bases for Air Mobility Command along with Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey. When the KC-46 team wasn’t conducting testing, tours were provided to more than 40 Airmen from the 60th Air Mobility Wing. “This was an opportunity to work with Boeing and create a relationship,” said Maj. Brad Echols, 60th Operations Support Squadron assistant director of operations, in the release. “It’s pretty exciting our airmen got to see the new aircraft.” According to Air Force officials, the first KC-46As are expected to begin arriving this fall at McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas and Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma.

Latest news headlines from Zimbabwe Situation Skip to content Home Latest TEXT ONLY Sources Lists Archives About “Zimbabwe Situation” Friends Support us Advertise AirZim deal collapses By ZimSitRep_M | March 23, 2017 6 Comments Source: AirZim deal collapses | The Financial Gazette March 23, 2017 By Shame Makoshori, Senior Business Reporter PLANS by the country’s beleaguered airline, Air Zimbabwe (AirZim), to lease modern passenger aircraft from Malaysia Airlines have hit a brick wall after the two parties could not agree on terms underpinning the multi-million dollar deal, the Financial Gazette can exclusively report. Zimbabwe had made giant strides in negotiating the acquisition of Boeing 787 Dreamliners from Malaysia Airlines to turn around the fortunes of the troubled AirZim, which is wallowing in debt estimated at about US$300 million. The two parties had opened discussions on the deal after President Robert Mugabe had led a delegation to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, last year to scout for opportunities for the landlocked southern African country. His delegation comprised Transport and Infrastructure Development Minister Joram Gumbo and aviation experts from AirZim who used the visit to the south-east Asian country to engage Malaysia Airlines with a view to either acquire or lease long-haul planes while parallel efforts back home focussed on identifying routes that would help the national flag carrier return to the black. Government had shown interest in the Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are basically long-haul, mid-size wide body, twin engine jet airliner manufactured by the United States’ Boeing Commercial Airplanes. AirZim board chairperson, Chipo Dyanda, could not be drawn into commenting on the latest development saying: “This is a shareholder matter. I refer you to the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development.” Gumbo confirmed this week that the discussions with Malaysia Airlines had fallen through and that AirZim had since shifted its focus elsewhere. “I am still talking with potential airlines and we may agree soon,” said Gumbo. “At the moment I do not want to say who they are. We were talking to 11 airlines in Singapore, in Ethiopia and other countries and there was nothing special about Malaysia. I only mentioned Malaysia (last year) because I went there to see planes that they were not using but we could not agree on certain issues,” he added. A new and efficient fleet would be crucial in AirZim’s struggle to return to profitability after meddling by government and years of mismanagement pushed the airline into its current crisis. It has been operating old aircraft that have been guzzling fuel and piling up expenses. AirZim has battled to compete for market share with regional competitors such as South African Airways, among others, which have invested in modern aircraft to save costs and attract the industry’s demanding clientele. Sources said AirZim was making progress on acquiring at least four Boeing 777s (B777s) aircraft from an undisclosed supplier. It also emerged that the AirZim board was exploring the possibility of establishing a new company to house the new fleet and start on a clean slate. Although this idea has not been officially communicated to government, the new airline could be called Zimbabwe Airways and would have the four aeroplanes as its first major assets. AirZim’s debt burden is one of the impediments to its ability to acquire new planes, as well as reaching agreement with a technical partner to steer the parastatal out of the woods. A new company is therefore seen as the most viable alternative to circumvent the problem, and even insulate the new planes from seizure by creditors. It was not immediately clear if the deal involves an outright acquisition or a lease, although indications are that AirZim would take delivery of the first batch of the B777s planes in the coming few months. If the national flag carrier is to acquire the planes, it could spend almost US$1 billion. The lowest priced model of the 777 family, the Boeing 777-200ER, costs US$261,5 million, while the Boeing 777-300ER goes for US$320,2 million. This, apparently, is costly for AirZim, whose shareholder, government, is broke and has spent the past year battling to pay its bloated civil service. It therefore does not have the financial wherewithal to fund the acquisition. The latest information appears to suggest that the AirZim board has ignored recommendations from consultants that it acquires two Dreamliner B787s and Brazilian assembled Embrear jetliners. The Embraer was briefly operated by AirZim on domestic and regional flights under a lease agreement three years ago. A report by audit consultants, EY, on the airline’s operations three years ago had recommended that AirZim should acquire or lease two B787 jetliners, which are smaller than the B777s. This was in addition to AirZim’s existing fleet. A feasibility assessment committee report came up with similar recommendations, according to sources familiar with the discussions. The committee had recommended that the airline procures a fleet of the Brazilian assembled 60-seater Embraer jetliners for domestic and short regional routes to significantly reduce costs on domestic routes, where AirZim has been operating the B737s, or even the much bigger B767s. There have been reports that AirZim has been flying with as low as three passengers on the Johannesburg-Harare route. The 150-seater Airbus A320 has also been flying on domestic and regional routes. AirZim is currently leasing two Airbus planes, one of which has been grounded ever since its delivery to the parastatal. Currently, AirZim has been grappling with declining load factors, and chief executive officer, Ripton Muzenda, has ordered that flights on the Harare-Kariba-Victoria Falls route should immediately be discontinued. A Chinese made MA60 plane, which is fuel efficient aircraft but costly to maintain, had been servicing the route. Passenger numbers have plummeted to about 230 000 per annum in the past few years, from a peak of one million in 1996, as travellers opt for other airlines on the four domestic destinations it services. The airline, currently flying into South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania, has been planning to re-launch the cash-spinning Harare-London flights, but airline executives have warned that without modern jetliners, it would be a waste of time because it would most certainly face stiff competition. AirZim’s aged fleet comprises of two Boeing 767s, three B737s, three MA60s and two Airbus A320s. Out of these planes, only four are flying – one airbus, one Boeing 767, one 737 and an MA60. Only two were in operation last week. The airline came close to liquidation when it stopped flights in 2011 before its sole shareholder took the decision to resume operation in November 2012. AirZim was also struggling due to a debt overhang; outstanding salaries/wages; collapsed administration systems; bloated staff complement; top-heavy management and limited route network consisting of local and two regional flights, namely South Africa and Tanzania that would inevitably affect its revenue. The Dyanda-led board has addressed the top-heavy management by putting in place a lean structure. Currently, a staff audit and restructuring exercise is underway to ensure the right people are in the right places and the airline carries a wage and salary bill it can afford and for the right kind of skills, knowledge and technical expertise. “We have also restructured the executive to ensure efficiency and reliability and to also upgrade and modernise systems that had collapsed and were outdated. Two new posts of chief operating officer and an executive manager (systems and administration) were created to achieve efficiency, reliability and modernisation of airline systems. We have also appointed an executive with the right technical skills, commitment and vision that the airline can be revived, can be viable and profitable to enable it to significantly contribute to national development by complementing road and rail transportation,” said Dyanda. “Above all, we are crafting a new three-year strategic plan with a different operational and business model so that we redirect the company to become a competitive airline in the next three years. In addition, these proposed changes are being done in a holistic, forward-looking and visionary manner to give the airline a new robust foundation for growth and development. In crafting this strategic plan, we have engaged our stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations from the airline, re-engaged the shareholder on the airline mandate as the national carrier and re-engineered the business model and systems. “As for the payment of retrenched workers’ packages, they are being paid monthly to the capacity of the airline. As a board, we are cognisant of their struggle to fend for their families, but we are limited by the funds available from a limited route network and the need to balance their needs with the operational requirements of the company. Some of them, with the right skills and expertise, may be re-absorbed in the company through the restructuring process currently underway. In addition, as the airline begins to have a good footing, more manpower may be required and more will be absorbed. The business model being proposed has the capacity to grow the business, but in some cases human resources will need upgrading to cope with the new demands.” Regarding EY’s recommendations, Dyanda said these were being considered as part of the 2017-2020 strategic plan. “Some recommendations from this report will be integrated with other strategies that have since come on board due to the developments in airline management, viability and profitability,” she said. Dyanda said no single solution was the magic wand for the revival of the airline, adding that money was not the only solution to the problems besetting the airline. “There are several strategies that are being put in place among them searching for a strategic partner by the shareholder, upgrading employee skills, knowledge and attitudes, changing the culture of the organisation, modernisation of the airline systems, rebranding to change the negative perceptions the airline has earned over the years and energising commitment and the vision of those running the organisation,” she said. The planned acquisition of B777 planes has already sparked heated debate within the airline, with questions being raised over the rationale behind purchasing long haul airliners during at a time when debts in London have meant that the national flag carrier cannot operate on this most lucrative route, for instance. “The bigger and the more the planes, the more cash those behind the acquisitions would get…. This has nothing to do with AirZim’s requirements. It only needs two big 787s. But four planes will give them more kickbacks. They want to make money out of aircraft acquisitions,” said a source.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 24 March 2017 MAS mulls deals for 42 jets as 'things are going better a bit quicker' Bellew: “Things have gone a bit better a bit quicker than I expected,” said Bellew, an Irishman who became MAS CEO last July after joining as chief operating officer in 2015, following nine years at Dublin-based discount specialist Ryanair Holdings Plc. “We’re ahead of where we hoped we would be.” - Bernama LONDON: Malaysia Airlines Bhd (MAS) plans to seal deals for as many as 42 wide-body jets over the next few months as the unprofitable carrier seeks to rebuild its long-haul network following a surge in demand. Terms should be agreed in the next six to eight weeks for the lease of up to a dozen used Airbus Group SE A330 or Boeing Co 777 aircraft, chief executive officer Peter Bellew said in an interview. That could be followed later in the first half by an order for 25 to 30 new Boeing 787s or A330neos, as the upgraded Airbus model is known, potentially worth more than US$7bil. Bellew is looking to expand wide-body operations after MAS slashed its fleet and route network in response to a bookings slump that followed two fatal plane crashes in 2014. Sales have now recovered to the extent that the carrier posted an 81% load factor in the fourth quarter of 2016, including a 90% occupancy rate in December, when it made money. “Things have gone a bit better a bit quicker than I expected,” said Bellew, an Irishman who became MAS CEO last July after joining as chief operating officer in 2015, following nine years at Dublin-based discount specialist Ryanair Holdings Plc. “We’re ahead of where we hoped we would be.” The Asian carrier needs the leased jets mainly to replace single-aisle Boeing 737s on 10 or 11 medium-haul routes that are capable of supporting wide-bodies, including services to India, Bali and Hong Kong, Bellew said. The plan has become attractive after hire rates fell 15% in 3½ months, he said. MAS is also rapidly adding new routes to China, with nine due this year and another eight in 2018, taking the total to 24. The expansion, part of a plan to make Malaysia a top destination for Chinese tourists, reflects a recovery in bookings that collapsed after the disappearance of Flight MH370 while en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. Bellew said he would seek to take half a dozen leased wide-bodies in the first half of next year, followed by the same number in 2019, all about six years old. A330s would be the obvious choice, though 777s would allow the carrier to add longer routes, perhaps reinstating a service to Amsterdam, he said. The 25 or more new jets that Bellew is evaluating would likely be bought direct from Airbus or Boeing and would join the fleet between 2019 and 2023, with 15 replacing older aircraft and the rest for expansion. The re-engined A330neo comes in two sizes advertised at US$255mil and $291 million before discounts, while the 787 Dreamliner has three variants priced between US$225mil and US$306mil. The airline is also poised to take delivery of six Airbus A350 wide-bodies, allowing it to move the same number of A380 superjumbos to a new sister carrier specialising in carrying people on the haj and umrah pilgrimages. With A350 handovers delayed by a shortage of interior fittings at Airbus, the first plane is due a couple of months late in November or December, Bellew said. All should arrive by June 2018, after which the A380s will be refitted to allow their capacity to be varied between 635 and 720 seats, with the airline commencing operations in December of that year. Dubbed Project Hope, the startup has yet to be given a permanent name, though most of its management team will be approved at a board meeting next week, Bellew said, adding that a CEO has yet to be chosen but will almost certainly be a Malaysian. Long-term support deals have been struck with Airbus and engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and that could extend to investment in the venture next year, he said. MAS had a loss last year that was less than half the internal forecast, it said March 1, and aims to reduce the deficit by more than half this year before becoming “consistently profitable” from 2018. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Earnings , Investing , Airlines , Malaysia Airlines , wide body jets , Peter Bellew , China , routes Related Stories Related Stories Malaysia Airlines offers discounts of up to 45% at Matta Fair MAS in recovery mode Creative people who don’t sleep at night - Bellew wants you MAS not cutting fares Malaysia Airlines offers 25% discount for China flights You May Be Interested Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

USD 81 million and a growth in all operational parameters, including an increase of about 11% in passenger segments, a market-share increase to 32.6% and an impressive load-factor of 84%. The 2016 results were affected by the pilots' crisis that reached its peak in the fourth quarter of the year. The main impact was on the operating expense items. We continue preparations for the arrival of the new wide-body 787 Dreamliners, the first of which is expected to arrive at the end of August 2017. Additionally, in 2016 we continued the trend of rejuvenating our narrow-body aircraft fleet, upon completion of the 8 Boeing 737-900 aircraft arrival process. Currently, the average age of the Company's narrow-body airplanes stands at seven years old. At the same time, as per our commitment, we continue the pilot of WIFI services during flights, which will be gradually installed in all Boeing 737-900 aircraft. The Frequent Flyer Club, in Israel and overseas, and in particular the FLYCARD credit card, serve as a significant growth engine, which is translated into an impressive expansion trend. The number of said credit card holders has exceeded all expectations and stands at about 200 thousand since its launch. The number of EL AL's Frequent Flyer Club members also continued to increase, reaching more than 1.76 million members. We shall do all in our power to provide our customers with a quality service, maximum comfort, innovative technology and advanced airplanes, while continuing to successfully cope with market conditions as well as competition. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you and express my highest appreciation for El Al employees, on the ground and in the air, in Israel and worldwide, who work with determination and dedication, allowing us to effectively deal with the challenges facing us. We are committed to ensure the Company's success and prosperity, and determined to restore our customers' security and trust." Dganit Palti, El Al's CFO, stated: "The company enjoyed from lower average fuel prices last year, which resulted in a net savings of $ 95 million in fuel expenses. On the other hand, the company's operating expenses increased significantly due to the 5% increase in flight hours and mainly due to disruptions in flights resulting from a crisis with the pilots. We are working hard improve the Company's operating indices. Despite the damage to the activity this year , the EBITDA amounted to $ 287 million, the Company generated a cash flow from operating activities in excess of $ 240 million, and cash and deposits balances at the end of the period amounted to $ 212 million, attesting to the Company's financial strength. The company's financial position enables us to move forward with confidence in the face of the challenge of the new fleet of aircraft program, which will enable the Company's future development in the coming years." Results for the year Ended on December 31, 2016: 1.      Operating revenues – operating revenues decreased in 2016 by approx. USD 16 million (about 0.8%) compared to 2015. Revenue from passenger flights increased by approx. 0.1% whereas income from cargo flights decreased. Revenue from passengers was affected by two opposing trends – on the one hand, the trend of drop in flight ticket prices continued due to the intensified competition and the impact of the fuel price drop, and on the other hand, a significant increase was recorded in the number of passengers carried by the Company and in passenger revenue per kilometer (RPK) as a result of an increase in operations. Additionally, the Company's passenger revenues were adversely affected by the erosion of exchange rates of currencies in which some of the Company's sales transactions are made, in relation to the dollar. Furthermore, the growth in passenger revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was partially offset by the disruptions in manning the Company's flights due to the pilots' sanctions (which started in October 2015 and continued intermittently throughout 2016). The Company's cargo revenue decreased by approx. 11.4%, primarily due to the drop in yield per ton-kilometer and revenue-ton-kilometer (RTK) flown. 2.      Operating expenses – operating expenses increased in 2016 by approx. USD 50 million (about 3.4%) compared to 2015, after a decline of approx. USD 95 million in jet fuel expenses. The gross increase of approx. USD 145 million mainly resulted from an increase in operations and wages and increase in lease expenses primarily due to disruptions in manning flights, as a result of the pilots' sanctions, and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, mainly wet lease of aircrafts (lease of aircraft and crew), as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses, primarily due to an increase in the number of the Company's aircrafts and change in the residual value of the 777 aircrafts. 3.      Jet Fuel Expenses – the Company's jet fuel expenses, including hedging impact, declined by approx. USD 94.7 million (about 20%) compared to the corresponding expenditure in 2015, as a result of a drop in the price of jet fuel, offset in part by an increase in the amount of jet fuel consumed due to the growth in the scope of the Company's operations. 4.      Selling Expenses –selling expenses decreased in approx. USD 2.3 million (about 1.2%) compared to 2015, primarily due to the drop in distribution expenses. 5.      General and Administrative Expenses - general and administrative expenses recorded a growth of approx. USD 1.6 million (about 1.7%) compared to 2015, mainly due to the an increase in professional services and provisions for legal claims. 6.      Other Revenues (Expenses) – the USD 5.2 million improvement in results is primarily attributed to early retirement plan expenses recognized in 2015, and capital gain for the sale of a 737-700 aircraft, which was recognized during 2016. 7.      Financing Expenses - financing expenses amounted to approx. USD 23.1 million, compared to approx. USD 26.5 million in 2015. This drop is mostly due to a one-time fee payment in 2015 and a decrease in price differences in 2016 compared to 2015. 8.      Taxes on Income – taxes on income totaled approx. USD 12.8 million compared to approx. USD 38.1 million in 2015. This drop is the result of a decrease in profit before taxes on income and the impact of the decrease in the corporate tax on deferred taxes (a benefit of approx. USD 11 million). 9.      Profit for the Period – profit before tax in 2016 totaled approx. USD 93.5 million and profit after tax totaled approx. 80.7 million (constituting about 4.0 % of the turnover), compared to profit before tax of approx. USD 144.6 million in 2015 and profit after tax approx. USD 106.5 million (about 5.2% of the turnover). Results for the Three-Month Period Ended on December 31, 2016: 1.      Operating revenues – decreased by approx. USD 15.5 million (about 3.3%) in the reported period compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year, with a drop of approx. USD 9.9 million (about 2.4%) in passenger revenues and approx. USD 7.0 million in cargo revenues (about 16.9%). The passenger revenue decrease was due to a decline in revenue passenger kilometer (RPK), for the above detailed reasons, as well as the erosion of exchange rates of currencies in which the Company's sales transactions are made, in relation to the dollar. In addition, the drop in passenger revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, was also due to the disruptions in manning the Company's flights. The Company's cargo yield per ton-kilometer and revenue-ton-kilometer (RTK) flown recorded a decrease. 2.      Operating expenses – increased in the reported period by approx. USD 17.2 million (about 4.5%) compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, after a savings of approx. USD 9.6 million in jet fuel expenses. The gross increase of approx. USD 26.8 million was primarily due to disruptions in manning flights, caused by the pilots' sanctions, and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, mainly wet lease of aircrafts by the Company, as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses. 3.      Selling Expenses –decreased by approx. 7.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to the drop in distribution and advertising expenses. 4.      General and Administrative Expenses – increased by approx. 6.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, mainly due to the an increase in professional services and provisions for legal claims. 5.      Financing Expenses - amounted to approx. USD 6.1 million, compared to approx. USD 7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This drop is mostly due to a one-time fee payment that was recognized in 2015 and a decrease in exchange differences. 6.      Taxes on Income – the tax benefit in the reported period totaled approx. USD 10.2 million. Said tax benefit includes revenues, due to a corporate tax rate decrease from 25% to 23% (in the expected period, on the date of reversing timing differences in respect of which deferred taxes were recognized) 7.     Loss for the Period – loss before tax in 2016 totaled approx. USD 12.7 million (loss after tax totaled approx. 2.4 million, constituting about 0.5% of the turnover), compared to profit before tax of approx. USD 16.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 (profit after tax - approx. USD 12.2 million, constituting about 2.6% of the turnover),  Additional Data as of December 31, 2016: 1.      Current Assets - amounted to approx. USD 435.1 million, reflecting a growth of approx. USD 40.8 million compared to December 31, 2015. This growth resulted mostly from an increase in cash balances compared to the cash balances at the end of 2015, which was partially offset by a decrease in the Short Term Deposits item and the improvement in the fair value of jet fuel derivatives. 2.      Current Liabilities - amounted to approx. USD 800.1 million, reflecting a drop of approx. USD 37.9 million compared to December 31, 2015. This drop is primarily due to the improvement in the fair value of jet fuel derivatives and a drop in current maturities of long-term loans, which were partially offset by an increase in the Revenues item from pre-sale of airline tickets, as a result of a rise in airline ticket sales (not yet realized) in the last quarter of 2016 compared to the last quarter of 2015. 3.      Working Capital – the Company has a working capital deficit of approx. USD 365.1 million compared to a deficit of approx. USD 443.7 dollar as of December 31, 2015. It shall be noted that a substantial part of the working capital deficit does not reflect short-term cash flows, and consists of two substantial components which are included in the Company's Current Liabilities items and are characterized by current business cycle; however, the Company is not required to use cash-flow sources in the short term in order to repay these components: prepaid revenue from the sale of airline tickets and from the Frequent Flyer Club, to be settled by providing future flight services, and liabilities to employees for vacation, which are expected to be paid over several years but classified as a short-term liability in accordance with accounting principles. Moreover, loans in an aggregate amount of approx. USD 78 million, whose original maturity date is in April and July 2017 and are therefore presented as short-term liabilities, were spread, after the date of the Statement of Financial Condition, over a period of 4 years, and thus will be classified, starting from the quarter of 2017, as  non-current liabilities. 4.      Non-Current Assets – amounted to approx. USD 1,281.9 million, showing a growth of approx. USD 12.0 million compared to their balance as of December 31, 2015, mainly as a result of the continued investment in the 787 Boeing aircraft acquisition program and the receipt of three 737-900 aircrafts during 2016, less current depreciation. 5.      Non-Current Liabilities - totaled approx. USD 632.8 million, similar to their balance as of December 31, 2015. Liabilities were affected by a decrease in loan balances, which was offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities due to profit before tax for the year, offset by the impact of the decrease in corporate tax. 6.      Total Equity – amounted to approx. USD 284.1 million. The growth of approx. USD 86.1 million compared to equity as of December 31, 2015, mainly resulted from the profit for the period, which was partially offset by a USD 33.4 million dividend, announced and paid during the period, as well as by the impact of the Company's hedging instruments on the equity funds, in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 48.0 million (increase), offset by actuarial losses in respect of employee benefits on the equity funds, which affected the equity funds in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 9.6 million.

ground and flight testing of USAF's KC-46A tanker Boeing has conducted ground and flight testing of the KC-46A Pegasus multirole tanker at Travis Air Force Base (AFB) in California. The testing was carried out by a group of 48 test and evaluation engineers at Boeing and four US Air Force (USAF) personnel from the Detachment 1, 418th Flight Test Squadron (FLTS). 418th FLTS KC-46 test operations engineer Captain Dylan Neidorff said: “The KC-46A is at Travis AFB to conduct military and Federal Aviation Administration certification testing. “We decided to come to Travis since the base is right in the temperature band required for the testing.” The Travis AFB, along with Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, was selected as preferred location in January this year for the active-duty-led base for the service’s aerial-refuelling aircraft. The 60th Operations Support Squadron ensured the KC-46 had fuel availability, a parking space and required maintenance supplies. The airfield management and air traffic control professionals along with members of the 60th Maintenance Group provided the tanker team with required supplies. The 60th Logistics Readiness Squadron was responsible for ensuring that the KC-46 had the current fuels. Boeing Test and Evaluation test director Paul Briedé said: “Because of this type of testing, we needed to offload all of our fuel. "Travis has underground tanks, which makes it infinitely easier. "The airfield management and air traffic control professionals along with members of the 60th Maintenance Group provided the tanker team with required supplies." “At another base we would’ve needed at least four other fuel trucks.” The first KC-46As are expected to begin arriving at McConnell AFB, Kansas, and Altus AFB, Oklahoma, later this year. Boeing has designed the KC-46 to be able to detect, avoid, defeat and survive threats using multiple layers of protection. Image: A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus arrives at Travis Air Force Base.

Latest news headlines from Zimbabwe Situation Skip to content Home Latest TEXT ONLY Sources Lists Archives About “Zimbabwe Situation” Friends Support us Advertise AirZim deal collapses By ZimSitRep_M | March 23, 2017 6 Comments Source: AirZim deal collapses | The Financial Gazette March 23, 2017 By Shame Makoshori, Senior Business Reporter PLANS by the country’s beleaguered airline, Air Zimbabwe (AirZim), to lease modern passenger aircraft from Malaysia Airlines have hit a brick wall after the two parties could not agree on terms underpinning the multi-million dollar deal, the Financial Gazette can exclusively report. Zimbabwe had made giant strides in negotiating the acquisition of Boeing 787 Dreamliners from Malaysia Airlines to turn around the fortunes of the troubled AirZim, which is wallowing in debt estimated at about US$300 million. The two parties had opened discussions on the deal after President Robert Mugabe had led a delegation to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, last year to scout for opportunities for the landlocked southern African country. His delegation comprised Transport and Infrastructure Development Minister Joram Gumbo and aviation experts from AirZim who used the visit to the south-east Asian country to engage Malaysia Airlines with a view to either acquire or lease long-haul planes while parallel efforts back home focussed on identifying routes that would help the national flag carrier return to the black. Government had shown interest in the Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are basically long-haul, mid-size wide body, twin engine jet airliner manufactured by the United States’ Boeing Commercial Airplanes. AirZim board chairperson, Chipo Dyanda, could not be drawn into commenting on the latest development saying: “This is a shareholder matter. I refer you to the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development.” Gumbo confirmed this week that the discussions with Malaysia Airlines had fallen through and that AirZim had since shifted its focus elsewhere. “I am still talking with potential airlines and we may agree soon,” said Gumbo. “At the moment I do not want to say who they are. We were talking to 11 airlines in Singapore, in Ethiopia and other countries and there was nothing special about Malaysia. I only mentioned Malaysia (last year) because I went there to see planes that they were not using but we could not agree on certain issues,” he added. A new and efficient fleet would be crucial in AirZim’s struggle to return to profitability after meddling by government and years of mismanagement pushed the airline into its current crisis. It has been operating old aircraft that have been guzzling fuel and piling up expenses. AirZim has battled to compete for market share with regional competitors such as South African Airways, among others, which have invested in modern aircraft to save costs and attract the industry’s demanding clientele. Sources said AirZim was making progress on acquiring at least four Boeing 777s (B777s) aircraft from an undisclosed supplier. It also emerged that the AirZim board was exploring the possibility of establishing a new company to house the new fleet and start on a clean slate. Although this idea has not been officially communicated to government, the new airline could be called Zimbabwe Airways and would have the four aeroplanes as its first major assets. AirZim’s debt burden is one of the impediments to its ability to acquire new planes, as well as reaching agreement with a technical partner to steer the parastatal out of the woods. A new company is therefore seen as the most viable alternative to circumvent the problem, and even insulate the new planes from seizure by creditors. It was not immediately clear if the deal involves an outright acquisition or a lease, although indications are that AirZim would take delivery of the first batch of the B777s planes in the coming few months. If the national flag carrier is to acquire the planes, it could spend almost US$1 billion. The lowest priced model of the 777 family, the Boeing 777-200ER, costs US$261,5 million, while the Boeing 777-300ER goes for US$320,2 million. This, apparently, is costly for AirZim, whose shareholder, government, is broke and has spent the past year battling to pay its bloated civil service. It therefore does not have the financial wherewithal to fund the acquisition. The latest information appears to suggest that the AirZim board has ignored recommendations from consultants that it acquires two Dreamliner B787s and Brazilian assembled Embrear jetliners. The Embraer was briefly operated by AirZim on domestic and regional flights under a lease agreement three years ago. A report by audit consultants, EY, on the airline’s operations three years ago had recommended that AirZim should acquire or lease two B787 jetliners, which are smaller than the B777s. This was in addition to AirZim’s existing fleet. A feasibility assessment committee report came up with similar recommendations, according to sources familiar with the discussions. The committee had recommended that the airline procures a fleet of the Brazilian assembled 60-seater Embraer jetliners for domestic and short regional routes to significantly reduce costs on domestic routes, where AirZim has been operating the B737s, or even the much bigger B767s. There have been reports that AirZim has been flying with as low as three passengers on the Johannesburg-Harare route. The 150-seater Airbus A320 has also been flying on domestic and regional routes. AirZim is currently leasing two Airbus planes, one of which has been grounded ever since its delivery to the parastatal. Currently, AirZim has been grappling with declining load factors, and chief executive officer, Ripton Muzenda, has ordered that flights on the Harare-Kariba-Victoria Falls route should immediately be discontinued. A Chinese made MA60 plane, which is fuel efficient aircraft but costly to maintain, had been servicing the route. Passenger numbers have plummeted to about 230 000 per annum in the past few years, from a peak of one million in 1996, as travellers opt for other airlines on the four domestic destinations it services. The airline, currently flying into South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania, has been planning to re-launch the cash-spinning Harare-London flights, but airline executives have warned that without modern jetliners, it would be a waste of time because it would most certainly face stiff competition. AirZim’s aged fleet comprises of two Boeing 767s, three B737s, three MA60s and two Airbus A320s. Out of these planes, only four are flying – one airbus, one Boeing 767, one 737 and an MA60. Only two were in operation last week. The airline came close to liquidation when it stopped flights in 2011 before its sole shareholder took the decision to resume operation in November 2012. AirZim was also struggling due to a debt overhang; outstanding salaries/wages; collapsed administration systems; bloated staff complement; top-heavy management and limited route network consisting of local and two regional flights, namely South Africa and Tanzania that would inevitably affect its revenue. The Dyanda-led board has addressed the top-heavy management by putting in place a lean structure. Currently, a staff audit and restructuring exercise is underway to ensure the right people are in the right places and the airline carries a wage and salary bill it can afford and for the right kind of skills, knowledge and technical expertise. “We have also restructured the executive to ensure efficiency and reliability and to also upgrade and modernise systems that had collapsed and were outdated. Two new posts of chief operating officer and an executive manager (systems and administration) were created to achieve efficiency, reliability and modernisation of airline systems. We have also appointed an executive with the right technical skills, commitment and vision that the airline can be revived, can be viable and profitable to enable it to significantly contribute to national development by complementing road and rail transportation,” said Dyanda. “Above all, we are crafting a new three-year strategic plan with a different operational and business model so that we redirect the company to become a competitive airline in the next three years. In addition, these proposed changes are being done in a holistic, forward-looking and visionary manner to give the airline a new robust foundation for growth and development. In crafting this strategic plan, we have engaged our stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations from the airline, re-engaged the shareholder on the airline mandate as the national carrier and re-engineered the business model and systems. “As for the payment of retrenched workers’ packages, they are being paid monthly to the capacity of the airline. As a board, we are cognisant of their struggle to fend for their families, but we are limited by the funds available from a limited route network and the need to balance their needs with the operational requirements of the company. Some of them, with the right skills and expertise, may be re-absorbed in the company through the restructuring process currently underway. In addition, as the airline begins to have a good footing, more manpower may be required and more will be absorbed. The business model being proposed has the capacity to grow the business, but in some cases human resources will need upgrading to cope with the new demands.” Regarding EY’s recommendations, Dyanda said these were being considered as part of the 2017-2020 strategic plan. “Some recommendations from this report will be integrated with other strategies that have since come on board due to the developments in airline management, viability and profitability,” she said. Dyanda said no single solution was the magic wand for the revival of the airline, adding that money was not the only solution to the problems besetting the airline. “There are several strategies that are being put in place among them searching for a strategic partner by the shareholder, upgrading employee skills, knowledge and attitudes, changing the culture of the organisation, modernisation of the airline systems, rebranding to change the negative perceptions the airline has earned over the years and energising commitment and the vision of those running the organisation,” she said. The planned acquisition of B777 planes has already sparked heated debate within the airline, with questions being raised over the rationale behind purchasing long haul airliners during at a time when debts in London have meant that the national flag carrier cannot operate on this most lucrative route, for instance. “The bigger and the more the planes, the more cash those behind the acquisitions would get…. This has nothing to do with AirZim’s requirements. It only needs two big 787s. But four planes will give them more kickbacks. They want to make money out of aircraft acquisitions,” said a source.

(Leroy Burnell / The Post and Courier) Aerospace blog Future of Boeing’s 787 seems secure, but maybe not in Everett Dan Catchpole Thu Mar 23rd, 2017 3:02pm BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Weak orders for the Boeing Co.’s sleek 787 Dreamliner have some analysts considering a day when the advanced jetliner is put together only in South Carolina. For now, several thousand workers in Everett and North Charleston, South Carolina, assemble 12 of the twin-aisle airplane each month. Boeing executives say they want to make more, not fewer, Dreamliners. The company expects to decide this year about increasing the production rate to 14 airplanes a month, Boeing’s chief financial officer Greg Smith told industry analysts at the Barclays Industrial Select Conference in February. “Today, that looks good, but we’re monitoring it.” After years of losing money, the program in late 2015 started bringing in cash. The company continues to whittle down the cost of making the high-tech airliner. Also, it is making more of the higher-priced 787-9 and 787-10 models, and fewer of the smallest version, the 787-8. Boosting 787 production is critical to Boeing’s bottom line. The aerospace giant is cutting back production on its biggest moneymaker — the 777. A steep drop in new airplane orders — which means fewer down payments from customers — and other market pressures also are weighing down the company’s balance sheet. At the same time, company leaders have promised to boost profit to around 15 percent of operational revenue and increase cash payouts for shareholders. Orders for big jetliners are down at the moment, but they will rebound after 2020, when airlines are expected to retire a wave of older widebody jets, Smith said. The vast majority of the 1,207 orders placed for 787s through February came before the airplane left the factory. Boeing gained 910 net orders from 2004 through 2008 and 297 orders in the years since. Production delays and other problems drove down demand for the fuel efficient airplane. With production running smoothly and the airplanes performing well in service around the world, orders have picked up. “Demand for the 787 remains solid,” Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said. “But we have more work to do. Securing additional orders to solidify our end-of-decade 14 per month production rate plan remains a priority.” So far this year, Boeing has landed orders for seven Dreamliners. Some analysts say that there is not enough demand right now for the 787 to sustain Boeing’s high production rate goals. Most analysts expect the company to keep turning out 12 a month rather than boost production. A few say Boeing will have to cut Dreamliner output. Weak demand will force Boeing by 2019 to drop 787 production from 12 airplanes a month to seven a month “to consolidate on one production line — likely (North) Charleston,” said Richard Safran, an investment analyst with Buckingham Research Group, in a report published in February. In October, UBS investment analyst David Strauss said he expects Boeing to cut 787 production to eight airplanes a month. “It’s cheaper to produce 787s in South Carolina,” said Scott Hamilton, an industry analyst based on Bainbridge Island. The cost of labor and regulatory compliance are significantly less there, he said. Boeing’s South Carolina workforce stumbled when production began there. The company regularly ferried unfinished 787s to Everett for rework and completion. Those days are gone. Both 787 assembly lines are close to moving at similar rates. The South Carolina workforce likely will have caught up with Everett workers in terms of quality by 2020, Hamilton said. Also, Boeing South Carolina makes all three Dreamliners — the 787-8, 787-9 and 787-10. Everett only makes the 787-8 and the -9. Boeing has few orders remaining for the 787-8 and is not pushing airlines to order more of the smallest — and least profitable — Dreamliner model. Boeing’s decision to open a second assembly line outside Washington was a bitter blow for many people in the state, including Rep. Jeff Morris. The Mount Vernon Democrat helped put together a tax break package in 2003 to convince Boeing to build the 787 Dreamliner around Puget Sound. “When Boeing approached the state, the context was it was a winner-take-all contest to get the work,” Morris said. Then, in 2009, Boeing announced it was opening the North Charleston final assembly line. Morris does not want to see all 787 production shift to South Carolina, but, he said, it would not cripple Washington’s economy. “We used to be much more dependent on aerospace and agriculture,” he said. Now, Amazon, Microsoft and other tech firms have helped create a broader base for the state’s economy.

Business Home LBoard PKR: Hadi’s ‘biawak’ analogy improper for religious leader Khairil Ashraf Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Surge in demand sees Malaysia Airlines expanding fleet Bloomberg | March 23, 2017 CEO Peter Bellew says company will lease aircraft as improvements at national carrier have been accomplished sooner than expected. KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airlines Bhd plans to seal deals for as many as 42 wide-body jets over the next few months as the unprofitable carrier seeks to rebuild its long-haul network following a surge in demand. Terms should be agreed in the next six to eight weeks for the lease of up to a dozen used Airbus A330 or Boeing 777 aircraft, chief executive officer Peter Bellew said in an interview. That could be followed later in the first half by an order for 25 to 30 new Boeing 787s or A330neos, as the upgraded Airbus model is known, potentially worth more than US$7 billion (about RM31 billion). Bellew is looking to expand wide-body operations after Malaysia Airlines slashed its fleet and route network in response to a bookings slump that followed two fatal plane crashes in 2014. Sales have now recovered to the extent that the carrier posted an 81% load factor in the fourth quarter of 2016, including a 90% occupancy rate in December, when it made money. “Things have gone a bit better a bit quicker than I expected,” said Bellew, an Irishman who became Malaysia Airlines CEO last July after joining as chief operating officer in 2015, following nine years at Dublin-based discount specialist Ryanair Holdings Plc. “We’re ahead of where we hoped we would be.” The Asian carrier needs the leased jets mainly to replace single-aisle Boeing 737s on 10 or 11 medium-haul routes that are capable of supporting wide-bodies, including services to India, Bali and Hong Kong, Bellew said. The plan has become attractive after hire rates fell 15% in three-and-a-half months, he said. China growth Malaysian Airlines is also rapidly adding new routes to China, with nine due this year and another eight in 2018, taking the total to 24. The expansion, part of a plan to make Malaysia a top destination for Chinese tourists, reflects a recovery in bookings that collapsed after the disappearance of Flight MH370 while en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, with most of the passengers onboard being Chinese nationals. Bellew said he’ll seek to take six leased wide-bodies in the first half of next year, followed by the same number in 2019, all about six years old. He added that A330s would be the obvious choice, though 777s would allow the carrier to add longer routes, perhaps reinstating a service to Amsterdam. The 25 or more new jets that Bellew is evaluating would likely be bought direct from Airbus or Boeing and would join the fleet between 2019 and 2023, with 15 replacing older aircraft and the rest for expansion. The re-engined A330neo comes in two sizes advertised at US$255 million and US$291 million before discounts, while the 787 Dreamliner has three variants priced between US$225 million and US$306 million. The airline is also poised to take delivery of six Airbus A350 wide-bodies, allowing it to move the same number of A380 superjumbos to a new sister carrier specialising in carrying people on the haj and umrah pilgrimages. 720 seats With A350 handovers delayed by a shortage of interior fittings at Airbus, the first plane is due a couple of months late in November or December, Bellew said. All should arrive by June 2018, after which the A380s will be refitted to allow their capacity to be varied between 635 and 720 seats, with the airline commencing operations in December of that year. Dubbed Project Hope, the startup has yet to be given a permanent name, though most of its management team will be approved at a board meeting next week, Bellew said, adding that a CEO has yet to be chosen but will almost certainly be a Malaysian national. Long-term support deals have been struck with Airbus and engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and that could extend to investment in the venture next year, he said. The airline had a loss last year that was less than half the internal forecast, it said March 1, and aims to reduce the deficit by more than half this year before becoming “consistently profitable” from 2018.

Zimbabwe had made giant strides in negotiating the acquisition of Boeing 787 Dreamliners from Malaysia Airlines to turn around the fortunes of the troubled AirZim, which is wallowing in debt estimated at about US$300 million. The two parties had opened discussions on the deal after President Robert Mugabe had led a delegation to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, last year to scout for opportunities for the landlocked southern African country. His delegation comprised Transport and Infrastructure Development Minister Joram Gumbo and aviation experts from AirZim who used the visit to the south-east Asian country to engage Malaysia Airlines with a view to either acquire or lease long-haul planes while parallel efforts back home focussed on identifying routes that would help the national flag carrier return to the black. Government had shown interest in the Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are basically long-haul, mid-size wide body, twin engine jet airliner manufactured by the United States’ Boeing Commercial Airplanes. AirZim board chairperson, Chipo Dyanda, could not be drawn into commenting on the latest development saying: “This is a shareholder matter. I refer you to the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development.” Gumbo confirmed this week that the discussions with Malaysia Airlines had fallen through and that AirZim had since shifted its focus elsewhere. “I am still talking with potential airlines and we may agree soon,” said Gumbo. “At the moment I do not want to say who they are. We were talking to 11 airlines in Singapore, in Ethiopia and other countries and there was nothing special about Malaysia. I only mentioned Malaysia (last year) because I went there to see planes that they were not using but we could not agree on certain issues,” he added. A new and efficient fleet would be crucial in AirZim’s struggle to return to profitability after meddling by government and years of mismanagement pushed the airline into its current crisis. It has been operating old aircraft that have been guzzling fuel and piling up expenses. AirZim has battled to compete for market share with regional competitors such as South African Airways, among others, which have invested in modern aircraft to save costs and attract the industry’s demanding clientele. Sources said AirZim was making progress on acquiring at least four Boeing 777s (B777s) aircraft from an undisclosed supplier. It also emerged that the AirZim board was exploring the possibility of establishing a new company to house the new fleet and start on a clean slate. Although this idea has not been officially communicated to government, the new airline could be called Zimbabwe Airways and would have the four aeroplanes as its first major assets. AirZim’s debt burden is one of the impediments to its ability to acquire new planes, as well as reaching agreement with a technical partner to steer the parastatal out of the woods. A new company is therefore seen as the most viable alternative to circumvent the problem, and even insulate the new planes from seizure by creditors. It was not immediately clear if the deal involves an outright acquisition or a lease, although indications are that AirZim would take delivery of the first batch of the B777s planes in the coming few months. If the national flag carrier is to acquire the planes, it could spend almost US$1 billion. The lowest priced model of the 777 family, the Boeing 777-200ER, costs US$261,5 million, while the Boeing 777-300ER goes for US$320,2 million. This, apparently, is costly for AirZim, whose shareholder, government, is broke and has spent the past year battling to pay its bloated civil service. It therefore does not have the financial wherewithal to fund the acquisition. The latest information appears to suggest that the AirZim board has ignored recommendations from consultants that it acquires two Dreamliner B787s and Brazilian assembled Embrear jetliners. The Embraer was briefly operated by AirZim on domestic and regional flights under a lease agreement three years ago. A report by audit consultants, EY, on the airline’s operations three years ago had recommended that AirZim should acquire or lease two B787 jetliners, which are smaller than the B777s. This was in addition to AirZim’s existing fleet. A feasibility assessment committee report came up with similar recommendations, according to sources familiar with the discussions. The committee had recommended that the airline procures a fleet of the Brazilian assembled 60-seater Embraer jetliners for domestic and short regional routes to significantly reduce costs on domestic routes, where AirZim has been operating the B737s, or even the much bigger B767s. There have been reports that AirZim has been flying with as low as three passengers on the Johannesburg-Harare route. The 150-seater Airbus A320 has also been flying on domestic and regional routes. AirZim is currently leasing two Airbus planes, one of which has been grounded ever since its delivery to the parastatal. Currently, AirZim has been grappling with declining load factors, and chief executive officer, Ripton Muzenda, has ordered that flights on the Harare-Kariba-Victoria Falls route should immediately be discontinued. A Chinese made MA60 plane, which is fuel efficient aircraft but costly to maintain, had been servicing the route. Passenger numbers have plummeted to about 230 000 per annum in the past few years, from a peak of one million in 1996, as travellers opt for other airlines on the four domestic destinations it services. The airline, currently flying into South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania, has been planning to re-launch the cash-spinning Harare-London flights, but airline executives have warned that without modern jetliners, it would be a waste of time because it would most certainly face stiff competition. AirZim’s aged fleet comprises of two Boeing 767s, three B737s, three MA60s and two Airbus A320s. Out of these planes, only four are flying – one airbus, one Boeing 767, one 737 and an MA60. Only two were in operation last week. The airline came close to liquidation when it stopped flights in 2011 before its sole shareholder took the decision to resume operation in November 2012. AirZim was also struggling due to a debt overhang; outstanding salaries/wages; collapsed administration systems; bloated staff complement; top-heavy management and limited route network consisting of local and two regional flights, namely South Africa and Tanzania that would inevitably affect its revenue. The Dyanda-led board has addressed the top-heavy management by putting in place a lean structure. Currently, a staff audit and restructuring exercise is underway to ensure the right people are in the right places and the airline carries a wage and salary bill it can afford and for the right kind of skills, knowledge and technical expertise. “We have also restructured the executive to ensure efficiency and reliability and to also upgrade and modernise systems that had collapsed and were outdated. Two new posts of chief operating officer and an executive manager (systems and administration) were created to achieve efficiency, reliability and modernisation of airline systems. We have also appointed an executive with the right technical skills, commitment and vision that the airline can be revived, can be viable and profitable to enable it to significantly contribute to national development by complementing road and rail transportation,” said Dyanda. “Above all, we are crafting a new three-year strategic plan with a different operational and business model so that we redirect the company to become a competitive airline in the next three years. In addition, these proposed changes are being done in a holistic, forward-looking and visionary manner to give the airline a new robust foundation for growth and development. In crafting this strategic plan, we have engaged our stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations from the airline, re-engaged the shareholder on the airline mandate as the national carrier and re-engineered the business model and systems. “As for the payment of retrenched workers’ packages, they are being paid monthly to the capacity of the airline. As a board, we are cognisant of their struggle to fend for their families, but we are limited by the funds available from a limited route network and the need to balance their needs with the operational requirements of the company. Some of them, with the right skills and expertise, may be re-absorbed in the company through the restructuring process currently underway. In addition, as the airline begins to have a good footing, more manpower may be required and more will be absorbed. The business model being proposed has the capacity to grow the business, but in some cases human resources will need upgrading to cope with the new demands.” Regarding EY’s recommendations, Dyanda said these were being considered as part of the 2017-2020 strategic plan. “Some recommendations from this report will be integrated with other strategies that have since come on board due to the developments in airline management, viability and profitability,” she said. Dyanda said no single solution was the magic wand for the revival of the airline, adding that money was not the only solution to the problems besetting the airline. “There are several strategies that are being put in place among them searching for a strategic partner by the shareholder, upgrading employee skills, knowledge and attitudes, changing the culture of the organisation, modernisation of the airline systems, rebranding to change the negative perceptions the airline has earned over the years and energising commitment and the vision of those running the organisation,” she said. The planned acquisition of B777 planes has already sparked heated debate within the airline, with questions being raised over the rationale behind purchasing long haul airliners during at a time when debts in London have meant that the national flag carrier cannot operate on this most lucrative route, for instance. “The bigger and the more the planes, the more cash those behind the acquisitions would get…. This has nothing to do with AirZim’s requirements. It only needs two big 787s. But four planes will give them more kickbacks. They want to make money out of aircraft acquisitions,” said a source. newsdesk@fingaz.co.zw Like to share?

Terms should be agreed in the next six to eight weeks for the lease of up to a dozen used Airbus Group SE A330 or Boeing Co 777 aircraft, Chief Executive Officer Peter Bellew said in an interview. That could be followed later in the first half by an order for 25 to 30 new Boeing 787s or A330neos, as the upgraded Airbus model is known, potentially worth more than US$7 billion (RM31 billion). Bellew is looking to expand wide-body operations after Malaysia Air slashed its fleet and route network in response to a bookings slump that followed two fatal plane crashes in 2014. Sales have now recovered to the extent that the carrier posted an 81 per cent load factor in the fourth quarter of 2016, including a 90 per cent occupancy rate in December, when it made money. “Things have gone a bit better a bit quicker than I expected,” said Bellew, an Irishman who became Malaysia Air CEO last July after joining as chief operating officer in 2015, following nine years at Dublin-based discount specialist Ryanair Holdings Plc. “We’re ahead of where we hoped we would be.” The Asian carrier needs the leased jets mainly to replace single-aisle Boeing 737s on 10 or 11 medium-haul routes that are capable of supporting wide-bodies, including services to India, Bali and Hong Kong, Bellew said. The plan has become attractive after hire rates fell 15 per cent in 3 1/2 months, he said. China growth Malaysia Airlines is also rapidly adding new routes to China, with nine due this year and another eight in 2018, taking the total to 24. The expansion, part of a plan to make Malaysia a top destination for Chinese tourists, reflects a recovery in bookings that collapsed after the disappearance of Flight MH370 while en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. Bellew said he’ll seek to take half a dozen leased wide-bodies in the first half of next year, followed by the same number in 2019, all about six years old. A330s would be the obvious choice, though 777s would allow the carrier to add longer routes, perhaps reinstating a service to Amsterdam, he said. The 25 or more new jets that Bellew is evaluating would likely be bought direct from Airbus or Boeing and would join the fleet between 2019 and 2023, with 15 replacing older aircraft and the rest for expansion. The re-engined A330neo comes in two sizes advertised at US$255 million and US$291 million before discounts, while the 787 Dreamliner has three variants priced between US$225 million and US$306 million. The airline is also poised to take delivery of six Airbus A350 wide-bodies, allowing it to move the same number of A380 superjumbos to a new sister carrier specialising in carrying people on the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. 720 seats With A350 handovers delayed by a shortage of interior fittings at Airbus, the first plane is due a couple of months late in November or December, Bellew said. All should arrive by June 2018, after which the A380s will be refitted to allow their capacity to be varied between 635 and 720 seats, with the airline commencing operations in December of that year. Dubbed Project Hope, the startup has yet to be given a permanent name, though most of its management team will be approved at a board meeting next week, Bellew said, adding that a CEO has yet to be chosen but will almost certainly be a Malaysian national. Long-term support deals have been struck with Airbus and engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and that could extend to investment in the venture next year, he said. Malaysia Air had a loss last year that was less than half the internal forecast, it said March 1, and aims to reduce the deficit by more than half this year before becoming “consistently profitable” from 2018. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week China slinging salmon on the Internet lures Norway seafood fund Oil producers call to roll over output cuts beyond June American Air in negotiations to purchase stake in China Southern Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Jack Ma: DFTZ will be a Malaysian-run business China capital controls leave buyers of foreign property in bind (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Malaysia Airlines in talks to rent out A380s for pilgrim flights MAB shows steady progress on turnaround plan Bellew Malaysia Airlines CEO tomorrow Malaysia Airlines Bhd’s revenue per ASK up 10pc on route optimisation MAB CEO chooses subtle moves over ‘big bang’ change to boost staff morale Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

So Brig. Gen. Russell Muncy took advantage of the opportunity Thursday afternoon. The March Air Reserve Base commander met Daytona 500 winner Kurt Busch on the airfield's tarmac and suggested a little mano-a-mano matchup between Busch's race car and one of the C-17s Muncy oversees at the base. With the nose of the military cargo plane looming above them, Busch laughed at the suggestion. "I told him, 'I can get you from zero to the mile,'" Busch later said. "'After a mile, it's all you bud.'" Busch who will take to the track in Fontana for the Auto Club 400 on Sunday, was touring the March base, getting a look at the planes that make its missions possible. A longtime friend of the driver's is the brother of Boeing engineer Tim Farmer. Farmer is based at the company's Huntington Beach facility, but Boeing, which built the C-17, has an office on the base. Farmer asked base officials if they would host Busch. "I always want to come out and take the opportunity to say thanks," Busch said of the military. "My passion for the military came from visits to Walter Reed and Bethesda (military hospitals). It was an eye-opening experience." Maj. Charles Conder, a C-17 pilot, took Busch on a walk-around of the plane, pointing out some of its features. Busch asked about take-off specifications and was surprised to learn the massive plane can take off in as little as 1,500 feet when it's not loaded. "My little plane needs 4,000 feet," Busch said. He was given the chance to walk through the expansive fuselage and to sit in the pilot's seat, where Conder gave him a demonstration of its features. "You're blown away by the sheer size," Busch said, after exiting the plane, "just the engineering." Conder, a racing enthusiast, was impressed as well. "It's a huge honor," he said, of meeting the NASCAR champ, "to have known him for a huge number of years and rooting for him along the way." The crew of the plane presented Busch with a 452nd Air Mobility Wing patch. The driver suggested he might place it on the dash of his car on Sunday, if it's one of those fitted with cameras. Busch also was given the opportunity to pilot the base's C-17 simulator, a motion-enhanced actuator that is realistic enough that Air Force pilots can use it to satisfy their training hour requirements. NASCAR drivers, including Busch, use simulators in their own training. Prior to entering the C-17 unit, Busch said the car simulators were about 90 percent realistic. He downgraded that somewhat after his half hour in the flight simulator. 1 2 Next Page Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off More from Military Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day celebrated with ride, patriotic ceremony 250 warriors at Camp Pendleton push through pain for paralympic Marine Corps Trials Here's how Riverside's Jamil Dada ended up on Air Force panel COMMENTS | PRINT | EMAIL |    Join the conversation Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our User Agreement We invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.

U.S. automakers and other manufacturers that rely on imported components also would be affected by the proposals, which would tax imports at a 20 percent rate, and could split these sectors into winners and losers. The revamp would heighten existing tensions in the aerospace industry, where Boeing's aggressive cost-cutting driven by fierce competition with European rival Airbus has pushed suppliers to lower prices and source more parts and materials abroad. Aerospace components often zigzag through multiple countries and companies before reaching Boeing's factories in Washington and South Carolina. U.S.-based suppliers to Boeing would face a tax on their imports of these parts. Boeing, the top exporter among U.S. manufacturers, would export its jetliners tax free. Boeing and some of its largest suppliers, such as United Technologies Corp, General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc, which also have substantial exports, favor the Republican tax package. The plans, laid out in a blueprint last year and which President Donald Trump has spoken about favorably, aim to boost U.S. manufacturing, and include cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and making capital investments immediately deductible. Lawmakers already are at work drafting a tax bill to introduce by early summer, but it could be delayed if health care changes take longer than expected, according to congressional staff. SUPPLIERS CONCERNED If the proposed 20 percent tax on imported goods had been in effect last year, Norfil Complex Machining, a 40-employee company in Pacific, Washington, likely would have paid more for titanium it imports from Russia. The metal goes into parts Norfil makes for Boeing landing gear that get assembled in Japan. "A lot of Russian titanium goes into planes," said Doren Spinner, Norfil's CEO. His purchase contracts have pricing that adjusts if costs go up, so the tax "would end up affecting what the plane would cost," he says. Other companies said it would be tough to pass higher costs on, and some might move production to low-cost locations abroad. "If the taxes are ridiculous, we'd just have to think of something creative," said Paul Doran, a sales manager at Mifa, a subsidiary of Netherlands-based Aalberts Industries NV that makes precision aluminum parts for aerospace, autos and other industries. "I think most companies would be in the same boat." Colin Frost, chief operating officer at parts and tooling supplier Carr Lane Manufacturing Co in St. Louis, Missouri, said he would consider manufacturing overseas if the tax plan were passed. "We'd end up splitting up the company and I don't think that's necessarily good for the U.S. economy," he said. Boeing said it was too soon to judge the plan's effects on suppliers and so far it appeared likely to benefit the industry as a whole rather than disrupt the supply chain. "These assessments will vary by company, and it's premature to speculate or generalize," Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said. OUTSOURCING CONUNDRUM Boeing was among about 90 companies, including many suppliers, that signed a letter this month from the Aerospace Industries Association urging Congress to overhaul the U.S. tax system. Boeing also is part of the American Made Coalition, an industry group that backs Republican tax proposals. Proponents say tax reform also would strengthen the dollar, offsetting the impact of the import tax for suppliers, and would encourage companies to invest in the United States. The tax overhaul could have cut Boeing's taxable income by an estimated $44.5 billion last year, according to tax experts and a Reuters analysis of Boeing's 2016 deliveries. Two-thirds of Boeing's jetliners were delivered overseas and would be tax exempt. Worth about $89 billion at list prices, they were likely sold at discounts of about 50 percent typical in the industry. Boeing declined to comment on the estimate. Boeing would face import taxes, too. Its 787 Dreamliner, for example, uses major parts from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and Italy's Leonardo SpA . Boeing also would still pay tax on sales to U.S. airlines and the new tax regime would affect its defense and space businesses, which source and sell globally. Yet suppliers say Boeing's vigorous cost-saving has pressed many to outsource production to low-cost countries, which now exposes them to a potential border tax. U.S. aerospace imports have doubled the past decade, with Mexico the fastest-growing source, up 950 percent since 2006. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2n4A8o1) Supply chains would face renewed pressure under the new tax regime, said David Wireman, managing director and co-head of aerospace and defense at consulting firm AlixPartners. "The tax on imports proposed by the new administration would certainly affect the complex decisions on choosing suppliers, and likely would cause manufacturers to change some supplier relationships."

Alaska Airlines will be retiring the Virgin America brand and logo by the end of 2019. (Alaska Air Photo) It all comes down to cost and consistency of branding: That’s why Alaska Airlines announced today that it would retire the Virgin America name for the airline it acquired last year. Seattle-based Alaska Air Group completed the $4 billion transaction (including debt and lease payments) to take over Virgin America’s operation and its routes late last year – but the question of what to do with the operation’s name had been hanging over the acquisition since it was announced last April. “We spent the last 10 months conducting extensive research and listening carefully to what fliers on the West Coast want most,” Sangita Woerner, Alaska Airlines’ vice president of marketing, said in today’s announcement. “While the Virgin America name is beloved to many, we concluded that to be successful on the West Coast we had to do so under one name – for consistency and efficiency, and to allow us to continue to deliver low fares.” Alaska said the Virgin America name and logo would be retired “likely sometime in 2019.” Alaska has to wait at least long enough to win certification from the Federal Aviation Administration for the two airlines to operate as a single carrier. Even before the acquisition, Virgin America had an arms-length relationship with British-based Virgin Group due to U.S. regulatory requirements. Virgin owned less than 25 percent of Virgin America – and was paid 0.7 percent of the airline’s roughly $1.5 billion in annual revenue as a licensing fee for the name. It’s not clear how much the licensing fee figured into Alaska Airlines’ decision. Potential brand confusion with Virgin Atlantic is a factor as well. In fact, Virgin Atlantic will raise its profile in Seattle next week by inaugurating nonstop flights to London (and bringing in Virgin’s billionaire founder, Richard Branson, for a celebration). Virgin America’s brand has had special cachet for Silicon Valley fliers, and in an attempt to keep that clientele as well as Alaska’s traditional customers happy, Alaska announced several enhancements to the customer experience: Mood lighting, music and meals: In a nod to the red-and-purple mood lighting scheme on Virgin America’s Airbus jets, Alaska will be phasing in blue mood lighting on its Boeing jets. Alaska will also update its passenger cabin design, its uniforms, its musical repertoire and its West Coast-inspired menus. By June, Alaska first-class passengers will be able to pre-select meals before they fly, and by next year, main-cabin passengers will be able to pre-pay for meals. High-speed wireless: In 2018, Alaska will start retrofitting its Boeing jets with satellite Wi-Fi that should be speedy enough to accommodate streaming video services like Netflix. Free chat and online messaging, which has been a feature on Alaska’s Boeing jets since January, will be expanded to Virgin America’s Airbus jets this August. The satellite Wi-Fi upgrade should be complete for the entire fleet, Boeing as well as Airbus, by the end of 2019. Free movies and TV: Passengers will continue to have free access to movies and TV shows on their own devices on Alaska’s Boeing jets. Free movies and TV will be coming to the in-flight entertainment system on Virgin America’s Airbus jets in August, and early-release movies will continue to be available for purchase. Premium seating: Beginning in late 2018, Alaska will add 18 premium-class seats to the Airbus jets and rearrange the first-class layout to go from eight to 12 seats. Virgin America’s first-class riders won’t be able to stretch out as far as they used to, but more seats will be available for Alaska’s free upgrades. The Alaska Mileage Plan becomes the sole loyalty program in 2018. Airport lounges: Alaska plans to remodel and expand its airport lounges in Seattle, Portland and Los Angeles by early 2019. New lounges will be built in San Francisco and at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. The new Alaska will infuse many of the brand elements you love about us. https://t.co/2uP5Io3yCN #MostWestCoast — Virgin America (@VirginAmerica) March 22, 2017 Today’s announcement brought mixed reviews in the comments on Alaska Airlines’ website as well as on online forums such as Flyertalk. “So basically I only have about a year and a half to enjoy Virgin before it disappears,” one comment read. “I knew this day would come. So sad.” Another commenter was more upbeat. “I was an early Virgin America adopter and have been at Gold level since 2011,” the commenter wrote. “We were all worried that the merger would ruin the Virgin America service, value and vibe we all live. It sounds like you’ve accepted the challenge to not only meet it but perhaps even go beyond!” Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

Credit: NASA NASA is gearing up for an intense few weeks of work aboard the International Space Station, staging three spacewalks, moving a docking port from one module to another to support commercial crew ferry ships and capturing an Orbital ATK Cygnus cargo ship carrying nearly 4 tons of equipment and supplies. Launch of the Cygnus spacecraft atop an Atlas 5 rocket had been planned for Monday, but late in the day Wednesday, United Launch Alliance announced a delay pending resolution of an unspecified problem with the booster’s hydraulic system. SpaceX, meanwhile, is believed to be pressing ahead with launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket next Wednesday carrying a commercial communications satellite, the California rocket builder’s fourth flight this year and the first launch of a “used” first stage recovered after an earlier mission. But NASA’s focus is on the space station, and a push to complete the three spacewalks and the launch and capture of the Cygnus cargo ship before three of the station’s six crew members return to Earth April 10 to close out a 173-day stay in space. Two fresh crew members are scheduled to take off from Kazakhstan on April 20. First up is a spacewalk Friday — U.S. EVA-40 — by Expedition 50 commander Shane Kimbrough and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet to carry out a variety of tasks, including work to ready a docking tunnel known as pressurized mating adapter No. 3 for a weekend move from the Tranquility module to the upper port of the forward Harmony module. Late this year or early next, a new docking mechanism will be attached to PMA-3, providing a second port for crews flying to the station aboard Boeing- and SpaceX-built commercial crew ferry ships. Kimbrough and Pesquet also will lubricate a robot arm grapple mechanism and install an upgraded control unit in the station’s power truss that can accommodate software commanding needed for commercial crew ships. Pesquet also will inspect part of the station’s ammonia coolant system to help engineers pinpoint and characterize a small leak. On Sunday, flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston will remotely operate the lab’s robot arm, detaching PMA-3 from the outboard port of the Tranquility module, which extends to the left of the station’s central Unity module, and moving it to Harmony’s upper port. Harmony already features a docking tunnel extending from the module’s forward port, the same pressurized mating adapter once used by visiting space shuttles. That PMA now features a new docking mechanism designed for the Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules and after PMA-3 is in place atop Harmony, a second docking adapter eventually will be attached to give the station two crew docking ports. The U.S. segment of the lab already features two ports used by unpiloted cargo ships, one extending down from Harmony and the other extending down from Unity. The Russian segment of the station features five docking ports. NASA originally hoped to launch the Cygnus supply ship this past Sunday, but problems with a pad hydraulic system pushed the flight to Monday. Late Wednesday, a second hydraulic issue was identified, this one with the booster, and the launch was put on hold. A new launch date is not yet known. Ground technicians load cargo into the Orbital ATK Cygnus supply ship earlier this month. Credit: NASA/Glenn Benson But the flight now will slip behind the launch of an SES communications satellite atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which is believed to be scheduled for liftoff at 4:59 p.m. EDT on March 29. The next day, on March 30, Kimbrough and Peggy Whitson plan to stage a second spacewalk — U.S. EVA-41 — to connect power and data cables between PMA-3 and Harmony, to install micrometeoroid shields to protect the mating adapter and the Tranquility port where it had been attached and to install a second upgraded controller. The third spacewalk, by Whitson and Pesquet, currently is planned for April 6. But EVA-42 will depend on when the Cygnus cargo ship arrives. The supply craft is carrying a cable needed to help engineers test a data circuit in a high-energy physics experiment and a replacement avionics box needed to support experiments mounted on an external stowage platform. Assuming the Cygnus gets there in time and the spacewalk stays on schedule, Whitson and Pesquet will replace the avionics box, install a wireless antenna and a new HD television camera and help engineers troubleshoot a cooling issue with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Whitson will install a jumper cable, launched aboard the Cygnus, to test a long-dormant data circuit in the instrument that could be used in the future if new coolant-system pumps need to be installed. She also will take additional photographs to help engineers assess the condition of the AMS’s thermal insulation. If the Cygnus does not arrive in time, the third spacewalk likely will be delayed to late April, sources say, but no decisions are expected until the problem with the Atlas 5 is resolved. Whenever it occurs, EVA-42, will be the 200th devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction of the lab complex began in 1998. Some 125 astronauts and cosmonauts have worked outside the station over the years, logging more than 51 days of EVA time. “We wouldn’t have space station without all these EVAs,” said Kenny Todd, ISS Operations Integration Manager at the Johnson Space Center. “That much is clear. We relied on our ability to go external and do the things we need to do to make the station whole. The fact that it’s 200 is pretty impressive. And I would tell you, we’re still learning.” Assuming all three spacewalks last the predicted six-and-a-half hours each, Whitson will move up to third on the list of the world’s most experienced spacewalkers, with nine excursions totaling more than 65 hours. Cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev holds the record with 68 hours and 44 minutes of EVA time over 14 spacewalks, followed by former astronaut Mike Lopez-Alegria, whose total stands at 67 hours and 40 minutes over 10 EVAs. With all three spacewalks complete and Cygnus safely attached, Kimbrough, Soyuz MS-02 commander Sergey Ryzhikov and flight engineer Andrey Borisenko plan to undock and return to Earth April 10, landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan around 7:20 a.m. (5:20 p.m. local time). Whitson will take over as commander of Expedition 51 when Kimbrough departs. She and her two Soyuz MS-03 crewmates — Pesquet and Soyuz commander Oleg Novitskiy — will have the station to themselves until April 20 when Soyuz MS-04 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and NASA flight engineer Jack Fischer arrive after launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Soyuz ferry ships normally carry three crew members, but the Russians are dropping back to two for this flight to save money and reduce the need for supplies. As it now stands, Whitson, Pesquet and Novitskiy plan to return to Earth June 2. But mission managers are debating the possibility of keeping Whitson in orbit until September to maximize research time. If Whitson comes home on schedule in June, launch of the next SpaceX Dragon cargo ship, currently expected in mid May, likely will be delayed to August. With just two crew members — Fischer and Yurchikhin — aboard the station in June and most of July, the research gear scheduled for launch aboard the Dragon will not be needed until later in the summer, after three more crew members arrive in late July aboard the Soyuz MS-05 spacecraft. A decision on Whitson’s mission is expected soon.

Both Trump and John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced plans to drastically increase the defense budget over the next several years. In November, Forbes claimed that the newly elected President was likely to increase overall military spending by as much as $1 trillion over ten years. During his campaign, Trump called for 90,000 more Army soliders, a 350-ship Navy (including more aircraft carriers and attack submarines), 100 more aircraft fighters, and a strengthened nuclear defense. McCain’s plan, announced in a whitepaper entitled “Restoring American Power” called for a $54 billion increase to the Defense Department’s base budget for 2018, citing global competition and rising terrorist threats. Demand and Budgets Increase in U.S. and Overseas Manufacturers in the space have reason to be optimistic that growth, sluggish in recent years, will pick up steam. The markets confirmed the promising outlook, as A&D funds and major company stocks ran up to record highs immediately following the election. A Republican-controlled Congress and vocally pro-military President should be able to end budget sequestration and increase spending without much pushback. Moreover, international demand for aircraft, missiles and other military craft continues to increase. The Middle East, Japan, South Korea and India are ramping up defense spending in response to growing threats. European countries’ unease with Trump’s anti-NATO (and pro-Russia) rhetoric has compelled Germany and other nations to increase their military budgets. No Easy Money However, A&D manufacturers should expect challenges along the way. Trump has already made it clear that he will not hesitate to publicly excoriate manufacturers in an effort to force cheaper deals and create jobs for U.S. workers. His public name-and-shame negotiations with automakers are just the beginning. Trump’s harsh criticism of Boeing’s Air Force One and Lockheed’s F-35 projects should put A&D players on notice: cost-cutting concessions will be part of any new or ongoing contracts. After a mid-January meeting with Trump, Boeing’s CEO Dennis Muilenburg reported that they had discussed plans to streamline and simplify processes in order to reach “substantial cost reductions.” Likewise, McCain has long history of calling out wasteful Pentagon spending, most recently targeting the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship failures. Trump’s voting base, especially in struggling Rust Belt states, was energized by his promises to bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and strengthen the military, but also by his crusade against big government and politics-as-usual. In order to make good on his pledges, he will have to push defense contractors to do more with less. Cost overruns, project delays and failure to execute may lead to damaging public reprimands and tighter government purse strings. Pressure to bring component manufacturing back to US factories will require manufacturers to retool plants and retrain workers, both of which will strain resources and cut into profit margins. Rising to the Challenge The challenge for the A&D industry is two-fold: prepare to secure a piece of increased funding and projects, and get ready to execute those contracts expeditiously under heightened scrutiny on costs, quality and compliance. Manufacturers can gear up for these challenges by embracing smart manufacturing approaches. Supported by information technology and digital manufacturing firms, A&D companies need to build up their capabilities in Big Data and advanced analytics, robotics and automation, cyber-physical integration and global supply chain management. To optimize the complex discrete manufacturing of highly engineered military hardware, enterprises must implement and integrate MES and other smart manufacturing solutions throughout the value chain. Smart Manufacturing Transformation Software, Big Data and IIoT are the main drivers of the sector’s transformation to Industry 4.0. Advanced analytics and data-driven production processes can boost productivity up to 30 percent while cutting product development and assembly costs in half. Data-driven decision making processes also reduce capital costs, streamline change management and increase quality. Big Data imbues lean manufacturing models with powerful, precise insights into eliminating wasteful activities and maximizing efficiency. A&D manufacturers can transform product development by leveraging sensor data from products, machines, and monitoring systems to create simulations, enabling performance analysis even before physical prototypes are created. Cyber-physical systems monitor processes and automate decision-making about inventory, logistics, maintenance and much more. Over the IoT, cyber-physical systems communicate with each other and with human operators, enabling internal and cross-organizational services that coordinate and support participants in the value chain. In an era when globalization is increasingly suspect (or hampered by geopolitics), supply chain visibility and accountability are paramount, especially for highly sensitive and elaborate machines like fighter jets. Quality and Accountability A&D companies require Closed-Loop Quality processes that permeate the enterprise and supplier networks. Traceability is especially critical in A&D manufacturing. Smart manufacturing systems provide strong control and visibility over lot and serial tracked parts from cradle to grave. In a fully integrated digital manufacturing enterprise, data gathered from initial design through to MRO forms a digital thread. Materials, components, subassemblies, units and completed products are traceable at granular levels, and can be queried to test quality, prove compliance and streamline changes and recalls. MES, operations and quality management solutions bridge gaps between engineering and business systems, enabling real-time statistical process control, documentation of root cause analysis and corrective action procedures, and real-time analysis of metrics for yield and performance reporting. A&D companies must meet myriad stringent requirements, from FAA and ITAR regulations to AS9100 and DCAA standards. While Trump has promised some deregulation, defense contractors are unlikely to see significant rollbacks in quality oversight due to the meticulous, life-and-death nature of their work. To demonstrate world-class quality and industry leadership, A&D manufacturers have to achieve and maintain a powerful, agile alignment of people, processes and technology. As the pressure to do better and more with fewer resources intensifies, we must exercise our technological might to the fullest extent. Smart manufacturing capabilities are fundamental to bolstering our national defenses and our ability to compete globally in the face of threats, disruptions and unknowns.

13:49 ET Share this article LOD, Israel, March 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- El Al Israel Airlines (TASE: ELAL) announced today that the Company's revenues in 2016 amounted to approx. USD 2,038 million, compared to approx. USD 2,054 million in the previous year; Profit before tax in 2016 was approx. USD 93 million, compared to a profit before tax of approx. USD 145 million in the previous year; The Company completed 2016 with a net profit of approx. USD 81 million compared to a net profit of approx. USD 107 million in 2015; The Company's cash and deposit balances as of December 31, 2016 totaled approx. USD 212 million and the equity amounted to approx. USD 284 million; The Company's market-share of passenger traffic at Ben-Gurion Airport increased in 2016 to approx. 32.6%, compared to approx. 32.5% in the previous year. Load factor in 2016 stood at approx. 84%, compared to 83.3% in the previous year; Passenger segments increased by approx. 11% EBITDA in 2016 amounted to approx. USD 287 million, compared to approx. USD 331 million last year; Cash flow from operating activities in 2016 amounted to approx. USD 243 million, compared to a cash flow of approx. USD 271 million in 2015; Equity in 2016 increased to approx. USD 284 million, compared to USD 198 million as of December 31, 2015; The Company's revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 amounted to approx. USD 460.8 million, compared to approx. USD 476.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015; The Company recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 a net loss of approx. USD 2.4 million, compared to a profit of approx. USD 12.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. David Maimon, El Al's CEO: "The Company announced a net profit for 2016 of approx. USD 81 million and a growth in all operational parameters, including an increase of about 11% in passenger segments, a market-share increase to 32.6% and an impressive load-factor of 84%. The 2016 results were affected by the pilots' crisis that reached its peak in the fourth quarter of the year. The main impact was on the operating expense items. We continue preparations for the arrival of the new wide-body 787 Dreamliners, the first of which is expected to arrive at the end of August 2017. Additionally, in 2016 we continued the trend of rejuvenating our narrow-body aircraft fleet, upon completion of the 8 Boeing 737-900 aircraft arrival process. Currently, the average age of the Company's narrow-body airplanes stands at seven years old. At the same time, as per our commitment, we continue the pilot of WIFI services during flights, which will be gradually installed in all Boeing 737-900 aircraft. The Frequent Flyer Club, in Israel and overseas, and in particular the FLYCARD credit card, serve as a significant growth engine, which is translated into an impressive expansion trend. The number of said credit card holders has exceeded all expectations and stands at about 200 thousand since its launch. The number of EL AL's Frequent Flyer Club members also continued to increase, reaching more than 1.76 million members. We shall do all in our power to provide our customers with a quality service, maximum comfort, innovative technology and advanced airplanes, while continuing to successfully cope with market conditions as well as competition. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you and express my highest appreciation for El Al employees, on the ground and in the air, in Israel and worldwide, who work with determination and dedication, allowing us to effectively deal with the challenges facing us. We are committed to ensure the Company's success and prosperity, and determined to restore our customers' security and trust." Dganit Palti, El Al's CFO, stated: "The company enjoyed from lower average fuel prices last year, which resulted in a net savings of $ 95 million in fuel expenses. On the other hand, the company's operating expenses increased significantly due to the 5% increase in flight hours and mainly due to disruptions in flights resulting from a crisis with the pilots. We are working hard improve the Company's operating indices. Despite the damage to the activity this year , the EBITDA amounted to $ 287 million, the Company generated a cash flow from operating activities in excess of $ 240 million, and cash and deposits balances at the end of the period amounted to $ 212 million, attesting to the Company's financial strength. The company's financial position enables us to move forward with confidence in the face of the challenge of the new fleet of aircraft program, which will enable the Company's future development in the coming years." Results for the year Ended on December 31, 2016: 1.      Operating revenues – operating revenues decreased in 2016 by approx. USD 16 million (about 0.8%) compared to 2015. Revenue from passenger flights increased by approx. 0.1% whereas income from cargo flights decreased. Revenue from passengers was affected by two opposing trends – on the one hand, the trend of drop in flight ticket prices continued due to the intensified competition and the impact of the fuel price drop, and on the other hand, a significant increase was recorded in the number of passengers carried by the Company and in passenger revenue per kilometer (RPK) as a result of an increase in operations. Additionally, the Company's passenger revenues were adversely affected by the erosion of exchange rates of currencies in which some of the Company's sales transactions are made, in relation to the dollar. Furthermore, the growth in passenger revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was partially offset by the disruptions in manning the Company's flights due to the pilots' sanctions (which started in October 2015 and continued intermittently throughout 2016). The Company's cargo revenue decreased by approx. 11.4%, primarily due to the drop in yield per ton-kilometer and revenue-ton-kilometer (RTK) flown. 2.      Operating expenses – operating expenses increased in 2016 by approx. USD 50 million (about 3.4%) compared to 2015, after a decline of approx. USD 95 million in jet fuel expenses. The gross increase of approx. USD 145 million mainly resulted from an increase in operations and wages and increase in lease expenses primarily due to disruptions in manning flights, as a result of the pilots' sanctions, and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, mainly wet lease of aircrafts (lease of aircraft and crew), as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses, primarily due to an increase in the number of the Company's aircrafts and change in the residual value of the 777 aircrafts. 3.      Jet Fuel Expenses – the Company's jet fuel expenses, including hedging impact, declined by approx. USD 94.7 million (about 20%) compared to the corresponding expenditure in 2015, as a result of a drop in the price of jet fuel, offset in part by an increase in the amount of jet fuel consumed due to the growth in the scope of the Company's operations. 4.      Selling Expenses –selling expenses decreased in approx. USD 2.3 million (about 1.2%) compared to 2015, primarily due to the drop in distribution expenses. 5.      General and Administrative Expenses - general and administrative expenses recorded a growth of approx. USD 1.6 million (about 1.7%) compared to 2015, mainly due to the an increase in professional services and provisions for legal claims. 6.      Other Revenues (Expenses) – the USD 5.2 million improvement in results is primarily attributed to early retirement plan expenses recognized in 2015, and capital gain for the sale of a 737-700 aircraft, which was recognized during 2016. 7.      Financing Expenses - financing expenses amounted to approx. USD 23.1 million, compared to approx. USD 26.5 million in 2015. This drop is mostly due to a one-time fee payment in 2015 and a decrease in price differences in 2016 compared to 2015. 8.      Taxes on Income – taxes on income totaled approx. USD 12.8 million compared to approx. USD 38.1 million in 2015. This drop is the result of a decrease in profit before taxes on income and the impact of the decrease in the corporate tax on deferred taxes (a benefit of approx. USD 11 million). 9.      Profit for the Period – profit before tax in 2016 totaled approx. USD 93.5 million and profit after tax totaled approx. 80.7 million (constituting about 4.0 % of the turnover), compared to profit before tax of approx. USD 144.6 million in 2015 and profit after tax approx. USD 106.5 million (about 5.2% of the turnover). Results for the Three-Month Period Ended on December 31, 2016: 1.      Operating revenues – decreased by approx. USD 15.5 million (about 3.3%) in the reported period compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year, with a drop of approx. USD 9.9 million (about 2.4%) in passenger revenues and approx. USD 7.0 million in cargo revenues (about 16.9%). The passenger revenue decrease was due to a decline in revenue passenger kilometer (RPK), for the above detailed reasons, as well as the erosion of exchange rates of currencies in which the Company's sales transactions are made, in relation to the dollar. In addition, the drop in passenger revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, was also due to the disruptions in manning the Company's flights. The Company's cargo yield per ton-kilometer and revenue-ton-kilometer (RTK) flown recorded a decrease. 2.      Operating expenses – increased in the reported period by approx. USD 17.2 million (about 4.5%) compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, after a savings of approx. USD 9.6 million in jet fuel expenses. The gross increase of approx. USD 26.8 million was primarily due to disruptions in manning flights, caused by the pilots' sanctions, and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, mainly wet lease of aircrafts by the Company, as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses. 3.      Selling Expenses –decreased by approx. 7.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to the drop in distribution and advertising expenses. 4.      General and Administrative Expenses – increased by approx. 6.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, mainly due to the an increase in professional services and provisions for legal claims. 5.      Financing Expenses - amounted to approx. USD 6.1 million, compared to approx. USD 7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This drop is mostly due to a one-time fee payment that was recognized in 2015 and a decrease in exchange differences. 6.      Taxes on Income – the tax benefit in the reported period totaled approx. USD 10.2 million. Said tax benefit includes revenues, due to a corporate tax rate decrease from 25% to 23% (in the expected period, on the date of reversing timing differences in respect of which deferred taxes were recognized) 7.     Loss for the Period – loss before tax in 2016 totaled approx. USD 12.7 million (loss after tax totaled approx. 2.4 million, constituting about 0.5% of the turnover), compared to profit before tax of approx. USD 16.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 (profit after tax - approx. USD 12.2 million, constituting about 2.6% of the turnover),  Additional Data as of December 31, 2016: 1.      Current Assets - amounted to approx. USD 435.1 million, reflecting a growth of approx. USD 40.8 million compared to December 31, 2015. This growth resulted mostly from an increase in cash balances compared to the cash balances at the end of 2015, which was partially offset by a decrease in the Short Term Deposits item and the improvement in the fair value of jet fuel derivatives. 2.      Current Liabilities - amounted to approx. USD 800.1 million, reflecting a drop of approx. USD 37.9 million compared to December 31, 2015. This drop is primarily due to the improvement in the fair value of jet fuel derivatives and a drop in current maturities of long-term loans, which were partially offset by an increase in the Revenues item from pre-sale of airline tickets, as a result of a rise in airline ticket sales (not yet realized) in the last quarter of 2016 compared to the last quarter of 2015. 3.      Working Capital – the Company has a working capital deficit of approx. USD 365.1 million compared to a deficit of approx. USD 443.7 dollar as of December 31, 2015. It shall be noted that a substantial part of the working capital deficit does not reflect short-term cash flows, and consists of two substantial components which are included in the Company's Current Liabilities items and are characterized by current business cycle; however, the Company is not required to use cash-flow sources in the short term in order to repay these components: prepaid revenue from the sale of airline tickets and from the Frequent Flyer Club, to be settled by providing future flight services, and liabilities to employees for vacation, which are expected to be paid over several years but classified as a short-term liability in accordance with accounting principles. Moreover, loans in an aggregate amount of approx. USD 78 million, whose original maturity date is in April and July 2017 and are therefore presented as short-term liabilities, were spread, after the date of the Statement of Financial Condition, over a period of 4 years, and thus will be classified, starting from the quarter of 2017, as  non-current liabilities. 4.      Non-Current Assets – amounted to approx. USD 1,281.9 million, showing a growth of approx. USD 12.0 million compared to their balance as of December 31, 2015, mainly as a result of the continued investment in the 787 Boeing aircraft acquisition program and the receipt of three 737-900 aircrafts during 2016, less current depreciation. 5.      Non-Current Liabilities - totaled approx. USD 632.8 million, similar to their balance as of December 31, 2015. Liabilities were affected by a decrease in loan balances, which was offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities due to profit before tax for the year, offset by the impact of the decrease in corporate tax. 6.      Total Equity – amounted to approx. USD 284.1 million. The growth of approx. USD 86.1 million compared to equity as of December 31, 2015, mainly resulted from the profit for the period, which was partially offset by a USD 33.4 million dividend, announced and paid during the period, as well as by the impact of the Company's hedging instruments on the equity funds, in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 48.0 million (increase), offset by actuarial losses in respect of employee benefits on the equity funds, which affected the equity funds in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 9.6 million.

USD 81 million and a growth in all operational parameters, including an increase of about 11% in passenger segments, a market-share increase to 32.6% and an impressive load-factor of 84%. The 2016 results were affected by the pilots' crisis that reached its peak in the fourth quarter of the year. The main impact was on the operating expense items. We continue preparations for the arrival of the new wide-body 787 Dreamliners, the first of which is expected to arrive at the end of August 2017. Additionally, in 2016 we continued the trend of rejuvenating our narrow-body aircraft fleet, upon completion of the 8 Boeing 737-900 aircraft arrival process. Currently, the average age of the Company's narrow-body airplanes stands at seven years old. At the same time, as per our commitment, we continue the pilot of WIFI services during flights, which will be gradually installed in all Boeing 737-900 aircraft. The Frequent Flyer Club, in Israel and overseas, and in particular the FLYCARD credit card, serve as a significant growth engine, which is translated into an impressive expansion trend. The number of said credit card holders has exceeded all expectations and stands at about 200 thousand since its launch. The number of EL AL's Frequent Flyer Club members also continued to increase, reaching more than 1.76 million members. We shall do all in our power to provide our customers with a quality service, maximum comfort, innovative technology and advanced airplanes, while continuing to successfully cope with market conditions as well as competition. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you and express my highest appreciation for El Al employees, on the ground and in the air, in Israel and worldwide, who work with determination and dedication, allowing us to effectively deal with the challenges facing us. We are committed to ensure the Company's success and prosperity, and determined to restore our customers' security and trust." Dganit Palti, El Al's CFO, stated: "The company enjoyed from lower average fuel prices last year, which resulted in a net savings of $ 95 million in fuel expenses. On the other hand, the company's operating expenses increased significantly due to the 5% increase in flight hours and mainly due to disruptions in flights resulting from a crisis with the pilots. We are working hard improve the Company's operating indices. Despite the damage to the activity this year , the EBITDA amounted to $ 287 million, the Company generated a cash flow from operating activities in excess of $ 240 million, and cash and deposits balances at the end of the period amounted to $ 212 million, attesting to the Company's financial strength. The company's financial position enables us to move forward with confidence in the face of the challenge of the new fleet of aircraft program, which will enable the Company's future development in the coming years." Results for the year Ended on December 31, 2016: 1.      Operating revenues – operating revenues decreased in 2016 by approx. USD 16 million (about 0.8%) compared to 2015. Revenue from passenger flights increased by approx. 0.1% whereas income from cargo flights decreased. Revenue from passengers was affected by two opposing trends – on the one hand, the trend of drop in flight ticket prices continued due to the intensified competition and the impact of the fuel price drop, and on the other hand, a significant increase was recorded in the number of passengers carried by the Company and in passenger revenue per kilometer (RPK) as a result of an increase in operations. Additionally, the Company's passenger revenues were adversely affected by the erosion of exchange rates of currencies in which some of the Company's sales transactions are made, in relation to the dollar. Furthermore, the growth in passenger revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was partially offset by the disruptions in manning the Company's flights due to the pilots' sanctions (which started in October 2015 and continued intermittently throughout 2016). The Company's cargo revenue decreased by approx. 11.4%, primarily due to the drop in yield per ton-kilometer and revenue-ton-kilometer (RTK) flown. 2.      Operating expenses – operating expenses increased in 2016 by approx. USD 50 million (about 3.4%) compared to 2015, after a decline of approx. USD 95 million in jet fuel expenses. The gross increase of approx. USD 145 million mainly resulted from an increase in operations and wages and increase in lease expenses primarily due to disruptions in manning flights, as a result of the pilots' sanctions, and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, mainly wet lease of aircrafts (lease of aircraft and crew), as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses, primarily due to an increase in the number of the Company's aircrafts and change in the residual value of the 777 aircrafts. 3.      Jet Fuel Expenses – the Company's jet fuel expenses, including hedging impact, declined by approx. USD 94.7 million (about 20%) compared to the corresponding expenditure in 2015, as a result of a drop in the price of jet fuel, offset in part by an increase in the amount of jet fuel consumed due to the growth in the scope of the Company's operations. 4.      Selling Expenses –selling expenses decreased in approx. USD 2.3 million (about 1.2%) compared to 2015, primarily due to the drop in distribution expenses. 5.      General and Administrative Expenses - general and administrative expenses recorded a growth of approx. USD 1.6 million (about 1.7%) compared to 2015, mainly due to the an increase in professional services and provisions for legal claims. 6.      Other Revenues (Expenses) – the USD 5.2 million improvement in results is primarily attributed to early retirement plan expenses recognized in 2015, and capital gain for the sale of a 737-700 aircraft, which was recognized during 2016. 7.      Financing Expenses - financing expenses amounted to approx. USD 23.1 million, compared to approx. USD 26.5 million in 2015. This drop is mostly due to a one-time fee payment in 2015 and a decrease in price differences in 2016 compared to 2015. 8.      Taxes on Income – taxes on income totaled approx. USD 12.8 million compared to approx. USD 38.1 million in 2015. This drop is the result of a decrease in profit before taxes on income and the impact of the decrease in the corporate tax on deferred taxes (a benefit of approx. USD 11 million). 9.      Profit for the Period – profit before tax in 2016 totaled approx. USD 93.5 million and profit after tax totaled approx. 80.7 million (constituting about 4.0 % of the turnover), compared to profit before tax of approx. USD 144.6 million in 2015 and profit after tax approx. USD 106.5 million (about 5.2% of the turnover). Results for the Three-Month Period Ended on December 31, 2016: 1.      Operating revenues – decreased by approx. USD 15.5 million (about 3.3%) in the reported period compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year, with a drop of approx. USD 9.9 million (about 2.4%) in passenger revenues and approx. USD 7.0 million in cargo revenues (about 16.9%). The passenger revenue decrease was due to a decline in revenue passenger kilometer (RPK), for the above detailed reasons, as well as the erosion of exchange rates of currencies in which the Company's sales transactions are made, in relation to the dollar. In addition, the drop in passenger revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, was also due to the disruptions in manning the Company's flights. The Company's cargo yield per ton-kilometer and revenue-ton-kilometer (RTK) flown recorded a decrease. 2.      Operating expenses – increased in the reported period by approx. USD 17.2 million (about 4.5%) compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, after a savings of approx. USD 9.6 million in jet fuel expenses. The gross increase of approx. USD 26.8 million was primarily due to disruptions in manning flights, caused by the pilots' sanctions, and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, mainly wet lease of aircrafts by the Company, as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses. 3.      Selling Expenses –decreased by approx. 7.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to the drop in distribution and advertising expenses. 4.      General and Administrative Expenses – increased by approx. 6.0% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, mainly due to the an increase in professional services and provisions for legal claims. 5.      Financing Expenses - amounted to approx. USD 6.1 million, compared to approx. USD 7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. This drop is mostly due to a one-time fee payment that was recognized in 2015 and a decrease in exchange differences. 6.      Taxes on Income – the tax benefit in the reported period totaled approx. USD 10.2 million. Said tax benefit includes revenues, due to a corporate tax rate decrease from 25% to 23% (in the expected period, on the date of reversing timing differences in respect of which deferred taxes were recognized) 7.     Loss for the Period – loss before tax in 2016 totaled approx. USD 12.7 million (loss after tax totaled approx. 2.4 million, constituting about 0.5% of the turnover), compared to profit before tax of approx. USD 16.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 (profit after tax - approx. USD 12.2 million, constituting about 2.6% of the turnover),  Additional Data as of December 31, 2016: 1.      Current Assets- amounted to approx. USD 435.1 million, reflecting a growth of approx. USD 40.8 million compared to December 31, 2015. This growth resulted mostly from an increase in cash balances compared to the cash balances at the end of 2015, which was partially offset by a decrease in the Short Term Deposits item and the improvement in the fair value of jet fuel derivatives. 2.      Current Liabilities - amounted to approx. USD 800.1 million, reflecting a drop of approx. USD 37.9 million compared to December 31, 2015. This drop is primarily due to the improvement in the fair value of jet fuel derivatives and a drop in current maturities of long-term loans, which were partially offset by an increase in the Revenues item from pre-sale of airline tickets, as a result of a rise in airline ticket sales (not yet realized) in the last quarter of 2016 compared to the last quarter of 2015. 3.      Working Capital – the Company has a working capital deficit of approx. USD 365.1 million compared to a deficit of approx. USD 443.7 dollar as of December 31, 2015. It shall be noted that a substantial part of the working capital deficit does not reflect short-term cash flows, and consists of two substantial components which are included in the Company's Current Liabilities items and are characterized by current business cycle; however, the Company is not required to use cash-flow sources in the short term in order to repay these components: prepaid revenue from the sale of airline tickets and from the Frequent Flyer Club, to be settled by providing future flight services, and liabilities to employees for vacation, which are expected to be paid over several years but classified as a short-term liability in accordance with accounting principles. Moreover, loans in an aggregate amount of approx. USD 78 million, whose original maturity date is in April and July 2017 and are therefore presented as short-term liabilities, were spread, after the date of the Statement of Financial Condition, over a period of 4 years, and thus will be classified, starting from the quarter of 2017, as  non-current liabilities. 4.      Non-Current Assets – amounted to approx. USD 1,281.9 million, showing a growth of approx. USD 12.0 million compared to their balance as of December 31, 2015, mainly as a result of the continued investment in the 787 Boeing aircraft acquisition program and the receipt of three 737-900 aircrafts during 2016, less current depreciation. 5.      Non-Current Liabilities - totaled approx. USD 632.8 million, similar to their balance as of December 31, 2015. Liabilities were affected by a decrease in loan balances, which was offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities due to profit before tax for the year, offset by the impact of the decrease in corporate tax. 6.      Total Equity – amounted to approx. USD 284.1 million. The growth of approx. USD 86.1 million compared to equity as of December 31, 2015, mainly resulted from the profit for the period, which was partially offset by a USD 33.4 million dividend, announced and paid during the period, as well as by the impact of the Company's hedging instruments on the equity funds, in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 48.0 million (increase), offset by actuarial losses in respect of employee benefits on the equity funds, which affected the equity funds in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 9.6 million.

(NYSE: BA) is creating state-of-the-art manufacturing solutions at its Everett factory to renew its B777 line and to produce the B787 more efficiently. At the same time, its Composite Wing Facility is on schedule. According to one key analyst, these changes should help long-term profitability. Jefferies has a Buy rating for Boeing with a $200 price target, implying an upside of 13% from Wednesday’s closing price of $176.98. This view on Boeing contrasts greatly from Merrill Lynch’s call from Wednesday. Merrill Lynch maintained an Underperform rating, while lifting its price objective to $150 from $135, implying downside of 23% from Tuesday’s close of $175.96. According to the brokerage firm, Boeing continues to lead in the civil aviation market, which is growing slightly faster than gross domestic product. Boeing has improved its operating disciplines and has the ability to grow its cash flow per share at a high-single-digit rate over the next several years. Boeing’s 1.1 million square foot Composite Wing Center for the 777X is on schedule. Jefferies believes the wing that emerges from this center will go a long way toward delivering a 20% improvement in the seat mile cost of the newest 777 over its predecessor. The first several wing forms are being built and will soon undergo testing. The plane will have the longest wingspan of any twin-engine aircraft. Currently, two-thirds of the 777 is now being assembled using robotics. The gains in quality and reduction in waste should increase assembly speeds and lead to lower costs in the future. Over the past year, span times on the 787 have declined by 55% to 60%, while more gains are expected as the company plans on removing a work station from the line by the end of the year. North Charleston has been able to introduce the 787-10 into the line with only a minor bump in the learning curve. In the near term, the company has elected to go with a stretch 737, offering the MAX 10X. Longer term, it appears that the company has an attractive concept for the 4,000-nautical-mile market. The cost for the new 737 is expected to be modest and complements the existing lineup. Shares of Boeing were last seen at $177.17 on Thursday, with a consensus analyst price target of $175.75 and a consensus analyst price target of $122.35 to $185.71.

Jim Cramer Gives His Opinion On New York Community Bancorp And Boeing What's Next For GOP Agenda, Tesla, Oil, Hollywood: Investing Action Plan (Investor's Business Daily) Related Global Defense Firms Will Build $82 Billion In Drones In A Decade Earnings Scheduled For January 17, 2017 By knocking out a surface-to-air missile from Syria last week with its newest Arrow 2 interceptor, Israel successfully deployed the latest addition to its packed quiver of air defenses, which might be the most sophisticated in the world. The Arrow 2 missile, which can take out targets outside the Earth’s atmosphere, was launched after Israeli fighter jets attacked a Hezbollah arms convoy in Syria heading into Lebanon, the Jerusalem Post said. Hezbollah fights alongside Syrian government forces opposed to U.S.-backed rebels. Syrian air-defense systems fired three missiles at the Israeli jets, and the Israeli military revealed that one of the ballistic missiles was taken out by the ballyhooed Arrow 2, which is co-produced by the Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) and Israeli Aerospace Industries. The Arrow 2’s deployment was the first successful use of the latest addition to Israeli air defenses, which once were dependent primarily on Patriot missiles developed by the Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN). Some Patriots are still in use in Israel, and Raytheon makes other missiles that are part of this cutting-edge system. “I don’t think we can say (which country) has the best individual system, but I think it would be fair to say that Israel has the most comprehensive missile defense of any country when all the different systems, radars and integrated command-and-control are taken into consideration,” said Jeremy Binnie, a missile analyst for Jane’s Defence, a division of IHS Markit Ltd (NASDAQ: INFO). U.S. Defense Contractors Guaranteed A Cut Of Israeli Missile Defense In exchange for the U.S. contribution to the Israeli defense budget, U.S. firms are guaranteed a slice of the Israeli missile budget. According to Defense News, Boeing received $100 million for the Arrow production. Congress for this year approved $416 million for other aspects of the complex missile system, with Raytheon expected to receive half the production funding. The Arrow 3 is only part of Israel’s particular air-defense web developed by the government-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. Binnie said Rafael is marketing aspects of its system to other countries. From Iron Dome To David’s Sling, Israeli Missile Defense In A Nutshell Here's how Binnie broke down Israel's layered missile system for Benzinga: Iron Dome: Missiles used for intercepting artillery rockets from common 122mm Russian Grads to tactical ballistic missiles with a range of sixty miles. The system will even be capable of taking out lightweight enemy drones. David’s Sling: Expected to achieve operating capability next month, it is expected to be a more affordable replacement for the U.S.-made Patriots. It’s designed for intercepting heavy rockets. Binnie said Israel chose this system rather than upgrade to the PAC-3-series manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT). However, Raytheon helped develop the Stunner missile used in this program. Arrow Weapon System: The Arrow 2 anti-ballistic missile has been used for years for intercepting longer-range ballistic missiles inside the atmosphere. The Arrow 3 was formally inducted into service in January for intercepting missiles such as Iran’s Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile even further outside the Earth’s atmosphere.

four-year service agreement with Avianca, the flagship airline of Colombia. Jeppesen will provide Crew Pairing and Crew Rostering services to optimize crew planning operations for the airline's 5,000-plus crew members based in Colombia, El Salvador, Peru, Costa Rica, Honduras, Ecuador and Guatemala.

Jeppesen Crew Rostering helps airlines build high-quality rosters while reducing total costs and time to market, leading to increased profitability. The tool also considers seniority to build rosters, based on a preferential bidding system which increases crew quality of life and job satisfaction factors. "The addition of these crew services from Jeppesen will help us to operate more efficiently, taking into account numerous real-time crew planning factors that can greatly effect daily airline operations," said Erika Ratkovich, Planning and Control Production director, Avianca. "The flexibility provided by both the pairing and rostering solutions will allow us to both publish schedules further in advance as well as make necessary adjustments with day-of operations, which increases efficiency." Through use of Jeppesen Crew Pairing, Avianca will be able to optimize a full monthly crew schedule, instead of a typical daily or weekly outlook. The optimization tool offers powerful decision support, enabling effective control of costs and other objectives, while its flexibility and modeling capabilities makes it easy for the airline to adapt to changes. "The implementation of Jeppesen Crew Pairing and Rostering with Avianca is the outcome of carefully developed strategy and teamwork to help the airline better manage their crew operations through advanced optimization and data analytics," said Peter Andersson, vice president, Jeppesen Crew Management.

Outfitted in bulky white spacesuits, helmets and gloves, France's Thomas Pesquet, 39, and American Shane Kimbrough, 49, completed their work right on schedule, after six hours and 34 minutes in the vacuum of space. "Another great example of international collaboration and the work that we can do when we get a great team like this together," said Jessica Meir, a NASA astronaut who coordinated the spacewalk from mission control in Houston. Scroll down for video  ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet works outside the International Space Station on March 24, 2017, in a framegrab taken from NASA TV The goal for Friday's outing was to prepare for the installation of the second of two parking spots for space taxis, known as the International Docking Adapters. New crew spaceships, being designed by SpaceX and Boeing, will use them when they begin flying astronauts to the station in the coming years, as early as 2018. Currently, the only way the world's astronauts can reach orbit is by buying a ride aboard Russia's Soyuz capsules, at $81 million per seat.

Share this article Share 21 shares NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough seen working on the outside of the International Space Station on March 24, 2017, in a framegrab taken from NASA TV Pesquet spent the first part of his spacewalk inspecting a radiator valve suspected of a small ammonia leak, but was unable to find evidence of any problems. Then, he lubricated the space station's robotic arm, Dextre, which is employed to grab approaching cargo ships and move items around outside. Meanwhile, Kimbrough disconnected cables and electrical connections on the pressurized mating adapter (PMA-3) to prepare for its move Thursday, March 30, during another spacewalk. In its new location, it will become the home for the second of two International Docking Adapters, to be delivered on a future flight of a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship. Boeing's CST-100 spacecraft will first be used to take astronauts to the ISS, pictured. However, Boeing also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as Bigelow Aerospace's inflatable habitats Kimbrough also worked on installing new cameras and computer equipment outside the space station. Pesquet and Kimbrough worked separately on their tasks outside the space station, a symbol of international cooperation which has been continuously inhabited by global astronauts for the past 17 years.  Friday's spacewalk was the second of Pesquet's career, and the fifth for Kimbrough. French astronaut Thomas Pesquet in the International Space Station's Cupola observatory, one of ESA's contributions to the orbital outpost, on November 22, 2016 "Going outside is always a gee-whiz moment for me," Kimbrough said in an interview on NASA television this week, adding that it was also "really satisfying" to see Pesquet perform so well on his first spacewalk back in January. Pesquet is the fourth Frenchman to ever walk in space, and the 11th European. The next outing on March 30 will include Kimbrough and American astronaut Peggy Whitson, making the eighth spacewalk of her career. A third spacewalk on April 6 is to include Pesquet and Whitson. French astronaut Thomas Pesquet displays his juggling and eating skills during a light moment on the International Space Station, in an image released by the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA on February 27, 2017 Next month, the 57-year-old Whitson will set a new record for spacewalks by a female astronaut, and will also break the record for most number of days spent in space by an American. The current US record of 534 days is held by NASA astronaut Jeff Williams. Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka holds the record for the most cumulative days ever in space, at 879 days over five career trips.

A plane lands at Heathrow airport in west London on 21 January 2013 after the airport announced further flight cancellations due to adverse weather. Picture: AFP. British government Turkish government US government North Africa Aviation Authority US to ban carrying more electronics on planes Middle East countries Email Print Tweet Share Reuters | 3 days ago ISTANBUL – As Istanbul builds a massive new airport and Turkish Airlines pursues aggressive route expansion, some in Turkey see the ban on large carry-on electronics on U.S. and Britain-bound flights as a ploy to undermine their aviation industry. The US and British decisions to forbid devices bigger than a cellphone in the cabin on flights from several Middle East and North African states could hit Istanbul particularly hard, after years building up its position as an international hub. More than half of international passengers at Turkish Airlines, which is 49% state-owned and serves 247 destinations outside Turkey, are transit customers who could instead travel through Europe or other hubs. Fast-growing Gulf airlines such as Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways, which similarly depend on business-class flyers stopping over in places like Dubai or Doha for far-flung destinations, could also be hit. For Turkey’s national carrier, the setback comes as it prepares to relocate to a €10 billion third airport in Istanbul, billed by the developer as the world’s largest and championed by President Tayyip Erdogan as a megaproject that will cement Turkey’s global standing. “The biggest aim of the third airport was to use Istanbul as a hub. But if such security measures become permanent, this could reduce Istanbul’s appeal,” said Esra Sirinel, a deputy research director at Is Investment and an airline specialist. Istanbul’s existing main Ataturk airport is struggling to cope with millions of transit passengers a month. The new airport will initially have the capacity for 90 million passengers when it opens in 2018, but ultimately aims to serve double that and to offer flights to more than 350 destinations. Turkey’s pro-government media, which, like Erdogan, often casts the country as a victim of foreign conspiracies, was quick to lambaste the new regulations. “They’re afraid of THY (Turkish Airlines),” the Yeni Safak newspaper said in a front-page headline on Thursday, over a simulated image of the new airport glistening in the sun. It cast the move as a plot against Turkey’s national carrier. “We need to stop THY,” read the headline on fellow pro-government daily Aksam, which claimed US carriers, facing stiff competition from Turkish Airlines and Gulf carriers, had lobbied for the move. Gulf airlines have been battling against a campaign in Washington by US carriers which accuse them of receiving unfair subsidies, charges they deny. The administration of US President Donald Trump has so far placed more emphasis on the job benefits of building jets for foreign carriers. Gulf carriers and Turkish Airlines are major customers of Boeing and between them have more than 440 Boeing jets on order, worth tens of billions of dollars. “PURELY COMMERCIAL DECISION” The US restrictions apply to flights originating from 10 airports in countries including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey. The British restrictions do not include the UAE or Qatar but will affect Turkish Airlines and UK-based carriers including British Airways, easyJet and Monarch. A senior Turkish government official questioned the basis for the restrictions, saying airport security in Turkey was no worse than in Europe and that laptops or tablets could still be used to carry explosives even if they are put in the hold. “It appears this decision was made purely on commercial grounds, and it seems it was done to limit the advancements made by Turkish Airlines and by Turkey,” the official told Reuters. Security experts say Washington and London may believe a laptop could disguise a bomb big enough to bring down a plane, warranting extra explosives checks which can be performed on luggage in the hold. Confining any device to checked baggage would also make it harder for a would-be attacker to trigger it, or to position it to bring the plane down. Turkey’s foreign ministry said talks were underway to try to persuade the United States and Britain to exclude Turkish Airlines and Istanbul airport from the ban. Istanbul-based brokerage Unlu&Co said Turkish Airlines and Gulf operators would be hit hardest by the regulations. “(They) have the most to lose from the US ban since they rely on transfer passengers who may need access to laptops and other devices for business reasons and could easily travel via European hubs, like Frankfurt,” it said in a report. Emirates said it would introduce a service letting customers use laptops and tablets until just before they board direct flights to the US from Dubai, and made clear on Thursday that the ban did not apply to its US-bound flights via Europe. The Americas account for 14% of Turkish Airlines revenue, according to the airline’s website, which does not break out figures separately for the United States or Britain. Turkish Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Alaska announced late Wednesday that it will retire the Virgin brand, probably in 2019, adding that name to a list of airline brands including Continental and US Airways that disappeared in the past decade. Launching a new airline takes lots of money and patience—one reason that Virgin America's debut in 2007 was so eye-catching. The other was its hip vibe including mood lighting and young, attractive flight attendants. So when Alaska announced last year that it was buying Virgin for $2.6 billion, it was like asking Virgin customers to trade in their sports car for a minivan—a solid, reliable ride, but not exciting. Alaska Airlines knew it, too. Last June, CEO Brad Tilden held out hope to Virgin fans that he might keep the Virgin America brand, and run it as a separate airline under the same corporate umbrella. Tilden said he believed in "the power of the Virgin America brand, and we don't want to lose all that loyalty." But running an airline within an airline adds complexity and costs. Alaska flies only Boeing jets; Virgin uses Airbus planes. Sometimes a split personality works in the airline business, sometimes it doesn't—remember Ted, by United Airlines? And so Alaska's announcement came as no surprise to people in the business. Still, many will be saddened, particularly in Virgin's home market of California. Richard Branson, the British billionaire whose backing and minority ownership stake made the airline possible, posted a letter on Virgin's website bemoaning that Alaska couldn't find a place for Virgin. "With a lot of things in life, there is a point where we have to let go and appreciate the fact that we had this ride at all," he wrote. Branson added that it remains to be seen how travelers will be affected by the dwindling number of U.S. airlines. Mergers in recent years grounded US Airways, Continental, Northwest, AirTran, and America West. Airfares rose faster than inflation after those mergers, but then they fell in 2015 and 2016 as fuel became cheaper. Virgin America played a role in those lower fares by engaging Southwest Airlines in a price war at Dallas Love Field. Seattle-based Alaska won a bidding war with JetBlue Airways to buy Virgin. The deal will greatly expand Alaska's strength in California. Alaska recently announced it will greatly expand routes from the San Francisco Bay Area. Indianapolis International Airport announced this month that Alaska would offer nonstop daily flights between Indianapolis and San Francisco starting Sept. 26 using Virgin America Airbus planes.

Sure enough, the parent company announced Wednesday that all Virgin America flights will fly under one brand with Alaska Airlines, likely sometime in 2019. But don't despair, Virgin America devotees: Alaska promised that it will keep much of the "flair" that accompanied Virgin flights, including all that free in-flight entertainment, mood lighting and boarding music. Seattle-based Alaska bought Virgin last year in an effort to bust into the California market in a major way and expand well beyond its roots in the Pacific Northwest. The $2.6 billion merger resulted in a combined airline with nearly 1,200 daily flights and 286 aircraft, making it the United States' fifth largest airline. Its new strategy is coming with a major expansion, adding 25 new daily flights out of San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles and San Jose last year. The newly merged airline is pushing ahead with a combined brand that will see significant changes for passengers over the coming years. Its Boeing jets will get all new cabins starting in 2018 with new first and economy class seating. New first class seating will be expanded by 50% on Virgin's Airbus jets (from 8 seats to 12) and is coming in the fourth quarter of 2018. Alaska said it isn't making any changes to the economy seats on Virgin's fleet, which today features in-flight entertainment screens. High speed satellite wi-fi is also being added to the fleet starting with its Boeing 737s starting in fall 2018 with the full fleet outfitted by the end of 2019. It's also making permanent free movies and TV episodes available on streaming to passenger's devices and starting in August seat-back screens will have the same free content. As the integration advances, many of Virgin's signature attributes will fade away. Gone will be Virgin's frequent flyer plan. The airline's signature pink and purple club-like mood lighting will also be a thing of the past, in favor of a new blue hue. And all its front line staff are all getting new uniforms designed by fashion designer Luly Yang, which will roll out in mid-2019 Alaska and Virgin flyers are among the most loyal in U.S. air travel and a final decision on the fate of the acquired carrier was eagerly awaited. But Virgin wasn't likely to stick around forever: Alaska Airlines didn't want to pay license fees on the Virgin brand indefinitely. "While the Virgin America name is beloved to many, we concluded that to be successful on the West Coast we had to do so under one name - for consistency and efficiency, and to allow us to continue to deliver low fares," said Sangita Woerner, Alaska Airlines' vice president of marketing, in a statement. One major decision is still outstanding: The future of Virgin's Airbus fleet. Alaska is a long time Boeing stalwart and an airline spokeswoman said they are still pushing ahead with adding ten new A321neo jets from Airbus in 2017 and 2018. A decision on whether to remain all-Boeing on its Alaska Airlines brand "or move forward with a duel (sic) fleet strategy for future" will come later this year. "Either way, the company will fly a mixed fleet for at least the next 6 years," the spokeswoman said. Painting of Virgin's jets begins in 2018. Copyright 2017 Cable News Network.

The U.S. and British decisions to forbid devices bigger than a cellphone in the cabin on flights from several Middle East and North African states could hit Istanbul particularly hard, after years building up its position as an international hub. More than half of international passengers at Turkish Airlines <THYAO.IS>, which is 49 percent state-owned and serves 247 destinations outside Turkey, are transit customers who could instead travel through Europe or other hubs. Fast-growing Gulf airlines such as Emirates <EMIRA.UL>, Etihad and Qatar Airways, which similarly depend on business-class flyers stopping over in places like Dubai or Doha for far-flung destinations, could also be hit. For Turkey's national carrier, the setback comes as it prepares to relocate to a 10 billion euro ($10.8 billion) third airport in Istanbul, billed by the developer as the world's largest and championed by President Tayyip Erdogan as a megaproject that will cement Turkey's global standing. "The biggest aim of the third airport was to use Istanbul as a hub. But if such security measures become permanent, this could reduce Istanbul's appeal," said Esra Sirinel, a deputy research director at Is Investment and an airline specialist. Istanbul's existing main Ataturk airport is struggling to cope with millions of transit passengers a month. The new airport will initially have the capacity for 90 million passengers when it opens in 2018, but ultimately aims to serve double that and to offer flights to more than 350 destinations. Turkey's pro-government media, which, like Erdogan, often casts the country as a victim of foreign conspiracies, was quick to lambaste the new regulations. "They're afraid of THY (Turkish Airlines)," the Yeni Safak newspaper said in a front-page headline on Thursday, over a simulated image of the new airport glistening in the sun. It cast the move as a plot against Turkey's national carrier. "We need to stop THY," read the headline on fellow pro-government daily Aksam, which claimed U.S. carriers, facing stiff competition from Turkish Airlines and Gulf carriers, had lobbied for the move. Gulf airlines have been battling against a campaign in Washington by U.S. carriers which accuse them of receiving unfair subsidies, charges they deny. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has so far placed more emphasis on the job benefits of building jets for foreign carriers. Gulf carriers and Turkish Airlines are major customers of Boeing <BA.N> and between them have more than 440 Boeing jets on order, worth tens of billions of dollars. "PURELY COMMERCIAL DECISION" The U.S. restrictions apply to flights originating from 10 airports in countries including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey. The British restrictions do not include the UAE or Qatar but will affect Turkish Airlines and UK-based carriers including British Airways <ICAG.L>, easyJet <EZJ.L> and Monarch. A senior Turkish government official questioned the basis for the restrictions, saying airport security in Turkey was no worse than in Europe and that laptops or tablets could still be used to carry explosives even if they are put in the hold. "It appears this decision was made purely on commercial grounds, and it seems it was done to limit the advancements made by Turkish Airlines and by Turkey," the official told Reuters. Security experts say Washington and London may believe a laptop could disguise a bomb big enough to bring down a plane, warranting extra explosives checks which can be performed on luggage in the hold. Confining any device to checked baggage would also make it harder for a would-be attacker to trigger it, or to position it to bring the plane down. Turkey's foreign ministry said talks were underway to try to persuade the United States and Britain to exclude Turkish Airlines and Istanbul airport from the ban. Istanbul-based brokerage Unlu&Co said Turkish Airlines and Gulf operators would be hit hardest by the regulations. "(They) have the most to lose from the U.S. ban since they rely on transfer passengers who may need access to laptops and other devices for business reasons and could easily travel via European hubs, like Frankfurt," it said in a report. Emirates said it would introduce a service letting customers use laptops and tablets until just before they board direct flights to the U.S. from Dubai, and made clear on Thursday that the ban did not apply to its U.S.-bound flights via Europe. The Americas account for 14 percent of Turkish Airlines revenue, according to the airline's website, which does not break out figures separately for the United States or Britain. Turkish Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) Posted: Thursday, March 23, 2017 12:20 pm | Updated: 12:45 pm, Thu Mar 23, 2017. Virgin America will be the latest airline brand to disappear Associated Press | DALLAS (AP) — After months of teasing, Alaska Airlines has bad news for loyal customers of Virgin America — their airline's name is being dumped. Alaska announced late Wednesday that it will retire the Virgin brand, probably in 2019, adding that name to a list including Continental and US Airways that disappeared in the past decade. Launching a new airline takes lots of money and patience — one reason that Virgin America's debut in 2007 was so eye-catching. The other was its hip vibe including mood lighting and young, attractive flight attendants. So when Alaska announced last year that it was buying Virgin for $2.6 billion, it was like asking Virgin customers to trade in their sports car for a minivan — a solid, reliable ride, but not exciting. Alaska Airlines knew it, too. Last June, CEO Brad Tilden held out hope to Virgin fans that he might keep the Virgin America brand, and run it as a separate airline under the same corporate umbrella. Tilden said he believed in "the power of the Virgin America brand, and we don't want to lose all that loyalty." But running an airline within an airline adds complexity and costs. Alaska flies only Boeing jets; Virgin uses Airbus planes. Sometimes a split personality works in the airline business, sometimes it doesn't — remember Ted, by United Airlines? And so Alaska's announcement came as no surprise to people in the business. Still, many will be saddened, particularly in Virgin's home market of California. Richard Branson, the British billionaire whose backing and minority ownership stake made the airline possible, posted a letter on Virgin's website bemoaning that Alaska couldn't find a place for Virgin. "With a lot of things in life, there is a point where we have to let go and appreciate the fact that we had this ride at all," he wrote. Branson added that it remains to be seen how travelers will be affected by the dwindling number of U.S. airlines. Mergers in recent years grounded US Airways, Continental, Northwest, AirTran, and America West. Airfares rose faster than inflation after those mergers, but then they fell in 2015 and 2016 as fuel became cheaper. Virgin America played a role in those lower fares by engaging Southwest Airlines in a price war at Dallas Love Field. Seattle-based Alaska won a bidding war with JetBlue Airways to buy Virgin. The deal will greatly expand Alaska's strength in California. Alaska recently announced it will greatly expand routes from the San Francisco Bay Area. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Nick Ut / AP) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Dallas — After months of teasing, Alaska Airlines has bad news for loyal customers of Virgin America — their airline’s name is being dumped. Alaska announced late Wednesday that it will retire the Virgin brand, probably in 2019, adding that name to a list including Continental and US Airways that disappeared in the past decade. Launching a new airline takes lots of money and patience — one reason that Virgin America’s debut in 2007 was so eye-catching. The other was its hip vibe including mood lighting and young, attractive flight attendants. So when Alaska announced last year that it was buying Virgin for $2.6 billion, it was like asking Virgin customers to trade in their sports car for a minivan — a solid, reliable ride, but not exciting. Alaska Airlines knew it, too. Last June, CEO Brad Tilden held out hope to Virgin fans that he might keep the Virgin America brand, and run it as a separate airline under the same corporate umbrella. Tilden said he believed in “the power of the Virgin America brand, and we don’t want to lose all that loyalty.” But running an airline within an airline adds complexity and costs. Alaska flies only Boeing jets; Virgin uses Airbus planes. Sometimes a split personality works in the airline business, sometimes it doesn’t — remember Ted, by United Airlines? And so Alaska’s announcement came as no surprise to people in the business. Still, many will be saddened, particularly in Virgin’s home market of California. Richard Branson, the British billionaire whose backing and minority ownership stake made the airline possible, posted a letter on Virgin’s website bemoaning that Alaska couldn’t find a place for Virgin. “With a lot of things in life, there is a point where we have to let go and appreciate the fact that we had this ride at all,” he wrote. Branson added that it remains to be seen how travelers will be affected by the dwindling number of U.S. airlines. Mergers in recent years grounded US Airways, Continental, Northwest, AirTran, and America West. Airfares rose faster than inflation after those mergers, but then they fell in 2015 and 2016 as fuel became cheaper. Virgin America played a role in those lower fares by engaging Southwest Airlines in a price war at Dallas Love Field. Seattle-based Alaska won a bidding war with JetBlue Airways to buy Virgin. The deal will greatly expand Alaska’s strength in California. Alaska recently announced it will greatly expand routes from the San Francisco Bay Area. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The U.S. and British decisions to forbid devices bigger than a cellphone in the cabin on flights from several Middle East and North African states could hit Istanbul particularly hard, after years building up its position as an international hub. More than half of international passengers at Turkish Airlines (THYAO.IS), which is 49 percent state-owned and serves 247 destinations outside Turkey, are transit customers who could instead travel through Europe or other hubs. Fast-growing Gulf airlines such as Emirates (EMIRA.UL), Etihad and Qatar Airways, which similarly depend on business-class flyers stopping over in places like Dubai or Doha for far-flung destinations, could also be hit. For Turkey's national carrier, the setback comes as it prepares to relocate to a 10 billion euro ($10.8 billion) third airport in Istanbul, billed by the developer as the world's largest and championed by President Tayyip Erdogan as a megaproject that will cement Turkey's global standing. "The biggest aim of the third airport was to use Istanbul as a hub. But if such security measures become permanent, this could reduce Istanbul's appeal," said Esra Sirinel, a deputy research director at Is Investment and an airline specialist. © REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo FILE PHOTO: Turkish Airlines aircrafts are parked at the Ataturk International airport in Istanbul Istanbul's existing main Ataturk airport is struggling to cope with millions of transit passengers a month. The new airport will initially have the capacity for 90 million passengers when it opens in 2018, but ultimately aims to serve double that and to offer flights to more than 350 destinations. Turkey's pro-government media, which, like Erdogan, often casts the country as a victim of foreign conspiracies, was quick to lambaste the new regulations. "They're afraid of THY (Turkish Airlines)," the Yeni Safak newspaper said in a front-page headline on Thursday, over a simulated image of the new airport glistening in the sun. It cast the move as a plot against Turkey's national carrier. "We need to stop THY," read the headline on fellow pro-government daily Aksam, which claimed U.S. carriers, facing stiff competition from Turkish Airlines and Gulf carriers, had lobbied for the move. Gulf airlines have been battling against a campaign in Washington by U.S. carriers which accuse them of receiving unfair subsidies, charges they deny. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has so far placed more emphasis on the job benefits of building jets for foreign carriers. Gulf carriers and Turkish Airlines are major customers of Boeing (BA.N) and between them have more than 440 Boeing jets on order, worth tens of billions of dollars. "PURELY COMMERCIAL DECISION" The U.S. restrictions apply to flights originating from 10 airports in countries including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey. The British restrictions do not include the UAE or Qatar but will affect Turkish Airlines and UK-based carriers including British Airways (ICAG.L), easyJet (EZJ.L) and Monarch. A senior Turkish government official questioned the basis for the restrictions, saying airport security in Turkey was no worse than in Europe and that laptops or tablets could still be used to carry explosives even if they are put in the hold. "It appears this decision was made purely on commercial grounds, and it seems it was done to limit the advancements made by Turkish Airlines and by Turkey," the official told Reuters. Security experts say Washington and London may believe a laptop could disguise a bomb big enough to bring down a plane, warranting extra explosives checks which can be performed on luggage in the hold. Confining any device to checked baggage would also make it harder for a would-be attacker to trigger it, or to position it to bring the plane down. Turkey's foreign ministry said talks were underway to try to persuade the United States and Britain to exclude Turkish Airlines and Istanbul airport from the ban. Istanbul-based brokerage Unlu&Co said Turkish Airlines and Gulf operators would be hit hardest by the regulations. "(They) have the most to lose from the U.S. ban since they rely on transfer passengers who may need access to laptops and other devices for business reasons and could easily travel via European hubs, like Frankfurt," it said in a report. Emirates said it would introduce a service letting customers use laptops and tablets until just before they board direct flights to the U.S. from Dubai, and made clear on Thursday that the ban did not apply to its U.S.-bound flights via Europe. The Americas account for 14 percent of Turkish Airlines revenue, according to the airline's website, which does not break out figures separately for the United States or Britain. Turkish Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The arguments presented are very…interesting. Both are, perhaps, classic cases of protesting too much. This article, appearing in the New Yorker on Sunday, sets out to tell its readers that there is no such thing as an American “deep state”, repeatedly rubbishing the very idea whilst – at the same time – making a compelling case for the exact opposite. To start off the author, David Remnick, relates a very cheery sounding story about a young man’s transformative journey from junior naval officer to hard-hitting journalist. I shall relate it to you in bullet points, for the sake of brevity: In 1970 junior naval officer Bob Woodward, a Yale graduate and member of the Book and Snake secret society, goes to the White House Situation room. At night. Whilst there, he meets a high-up at the FBI named Mark Felt, an intelligence veteran and long-time loyalist to J. Edgar Hoover. For reasons unknown the two men discuss the career prospects of young Mr Woodward. Mr Felt gives Woodward advice about pursuing “only employment that interests him”. Later that year Woodward leaves the navy, and applies for a job at the Washington Post. He doesn’t get it, thanks to a complete lack of any journalistic experience. He spends a year working at a minor local paper instead, before being hired by the WaPo in 1971. Throughout this time Woodward and his FBI friend are in constant contact, Woodward thinking of Felt as a “career counselor”. Felt confides in Woodward that he sees the Nixon administration as “corrupt, paranoid, and trying to infringe on the independence of the Bureau”. In 1973 Felt, under the alias “Deep Throat”, leaks Woodward information on the Watergate break-in, and – by proxy – brings down the Nixon administration. How does that story read to you? There are unquestionably overtones of Operation Mockingbird, right? Well, I don’t know about you guys, but I’m convinced. Well, not according to Remnick. He tells us the meeting was accidental, the friendship natural, the career advice sincere and the leak opportunistic. He asks the rhetorical question: “Was Deep Throat part of the Deep State?” As if the only logical answer is “no, of course not”, when in truth any answer other than “Yes, almost certainly” shows a level of willful blindness or chronic naivety that probably merits medication. We are expected to believe that a young naval officer, with no previous interest or experience in journalism, takes career advice from a senior FBI agent after one (accidental) meeting, leaves the navy, becomes a reporter, and ultimately acts as a key cog in what amounted to a “soft coup” in the United States. That is patently absurd. As I said before, what is presented as a case against the existence of an American Deep State, makes a very strong argument for both its existence, and its power. Next, Remnick provides us with a little history on “Deep States”: “Deep State” comes from the Turkish derin devlet, a clandestine network, including military and intelligence officers, along with civilian allies, whose mission was to protect the secular order established, in 1923, by the father figure of post-Ottoman Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. It was behind at least four coups, and it surveilled and murdered reporters, dissidents, Communists, Kurds, and Islamists. The Deep State takes a similar form in Pakistan, with its powerful intelligence service, the I.S.I., and in Egypt, where the military establishment is tied to some of the largest business interests in the country. You see, he’s not arguing that Deep State power structures don’t exist – he willingly admits that they do – it’s just that they don’t have them in America. His argument for this is simple…or at least, it probably would be if he were to make one. What he actually DOES is simply describe how deep states work in other countries, and then leave an ellipsis that’s meant to convey “and of course none of that is true in the USA”, when in fact – again – it does the exact opposite. What he does is supply us a short checklist of qualities which define a “Deep State”: Clandestine and secretive Involving military and intelligence officers civilians allies Protecting the status quo coups surveillance assassinations ties to big business interests Does that not sound the least bit familiar to anyone else? The first two are givens that need no explanation. Civilian allies? Well, I would imagine that a planted and/or manipulated journalist would make a good “civilian ally”. Such a person could be used to “leak” information that brings down enemies of the Deep State. Or, indeed, to write clumsy editorials about how the Deep State doesn’t even exist. Protecting the status quo. The protection of “secular order” in Turkey could easily be translated as the protection of the neo-liberal order in the United States. It is essentially a program of protecting those in power from any kind of change. In fact, the way Remnick writes about this mission, it’s almost as if he is arguing that the noble ends justify ignoble means. That’s an interesting subtext to include. Coups, surveillance and assassinations. Turkey’s derin devlet was behind only four coups? That’s a busy morning at the CIA. Surveillance? Well, it has suited the MSM of late to pretend they didn’t tell us all about the level of surveillance we operate under every single day. But we all know. Assassinations? Yes, there are a few famous examples, and a few not so famous. Blowing the President’s head off in the middle of a public square probably counts. Ties to big business? Well Eisenhower admitted that, and warned against it, sixty years ago. Soros Open Society Foundation frequently collaborates with the State Department, as does the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Pentagon’s ties to Boeing and Lockheed Martin are well documented, as is Dick Cheney’s involvement with Halliburton. The list is endless. As an eight-point definition of a “deep state”, America’s power structures certainly seem to stand as a perfect template. Now we come to the good part. The part where Remnick is forced to include a lot of information he’d rather pretend wasn’t true, because – if he didn’t mention it – he would open himself up awful lot of correction and/or ridicule…even more so than he does already. One does not have to be ignorant of the C.I.A.’s abuses—or of history, in general—to reject the idea of an American Deep State. Previous Presidents have felt resistance, or worse, from elements in the federal bureaucracies: Eisenhower warned of the “military-industrial complex”; L.B.J. felt pressure from the Pentagon; Obama’s Syria policy was rebuked by the State Department through its “dissent channel”. You see, there undoubtedly are powerful secretive intelligence organisations with ties to big business and the military. Yes, you can point to the uncontested public record of literally dozens of crimes – both international and domestic – carried out by these agencies (calling coups and wars “abuses”, is craven apologist language). Yes, it’s perfectly true that many Presidents (from both parties) have faced domestic opposition from these agencies, to their eventual ruin in some cases. Yes, some of those President’s – including Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy – have publicly warned against the influence of these unelected actors and agencies…but – BUT – that doesn’t mean America has a “Deep State. Because: …to use the term as it is used in Turkey, Pakistan, or Egypt is to assume that all these institutions constitute part of a subterranean web of common and nefarious purpose. Which begs the response: “And?” For one thing, David, it’s not to assume that, it’s to reason that…based on evidence (including all the evidence you helpfully supply in your article). It was your self-appointed task to provide a counter-argument to this reading of the evidence….and you have failed. Miserably. However, David Remnick is not alone in his ineffectual assertion that “there is no deep state, it just looks like there is”. Further arguments that there are no “secretive military and intelligence collectives” pushing their agendas through “civilian allies”, was published in Salon. It is an editorial on the exact same subject, published on the exact same day, with almost the exact same title. The author, Ryan Bohl, argues (in apparent seriousness) that deep states are definitely real, that Egypt has one, but that American can’t have one…because America and Egypt are different. His assertions that America “doesn’t have a deep state”, would probably hold more water if he displayed any kind of understanding of what the term actually means. Instead he has, in truly Orwellian fashion, redefined the phrase in order to present a counter-argument…and even then barely manages to scrape one together. …a major flaw of the American Deep State theory is that a deep state needs a weak state to survive. I’m not sure where Bohl got this statement from. I suspect he made it up. It means nothing, and is never backed up by any kind of sources, analysis or evidence. It is a baseless factoid, invented to allow the author to use the rhetorical trick of shifting the argument. Having “established” that a Deep State cannot exist within a strong nation, the author no longer has to disprove the deep states existence…but can now focus on proving that America is strong. Unfortunately for him, he is equally bad at this. What does a weak state look like? For one, it’s horrifically ineffective: not a “I can’t believe they made me wait 45 minutes for my driver’s license when there were only six people in front of me” nuisance, but “I can’t believe I had to spend 2 years, $4000, and know an official at the Ministry of Transport via a relative to get my license”-style corruption. It is a state that fails to provide water, electricity, schools, and roads on a vast scale every single day. The logic is obviously terrible. His argument that a deep state can only exist within weak and corrupt infrastructure? A completely unjustifiable a priori assumption. One that is never established with any kind of evidence. …but let’s suppose, for the sake of argument, that he’s right – doesn’t America have a failing infrastructure? Doesn’t America house 20% of all the incarcerated people on the planet? Aren’t many of these people held in corrupt private prisons? Aren’t post-industrial cities falling apart? Didn’t Detroit have no water for weeks at a time? And didn’t Flint have toxic water? Aren’t there roads and bridges crumbling? Didn’t New Orleans flood because of neglected levees? Aren’t their dams crumbling to dust? Have not Salon themselves published two articles in the last month about the collapsing American infrastructure? If a state is labeled “weak” on the quality of its infrastructure and development, then any objective observer would have to accept that America is weak. In many cases it is practically a third world nation. But Bohl has a response: It can seem like the United States has a weak state when you compile the many anecdotes of bad roads, bridges, schools, water supplies, and other creaky public services. But this is misleading: just because you know a lot of stories about a topic doesn’t mean you know anything about its societal scale. You see, much like the deep state, it might seem like America is falling apart…but it’s not really. Just look at the statistics he cites. Of course, these statistics are “indexes”, with a secret formula entirely invented by America-based NGOs who are almost certainly part of the (entirely fictional) American deep state. There is also yet another critical argument against an America deep state: the regular transfer of power. Another flawed argument. The very theory he is arguing against is that the elected officials possess very little power at all, and, as such, power is never transferred. Rather, the puppet is replaced. What frustrates Trump and his allies is not a conspiracy of a CIA/State Department/journalists/Democrats/Obama/Pentagon cabal, agenda-driven to impose some secret world order upon the United States. Rather, they are encountering the hard edges of America’s geopolitical interests. You see, it’s not there is a deep state with an agenda, it’s just that America has concrete, innate “interests” that cannot be threatened by elected officials without encountering massive resistance from the agencies whose job it is to protect these interests. …it is not in America’s interests to align with Russia any more than it has to, especially under the Putin government. So long as Russia has an independent foreign policy, it will be a threat to both NATO and the American-led world order; only bringing its foreign policy into the American-led alliance system will end that condition. It is counter to the unquestioned and never-changing “interests” of the USA to have friendly relations with Russia, so naturally if the elected representatives of the people try to improve those relations, then the CIA/State Dept./FBI/the media and other unelected bodies will work together in opposing those plans. This does not mean America has a deep state. America having geo-political interests that extend beyond the power of the people’s elected officials is NOT evidence of a “deep state”…because? Well… As the deep state accusations grow, it would behoove some to visit Egypt, stay a while, and try to get a driver’s license. That is what a place with a deep state truly feels like. …have you ever tried getting a driver’s license in Cairo? * So two… …wait, did I say two? I meant  three  four  five  six seven. Seven non-members of the non-deep state are so enraged by the idea that people might think the totally fake American deep state might be real, that they accidentally publish seemingly coordinated attacks on the very idea. Under very similar titles. All within the same few days. Citing the same “counter examples” of Egypt and Turkey. All acting with symmetrical umbrage. That’s almost as unlikely as bumping into a senior FBI agent in the White House by chance, taking his off-hand advice about a career change and then accidentally breaking the story that results in the FBI’s removal of a President they perceived as a threat to their influence, when you think about it. Nevermind. I’m just paranoid. America doesn’t have a deep state. It just sometimes really looks like it does.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has so far placed more emphasis on the job benefits of building jets for foreign carriers. Gulf carriers and Turkish Airlines are major customers of Boeing and between them have more than 440 Boeing jets on order, worth tens of billions of dollars. "PURELY COMMERCIAL DECISION" The U.S. restrictions apply to flights originating from 10 airports in countries including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey. The British restrictions do not include the UAE or Qatar but will affect Turkish Airlines and UK-based carriers including British Airways, easyJet and Monarch. A senior Turkish government official questioned the basis for the restrictions, saying airport security in Turkey was no worse than in Europe and that laptops or tablets could still be used to carry explosives even if they are put in the hold. "It appears this decision was made purely on commercial grounds, and it seems it was done to limit the advancements made by Turkish Airlines and by Turkey," the official told Reuters. Security experts say Washington and London may believe a laptop could disguise a bomb big enough to bring down a plane, warranting extra explosives checks which can be performed on luggage in the hold. Confining any device to checked baggage would also make it harder for a would-be attacker to trigger it, or to position it to bring the plane down. Turkey's foreign ministry said talks were underway to try to persuade the United States and Britain to exclude Turkish Airlines and Istanbul airport from the ban. Istanbul-based brokerage Unlu&Co said Turkish Airlines and Gulf operators would be hit hardest by the regulations. "(They) have the most to lose from the U.S. ban since they rely on transfer passengers who may need access to laptops and other devices for business reasons and could easily travel via European hubs, like Frankfurt," it said in a report. Emirates said it would introduce a service letting customers use laptops and tablets until just before they board direct flights to the U.S. from Dubai, and made clear on Thursday that the ban did not apply to its U.S.-bound flights via Europe. The Americas account for 14 percent of Turkish Airlines revenue, according to the airline's website, which does not break out figures separately for the United States or Britain. Turkish Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ($1 = 0.9270 euros) (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

The U.S. and British decisions to forbid devices bigger than a cellphone in the cabin on flights from several Middle East and North African states could hit Istanbul particularly hard, after years building up its position as an international hub. More than half of international passengers at Turkish Airlines, which is 49 percent state-owned and serves 247 destinations outside Turkey, are transit customers who could instead travel through Europe or other hubs. Fast-growing Gulf airlines such as Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways, which similarly depend on business-class flyers stopping over in places like Dubai or Doha for far-flung destinations, could also be hit. For Turkey's national carrier, the setback comes as it prepares to relocate to a 10 billion euro ($10.8 billion) third airport in Istanbul, billed by the developer as the world's largest and championed by President Tayyip Erdogan as a megaproject that will cement Turkey's global standing. "The biggest aim of the third airport was to use Istanbul as a hub. But if such security measures become permanent, this could reduce Istanbul's appeal," said Esra Sirinel, a deputy research director at Is Investment and an airline specialist. Istanbul's existing main Ataturk airport is struggling to cope with millions of transit passengers a month. The new airport will initially have the capacity for 90 million passengers when it opens in 2018, but ultimately aims to serve double that and to offer flights to more than 350 destinations. Turkey's pro-government media, which, like Erdogan, often casts the country as a victim of foreign conspiracies, was quick to lambaste the new regulations. "They're afraid of THY (Turkish Airlines)," the Yeni Safak newspaper said in a front-page headline on Thursday, over a simulated image of the new airport glistening in the sun. It cast the move as a plot against Turkey's national carrier. "We need to stop THY," read the headline on fellow pro-government daily Aksam, which claimed U.S. carriers, facing stiff competition from Turkish Airlines and Gulf carriers, had lobbied for the move. Gulf airlines have been battling against a campaign in Washington by U.S. carriers which accuse them of receiving unfair subsidies, charges they deny.

America” Jan R. Weinberg told Sputnik. The activist explained why the policy, spearheaded by the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, was actually aimed at extensive militarization of the region. © Twitter: RT_America Emailgate: Untold Story of Clinton Foundation's Ties With Defense ContractorsTensions continue to escalate in the Southeast Asian region with the Pentagon resuming its FONOP (Freedom of Navigation Operations) maneuvers in the South China Sea and kicking off the deployment of Lockheed Martin's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea. Needless to say, the recent developments have triggered deep concern in China, viewed by Washington as the US' economic competitor and a geopolitical rival in the region. "Sending the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and its escorts into the South China Sea is an apparent shift from the Obama administration's policies of 'de-escalation' and accommodation towards the People's Republic of China," Grant Newsham, a Senior Research Fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies, remarked in his article for The National Interest. However, it appears that Newsham may very well be mistaken: ex-President Barack Obama's much discussed Pivot to Asia policy and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) have never been aimed at "de-escalation" and "accommodation" toward Beijing. Hillary Clinton's 'Pacific Century' Speaking to Sputnik, founder of "Show Up! America" Jan R. Weinberg referred to Hillary Clinton's America's Pacific Century article for Foreign Policy magazine. "One of the most important tasks of American statecraft over the next decade will therefore be to lock in a substantially increased investment — diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise — in the Asia-Pacific region. The Asia-Pacific has become a key driver of global politics," then Secretary of State Clinton wrote in October 2011. Still, Hillary Clinton failed to mention that Obama's Pivot to Asia actually meant an extensive militarization of the region with the TPP project as the spearhead of this policy. How did it all begin? How US Defense Lobbyists Found Their Way to White House "I'm in this race to tell the lobbyists in Washington that their days of setting the agenda are over. They, they have not funded my campaign, they will not work in my White House," then presidential candidate Barack Obama claimed back in 2007. However, it turned out later that the statement was "nothing less than sheer hypocrisy," Weinberg stressed. "For example, President Obama, very early in his administration, gave the 'Revolving Door' a spin by nominating William J. Lynn, III, to serve as the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, knowing full well of Mr. Lynn's position as a lobbyist with Raytheon, a prestigious US defense contractor," he said. But that is not all. "Obama opened the door to defense contractor CEOs by including them on the President's Export Council and the President's Council on Jobs & Competitiveness, while they also served on the professional association known as the Business Roundtable, which is a very influential lobbying organization in its own right," Weinberg told Sputnik. © AP Photo/ Pablo Martinez Monsivais House of Cards: Is Assange Right About Hillary Clinton's Plot Against Trump?The Business Roundtable (BR) is an association of chief executive officers of leading US companies and, among other things, a lobbying organization. "The Roundtable, which is now comprised of 192 CEOs, is one of the most prominent lobbying groups in Washington, D.C. In 2015, the group spent $19.3 million on lobbying, making it the eighth-biggest spender that year," Fortune reported in December 2016. One would be apparently surprised to know that Boeing CEO James McNerney, the Business Roundtable Chairman, served at the same time as a member of the President's Export Council, whose main purpose was to advise on trade agreements, under Obama. Likewise, the other two BR representatives, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt, served as members of the President's Export Council and Council on Jobs & Competitiveness, respectively. © REUTERS/ Jonathan Ernst US President Barack Obama attends the East Asia Summit in Vientiane, Laos September 8, 2016 Why US Military-Industrial Complex Pushed Ahead With TPP There is yet another thing that united them: it's their strong interest in the implementation of the TPP project and Trade Promotion Authority (also known as Fast Track) reauthorization, Weinberg pointed out. The Fast Track authority expanded the President's powers to negotiate the trade deals; yet by the same stroke diminishing the powers of Congress as described by the Constitution. "The Business Roundtable had been vociferously involved with promulgating information about the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) based on their corporate member's interests, notably through their initiative Trade Benefits America Coalition and other extensive lobbying efforts," Weinberg revealed. Curiously enough, US media coverage has been void of the Business Roundtable, their Trade Benefits America Coalition and their relationship with TPP, he highlighted. "Perhaps it has become the new-normal, though little noticed by the American public — by design the defense contractors and ex-military-turned-lobbyists reached the top echelons within the Obama administration, both as advisors on international trade agreements such as the TPP, as well as serving, for example, within the Department of Defense," Weinberg remarked. © AP Photo/ Lee Jin-man US' Urge to Get Rid of N Korea Could Destabilize Asia-Pacific RegionThe question arises as to why US prominent defense contractors were so enthusiastic about the TPP enactment. The answer is on the surface, according to Weinberg: Obama's Pivot to Asia plan envisaged bolstering weapons deployment to many Asia-Pacific nations and the US military-industrial complex was expecting to benefit from it. "Defense investment across Asia is expected to continue to grow strongly over the next decade, as sovereign nations seek to modernize defense capabilities in the face of increasing regional threats," Hewson said at the 2016 Lockheed Martin Media Day on March 15, 2016, citing "China's aggressive military build-up and maritime claims, and North Korea's increasingly unpredictable actions." "Once approved, the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement will be a cornerstone of US economic policy in the region, and is expected to increase economic ties and the region's importance in years to come," she stressed. © Twitter: RT_America WikiLeaks Logo and Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton's Emails Still Spark Questions In his previous interview with Sputnik, Weinberg shed light on the Clinton Foundation's cooperation with the US omnipotent military-industrial complex. At the same time, Hillary Clinton, a longstanding "Pivot to Asia" propagator, worked hand in hand with major US defense contractors. "Through Obama's President's Export Council assignments, James McNerney of Boeing and Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin (both defense contractors) gained unfettered access to President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter and Michael Froman the United States Trade Representative. Collectively they all promoted the TPP as an essential component of Obama's overarching foreign policy initiatives known as the Pivot to Asia of which armament sales and the forward deployment of US military assets, as they professed, were an essential part of the US and allied Asia-Pacific nations 'National Security Interests'," Weinberg explained, speaking to Sputnik Wednesday.  One would think that the ongoing "tit-for-tat" arms escalations throughout the entire Indo-Asia-Pacific region would serve as a cataclysmic warning, he believes. "In my opinion, despite unequivocal admonishments from China and North Korea, the expanded military cooperation agreement with Indonesia, the present deployment of the THAAD missile battery to South Korea, the most recent $1.83 billion of arms sales to Taiwan, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to "reinterpret" Article 9 of the Japanese constitution which previously prohibited offensive military engagement, the lifting of the US arms embargo against Vietnam, and the expansion of US military bases in the Philippines, were all preplanned militarization aspects of the Obama administration's Pivot to Asia which from the point of view of the defense contractors serves their business interests perfectly well," Weinberg told Sputnik. As the founder of "Show Up! America" noted in his February interview, Clinton's emails recently obtained by the FBI, as well as those which apparently remain stored in Boeing and GE's data centers, could have apparently raised the alarm and drawn public attention to this problem. Now he expresses growing concerns that the truth may never find its way out. Trump and Obama's Legacy: Here We Go Again © AP Photo/ Carolyn Kaster 'Lock Her Up': Untold Story of Hillary Clinton's Disgrace in HaitiAlthough during his presidential campaign Donald Trump had repeatedly promised to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton's email case, it seems that Trump has changed his mind, Weinberg assumed. He called attention to the fact that the State Department lawyers have recently dismissed conservative watchdog Judicial Watch's request to disclose the rest of Clinton's emails. Meanwhile, influential defense contractors have again filled the new administration's councils and got positions in the government's departments. "I doubt that Boeing or GE will ever turn the emails over even if there are court ordered subpoenas compelling them to do so," Weinberg said, "Even if the emails are turned over, at first, only members of Congress and the FBI who have the proper security clearances will be privy to them under the auspices that general knowledge of the contents would be a risk to our national security interests." Given this, it is highly unlikely that Obama's good old "Pivot to Asia" policy will undergo any significant changes, regardless of the fact that Trump ripped the TPP deal up. "It is doubtful that the entirety of the present day United States government; President Trump, the Congress, nor the Pentagon will heed the further warnings related to the Arms Race as professed by China. As far as the American public is concerned, in no small part due to their apathy, as a whole they remain in the dark on such issues," Weinberg remarked. He also warned that the military-industrial complex is pushing the US toward yet another missile crisis, this time in the Asia-Pacific region. "The American Missile Crisis may very well become the term that historians use to describe the precipitously dangerous, present day, militarization and terrorism issues within the Indo-Asia-Pacific region — should we be fortunate enough, in the unlikely event that we pull back from the brink-of-war," he concluded.

Aeroplanes have metal shells that prevent passengers being affected by lightning Lizzie Porter, Travel writer 23 March 2017 • 3:30pm It’s the moment you’ve never been waiting for. You're tucked up under your airline blanket, nose in book, when, suddenly, a flash of bright light streaks through the aeroplane. You – well, the plane with you in it – has been struck by lightning. But do you need to panic, brace, or reach for a lifejacket? An incident this week, in which a Virgin Atlantic plane was struck by lightning after taking off from Gatwick, would suggest not. Yes, the aircraft had to return to the airport for a safety check, after dumping fuel, but the aircraft landed normally. Lightning strikes close to a plane's wing Credit: GETTY So what actually happens when lightning hits an aeroplane, and why are they not seriously damaged? Typically, a bolt will hit an extremity, such as a wing tip, or the nose, and the current will travel through the aeroplane’s metal shell before leaving from another point – the tail, for example. And, according to Patrick Smith, pilot and author of Cockpit Confidential, a book on “everything you need to know about air travel”, planes are hit by lightning far more frequently than you might think. How and why do planes dump fuel? “An individual jet liner is struck about once every two years, on average”, and aeroplanes are designed accordingly. “Once in a while there’s exterior damage – a superficial entry or exit wound – or minor injury to the plane’s electrical systems, but a strike typically leaves little or no evidence.” You might not even notice it, he says. Professor Mamu Haddad, professor and director at Cardiff University's Morgan-Botti Lightning Laboratory, which works on understanding lightning strikes on aeroplane construction materials, explains further. The confessions of an airline pilot Modern aircraft, he says, are made from lightweight carbon composite covered with a thin layer of copper – Dreamliners and Boeing Airbus A350s have this construction – and act as very good Faraday Cages, meaning that the space inside the metal (ie where you’re sitting) – is protected from electric currents. Most important, he adds, is that the fuel tanks in the wings are not exposed to any lightning sparks – hence why the surrounding metal, structural joints, access doors, vents and fuel filler caps must be able to withstand any burning from a bolt of lightning, which can have temperatures of up to 30,000C. Strikes are most likely to happen when a jet is passing through cumulonimbus (storm) clouds, between two and five kilometres (6,500-16,500 feet) from the ground. And, like Patrick Smith, Prof Haddad says that fliers need not be concerned. A storm erupts as a plane comes into land in Nice Airport Credit: GETTY “Lightning can be up to 200,000 amps – at a low current people might hear noise, or see a flash of light through the window, but they won’t feel anything," he said. "One effect on the aircraft body might be some local melting, where the lightning struck, but the aerospace industry is highly conservative, and testing so rigorous, that passengers aren’t at risk.” Rare though they may be, there have been a few fatal incidents involving lightning strikes, however. In January 2014, four charred bodies were reportedly pulled from plane wreckage in Indonesia after a light aircraft owned by Intan Angkasa Air was hit by lightning and crashed. Bambang Ervan, an Indonesian transport ministry spokesman, confirmed to an Australian news site that all four people on board the aircraft were killed instantly. In 2010, two people were killed when a Boeing 737-700 from Bogota was struck by lightning and split into three pieces as it landed at San Andres island in the Caribbean. At the time, aeronautical specialists explained that the lightning alone was unlikely to be the cause of the accident, but combined with a sharp change in wind direction, or an air pocket linked to lightning when a plane is near the ground, it could cause a crash. secrets of air travel Another serious case, resulting in 81 deaths, happened in 1963, when a lightning strike over Maryland caused a wing to explode on a Boeing 707 flown by Pan Am. The Federal Aviation Administration, the US equivalent of the Civil Aviation Authority, subsequently introduced changes to fuel tanks and discharge wicks aboard all aircraft. But non-fatal incidents are far more common, thanks largely to modern safety measures. Famous cases include the flight taken by François Hollande, the French President, to crucial talks with Angela Merkel in Germany in 2012. The presidential Falcon 7X was struck by lightning just four minutes into the flight; Mr Hollande eventually arrived in Berlin 90 minutes late, on a different plane. Patrick Smith remembers having a close encounter with lighting when he was at the helm of a 37-seat aeroplane. Incredibly only two died in this lightning-related incident in Bogota Credit: GETTY “Lightning from a tiny embedded cumulonimbus cell got us on the nose," he told Telegraph Travel. “What we felt and heard was little more than a dull flash and a thud. No warning lights flashed, no generators tripped off line. Our conversation went: ‘What was that?’ ‘I don’t know.’ ‘Lightning?’ ‘Might have been.’ Mechanics would later find a black smudge on the forward fuselage.” In other words, an incident is likely to be over in a flash, literally, leaving passengers on board to get back to that in-flight film. It’s often those on the next flight who could be delayed, as the plane undergoes post-lightning safety checks.

The Dubai-based carrier will deploy the Airbus Group SE jet on daily services to Nice Cote d’Azur Airport as of July 1, providing a 44 percent capacity boost compared with the Boeing Co. 777-300ER that’s currently used, it said in a statement Thursday. The Emirates announcement comes a week after Abu Dhabi-based rival Etihad Airways said it would use an A380 for one of its two daily Paris services during the peak July 1 to Oct. 28 period after an upsurge in demand. Travel to France fell amid a series of attacks that began in 2015, with hotel bookings in Nice slumping 30 percent in immediate aftermath of the July 14 deaths. Nice airport has upgraded its boarding bridge and juggled operations to accommodate the double-decker, Dominique Thillaud, its president, said in the release, while Emirates Chief Commercial Officer Thierry Antinori predicted that deployment of the A380 will provide a further boost to visitor numbers. Emirates will also provide a helicopter link to Monaco through a partnership local operator Monacair. The service will be complimentary for first-class passengers and cost 79 euros ($85) for those traveling business class and 109 euros for customers in coach. The Persian Gulf giant first flew to Nice in 1994 and transported more than 200,000 people on the route last year. Demand on its U.S.-bound services may come under pressure following a federal government edict banning passengers from carrying laptops, tablet computers and other large electronic devices into the aircraft cabin.

A single TILE thruster engine brings together 36 thruster chips. Credit: Accion Systems CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A new propulsion engine with dime-size thrusters could be used to propel a host of spacecraft, from small satellites to crewed ships designed for interplanetary exploration. The new propulsion engine, called TILE, which stands for Tiled Ionic Liquid Electrospray, could serve as an efficient and lightweight way to keep constellations of small satellites in orbit. Spaceflight companies — including OneWeb, Boeing and SpaceX — want to launch hundreds of thousands of these small satellites to provide broadband internet to everyone around the globe. And because several TILEs can be connected to produce more power, the engine has the potential to propel astronauts to Mars, according to Accion Systems, the company that designed TILE. "Our technology starts on a nanometer scale, and then we can array that and scale that up to serve satellites," said Natalya Bailey, CEO of Accion Systems. Bailey described the propulsion engine to an audience here at the New Space Age Conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Sloan School of Management on March 11. [Superfast Spacecraft Propulsion Concepts (Images)] Bailey developed the underlying propulsion system with Accion co-founder Louis Perna while they were Ph.D. students at MIT. The TILE engine uses a method called ionic liquid electrospray propulsion. The system draws from a decades-old technology for thrusting satellites, called electric propulsion, which uses electromagnetic fields to shoot charged atoms, or ions, out the back of a satellite to push it forward.  But these engines, known as Hall-effect thrusters, have some major downsides. First, they use compressed-gas propellants that have to be stored in large, pressurized containers. Hall thrusters also require electric power in a couple of different places, first to charge the particles to create an ionized gas, and then to accelerate that plasma to propel the satellite. All of these things add bulk and weight to the engines, which make them way too big to serve as propulsion systems for small satellites, Bailey said. And thanks to the laws of plasma physics, the engines are just plain impossible to shrink down.  "Essentially, you end up running into some problems with really hot electrons and melting the device," she said.

Credit: Accion Systems In contrast, the TILE's ionic liquid electrospray propulsion system has more in common with a computer chip than a huge, bespoke engine, Bailey said. In fact, Accion calls the dime-size propulsion device a "thruster chip." It's made of hundreds of emitters that produce beams of ions generated from a nontoxic and nonexplosive propellant that's a salt-based solution.  An array of 36 thruster chips make up the outward-facing surface of a TILE module, which measures about 4 inches by 4 inches by 5 inches (10 by 10 by 12.5 cm) — about the size of a grapefruit. Beneath the top layer of the module are other components stacked in a particular order, including the salt-based propellant, which is stored in tiny tanks, and the system's power electronics, which run off of the satellites' solar panels and batteries. When the power is on, the battery creates an electric field that draws ions up from the salty propellant and pulls them through the tanks to the thruster chips, which funnel them into a beam and eject them for propulsion. An illustration of the microscopic thrusters in an Accion Systems thruster chip. Credit: Accion Systems One to four TILEs could propel a small satellite weighing anywhere from 100 to 440 lbs. (50 to 200 kilograms), Bailey said. Arranging more modules together in a larger array could steer larger satellites, without the added bulk, she added. Bailey and Perna founded Accion Systems in 2014 to commercialize the Til technology. In 2015, the company received a $3 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to develop their technology. This summer, the company will test the TILE to see how well it can withstand temperature extremes, the vacuum of space, and the shock and vibration of a launch.  After it passes those tests, Accion plans to integrate a TILE with a customer satellite, Bailey said. "We're definitely going to space," she added.  In another 10 to 15 years, Accion Systems hopes to have the technology refined to make the long journey to Mars. According to the company's estimates, if a crewed spacecraft were to rely on conventional engines, the journey would require so much fuel that the ship would have to support 4,000 Hall thrusters. The fuel tanks alone would equal the size of the International Space Station. But if the trip were made using Accion's TILE propulsion, the engine and fuel system would take up the space of shoebox, Bailey said.

Claimed to be the 'world's fastest civil aircraft ever made', the XB-1 Supersonic Demonstrator is due to take off on its first test flight later this year and could take passengers from London to New York in 3.5 hours, its maker claims. The company said the jet, which will cost more than $200 million (£160 million) to build, may carry passengers by the early 2020s. A futuristic supersonic passenger airliner has got the funding it needs to take off on a test flight later this year. Boom Supersonic said it received $33million (£26million) in funding and was ready to build its XB-1 jet prototype  XB-1 SUPERSONIC DEMONSTRATOR SPECS  - Crew: Two (pilot + optional flight test engineer or passenger) - Length: 68 feet (20m) - Wingspan: 17 feet (5.2m) - Maximum Takeoff Weight: 13,500 lb (6,120kg) - Powerplant: 3X General Electric J85-21, non-afterburning; proprietary variable-geometry intake and exhaust  - Aerodynamics: Chine, refined delta wing with swept trailing edge - Cruise: Mach 2.2 (1,451mph, 2,335 km/h)  - Nose Temperature: 307°F (345°F on ISA+20 day) - Range: > 1,000 nautical miles (1852km) The subsonic flight test will be conducted near Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California in partnership with Virgin Galactic's The Spaceship Company.  The prototype was unveiled in November at Centennial Airport in Denver. The XB-1 is a technically representative ⅓-scale version of the future Boom Airliner.  'I have long been passionate about aerospace innovation and the development of high-speed commercial flights,' said Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group.  'As an innovator in space, Virgin Galactic's decision to work with Boom was an easy one.' The airline tycoon has confirmed that Virgin has options to buy 10 of the recently revealed supersonic Boom jets, which will be capable of flying at 1,451mph (2,335 km/h) - about 100mph (160km/h) faster than Concorde - and reaching New York from London in three and a half hours.  'Sixty years after the dawn of the jet age, we're still flying at 1960s speeds,' said Blake Scholl, a former Amazon executive and CEO and founder of Boom. 'Concorde's designers didn't have the technology for affordable supersonic travel, but now we do. 'Today, we're proud to unveil our first aircraft as we look forward to its first flight.'

The Boom jet was created by top aviation experts with collective experience working at NASA, SpaceX and Boeing. Learning from the Concorde, they combined advanced aerodynamics, efficient engine technology and new composite materials to produce a 'safe and affordable' supersonic aircraft 2.6 times faster than current jetliners. The prototype has been subjected to more than 1,000 simulated wind tunnel tests and features a tapered carbon fibre fuselage, and efficient turbofan jet engines.  Unlike Concorde, the Boom design requires no afterburner, which should significantly improve fuel efficiency. In March, Virgin told MailOnline Travel: 'Richard has long expressed interest in developing high speed flight and building high-speed flight R&D through Virgin Galactic and our manufacturing organisation, The Spaceship Company. 'We can confirm that The Spaceship Company will provide engineering, design and manufacturing services, flight tests and operations and that we have an option on the first 10 airframes. It is still early days and just the start of what you'll hear about our shared ambitions and efforts.' Scholl said: 'We're thrilled to be working with Virgin. It's hard to imagine a better partner for bringing supersonics to market.' When created Boom will have 45 seats - with a ticket costing $5,000 (£4,020). Speaking to Bloomberg earlier this year, Scholl said: 'The idea is for a plane that goes faster than any other passenger plane built before, but for the same price as business class.'  According to the simulations, Boom's design is quieter and 30 per cent more efficient than the Concorde. It will be split into two single-seat rows, so everybody has a window and an aisle. To reduce weight, the seats are of the standard domestic first-class variety, so no lay-down beds. To cut flight time, Boom's plane will cruise at 60,000 feet, where passengers will be able to see the curvature of the earth, while going 2.6 times faster than other passenger planes. Scholl said about 500 routes fit the craft's market, including a five-hour trip from San Francisco to Tokyo and a six-hour flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. The firm hopes London to New York could be one of its most popular routes, with a 3.6 hour saving on a normal flight A concept image shows what the interior of the Boom passenger jet could look like. Test flights of the first subscale prototypes begin in late 2017 A concept drawing shows what the interior of the futuristic passenger jet could look like - all passengers would have a seat that sits both on the window and the aisle Created by aerospace company Boom, the jet nicknamed 'Baby Boom' could pave the way for the larger Boom passenger jet (pictured) and usher in a new era of affordable supersonic travel  A mock-up of the craft at Heathrow - its founders hope it will use existing airports once tests are complete 'Boom was founded on the philosophy that we need to overcome the challenges to supersonic passenger flight, not surrender to them,' the firm says. The firm hopes London to New York could be one of its most popular routes, with a 3.6 hour saving on a normal flight. The firm even has record breaking US Astronaut Scott Kelly as an adviser. It added: 'We're making a supersonic aircraft affordable for business travel. Our ultimate goal is routine supersonic flight for everyone.'  Scholl said about 500 routes fit the craft's market, including a five-hour trip from San Francisco to Tokyo and a six-hour flight from Los Angeles to Sydney The first test flights will occur at Centennial Airport in Denver, with supersonic testing near Edwards Air Force Base in California  'Today, international travel means jet-lag and days of lost productivity and family time. But imagine leaving New York in the morning, making afternoon meetings in London, and being home to tuck your kids into bed. 'Unlike Concorde, flying Boom is affordable - the same price as business class,' said Boom. THE ICON THAT FLEW PASSENGERS FROM LONDON TO NEW YORK IN 3.5 HOURS Concorde was a turbojet-powered supersonic passenger jet that was operated until 2003.  It had a maximum speed over twice the speed of sound at Mach 2.04 (1,354 mph or 2,180 k per hour at cruise altitude) and could seat 92 to 128 passengers. It was first flown in 1969, but needed further tests to establish it as viable as a commercial aircraft. Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued flying for the next 27 years.  The aircraft is regarded by many as an aviation icon and an engineering marvel, but it was also criticized for being uneconomical, lacking a credible market, and consuming more fuel to carry fewer passengers than a Boeing 747 Twenty aircraft were built including six prototypes and development aircraft It is one of only two supersonic transports to have been operated commercially.  The other is the Soviet-built Tupolev Tu-144, which ran for a much shorter period of time before it was grounded and retired due to safety and budget issues. Concorde was jointly developed and manufactured by Aérospatiale and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty.  Concorde's name, meaning harmony or union, reflects the cooperation on the project between the United Kingdom and France.  In the UK, any or all of the type are known simply as 'Concorde', without an article.  Twenty aircraft were built including six prototypes and development aircraft. Air France (AF) and British Airways (BA) each received seven aircraft.  The research and development failed to make a profit and the two airlines bought the aircraft at a huge discount. Among other destinations, Concorde flew regular transatlantic flights from London Heathrow and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to New York-JFK, Washington Dulles and Barbados. It flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners.  Over time, the aircraft became profitable when it found a customer base willing to pay for flights on what was for most of its career the fastest commercial airliner in the world. The aircraft is regarded by many as an aviation icon and an engineering marvel, but it was also criticized for being uneconomical, lacking a credible market, and consuming more fuel to carry fewer passengers than a Boeing 747. Concorde was retired in 2003 due to a general downturn in the commercial aviation industry after the type's only crash in 2000, the September 11 attacks in 2001, and a decision by Airbus, the successor to Aérospatiale and BAC, to discontinue maintenance support. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Beauty contestant barely contains anger at losing competition Watch video IRS scammer gets pranked after telling Cop he's going to jail Watch video Dashcam captures gun-wielding woman being run over by police Watch video Plates thrown as almighty fight breaks out during get-together Watch video Video of woman having drug overdose goes viral Watch video Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban arrive into Sydney with their children Watch video Ed Sheeran forgets his own lyrics in live Red Nose Day performance Watch video Madonna shows off her twin daughters and their new Barbie dolls Watch video Iggy Azalea twerks famed posterior to promote Mo Bounce single Watch video Mooove!

It happened during a windstorm during which gusts of near 70 miles per hour were reported. One person suffered a minor injury onboard the plane.  READ: How March winds knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people across southern Michigan The team was on its way to play in the Big Ten tournament. Their trip was delayed until the next morning.  STORY: Michigan basketball team 'a little banged up' after plane accident Here's the latest from the NTSB: The National Transportation Safety Board issued an investigative update for the March 8, 2017, rejected takeoff and runway excursion at Willow Run Airport, Ypsilanti, Michigan. All 109 passengers and seven crewmembers evacuated Ameristar Air Cargo Inc., flight 9363 via escape slides after the Boeing MD-83 came to rest about 1,000 feet past the end of runway 23L.  One passenger sustained a minor injury during the evacuation. This update does not provide probable cause for the accident and does not contain analysis of information collected thus far in the NTSB’s ongoing investigation. As such, no conclusions regarding the cause of the incident should be made from this preliminary information. Parties to the investigation include the Federal Aviation Administration, The Boeing Company and Ameristar Air Cargo, Inc. Both pilots held airline transport pilot certificates with DC-9-series type ratings (this rating includes the MD-83). The pilot-in-command, who was the Ameristar chief pilot, was in the right seat and was providing differences training to the captain, who was in the left seat and was the pilot flying the aircraft. The Ameristar chief pilot had 9,660 total flight hours, with 2,462 hours in DC 9 series airplanes. The captain (flying pilot) had 15,518 total flight hours, with 8,495 hours in DC-9-series airplanes. (In this NTSB graphic, one of two elevators of the MD-83 involved in the March 8, 2017, rejected takeoff and runway excursion at Willow Run Airport, Ypsilanti, Michigan, is diagrammed. The elevators are the primary means of controlling the airplane’s pitch.) Post-accident examination revealed movement of the control column in the cockpit appeared normal; the control columns were free to move, and the elevator control tabs moved as commanded. However, when investigators tried to move the elevator surfaces by hand, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator was jammed in a trailing edge-down position (airplane nose down). Upon further inspection, the right elevator geared tab inboard pushrod linkage was found damaged which restricted movement of the right elevator surface but allowed movement of the control tab. After the damaged components were removed, the elevator could be moved by hand. (This March 10, 2017, NTSB image depicts the displaced inboard elevator geared tab linkage, highlighted by the arrow, from Ameristar Air Cargo Inc., flight 9363.  The red piece of metal is included in the image for reference only an is not part of the elevator system). Examination of the flight data recorder data indicates that during the taxi and take-off roll, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator did not move. During takeoff roll, the left elevator began a large airplane nose-up movement (consistent with rotation) at an airspeed of about 152 knots and continued for five seconds to about 166 knots. There was no change in the airplane pitch attitude during this time. The airplane data then are consistent with the takeoff being rejected. The maximum recorded airspeed was about 173 knots. Review of previous flight data showed normal movement of both the left and right elevator surfaces.  The airplane flew to Ypsilanti two days before the accident. The flight and cabin crewmembers indicated in post-accident statements that all slides except for the forward right door deployed correctly. The slide was removed from the airplane and will be examined by investigators at a future date. No further updates are planned for this investigation. The docket for the investigation will be opened to the public prior to release of the final report. NTSB investigations generally take 12 to 18 months to complete. The preliminary report for the investigation is available online at https://go.usa.gov/xXkXx.

But what if robotic software and devices could actually make employees better at their job? COMMENT Better data, smarter devices, and customised sensors can all help drive efficiency at work. Better productivity may help human workers hang onto important jobs for longer and fight off the threat of being replaced by bots Nick Ismail Robotics and automation are already rife in the auto industry with BMW employees having already started using hi-tech gloves that let them shave off valuable seconds on scanning items with both hands. The German car giant suggest that when you add up all the workers and the collective amount of time saved it’s close to 66 hours every day. The gloves are more than just time savers. They help workers identify the right parts and handle them appropriately. The $1,300 gloves are being tested by other car manufacturers such as Audi and Skoda. The US and the UK lose millions of work hours and billions of dollars every year simply due to sick leave and minor injuries. If smart tech can make the workplace a little safer and more efficient, the aggregate value added would make a huge difference. >See also: How robots in the workplace will change organisational culture Some tech firms are also building belts and devices that support workers as they try to lift heavy objects. Injuries from lifting objects cost US businesses more than $70 billion last year alone. Smart devices like this can help reduce the chance of injury. A great example of this is that cutting edge support systems have drastically reduced lifting related injuries. Meanwhile, Boeing, the aerospace manufacturing giant, has been experimenting with Google Glass to assist technicians while they fix complex wiring systems that are found in their aircraft. A specially designed app allows technicians to identify, cut, and attach the right wires.  Boeing says this has reduced the rate of errors and the time fixing wires by 25%. Smart fleet management software is helping to keep drivers safe as they transport goods across the country. Smart sensors built into vans and trucks can detect odd behaviour from drivers and flag up collision risks on the road. Not only does this make the driver more alert but it can also help fleet management companies reduce the cost of insurance. >See also: Robots could replace 250,000 public sector workers by 2030 Companies have been handing out fitness trackers and calorie counters to help employees stay healthy. Wellness programs have been taking advantage of all the tech and data now available to reduce the rates of absenteeism. IT giant Oracle, for example, regularly organises stress workshops that have helped the company save more than $1m in absenteeism-related costs. Better data, smarter devices, and customised sensors can all help drive efficiency at work. Better productivity may help human workers hang onto important jobs for longer and fight off the threat of being replaced by bots. Technology has already transformed the way people live and communicate. It’s time it started transforming work as well.

Photographer: Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg Malaysia Airlines Bhd. plans to seal deals for as many as 42 wide-body jets over the next few months as the unprofitable carrier seeks to rebuild its long-haul network following a surge in demand. Terms should be agreed in the next six to eight weeks for the lease of up to a dozen used Airbus Group SE A330 or Boeing Co. 777 aircraft, Chief Executive Officer Peter Bellew said in an interview. That could be followed later in the first half by an order for 25 to 30 new Boeing 787s or A330neos, as the upgraded Airbus model is known, potentially worth more than $7 billion. Bellew is looking to expand wide-body operations after Malaysia Air slashed its fleet and route network in response to a bookings slump that followed two fatal plane crashes in 2014. Sales have now recovered to the extent that the carrier posted an 81 percent load factor in the fourth quarter of 2016, including a 90 percent occupancy rate in December, when it made money. “Things have gone a bit better a bit quicker than I expected,” said Bellew, an Irishman who became Malaysia Air CEO last July after joining as chief operating officer in 2015, following nine years at Dublin-based discount specialist Ryanair Holdings Plc. “We’re ahead of where we hoped we would be.” The Asian carrier needs the leased jets mainly to replace single-aisle Boeing 737s on 10 or 11 medium-haul routes that are capable of supporting wide-bodies, including services to India, Bali and Hong Kong, Bellew said. The plan has become attractive after hire rates fell 15 percent in 3 1/2 months, he said. China Growth Malaysian Air is also rapidly adding new routes to China, with nine due this year and another eight in 2018, taking the total to 24. The expansion, part of a plan to make Malaysia a top destination for Chinese tourists, reflects a recovery in bookings that collapsed after the disappearance of Flight MH370 while en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. Bellew said he’ll seek to take half a dozen leased wide-bodies in the first half of next year, followed by the same number in 2019, all about six years old. A330s would be the obvious choice, though 777s would allow the carrier to add longer routes, perhaps reinstating a service to Amsterdam, he said. The 25 or more new jets that Bellew is evaluating would likely be bought direct from Airbus or Boeing and would join the fleet between 2019 and 2023, with 15 replacing older aircraft and the rest for expansion. The re-engined A330neo comes in two sizes advertised at $255 million and $291 million before discounts, while the 787 Dreamliner has three variants priced between $225 million and $306 million. The airline is also poised to take delivery of six Airbus A350 wide-bodies, allowing it to move the same number of A380 superjumbos to a new sister carrier specializing in carrying people on the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages. 720 Seats With A350 handovers delayed by a shortage of interior fittings at Airbus, the first plane is due a couple of months late in November or December, Bellew said. All should arrive by June 2018, after which the A380s will be refitted to allow their capacity to be varied between 635 and 720 seats, with the airline commencing operations in December of that year.

Sign Up Dubbed Project Hope, the startup has yet to be given a permanent name, though most of its management team will be approved at a board meeting next week, Bellew said, adding that a CEO has yet to be chosen but will almost certainly be a Malaysian national. Long-term support deals have been struck with Airbus and engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and that could extend to investment in the venture next year, he said. Malaysia Air had a loss last year that was less than half the internal forecast, it said March 1, and aims to reduce the deficit by more than half this year before becoming “consistently profitable” from 2018.

Alaska announced in 2016, that it was buying Virgin, but CEO Brad Tilden held out hope to Virgin fans that he might keep the Virgin America brand, and run it and Alaska as separate airlines under the same corporate umbrella. DALLAS >> After months of teasing, Alaska Airlines has bad news for loyal customers of Virgin America — their airline’s name is being dumped. Alaska announced late Wednesday that it will retire the Virgin brand, probably in 2019, adding that name to a list including Continental and US Airways that disappeared in the past decade. Launching a new airline takes lots of money and patience — one reason that Virgin America’s debut in 2007 was so eye-catching. The other was its hip vibe including mood lighting and young, attractive flight attendants. So when Alaska announced last year that it was buying Virgin for $2.6 billion, it was like asking Virgin customers to trade in their sports car for a minivan — a solid, reliable ride, but not exciting. Alaska Airlines knew it, too. Last June, CEO Brad Tilden held out hope to Virgin fans that he might keep the Virgin America brand, and run it as a separate airline under the same corporate umbrella. Tilden said he believed in “the power of the Virgin America brand, and we don’t want to lose all that loyalty.” But running an airline within an airline adds complexity and costs. Alaska flies only Boeing jets; Virgin uses Airbus planes. Sometimes a split personality works in the airline business, sometimes it doesn’t — remember Ted, by United Airlines? And so Alaska’s announcement came as no surprise to people in the business. Still, many will be saddened, particularly in Virgin’s home market of California. Richard Branson, the British billionaire whose backing and minority ownership stake made the airline possible, posted a letter on Virgin’s website bemoaning that Alaska couldn’t find a place for Virgin. “With a lot of things in life, there is a point where we have to let go and appreciate the fact that we had this ride at all,” he wrote. Branson added that it remains to be seen how travelers will be affected by the dwindling number of U.S. airlines. Mergers in recent years grounded US Airways, Continental, Northwest, AirTran, and America West. Airfares rose faster than inflation after those mergers, but then they fell in 2015 and 2016 as fuel became cheaper. Virgin America played a role in those lower fares by engaging Southwest Airlines in a price war at Dallas Love Field. Seattle-based Alaska won a bidding war with JetBlue Airways to buy Virgin. The deal will greatly expand Alaska’s strength in California. Alaska recently announced it will greatly expand routes from the San Francisco Bay Area.

Alaska announced late Wednesday that it will retire the Virgin brand, probably in 2019, adding that name to a list including Continental and US Airways that disappeared in the past decade. Launching a new airline takes lots of money and patience — one reason that Virgin America’s debut in 2007 was so eye-catching. The other was its hip vibe including mood lighting and young, attractive flight attendants.

IndiGo has asked its pilots to fly snag-hit A320neo planes at a lower altitude, 30,000 ft, and not the usual 36,000 ft to reduce strain on engines even though it will mean higher fuel burn. GoAir CEO Wolfgang Prock-Schauer said in an interview on Thursday that Pratt & Whitney “will support us properly with spare engines and other support needs to be there so we can overcome the initial phase and don’t have any flight disruptions.” A Pratt & Whitney spokesman said it has no comment on the subject. Earlier this month the engine maker said there were no safety issues involved with the planes and replacement engines were being sent to India on cargo jets when required. Still, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked IndiGo and GoAir to increase surveillance of these planes, besides specifying other restrictions on when and where to fly them. In January, an IndiGo flight had a so-called rejected takeoff at Mumbai. A GoAir flight from Delhi had to return to the airport after an engine fire 15 minutes into the flight. Last month, a GoAir flight had to effect an emergency landing and an IndiGo flight had to fly minus passengers to Delhi from Baroda. Spokespersons for GoAir and IndiGo declined to comment for this story. Analysts say the two airlines are facing teething troubles that early buyers of new aircraft do. They point to Air India’s troubles with Boeing’s Dreamliner. Usually, such problems are sorted out within the first two years of a new aircraft being launched. In this case too, “technical issues will be sorted out in one-and-a-half years,” Prock-Schauer said. IndiGo, which was the launch customer for the Airbus A320neo, has about 413 planes on order; it has so far inducted 17 in its 129-plane fleet. GoAir flies less than half-a-dozen of them and has about 140 on order. The planes, powered by fuel-efficient engines, are key to both airlines’ low cost model. On 21 March, Ashim Mittra, vice president (flight operations), IndiGo said in a note to pilots that Pratt & Whitney had proposed limiting the altitude of flying to 30,000 feet for A320neo planes to avoid a possible glitch in the engine lubrication system and that effective 22 March, IndiGo had decided to adopt the recommendation. Mint has seen a copy of the note. Since flying at lower altitudes consumes more fuel, the note asked pilots to fuel up accordingly. Aviation analyst Mohan Ranganathan and former director general of civil aAviation Kanu Gohain said it was rare for an airline to place such altitude restrictions. Publicly known technical snags in the Neos include erroneous warnings to the pilot, longer startup times, issues with the combustor chamber lining, oil seal failures, and so-called oil chip detected warnings. “Pratt and Whitney have constantly been analysing other teething problems that have emerged during operations,” Mittra said in his note to pilots. Earlier this month, top Pratt & Whitney executives met DGCA officials to update them on the engine issues. Former DGCA chief Gohain said more inspections would help. “Whenever there are repeated engine issues you increase the frequency of inspections so that you can detect the internal distress of the engine earlier before it fails,” Gohain said. tags GoAir Airbus A320neo IndiGo Airlines Aviation more from business Apple didn’t violate Chinese phonemaker’s patent, rules Beijing court Mar 25, 2017 17:42 IST 2017 KTM RC390 review: Minor updates but ride remains the same great Mar 25, 2017 16:50 IST FD vs Stocks: Which One Should You Choose?

Administrators of this training institute have already initiated steps to upgrade CTE into a deemed university and a feasibility study is being done. “There’s acute shortage of good training institutes to train aspirants in the aviation sector. CTE has excellent track record of six decades in training and state-of-the art infrastructure and training facilities. We want to make optimum utilisation of the available resources and increase the capacity for training. Setting up of a deemed university in the aviation sector is a step in this direction,” said Amitabh Singh, executive director (training) at CTE. Singh said MBA in aviation, a first-of-its-kind in India, and other courses will be offered through CTE’s deemed university. CTE Hyderabad is spread over 20 acres and it has campuses at Mumbai and Delhi. CTE has six simulators – four Boeing simulators at Mumbai and two Airbus simulators at Hyderabad. CTE also offers cources for cabin crew, aviation security, aircraft engineering, and aviation marketing and management.       “We’ll acquire ATR flight simulator by October with an outlay of Rs 65 crore to train pilots flying ATR flights. We will train Alliance Air pilots through this simulator. Right now pilots are going to foreign nations like Singapore, Bangkok and France for ATR simulator training. Indian pilots can have training in India itself after ATR simulator is made available,” said Amitabh Singh. CTE traines pilots and staff of other airlines, too.

Not quite (NASA) space Magical Thinking Won't Get You to Mars. (Washington Please Note) Jeffrey Kluger Mar 23, 2017 Who knew getting to Mars could be so easy? After millennia of gazing wonderingly at the Red Planet and more than half a century of firing robot spacecraft its way, the U.S. has at last figured out a way to get astronauts onto the Martian surface: make it a rule. That was the talking point out of Washington on March 21, when, in a flashy photo op, President Donald Trump signed Senate Bill 442, an act that includes a $19.5 billion outlay for NASA for 2017 and a firm plan for a crewed Mars landing in 2033. "The President signed into law a one-year spending plan for NASA that, for the first time, explicitly requires the space agency to send humans to Mars," read the press release promptly issued by the office of Sen. Bill Nelson (D, Fla.), a co-sponsor, with Sen. Ted Cruz (R, Tex), of the bill. The media echoed that exciting news. "Congress just passed a bill that tells NASA to send humans to Mars by 2033," wrote Business Insider. "US Government to NASA: Get Humans to Mars by 2033," announced Techspot. Even RT, the Russian government's international news outlet, was wowed: "Congress passes NASA funding bill, Mars mission date set," it reported. So that's settled, right? Wrong. Related White HousePresident Trump Signs Bill Authorizing NASA Funding and Mars Exploration White House President Trump Signs Bill Authorizing NASA Funding and Mars Exploration For NASA enthusiasts there is indeed a lot to love in S.442. The funding level represents only a slight uptick from recent years, but it's the up part of that that counts. NASA has been a favorite target of budget hawks for decades, and even though its current annual allowance represents just 0.4% of the federal budget — compared to 4% during the Apollo days — the agency is not facing the draconian cuts of the past. The longterm space vision spelled out in the spending plan is a good one, too. The International Space Station will continue to operate at least until 2024, while NASA presses for more budgetary buy-in from the 14 partner countries that helped build the giant complex. Dunning NATO for more money might not be the Administration's smartest geopolitical play, but NASA has long borne the overwhelming share of the cost for building and maintaining the station, which has been visited by 226 different astronauts from 18 different countries. All contributions are welcome — and needed. The newly signed act also calls for ending U.S. dependence on Russia to get American astronauts to space. Accordingly, it mandates continued work on the commercial cargo and crew programs — with NASA partnering with outside companies like Boeing and SpaceX to fly to low-Earth orbit — as well as pressing ahead with the space agency's own SLS rocket and Orion crew capsule for deep space exploration. There are also commitments to continued unmanned exploration of the solar system, next generation space-based telescopes, and even better health care for astronauts. Indeed, that last part of the act is actually its longest, covering such familiar details as deductibles, copays and access to local providers. Again and always, health care is really hard. Who knew? But then there's the Mars part. The 2033 target is nice, precise and buzzy, but for practical purposes it's meaningless. Start with the things we need to build — in some cases invent — before we get to Mars. After the SLS and Orion are complete, we still need (deep breath): a habitat module for the outward-bound and return trips, radiation shielding, a landing module, a habitat for the surface, a pressurized rover, a greenhouse facility and a way to manufacture fuel, power and water onsite—infrastructure, in other words, when we can barely get the damn stuff built on Earth. Even SpaceX's Elon Musk, whose pledge to have humans on Mars by 2024, beats Congress in the fever-dream category, was not impressed. "Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it," he responded to a follower in an extended Twitter exchange about S.442. A big part of that problem is funding. The $19.5 billion is nice, but it still puts NASA's budget at just a third of the inflation-corrected amount it received at the peak of the Apollo program. The bigger flaw with the 2033 plan is that, as so often happens in Washington, it misreads the lessons of history. In this case that history is President Kennedy's bracing call, in 1961, for a manned landing on the moon before 1970. We made that deadline in July of 1969 and even squeezed in another landing before that year was out. But Kennedy was operating in a much more politically functional era, when an overarching national goal could survive election cycles and even changes of Administration, without being pulled out root and branch the moment the opposing party took over the White House or Capitol Hill. Washington today can barely keep the lights on, with a Congress that has left the Supreme Court shorthanded for more than a year, and a White House that currently governs by Tweet and tantrum. You think you get to Mars that way? You don't even get to the next fiscal quarter that way. Space travel is a business for engineers, astronauts and rational policymakers — adults all. The new NASA appropriation is a nice start and 2033 is a good goal. Now grow up and do the work.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 March 2017 by Military News Synthetic Lubricants Market to Experience Increase in Growth by 2016-2024 Sarasota, FL — (SBWIRE) — 03/23/2017 — Global Synthetic Lubricants Market: Overview Basically, lubricants are substances that are used to reduce the friction amid two sliding or two moving surfaces. The primary objective of the lubricant is to keep aside the two sliding or moving surfaces so as to decrease the destruction of the materials that will happen owing to the friction. Synthetic lubricants compose of thickeners, synthetic base oil, and additives. They provide more advantages when compared to the conventional lubricants that are mineral based. The synthetic lubricants are used in metal stamping and are eco-friendly in nature.

The negotiations focus on an investment of about US$200 million (S$280 million) by American Airlines in China Southern's Hong Kong-listed shares, said the people, asking not to be identified as talks are confidential. The sale would likely take place through a private placement, one of the people said. China Southern has a market value of about US$10 billion. Bringing in the world's largest carrier as a partner will help the Guangzhou-based airline expand its network through code-sharing as it adds more destinations. The tie-up will help American strengthen its presence in a market that the International Air Transport Association predicts will surpass the US to become the world's biggest in terms of passenger numbers by 2024. Under the discussions, American would nominate an observer without voting rights to the Chinese company's board, the people said. Details of a deal are subject to change and a transaction could still fall through. CHINA SOUTHERN 684 Fleet size, as of June 2016. 208 Number of destinations it flies to A spokesman for American declined to comment. China Southern representatives could not immediately comment. Trading in the shares of the Chinese carrier was suspended in Hong Kong and Shanghai yesterday, pending an announcement of a possible major strategic cooperation, according to an exchange filing. Beyond Beijing, China Southern's stock has gained 35 per cent this year in Hong Kong, compared with an 11 per cent advance in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. American connects 350 destinations in 50 countries, mostly in North America, the Caribbean, South America and Europe. China Southern - with a fleet of 684 aircraft as of June last year, the largest in Asia - flies to 208 destinations across 40 countries and has been expanding on routes to Australia, New Zealand and South-east Asia. "The deal would allow China Southern and American to expand their presence in each other's home markets without being constrained by the limit on air rights," said analyst Su Baoliang at Sinolink Securities. China Southern and its subsidiaries have ordered more than US$15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Group since 2015 as more people fly in the world's most populous nation. China Southern and Delta Air Lines are members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. American is in the competing Oneworld group, which does not have a China-based partner. Such alliances make it easier for passengers to fly around the world by combining schedules through one carrier and allowing travellers to accrue and use frequent-flier miles across airlines. China Eastern Airlines is also a SkyTeam member. A Delta spokesman declined to comment. American closed little changed at US$40.35 in New York on Wednesday, leaving the shares down 14 per cent this year.

Tarun Shukla IndiGo has been forced to find ways to deal with vexing technical snags with the Pratt & Whitney engines that power the Airbus A320neo aircraft. New Delhi: InterGlobe Aviation Ltd-run IndiGo and Go Airlines (India) Ltd-run GoAir, among to first to fly the new Airbus A320neo, have been forced to find ways to deal with vexing technical snags with the Pratt & Whitney engines that power the aircraft. IndiGo has asked its pilots to fly snag-hit A320neo planes at a lower altitude, 30,000 feet, and not the usual 36,000 feet, to reduce strain on engines even though it will mean higher fuel burn. GoAir CEO Wolfgang Prock-Schauer said in an interview in February that Pratt & Whitney “will support us properly with spare engines and other support needs to be there so we can overcome the initial phase and don’t have any flight disruptions”. A Pratt & Whitney spokesman said it has no comment on the subject. ALSO READ | IndiGo eyes A321neo switch in Airbus order Earlier this month, the engine maker said there were no safety issues in the planes and replacement engines were being sent to India when required. Still, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked IndiGo and GoAir to increase surveillance of these planes, besides specifying other restrictions on when and where to fly them. In January, an IndiGo flight had a so-called rejected take-off at Mumbai. In February, a GoAir flight from Delhi had to return to the airport after an engine fire 15 minutes into the flight. In the same month, a GoAir flight had to make an emergency landing and an IndiGo flight had to fly minus passengers to Delhi from Baroda. Spokespersons for GoAir and IndiGo declined to comment for this story. Analysts say the two airlines are facing teething troubles that early buyers of new aircraft do. They point to Air India’s troubles with Boeing’s Dreamliner. Usually, such problems are sorted out within the first two years of a new aircraft being launched. In this case too, “technical issues will be sorted out in one-and-a-half years”, Prock-Schauer said. ALSO READ | Why are IndiGo, SpiceJet, others fighting over ‘most punctual’ crown? IndiGo, which was the launch customer for the A320neo, has about 411 planes on order; it has so far inducted 19 in its 131-plane fleet. GoAir flies less than half-a-dozen of them and has about 140 on order. The planes, powered by fuel-efficient engines, are key to both airlines’ low cost model. On 21 March, Ashim Mittra, vice-president (flight operations), IndiGo, said in a note to pilots that Pratt & Whitney had proposed limiting the altitude of flying to 30,000 feet for A320neo planes to avoid a possible glitch in the engine lubrication system and that, effective 22 March, IndiGo had decided to adopt the recommendation. Mint has seen a copy of the note. Since flying at lower altitudes consumes more fuel, the note asked pilots to fuel up accordingly. Aviation analyst Mohan Ranganathan and former director general of civil aviation Kanu Gohain said it was rare for an airline to place such altitude restrictions. Publicly known technical snags in the Neos include erroneous warnings to the pilot, longer start-up times, issues with the combustor chamber lining, oil seal failures and so-called oil chip detected warnings. Air India won’t oppose Qatar Airways bid to set up airline in India: Ashwani Lohani “Pratt and Whitney has constantly been analysing other teething problems that have emerged during operations,” Mittra said in his note to pilots. Earlier this month, top Pratt & Whitney executives met DGCA officials to update them on the engine issues. Former DGCA chief Gohain said more inspections would help. “Whenever there are repeated engine issues you increase the frequency of inspections so that you can detect the internal distress of the engine earlier before it fails,” he said.

Warren) DALLAS (AP) - After months of teasing, Alaska Airlines has bad news for loyal customers of Virgin America — their airline’s name is being dumped. Alaska announced late Wednesday that it will retire the Virgin brand, probably in 2019, adding that name to a list including Continental and U.S. Airways that disappeared in the past decade. Launching a new airline takes lots of money and patience — one reason that Virgin America’s debut in 2007 was so eye-catching. So when Alaska announced last year that it was buying Virgin for $2.6 billion, it was like asking Virgin customers to trade in their sports car for a minivan — a solid, reliable ride, but not exciting. Alaska Airlines knew it, too. Last June, CEO Brad Tilden held out hope to Virgin fans that he might keep the Virgin America brand, and run it as a separate airline under the same corporate umbrella. Tilden said he believed in “the power of the Virgin America brand, and we don’t want to lose all that loyalty.” But running an airline within an airline adds complexity and costs. Alaska flies only Boeing jets; Virgin uses Airbus planes. Sometimes a split personality works in the airline business, sometimes it doesn’t — remember Ted, by United Airlines? And so Alaska’s announcement came as no surprise to people in the business. Still, many will be saddened, particularly in Virgin’s home market of California. Richard Branson, the British billionaire whose backing and minority ownership stake made the airline possible, posted a letter on Virgin’s website bemoaning that Alaska couldn’t find a place for Virgin. “With a lot of things in life, there is a point where we have to let go and appreciate the fact that we had this ride at all,” he wrote. Branson added that it remains to be seen how travelers will be affected by the dwindling number of U.S. airlines. Mergers in recent years grounded U.S. Airways, Continental, Northwest, AirTran and America West. Airfares rose faster than inflation after those mergers, but then they fell in 2015 and 2016 as fuel became cheaper. Virgin America played a role in those lower fares by engaging Southwest Airlines in a price war at Dallas Love Field. Seattle-based Alaska won a bidding war with JetBlue Airways to buy Virgin. The deal will greatly expand Alaska’s strength in California. Alaska recently announced that it will greatly expand routes from the San Francisco Bay Area.

up next: now reading: This Is No Time For You to Bury Your Head In the Sand The Associated Press This Is No Time For You to Bury Your Head In the Sand By Doug Kass March 24, 2017 The Associated Press X Story Stream recent articles Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... "What Washington needs is adult supervision." --Barack Obama Yesterday's opening missive, " Wall Street Blues," depicted an overvalued market, moderating U.S. economic prospects, elevated investor optimism and a new Administration that, arguably, appears to be doing nearly everything it can do to jeopardize its legislative agenda (which, despite protestations in some parts, has been crucial to the S&P index's impressive run since the November election). The latter is an important point, though Jim "El Capitan" Cramer, and some others, have disputed President Trump's prospective market influence -- here and here, for example -- and respectfully disagree with my narrative. To me, the domestic economic recovery and the trajectory of growth is far too fragile (and stock prices by almost every metric to high) to dismiss the growing probability that the Trump agenda is on less than a solid foundation -- owing, in part, to numerous (bizarre) tweets, policy decisions, constitutional issues and, arguably, a general level of disorganization. That said, I expect the Republicans to come together and pass an affordable health-care bill which will likely be a product of extensive compromise and, in the main, imperfect to the Republican and Democratic parties. I anticipate that the stock market may very well rally somewhat further in response. But, as always, it is all about one's timeframes (and risk profile) -- and I am describing my near-term tactical strategy. I am concerned with what follows after health care's passage -- that future policy (regulatory and tax reform, repatriation and fiscal policy) may be hobbled and that our markets will feel the pain. My Tactical Approach to the Markets As I wrote yesterday, for my trading positions, the market's influences are too "newsy," and I have reduced my gross and net exposures. Fortunately, many of these positions have been on the short side and have benefited from a market that may be rolling over. Financial stocks, which I have been negative on -- particularly life insurance ( Lincoln National (LNC) from $73 to $63, Metlife (MET) $56 to $51) and brokerages ( Goldman Sachs (GS) from $253 to $229, Morgan Stanley (MS) from $47 to $41) -- have been the right places to be short. There Is Always a Bull Market Somewhere In fact, Jim and I might BOTH be right. There will always be attractive stocks to own in nearly any market setting -- hopefully I have some (last night Campbell Soup (CPB) announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase). But ignoring valuation, investor sentiment, moderating domestic economic growth expectations, political and geopolitical risks is not my path. Moreover, for every Amazon (AMZN) there is a Macy's (M) and a Nordstrom (JWN) . For every PVH Corp. (PVH) there is a Target (TGT) . For every Boeing (BA) there is a General Electric (GE) and a Caterpillar (CAT) . For every Apple (AAPL) there is a Hewlett Packard (HPE) . And for every JPMorgan (JPM) there is a Deutsche Bank (DB) . So, as always (and as Jimmy opines), search to identify the winners (and if you are a short seller, search to identify the losers). It remains my view that in the aggregate (and when considering overall market exposure), ignoring valuation, sentiment, the bigger economic picture (in retail, housing and autos) -- and even politics (and geopolitics) -- may be injurious to your investment well being. Five Charts That Spew Overvaluation While I recognize that valuations are a poor timing tool, we must never forget what Warren Buffett said: "Price is what you pay, value is what you get." I discuss five charts that embody some of my valuation concerns. 1. Warren Buffett's favorite indicator, total market capitalization compared to GDP, is now at 130% -- that's a +130% rise in the last eight years 2. The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) developed by Yale's Robert Shiller is, with the exception of 1929 (preceding the Great Depression) and 2000 (dot.com bubble), at the highest reading on record 3. An all-time high in cash flow multiples -- occurring by P/E ratio expansion and not through profit growth (2012-2016 experienced +0.5% compounded growth versus 1995-1999 of +9%): 4. Rising margin debt hit a record high in January, 2017 -- the prior tops were one month and three months prior to the bear markets that began in 2000 and in late 2007: 5. The Bull Market in Complacency: Bottom Line I remain negative on equities -- by my calculation, the aggregate downside risk "trumps" the upside reward by a factor of about 3:1. My market forecast, expressed in last December's 15 Surprise for 2017, remains the same: "The S&P Index has a high of 2,375 (up 5%) for the year and a low of 1,815 (down 20%), closing the year closer to the low end of the annual price range (down 15%)."

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory White House officials are trying to distance themselves from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, whose financial ties to Russia are being probed by federal investigators, but his longtime associate remains active in the president’s operations. Press Secretary Sean Spicer declined Wednesday to discuss revelations that Manafort been paid to promote Russian interests 12 years ago in the U.S., saying it would be “inappropriate” to comment on someone who wasn’t a White House employee — but his former deputy Rick Gates was there just last week for a meeting with the president, reported the Washington Post. Gates, who also worked with the same Russian oligarch who reportedly paid Manafort $10 million to promote Russian interests, leads the outside group America First Policies to push Trump’s agenda. RELATED: Paul Manafort’s shadowy Cyprus bank transactions under investigation by US Treasury America First Policies was announced Jan. 31, and Kellyanne Conway promoted its importance, but little work has been done besides an initial press release and some social media activity after reporters began poking around its operations. He started working with Manafort in 2006, a year after the Republican strategist struck a deal with Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and Vladimir Putin ally. Gates told the Post that he also worked with Deripaska, who has been denied entry to the U.S. over his alleged ties to organized crime, to support a private equity fund started by Manafort’s firm and “democracy building and party building in Ukraine.” He also took part in at least two other recent deals involving Putin-connected oligarchs, including one that ended with Deripaska suing both Gates and Manafort. The firm pitched Deripaska on a $200 million private equity partnership focused on Russia and Ukraine, and the arrangement was set up in 2007 in the Cayman Islands, but the relationship had disintegrated by 2014, when Deripaska sued Manafort and Gates over $19 million in unaccounted funds intended for the purchase of a Ukrainian cable provider. The pair eventually stopped answering Deripaska’s requests to show how the money had been used or return it to the investor, according to the lawsuit. “It appears that Paul Manafort and Rick Gates have simply disappeared,” claimed the lawsuit, which a Deripaska spokeswoman said might still be pending. Manafort and Gates were also named in a 2014 racketeering lawsuit involving Ukrainian oligarch named Dmitry Firtash, who also has ties to Putin. That suit, which was later dismissed, claimed Manafort and Gates helped Firtash launder ill-gotten gains as part of an $850 million deal to build luxury housing at the site of the Drake Hotel in New York City. Firtash was indicted with five others in 2013 with paying $18.5 million in bribes to Indian officials so they could mine titanium and sell it to Boeing Corporation to build the 787 Dreamliner jet, and he’s currently fighting extradition to the U.S. Manafort and Gates promoted the pro-Russian Party of Regions on behalf of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, and introduced the pro-Yanukovych European Center for a Modern Ukraine to the lobbying firms Mercury LLC and the Podesta Group. Both of those Washington-based lobbying firms hired outside investigators to determine whether they’d been misled by Gates. Gates was named the Trump campaign’s liaison to the Republican National Committee just hours after Manafort quit his unpaid chairmanship in August over his alleged financial ties to Russia. He left that role, in which he maintained offices at both the RNC and Trump Tower, two weeks later after former Citizens United head David Bossie — who is putting together a potential rival group to America First Policies — was named deputy campaign manager. Gates was blamed by campaign sources for Melania Trump’s RNC speech that included a plagiarized portion of a speech given by former first lady Michelle Obama, although he denies the claims.

News Business Business Comment Businessman who puts job applicants through snowflake test is the real snowflake Marketing man Kyle Reyes says he wants people who can justify their opinions. Just as long as they're the same as his opinions James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Thursday 23 March 2017 17:45 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online A US company has introduced a “snowflake test” to weed out overly sensitive, liberal candidates who are too easily offended Gothamist Congratulations Kyle Reyes. I’m officially naming you as the inaugural winner of my Business Jerk of the Month award.  Mr Reyes, who if nothing else has quite the talent for self promotion, has created a huge fuss with his “Snowflake Test” that applicants for jobs with his company have to pass.  The boss of US marketing outfit “The Silent Partner” has been all over the media taking aim at the moany millennials and brats he claims he is confronted with.  Read more CEO uses 'snowflake' test when hiring to avoid 'whiny millennials' So of course Rupert Murdoch’s conservative Fox News Channel, and its sibling Fox Business, had him in to opine on the subject.  Mr Reyes insisted that his test is not political: “There can be conservative snowflakes”. It is simply designed to weed out people who “whine and complain and come to the table with an entitled attitude and an inability to back their perspective”.  It all starts to fall apart when you watch his spiel on Fox & Friends (not being a snowflake myself, I did that, although I had to restrain myself from throwing up at one point).  “Ever since the election cycle, people are split and not having rational, realistic conversations, so I want to understand how people make an opinion and stand by that,” he told the host, not unreasonably.   “So what answer would disqualify them from a job?” Read more CEO uses 'snowflake' test when hiring to avoid 'whiny millennials' Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk takes credit for ‘snowflake’ term If you are so triggered by students then maybe you're the 'snowflake' “An answer where you don’t know the difference between there, their and they’re from a spelling purpose (dude, I think you mean spelling perspective) and someone who is not proud to be an American.” Right. It seems that while Mr Reyes says he wants people who are able to justify their opinions, and who can back their perspectives, he’s not so keen on people who have a perspective that differs from his.  If your opinion is anything other than “I’m super proud to be an American” then you’re out.  Of course, most Americans are proud to be Americans whatever their political stance. I happen to be fond of the place myself. Mr Reyes and me would just differ about what makes it great.  Take guns, and here again Mr Reyes shows his true colours. The “Snowflake Test” asks applicants for their views on that subject.  “We do a lot of work filming with guns. I carry, a lot of our team and our clients carry as well,” Mr Reyes told Fox. "We work with a lot of hard core American companies so you’ve got to be comfortable around them.” “If you’re not you’re not hired?” “Adios.” You do not have access to view this Atom. Once again, it seems that holding and being able to justify an opinion that there should be more gun control in America and that they’re not healthy isn’t enough. You either agree with Mr Reyes or it’s curtains for you.  Hey, I get it. You want people who are going to be able to work well with your clients. There’s nothing wrong with tailoring your hiring process to that end. But after sneering about “snowflakes” it does rather seem as if it’s Mr Reyes who is the real snowflake here.  I suppose it shouldn’t come as that big of a surprise when the current conservative President is so super sensitive he can’t even tolerate a critical tweet. It isn’t hard to see from where this man is taking his cue.  Enjoy your award Mr Reyes.  More about: Generation Snowflake snowflakes Millennials Kyle Reyes Fox News Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

The U.S. and British decisions to forbid devices bigger than a cellphone in the cabin on flights from several Middle East and North African states could hit Istanbul particularly hard, after years building up its position as an international hub. More than half of international passengers at Turkish Airlines , which is 49 percent state-owned and serves 247 destinations outside Turkey, are transit customers who could instead travel through Europe or other hubs. Fast-growing Gulf airlines such as Emirates , Etihad and Qatar Airways, which similarly depend on business-class flyers stopping over in places like Dubai or Doha for far-flung destinations, could also be hit. For Turkey's national carrier, the setback comes as it prepares to relocate to a 10 billion euro ($10.8 billion) third airport in Istanbul, billed by the developer as the world's largest and championed by President Tayyip Erdogan as a megaproject that will cement Turkey's global standing. "The biggest aim of the third airport was to use Istanbul as a hub. But if such security measures become permanent, this could reduce Istanbul's appeal," said Esra Sirinel, a deputy research director at Is Investment and an airline specialist. Istanbul's existing main Ataturk airport is struggling to cope with millions of transit passengers a month. The new airport will initially have the capacity for 90 million passengers when it opens in 2018, but ultimately aims to serve double that and to offer flights to more than 350 destinations. Turkey's pro-government media, which, like Erdogan, often casts the country as a victim of foreign conspiracies, was quick to lambaste the new regulations. "They're afraid of THY (Turkish Airlines)," the Yeni Safak newspaper said in a front-page headline on Thursday, over a simulated image of the new airport glistening in the sun. It cast the move as a plot against Turkey's national carrier. "We need to stop THY," read the headline on fellow pro-government daily Aksam, which claimed U.S. carriers, facing stiff competition from Turkish Airlines and Gulf carriers, had lobbied for the move. Gulf airlines have been battling against a campaign in Washington by U.S. carriers which accuse them of receiving unfair subsidies, charges they deny. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has so far placed more emphasis on the job benefits of building jets for foreign carriers. Gulf carriers and Turkish Airlines are major customers of Boeing and between them have more than 440 Boeing jets on order, worth tens of billions of dollars. "PURELY COMMERCIAL DECISION" The U.S. restrictions apply to flights originating from 10 airports in countries including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey. The British restrictions do not include the UAE or Qatar but will affect Turkish Airlines and UK-based carriers including British Airways , easyJet and Monarch. A senior Turkish government official questioned the basis for the restrictions, saying airport security in Turkey was no worse than in Europe and that laptops or tablets could still be used to carry explosives even if they are put in the hold. "It appears this decision was made purely on commercial grounds, and it seems it was done to limit the advancements made by Turkish Airlines and by Turkey," the official told Reuters. Security experts say Washington and London may believe a laptop could disguise a bomb big enough to bring down a plane, warranting extra explosives checks which can be performed on luggage in the hold. Confining any device to checked baggage would also make it harder for a would-be attacker to trigger it, or to position it to bring the plane down. Turkey's foreign ministry said talks were underway to try to persuade the United States and Britain to exclude Turkish Airlines and Istanbul airport from the ban. Istanbul-based brokerage Unlu&Co said Turkish Airlines and Gulf operators would be hit hardest by the regulations. "(They) have the most to lose from the U.S. ban since they rely on transfer passengers who may need access to laptops and other devices for business reasons and could easily travel via European hubs, like Frankfurt," it said in a report. Emirates said it would introduce a service letting customers use laptops and tablets until just before they board direct flights to the U.S. from Dubai, and made clear on Thursday that the ban did not apply to its U.S.-bound flights via Europe. The Americas account for 14 percent of Turkish Airlines revenue, according to the airline's website, which does not break out figures separately for the United States or Britain. Turkish Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Bhat and Pai have created the Presidential Actions app that helps users keep up with presidential executive orders, memorandums, proclamations and any official actions taken by the president. (Laura A. Oda/Bay Area News Group) By Queenie Wong | qwong@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 23, 2017 at 8:00 am | UPDATED: March 23, 2017 at 12:25 pm var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]); Upset after Donald Trump’s presidential victory, 20-year-old Bastian Shah wanted to fight back by hitting Trump where it might hurt the most: his wallet. So he downloaded Boycott Trump, an app that compiles a list of businesses that have ties to the president and helps users contact them through e-mail, Twitter or a phone call. Shah, who now volunteers for the liberal organization that created the app, steers clear of restaurants that Trump has an ownership stake in and deleted the ride-hailing app Uber. Boycott Trump has helped him personally resist Trump and get through the day, he said. “At the end of the day Trump, I really believe, doesn’t care about anything other than his bottom line,” said Shah, who is from San Jose but attends college in New York. “If we can hurt his bottom line, that’s kind of where I’m coming at this from.” Whatever his ultimate effect on the nation, Trump’s candidacy and election have been a gold mine for Twitter, the news media and “Saturday Night Live.” They’ve also become a boon for software developers, a growing number of which have been making apps and web services to cater to both sides of the Trump divide and even those in between. So whether you consider yourself part of the resistance, are yearning to “Make America Great Again,” or are somewhere in the middle, there’s likely an app for you. The Trump app phenomenon is a function of the moment we live in, both politically and technologically, said Robert Siegel, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business and a partner at XSeed Capital. Advances in technology have made it easier for startups to launch new apps faster and more cost-effectively than in previous presidential administrations, he said. “Not only do we have an incredibly non-traditional new president, but we also have an opportunity for people to start new businesses with technology platforms that were previously unavailable,” he said. Presidential Actions, a smartphone app created by a pair of UC Berkeley students, alerts users when the president issues a new executive order or takes other actions. Laura A. Oda/Bay Area News Group One such Trump-inspired app is Presidential Actions. The app, which UC Berkeley sophomore Ash Bhat and his roommate Rohan Pai put together in less than a day, alerts users every time the president signs an executive order or takes another action, providing press releases and documents from the White House’s website. It also displays a map of nearby town hall meetings held by lawmakers. Bhat had politics on his mind after Trump threatened to pull federal funding from UC Berkeley in February. Violent protests caused university officials to cancel an appearance by conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos, prompting the president to tweet that the university doesn’t allow free speech. “One of the big things that we can do is just educate people and let them come to their own decisions,” said Bhat, whose app is used by both Democrats and Republicans. “There’s misinformation going around.” After releasing the app for the iPhone, Presidential Actions also launched an Android version that was built by Bhat’s friend Mohammad Adib. Instead of simply informing citizens, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump’s aim with its Boycott Trump app, which it launched after the mogul’s victory in November, is to help them oppose the president by pressuring his business partners. Among the companies it targets are businesses that sponsored “Celebrity Apprentice,” carry Trump’s menswear line or have executives who donated to his presidential campaign. “It was almost therapeutic because there was a lot of people who felt powerless at the time,” said Nathan Lerner, the coalition’s executive director. “You do have a voice every single day with your purchasing power.” Other Trump apps take themselves and the president a lot less seriously, choosing to take on the president by poking fun at him. Donald Trump Soundboard allows users to create ringtones from Trump phrases. With Fake Call Donald Trump and other apps, users can prank their friends with a call that looks and sounds like it’s coming from the president. In the Trump Dump game, users can even turn Trump into a pile of poop. But while many app developers are catering to Trump opponents, others are targeting the president’s fans. TrumpSingles.com, which was created by Santa Clarita Republican David Goss, vows to make dating great again. Goss launched the dating site after hearing stories about the backlash Trump supporters got when politics came up during a date. “As soon as someone mentioned they were a Trump supporter, the date went sour,” he said. Trump fans who connected over the site have grabbed dinner together or gone out on dates at a shooting range, Goss said. The site, which launched in May 2016, saw its number of users grow to about 38,000 after Trump’s presidential win. TrumpSingles.com even captured the attention of comedian Seth Meyers, who parodied the site on his late night show this month. Some analysts worry that, as fun as they may be, apps that pick a side in the political debate ultimately won’t be good for us or society as a whole because they could deepen our political biases. “We are in an incredibly polarized country,” Stanford lecturer Siegel said. “The echo chamber continues to be reinforced even after the election.” But not all app makers that are trying to cash in on Trump are focusing on politics. The people behind Trigger Finance think there’s money to be made in a more traditional way — in the markets. Trigger’s service allows investors to create rules that take certain finance-related actions based on public information. For example, an investor can ask the service to buy shares of a particular index fund if the Federal Reserve changes its interest rates. After seeing the stock prices of companies like Toyota, Lockheed Martin and Boeing take a hit from being targeted by Trump on Twitter, Trigger’s users urged the company to give them the ability to create alerts for whenever the president tweets about a publicly traded stock they own. Trigger released the feature in January, and it’s since become the service’s most popular feature, said Rachel Mayer, the company’s co-founder and CEO. “He’s sort of dialed down on the tweeting, but I don’t anticipate that to stop throughout the course of the year,” she said. “There’s always going to be a new industry he’ll target later on.” Trump apps, features and services at glance Presidential Actions: A pp that alerts users every time Trump signs an executive order or takes another action, providing press releases and documents from the White House’s website.

News Co-op Bank's unique proposition must be preserved The bank was been let down by previous poor management, but its customers have stuck with it despite its travails because they value its ethical lending policies James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Thursday 23 March 2017 14:57 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Lots of Co-operative Bank customers have remained with the bank despite its problems Charlie Forgham-Bailey Dark clouds have been swirling around the Co-operative Bank for years now. There are some in the media who are ready to read its last rites as it scrambles to find a buyer.  The latest example of that is a report from the BBC stating that the bank has been placed under “intensive supervision as survival hopes dwindle”.  Given its troubles, up to an including the failure to pass Bank of England stress tests, I’d be rather surprised if it hadn’t been under intensive supervision for months now and I’d be inclined to ask why if that wasn’t the case.  Read more Co-op Bank reports loss of £477m in 2016 as sale looms Co-Op Bank is putting itself up for sale Brexit impact may hold back Co-op bank’s recovery plans, company warns But, amid a veritable torrent of negative publicity, and the continuing questions about its future, one fact often gets over-looked. That is how sticky the bank’s customer base is.  It’s reasonable to ask whether the Co-op would have withstood what it has withstood without that. Forget last rites. Any other small bank in Co-op’s situation might very well have been buried.  But Co-op is different. It does not lend, or get involved in syndicates that lend, to arms companies, payday lenders, businesses involved in animal testing or environmentally destructive activities. Nasty regimes are also a no no. If you don’t want the money you hold on deposit with your bank used for those purposes, you know were to go. RBS was until recently a big financier of fossil fuels. HSBC has come under fire over its lending to the palm oil industry. Other banks have similarly seen their names linked to unsavoury industries. Co-op? Not us. No siree.  The problems at Co-operative Bank have been caused because its bosses have not always lived up to the ideals espoused by the institution.  The name everyone remembers is Paul Flowers, the former chairman dubbed the “crystal methodist” for the drug habits that were just one part of a lifestyle bathed in sleaze. The sins of other leaders of the Co-operative, while of rather less interest to the tabloids, were arguably far more damaging to the business. Arrogance, hubris, incompetence, I could go on.  But, at the same time, the bank’s policies have remained in place, and a large chunk of customers that like those policies have remained with it when they might have quit other financial institutions with questions surrounding their financial health.  There is value in that. Business types like to refer to it as “brand equity”. If there is a bidder to be found, and the bank maintains that it is continuing to hold discussions with interested parties, they’ll need to find a way to keep that in place. It’s the most valuable part of the business. It is the business.  But can you marry an ethical lender to one with rather looser rules?  Business picture of the day 37 show all Business picture of the day 1/37 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Reuters There is clearly an appetite for an ethical bank, and for ethical banking. There is money to be made in providing it.  The best outcome might be for the Co-operative Bank to find a way through its problems, and to emerge as a small, niche player run with a little more care and a little less ambition than it had in the past. However, what can't be denied is that there are real questions over whether that can be achieved.  If it can’t, there ought be an opportunity for someone willing to start afresh, working from the template.

It follows therefore that occupational ergonomics must be developed and improved to prevent accidents and injuries. This is done by removing hazards, reducing the probability of accidents and minimizing the severity of accident consequences. This article will study and take the above into consideration, regarding aircraft accidents and injuries in Namibia. We have experience of an aircraft that crashed into a house, bursting into flames and killing all five passengers and one pilot on January 11, 2008 at around 16h23 UTC (Universal Coordinated Time), shortly after the plane departed from Eros Airport en route to Mokuti Lodge. The aircraft (type registration and serial number, Cessna 210, V5-GWH), sustained major damage beyond repair, since it was destroyed by the fire after the crash. The Director of Aircraft Accident Investigations in MWTC said that he had assigned investigators in order to establish the cause of the accident. Some eyewitnesses interviewed by investigators claimed seeing fire coming from the aircraft’s engine before the crash, but the real cause will only be determined after scientific investigation is conducted (The Namibian January, 14, 2008). Basic industry statistics – November 1998 to July 2001 Parameter – Civil aircraft registered were 446 in 1998, 473 in 1999, 490 in 2000 and 504 in 2001. – Aircraft maintenance engineers (licensed) were 40 in 1998, 45 in 1999, 51 in 2000 and 68 in 2001. – Pilots were 720 in 1998, 823 in 1999, 872 in 2000 and 983 in 2001. – Aircraft operators were 56 in 1998, 69 in 1999, 71 in 2000 and the same figure in 2001. – Maintenance organizations were 27 in 1998, 24 in 1999, 21 in 2000 and 21 in 2001. – Incidents were *102 in 1998, 107 in 1999, 149 in 2000 and 64 in 2001. – Accidents were *4 in 1998, 6 in 1999, 10 in 2000 and 6 in 2001. – Aircraft mass more than 5700 kg (occurrences) were *24 in 1998, 39 in 1999, 51 in 2000 and 28 in 2001. – Aircraft mass less than 5700 kg (occurrences) were *82 in 1998, 74 in 1999, 108 in 2000 and 42 in 2001. – Non-fatal injuries were *6 in 1998, 6 in 1999, 6 in 2000 and 7 in 2001. – Fatal injuries were *0 in 1998, 1 in 1999, 3 in 2000 and 0 in 2001. NB! These are ‘annualized’ figures because complete statistics for the whole year have not been completed. Detailed records compilation commenced in November 1998. These are figures up to July 2001. Further breakdown of each parameter is usually made for a clearer picture of what is occurring (ICAO Circular 276-AN/162, 1998). For example, the number of pilots in Namibia can further be broken down into: Student Pilots, Commercial Pilots and Airline Transport Pilots. The International Civil Aviation Organization’s long-term commitment to aviation safety has come a long way in making air travel a safe form of transport. This is demonstrated in the improving trend of both aircraft accidents and passenger fatalities over the years. According to the aircraft Crashes Records Office of Geneva, the death toll of over 1 300 people from air accidents in 2002 was the lowest since 1947. I would like to categorically state that although only 17 years old, the Republic of Namibia has been a proud member of ICAO since 1991. To this end, Namibia has and continues to contribute to the development of civil aviation in a safe, secure and orderly manner despite the fact that civil aviation is passing through some of the most turbulent times in its history as a result of the economic downturn. In order to assure “Safe Skies” Namibia has trained and continues to train its air traffic controllers to the highest standards. The National Civil Aviation Administration has upgraded its air traffic communication equipment, and has recently embarked upon a project aimed at acquiring surveillance capability. In order to comply with the Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) set out in Annexes 1, 6 and 8 as well as related procedures, Namibia has in place primary aviation legislation, new regulations, technical standards and procedures enabling the Director of Civil Aviation to carry out safety oversight responsibilities. Accident Analysis Accident analysis is a systemic approach to identify hazards and prevent accidents before they occur. Different methods of analyzing are in use, such as hazard analysis, risk analysis, reliability analysis and to a broader extent, total control and risk management. Once an accident has been investigated, the next step is to perform a thorough accident analysis. Although the depth of analysis will vary, depending on the seriousness of the event, some basic guidelines are summarized below: – do not fix blame for an accident, merely state the causes; – be factual as far as possible in specifying the causes; – look for the primary and secondary causes of the accidents, not the symptoms. The first guideline is essential. In order to obtain facts, communication between workers, supervisors and informed employees must be open. The second guideline is particularly useful if opinions vary. Extra care should be taken to obtain the views of everyone involved in the accident or near the accident site. The last guideline deals with determining the cause or causes of the accident. These causes are defined as either unsafe conditions or unsafe acts. If the primary and secondary causes are known, the next step is to implement the suggested corrective measures so as to eliminate the effecting factors. Reporting of Accidents (failures, malfunctions and defects) According to the Namibian Civil Aviation Regulations, 2001, Part 21 Subpart 21.01.3 (1) the holder of any type certificate, supplemental type certificate, production certificate, NAM-PMA or NAM-TSO authorization issued in terms of the regulations in this Part, shall report in writing to the directorate any failure, malfunction or defect in any product, part or appliance manufactured by such holder which: – Has resulted in any of the occurrences specified in Document NAM-CATS-AR; or has passed through such holder’s quality assurance system and may result in any of the occurrences specified in Document NAM-CATS-AR. A report referred to the above shall include: – The aircraft serial number; – If the failure, malfunction or defect is associated with an article approved under a NAM-TSO authorisation, the article serial number and model designation; – If the failure, malfunction or defect is associated with an aircraft engine or aircraft propeller, the engine or propeller serial number; – The product model; – An identification, including the part number, of the part, component or system involved; and – The nature of the failure, malfunction or defect. Aviation safety studies of course are generally far more complex and sophisticated. Upon completion of the investigation, reports are released to the Public and the Aviation Regulatory Body (the Directorate of Civil Aviation). As the aviation regulator, the Directorate of Civil Aviation (or DCA) is normally tasked with developing the aviation safety programmes for implementing the recommendations made in the reports. According to the paper presented by Charles Higgins Vice President of Airplane Safety: Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, aircraft accident investigation reports typically cite several causal factors and refer to a complex series of events, or missed opportunities for intervention, that ultimately led to a tragedy. Therefore application of a simple, straightforward “fix” is not usually indicated. Solutions require an overall systems approach where all the casual factors, and other factors are considered along with associated risk and the feasibility of a remedy. Sometimes a proposed “fix” adds cost and complexity without a concomitant improvement in safety. Poorly thought-out “fixes” may even introduce additional risk. Conclusions and Recommendations The recommendations mainly fall under the following categories: – Aviation safety training improvements (e.g. air navigation procedures, information on airfields, etc.). – Aviation maintenance safety improvements (e.g. adjustments to maintenance schedules, improvement of aerodrome equipment, etc.). Some recommendations obviously fall outside the direct jurisdiction of the Directorate of Civil Aviation (DCA) and the latter then serves to act as a facilitator or coordinator for the implementation of such recommendations. An example of this would be a case where an aviator deliberately disregards mandatory regulations and thereby causes a danger to safety. In this case the police would best be suited to handle the situation and the DCA would serve as an advisor to the police and the Attorney General. Aircraft accident and incident prevention has now become a major priority for civil aviation in Namibia. The Directorate of Civil Aviation and the Aviation firms (Maintenance, Operators, Trainers) are systematically developing and improving their Aviation Safety Programs independently and co-operatively in response to aircraft accident/incident investigation reports. Finally, I would like to recommend that the Directorate of Civil Aviation must be transformed into the Namibian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) with the legal status to carry out its safety oversight responsibilities on behalf of the MWTC in a more cost-effective manner. The NCAA will be in a position to attract and retain suitably qualified technical staff that combine both the professionalism and integrity required to make civil aviation in Namibia a competitive employer.

Research firm Sentieo built Trump Tracker out of an existing product that enables hedge fund managers to scan public filings and receive instant, automated alerts for keywords. A manager with holdings in Ford, for instance, might want to set alerts for the term “autonomous vehicle” to stay on top of the company’s future. Trump Tracker lets anyone—not just Sentieo’s existing hedge fund clients—do the same for President Trump, free of charge. Already the tool has revealed a massive uptick in companies listing Trump among their risk factors. “Stocks have moved big-time under Trump. It’s a combination of hope and hype,” says Sentieo co-founder and CEO Alap Shah, himself a former hedge fund manager. Customers have been asking for a tool like this since election day, he says. “We’re just beginning to move from that to the execution phase, where he and the Republican Congress need to move on that agenda.” Money managers have until now done their best to predict how Trump’s policies will shape up based on his campaign season promises. But after just two months in office, those promises are already diverging from the administration’s actual policy proposals. Where candidate Trump promised to insure more people for less money under his Obamacare replacement, the American Healthcare Act would actually shrink the insured pool by an estimated 24 million people. Where President-elect Trump tweeted about Boeing’s new Air Force One being too expensive at $4 billion, President Trump has just proposed increasing defense spending by $54 billion. “It’s difficult to reconcile most of what he says,” Shah says.

Now Nothing Surprises Me Anymore Issie Lapowsky Not Even the FBI Can Get Trump to Drop His Wiretap Claims Issie Lapowsky The Carrier Deal Is Great—But Trump Hasn’t Saved Manufacturing Yet The new tool at least attempts to help fund managers understand how businesses are processing it all. Trump Tracker automatically scans Securities and Exchange Commission filings like the annual Form 10-K for mentions of Trump. Already, Shah says, the tool has revealed a massive uptick in companies listing Trump among their risk factors. “Those things tend to not change frequently,” he says. “It’s a big deal when you add a new risk factor.” According to Sentieo’s findings, President Trump is mentioned in filings about six times more often than President Obama was at the same time during his presidency. Those mentions have risen even more sharply since election day. The industry Trump Tracker shows is most concerned about his presidency? Health care. “Companies tend to not want to `fess up to these things until it’s actually happening,” Shah says. “The fact that this many health care companies are already talking about it is a sign it’s a world-shaking moment.” Political uncertainty and policy change have always moved financial markets. But those markets haven’t always had to cope with a president moved to tweet policy changes and wild accusations based on Fox News segments. If the president continues using tech tools to swing stocks, Wall Street will need its own tools to keep ahead of the curve. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Seattle-based Alaska Airlines completed its $4 billion takeover of Virgin America in late 2016, and said in a statement Wednesday it will "adopt many of the brand elements that Virgin America enthusiasts love." It cited in-flight entertainment, boarding music and onboard mood lighting, but the name, color schemes and other distinctive Virgin America touches will be phased out. Alaska Airlines predominately flies to destinations on the U.S. West Coast, as well as to Hawaii and Latin America, and has an all-Boeing fleet of planes. Virgin America flies largely to East and West Coast cities in Airbus planes. Alaska Airlines noted several improvements to its planes as the merger proceeds, including an increase in first-class seats on its planes, "Premium Class" economy seats in Virgin America's Airbus planes, new employee uniforms and redesigned cabin interiors, all in 2018 and 2019. The merged venture will make Alaska Airlines the United States' fifth-largest airline.

The test includes questions such as “What does America mean to you?” and “When was the last time you cried and why?”. Many questions are designed to assess a candidate’s stance on America, police, and guns. Someone who’s not proud to be an American is immediately out of the running, as are people who don’t support the Second Amendment right to bear arms, said Kyle Reyes, who created the test.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

(Courtesy Mark Curtis) Print Email Leanne Smith | lsmith12@mlive.com By Leanne Smith | lsmith12@mlive.com The Jackson Citizen Patriot Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 23, 2017 at 9:00 AM, updated March 23, 2017 at 2:08 PM comments JACKSON, MI - Timothy Jay Curtis was witty, fun-loving, strong-willed and at times a little bit stubborn. He was kind and generous, always making sure his 84-year-old mother was cared for. He made "care packages" of shaving cream, a razor, soap and a McDonald's gift card that he handed out to homeless people instead of cash. Curtis, a Jackson County native and 1977 Concord High School graduate living in Colorado, died of cancer last December. He was 57. For 18 months, he battled a brain tumor all while volunteering for cancer research studies, hoping to advance treatment options for others who may become afflicted with his disease. His Jackson-area friends and family will gather Saturday, March 25, to celebrate Curtis' life. They'll likely chuckle over the obituary his younger brother, Mark, who lives in Spring Arbor, placed in the newspaper last month. "Unable to live in a world with Donald J. Trump as president, Timothy Jay Curtis succumbed to cancer on Dec. 22, 2016," the first line reads. Curtis was gay and in an 18-year relationship with Pierre de Prez, who became his spouse two years ago. "He had a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, a little dry," de Prez said. "He was not afraid to be a little cheeky." A supporter of LGBT rights, Curtis did have real concerns about Trump being president both his brother and de Prez said. "We had frequent conversations and discussions with friends on where the country would go with Trump as president and how things would play out," de Prez said. "He had a good knack of reading people and their character." Coming from a simple background, Curtis always just wanted to be accepted and loved for who he was, his brother said. "He loved to travel," Mark Curtis said. "He loved photography. He wanted to see the world." The second oldest of five children, Curtis moved to California after graduating from high school. He became a finance analyst, working 37 years for Hughes Helicopters, which was sold to McDonnell-Douglas in 1984 and merged with Boeing in 1997. "As a manager, he was very concerned with the welfare of his co-workers and teammates," de Prez said. "If they deserved a reward, they would get a reward. He was open and straight forward and he helped people move on to very successful careers. He touched a lot of lives." Curtis was preceded in death by his father, Robert, and sister, Veronica, who both also had brain tumors, Mark Curtis said. Besides de Prez and Mark Curtis, he is survived by his mother, Mary Francis, and brothers David and James. Those wishing to honor Curtis may donate to the American Brain Tumor Association or other cancer research organization.

President Trump's trade policies will lead the way. (ladyheart/morguefile.com) Print Email Karin Price Mueller | NJMoneyHelp.com for NJ.com By Karin Price Mueller | NJMoneyHelp.com for NJ.com The Star-Ledger on March 23, 2017 at 8:39 AM, updated March 23, 2017 at 10:17 AM comments Q. How will Trump's trade policies affect our stock market? Most of my money is invested at home. -- Trying to keep up A. Indeed, there are lots of Trump-related headlines, and amateurs and pros alike are trying to figure out what it will all mean. It is tempting to read a lot into Trump's views on trade and make investments that respond accordingly, said Andy Kapyrin, director of research at RegentAtlantic in Morristown. But, he says, he believes there's a lot more nuance to the president's views than the headlines let on. "Many view his administration as hostile to global trade, but the nuance is much more specific," Kapyrin said. "Trump believes that multilateral trade deals are not a good bargain for American firms on the whole. He believes that bilateral deals will benefit American producers more." Plus, Kapyrin said, there has been talk in Washington about a border adjustment tax, which would favor more production in the U.S. The chances of Washington passing this seem pretty remote at this point, he said. "Irrespective of the details, the big winners among the U.S. stock market from a more export focused administration will be the large industrial firms that produce high-tech high valued exports already," he said. "Industrial companies like Boeing, Honeywell and General Electric would benefit most from that environment." But don't assume that all manufacturing firms will win. Kapyrin said many companies have relied on existing trade deals to create complex multinational production chains. "GM and Ford have both drawn attention from the administration for manufacturing plants in Mexico, for example," he said. "Depending on the details of new trade policies, they may need to accept higher production costs at home and have already abandoned manufacturing plants abroad in some cases."

Emma Hughes from campaign group Switched On said: “Once again we see British Gas reporting comfortable profits, while over 10 per cent of families in England suffer in cold homes struggling to pay astronomical energy bills.  Read more May steals Labour policy by vowing to tackle spiraling energy prices “We urgently need an alternative to the big six’s rising profits. Councils can set up local public energy companies that deliver both affordable prices and clean energy.” Centrica handed chief executive Iain Conn the 37 per cent pay boost after operating profits hit £1.5bn, up 4 per cent on 2015, the company announced on Wednesday. It comes days after Prime Minister Theresa May warned big energy companies that government would step in to control prices in a market that is “manifestly not working” for customers. “Our party did not end the unjust and inefficient monopolies of the old nationalised energy corporations only to replace them with a system that traps the poorest customers on the worst deals,” she said.  Ms May told the Conservative Party spring conference in Cardiff she would crack down on businesses that “abuse the system”.

They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government.

The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion. Paramount 3/37 John Lewis cuts staff bonuses to lowest in 63 years despite soaring profits - Thursday March 9 John Lewis has cut its employee bonus to the lowest level in more than 60 years despite announcing surging profits. The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

Getty 7/37 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 11/37 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Reuters SSE earlier this month became the latest major energy supplier to confirm that is increasing standard domestic electricity prices from 28 April. British Gas has yet to announce price increases this year and said it would hold prices until August. Centrica defended the pay package. “The awards were a critical part of securing his employment in the face of significant competition for his services,” said Lesley Knox, chairman of Centrica's remuneration committee, in the company's annual report. Much of the increase in Mr Conn’s remuneration comes from compensation for rewards he gave up when he joined Centrica from BP in January 2015. Mr Conn has not yet reached the bumper pay levels of his predecessor, Sam Laidlaw, who pocketed £4.95m in 2012. The former boss forfeited his bonus the following year amid public outcry after the company hiked electricity prices by 9 per cent. Research published on Wednesday found that, on average, FTSE 100 chief executives are now paid 386 times the national living wage.

News Business Business Comment Next says the outlook is grim but the City is right not to buy it The retailer has offered up a deeply pessimistic view of the future for its brick and mortar stores, but its boss is a past master at managing expectations down so he can outperform them James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Thursday 23 March 2017 14:54 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Lord Wolfson wants the City and his supporters among its investment community to think about the worst PA It’s looking grim up at Next. The first decline in profits for eight years, falling sales, even online (where they’re growing) was lacklustre.  Then there was the company’s outlook statement, which was about as bleak as it gets. Brexit backing chief executive Lord Wolfson bemoaned higher import prices, as a result of the slumping pound, falling customer wages, and people increasingly choosing to spend their diminishing disposable incomes on experiences rather than things.  Not a very happy situation to be in when you’re planning to try and push through price rises.  Read more Retailer Next posts first fall in annual profits in eight years Google apologises over adverts placed next to extremist YouTube videos Next poised to report fall in full-year profits amid plunging pound To cap it all, there was a supremely bleak analysis of the prospects for the company’s bricks and mortar stores.  “With increasing amounts of business being transferred online, it is legitimate to question the long term viability of retail stores and whether the possession of a retail portfolio is an asset or a liability,” Lord Wolfson opined.  “In the unlikely event that like-for-like retail sales continue to decline at high rates for the next ten years, we believe that our lease structure is such that the portfolio could be managed down profitably.” Translation: the high street is doomed and even out of town shopping centres aren’t going to have a lot of fun. We should be more or less ok because we’re clever. But don’t you be expecting any fireworks from us.  After all that, you’d think the shares would slump. Instead they shot up in early trading. Could it be that investors smell a rat? I think they do, and so do I. Next has long been a stock market darling precisely because Lord Wolfson and his team have time and again played the City like Keith Richards plays the guitar.  Next is a very good business, and it’s very well run. But in addition to that, its bosses excel at expectations management. They have a history of setting a low bar for Next’s performance that they inevitably go on to beat (often handsomely).  Lord Wolfson is quite right to say it’s tough out there and that it’s going to get tougher, in part because of Brexit, the lunatic political project he was such a big supporter of.  He is also right to raise questions about bricks and mortar stores as increasing numbers of consumers move online. The trend is ongoing, and no one’s quite sure when equilibrium will be reached between the two channels. But it is interesting to note that Next is still opening up new space.  By cleverly positing a worst case scenario – a situation where that equilibrium I spoke of isn’t reached and shops die a death in as little as ten years – Lord Wolfson wants the City and his supporters among its investment community to think about the worst.  Business picture of the day 37 show all Business picture of the day 1/37 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014.

The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

By Zach Carter 590 When President Donald Trump rolled out his first federal budget proposal last week, the administration defended its call for a $54 billion increase in defense spending by pointing to “an ambitious reform agenda” that would “reduce the costs of military programs wherever feasible.” It was a particularly sensitive subject for new Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who built a reputation during his tenure in Congress as a serious deficit hawk unafraid to challenge his Republican colleagues on ballooning war spending. One of his favorite punching bags was the Overseas Contingency Operations budget, which Mulvaney derided as “a slush fund” that should be eliminated. The Trump budget would increase both overall defense spending and the amount that flows to the OCO. To maintain his credibility and demonstrate that Trump’s new “hard power” defense priorities weren’t just an excuse to throw money away, Mulvaney needed to sniff out wasteful endeavors. He appears to have missed at least one. On Tuesday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis and the Pentagon’s acting inspector general accusing defense contractor TransDigm Group of illegally overcharging the Department of Defense by acting as a “hidden monopolist.” The business model Khanna described is devilishly clever, wildly profitable and totally at odds with the basic principles of a competitive market. TransDigm is essentially the Martin Shkreli of defense contractors. It’s a large holding company that searches for specialty parts used in heavy machinery ― unique panels, connectors, cables and other components ― that are produced exclusively by a single company. TransDigm buys these producers and Pharma Bros them, dramatically inflating the price to exploit their monopoly. Bloomberg via Getty Images Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) cited examples of TransDigm price hikes, including a cable assembly that went from $1,737 to $7,863 and a motor rotor that had been $654 now going for $5,474. Khanna’s letter cited five specific aerospace parts the company had jacked the price on, including a “cable assembly” that went from $1,737.03 to $7,863.00 after being acquired by TransDigm. The price of a TransDigm “motor rotor” soared from $654.46 to $5,474.00. But the practice is widespread throughout TransDigm. The company’s own filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission state that 80 percent of its sales come from parts for which TransDigm believes itself to be a monopolist. Not all of the company’s parts even work. In 2016, The Washington Post reported that drones were crashing due to faulty starter-generators supplied by a TransDigm subsidiary. “The president is asking for $54 billion more on defense,” Khanna told The Huffington Post. “How much money are we wasting on monopolistic behavior?” The Pentagon has rules designed to defend itself against predatory pricing. Companies that function as the sole vendors of supplies have to detail their costs to the government, which allows the firms to reap a reasonable profit margin over and above these expenses. But Khanna’s letter argued that TransDigm evaded these rules by setting up “a network of captive distributors” ― middlemen who sold to the government, creating the illusion of an actual competitive market. “TransDigm isn’t a business, it’s the abuse of monopoly power so extreme it borders on performance art,” according to Matthew Stoller, a fellow with the New America Foundation’s Open Markets division. “Congress should investigate this aggressively.” No less than 12 TransDigm subsidiaries failed to disclose to the Defense Department in their procurement filings that they were owned by TransDigm, according to Khanna. TransDigm did not respond to requests for comment. The company’s chief executive, W. Nicholas Howley, received $18.7 million in 2016 ― more than the chief executives of Apple, Boeing or Citigroup. Khanna’s interest in the TransDigm case reflects a broader concern in Washington over concentrated economic power. In early March, the Center for American Progress hosted a forum on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, focused on his antitrust record. Tom Perriello, the leading Democrat vying for the Virginia governorship this year, has made tackling monopolies a central plank in his economic platform. And outrage over EpiPen price hikes and Big Pharma monopolies have stained the reputations of popular Democratic Party politicians, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Khanna didn’t discover the TransDigm mess on his own. He was tipped off by a trade newsletter called The Capitol Forum, headed by Executive Editor Teddy Downey. The Capitol Forum isn’t a household name and doesn’t generate massive internet traffic, but it wields significant influence due to its subscriber base of lawyers, investors and federal employees interested in its technical dispatches detailing fraud and abuse. “To what extent are they hiding that TransDigm is selling these parts through layers of distributors?” Downey said. “That’s where I think the policy problem is.” Khanna is waiting to hear back from the Defense Department before taking further action, but he hasn’t ruled out a congressional investigation. “This is a bipartisan issue,” Khanna told HuffPost. “There are many of my Republican friends who want to see our dollars going to troops and readiness and not to anticompetitive behavior.” Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?

News Business Business News Eurogroup head pressured to quit after 'sexist, racist' remarks about 'women and drink' Jeroen Dijsselbloem said Southern European countries were like a man who had spent all his money on 'women and drink' and so can't ask Northern European countries to help them out Maria Tadeo, Corina Ruhe @mariatad Thursday 23 March 2017 09:40 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The comments come “from a tough Dutch Calvinistic culture, with Dutch directness,” Dijsselbloem said in the Hague on Wednesday Francois Lenoir/Reuters Jeroen Dijsselbloem faced pressure to resign as head of the euro area’s finance ministers after comments he made on the obligations of aid-receiving countries were seen as both offensive and widening the north-south divide in Europe. “I can’t spend all my money on women and drink and then at the end ask for your help,” Mr Dijsselbloem was cited as saying in an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published on Monday, alluding to the solidarity northern euro countries had shown with southern countries during the region’s crisis. “This principle holds at personal, local, national and also at European level.”  The remarks from Mr Dijsselbloem, whose position at the head of the European body had already been weakened by the poor showing of his party in the Dutch general elections this month, drew a sharp response from Portugal, Spain and Greece, all countries that received aid during the financial crisis. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa called the comments “xenophobic, racist and sexist,” while the Greek government said they “aren’t helfpul.” Read more UK must obey EU rules or lose position as finance hub, says Eurogroup The row underscores the simmering tensions between core northern European economies and the weaker periphery nations including Greece, Ireland and Portugal that had to implement unpopular reforms and budget cuts in exchange for financial aid from the region. While Mr Dijsselbloem said he regretted that his remarks had caused offence, he said he had no intention of resigning. The comments come “from a tough Dutch Calvinistic culture, with Dutch directness,” he said in the Hague on Wednesday. “I understand that this is not always well understood and appreciated elsewhere in Europa. That is another lesson I have to learn. The comment on drink and women was about myself. I said that I cannot expect to spend my money in a wrong way and then ask for financial support.” Read more Euro group chief warns Britain against tax haven temptation UK's stance 'incompatible' with smooth Brexit, says Eurogroup head UK must obey EU rules or lose position as finance hub, says Eurogroup Greece debt crisis: Greek finance minister turns up to Eurogroup Eurogroup sees 'little chance' of progress until after referendum, as Portugal’s Costa said on Wednesday that with views like the ones expressed in the interview, it was unacceptable for Mr Dijsselbloem to continue to head the Eurogroup. “In a serious Europe, Mr Dijsselbloem would have been dismissed by now,” he said. “It’s not acceptable that someone who has his behavior, who has a xenophobic, racist and sexist view about a part of the countries of the European Union, can be president of an entity like the Eurogroup.” Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos, who lost his bid to become head of the Eurogroup to Mr Dijsselbloem in 2015, said he was surprised by the Dutch finance minister’s comments. While Spain received aid to rescue its banking system in 2012, it has also contributed to each bailout package even as its public finances came under strain, a Spanish official added. “At a time when Europe seeks its next steps, statements that widen the north-south divide aren’t helpful,” Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters in Athens. Apology Demanded Beyond southern Europe, EU Competition Commissioner and former Danish economy minister Margrethe Vestager said in Brussels on Wednesday that Mr Dijsselbloem’s comments were “wrong.” Business picture of the day 37 show all Business picture of the day 1/37 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

News Business Business News Hungary threatens to ban Heineken over 'communist' red star logo Government in Budapest pushes for fines and even prison sentences for anyone selling products featuring totalitarian symbols Zoltan Simon Thursday 23 March 2017 14:38 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The Budapest government accused Heineken of bullying a small, partly ethnic-Hungarian owned brewer in neighbouring Romania Getty Who would have thought Heineken would be seen as a symbol of Communist oppression? That’s what’s happening in Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s ruling party has filed a bill to ban the vintage red-star logo featured on products including the beermaker’s iconic green bottles. Accusing Amsterdam-based Heineken of bullying a small, partly ethnic-Hungarian owned brewer in neighbouring Romania after the Dutch company won a patent dispute there, the government in Budapest is pushing for fines and even prison sentences for anyone selling products featuring totalitarian symbols. That includes the red star that’s also associated with the Communist regime that ruled Hungary for more than four decades last century. Read more Tesco has stopped selling Heineken beers because of Brexit “We believe we have to defend every Hungarian brand when someone wants to use its market dominance to squeeze out others,” Lajos Kosa, the parliamentary leader, told reporters on Tuesday. The bill banning totalitarian symbols and the Heineken case is the “confluence of two issues,” he said. The ruling Fidesz party is also trying to narrow the scope of the bill to ensure products including Converse shoes and San Pellegrino bottled water, which also feature the red star, aren’t affected, Kosa said. Read more Hungary rejects widely condemned ban of immigrants Hungary's shock vote on refugees doesn't make it the EU exception Heineken snaps up Kirin's Brazilian assets Mega brewers Heineken and AB InBev dominating beer market That’s rekindled questions about government interference in the private sphere via targeted legislation, a recurring complaint from investors that helped pushed Hungary down to 69th place in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index last year from 52nd place in 2010 when Orban returned to power. Heineken rejected the association that its star is a symbol of communism, saying brewers have used the logo since the Middle Ages. Its points represent beer’s ingredients: water, barley, hops, yeast, and a fifth that comprises the “magic of brewing”. “Naturally, the red Heineken star has no political meaning whatsoever, and we use the same brand symbols across the world, in every market,” the company said in a statement. “We will closely monitor this local matter and hope and trust that this matter will be resolved soon.” Kosa conceded that the bill had caveats and that the ruling party would modify it to make it conform to international law and also to protect retailers.

Latest news headlines from Zimbabwe Situation Skip to content Home Latest TEXT ONLY Sources Lists Archives About “Zimbabwe Situation” Friends Support us Advertise Air Zim fails to submit financials in 8 years By ZimSitRep_M | March 22, 2017 2 Comments Source: Air Zim fails to submit financials in 8 years – DailyNews Live 22 March 2017 HARARE – State-owned Air Zimbabwe (Air Zim) has failed to fulfil the obligation to submit financial statements for audit for the past eight years. The insolvent airline – grappling with $300 million in debt – is currently working on the 2010 financial statements, according to the office of the Auditor-General (AG). The primary objective of an audit is to express an opinion on the set of accounts audited. “Its accounts were not submitted for audit, again,” said a damning report by the Office of the AG on parastatals and State enterprises tabled in the National Assembly last week. “Air Zimbabwe and its subsidiaries’ audits in progress and being finalised are for the year 2010.” Chapter 22:19 of the Public Finance Management Act requires all accounts of parastatals to be made up yearly to the end of the financial year. These accounts are to be made up no later than 30 days post-yearend to which they are related, for auditing by the AG soon after. Despite this legal requirement, Air Zimbabwe is in violation for late lodgement of annual records during an eight-year period from 2009, it was disclosed in the AG report first handed to Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa by swashbuckling AG Mildred Chiri. The responsibility of submitting financial statements for the loss-making carrier lies solely with the chief executive Ripton Muzenda and the airline’s chief operations officer (COO) Simba Chikoore – who is also President Robert Mugabe’s son-in-law. Air Zim appointed Muzenda as its new CEO with effect from August 15 last year, taking over from Edmund Makona who has been acting CEO since 2013. Chikoore, who is said to be a qualified pilot and is married to Mugabe’s only daughter Bona – joined former Air Zim captain Muzenda, a relative of the late vice president Simon Muzenda, in October last year. The loss-making carrier, which claims it is in talks with two strategic partners to clear money owed to foreign creditors and raise capital to allow for the resumption of long haul flights, according to the new CEO, has been rapped by the AG for failing to subject its annual financial statements for audit. Yet information contained in the financial statements is required in commercial negotiations. Like most State-owned firms, Air Zim has been making losses for years due to mismanagement, high operating costs, old equipment and aircraft that are no longer profitable to fly. Air Zim’s under resourced and old fleet comprises two Boeing 767s, three 737s, three MA60s and two Airbus A320s. However, only four of those are flying – one airbus, one Boeing 767, one 737 and an MA60. International Air Transport Association (Iata) also suspended Air Zim from its account settlement system in 2012 due to non-payment of $4m in fees. The association’s system settles accounts between the world’s airlines, airline-associated companies and travel agencies. While no comment could be immediately obtained from the stuttering carrier, Muzenda told a parliamentary portfolio committee on Transport last month that the national flag carrier was working towards gaining Iata re-admission by May 31 this year. The airline’s debt comprises salary arrears, outstanding taxes, payments to the national pension fund and employee health insurance and foreign debts of $300m.

Wright Electric says that removing the need for aviation fuel would bring down the cost of short-haul flying and mean that airliners were quieter and greener. The Massachusetts-based company told investors that its goal was for all short-haul flights to be electric within the next 20 years. Its team includes designers with experience at companies including Boeing and Cessna who will work alongside the inventor Chip Yates, whose Long-ESA design is the fastest electric plane on record. Wright Electric is relying on rapid advances in battery technology to enable electric flights with a 300-mile range. Companies are investing heavily… Want to read more?

But they may find the seats in the front of the plane going unfilled after the U.S. and U.K. banned large electronics in the cabin on some flights from the region. Their European rivals appear best placed to capitalize on the needs of higher paying passengers who refuse to be separated from their devices. By Wednesday, Qatar Airways flights from Doha to the U.S. were already operating under the new restrictions, which U.S. and U.K. authorities say are based on concerns that devices larger than a smartphone could carry explosives. Affected airlines have until Saturday morning to abide by the new rules. Wall Street analysts are already warning that business travelers may change who they fly with if they can’t get work done on their laptops or tablets. Long flights from the Middle East and Africa back to the U.S. offer business travelers invaluable time that they can often use to toil away uninterrupted by phone calls or personal commitments. “Hubs that don’t impede the productivity of long-haul business travelers (such as Frankfurt, Paris, and so forth) could logically be expected to” charge a premium ticket price “at the expense of the Middle East,” wrote JPMorgan airline analyst Jamie Baker. Baker said in a research note Wednesday that European airlines are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of the electronics ban. Germany and France, home to global carriers Lufthansa and Air France, have not matched the restrictions put in place by the U.S. and the U.K. He also pointed to “the tech-heavy corridor between the U.S. and India” as one where significant numbers of business travelers could choose to avoid transfers at Middle East airports. But Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths said he thinks only “a very tiny proportion” of travelers will change airlines. “I don’t think it will have a big impact on numbers,” he told local radio, as long as “we are very, very diligent in both communicating to people exactly what the restrictions are and actually have an efficient process to deal with the situation.” Aviation information provider Flightglobal estimates the nine affected airlines under the U.S. ban have about 18,000 seats each day flying from their Middle East and North African hubs directly to the U.S. on 50 routes. Carriers in Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have bought hundreds of new jets to open new routes across the planet, much to the consternation of big U.S. and European airlines. But after years of blistering growth, carriers like Emirates, Etihad Airways and Turkish Airlines had started to struggle even before this week’s new security restrictions added to their difficulties. They were already suffering from falling revenues as a result of increased competition for cheap fares, terrorism concerns and the Trump Administration’s efforts to ban travelers from some Muslim-majority nations. “It’s not helping,” said Emirates President Tim Clark in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. “Hey ho, there are other years to come.” Emirates is still putting on a brave face. After the new restrictions were announced Tuesday, it sent a tweet touting its elaborate inflight entertainment systems fitted in the seats aboard its Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s that fly to the U.S. “Who needs tablets and laptops anyway?” it asked. However, the practicality of checking electronics may collide with corporate cybersecurity rules. Policies at government agencies, financial institutions or aerospace and defense contractors, for example, prohibit laptops from being stored in checked luggage for fear of theft of sensitive or proprietary data. One frequent business traveler who works in Southern California for an aerospace company told CNNMoney he was rebooking an April trip from the U.S. to the United Arab Emirates because of the new restrictions. The sensitive data he travels with doesn’t allow him to separated from his laptop while traveling internationally. The new itinerary he was considering involves an extra stop from the U.S. through London on Qatar Airways. Qatar was included in the U.S. ban, but not the U.K. one. Royal Jordanian, the airline with which he initially booked, was on both. He said he was waiting to rebook to make sure other countries didn’t join in the ban. The Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration have yet to offer an explanation of why airports in Qatar and the U.A.E. are included in their ban, but excluded from the U.K.’s. “Reasons that are best known to themselves,” Clark said. “Of course it’s hugely disruptive.” — Zahraa Alkhalisi contributed to this report.

Asia’s biggest carrier by passengers, is in advanced talks to sell a stake to American Airlines, according to people familiar with the matter. The negotiations focus on an investment of about US$200 million by Fort Worth, Texas-based American in China Southern’s Hong Kong-listed shares, said the people, asking not to be identified as talks are confidential. The sale likely would take place through a private placement, one of the people said. China Southern has a market value of about US$10 billion. An investment in China Southern would allow American, already the world’s largest carrier, to strengthen its presence in a market that the International Air Transport Association predicts will surpass the US to become the world’s biggest in terms of passenger numbers by 2024. Delta Air Lines acquired a minority stake in China Eastern Airlines Corp. in 2015. Under the discussions, American would nominate an observer without voting rights to the Chinese company’s board, the people said. Details of a deal are subject to change and a transaction could still fall through. A spokesman for American Airlines declined to comment. China Southern representatives couldn’t immediately comment when reached after regular business hours. China Southern and its subsidiaries have ordered more than US$15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus since 2015 as more people fly in the world’s most populous nation. China Southern and Delta are members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. American is in the competing Oneworld group, which doesn’t have a China-based partner. Such alliances make it easier for passengers to fly around the world by combining schedules through one carrier and allowing travellers to accrue and use frequent-flier miles across airlines. China Eastern also is a SkyTeam member. A China Southern stake sale would represent the Chinese government’s efforts to diversify ownership of state-controlled enterprises. Authorities have urged firms in industries including power, energy, defence and aviation to take measures this year to broaden ownership. China Southern is the last of the nation’s top three airlines to bring in a non-mainland Chinese strategic investor. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., which is based in Hong Kong, owns about 18 per cent of flagship Air China Ltd. Besides Delta, Shanghai-based China Eastern also counts online travel-services provider Ctrip.com International Ltd. among its shareholders. American recently received a six-month extension, until September, to begin flights between Los Angeles and Beijing because it was unable to secure viable slots from the Chinese government. The airline connects 350 destinations in 50 countries, mostly in North America, the Caribbean, South America and Europe. It has flights from major US cities to Beijing and Shanghai. China Southern -- with a fleet of 684 aircraft as of June 2016, the largest in Asia -- flies to 208 destinations across 40 countries and has been expanding on routes to Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia.   Most Popular Viewed 1 China is on the path to global technology dominance 2 The reason China won’t exert economic pressure on North Korea 3 For Hong Kong’s housing squeeze, the easy fix is ... 4 Hong Kong’s future as a bridge from China to Southeast Asia 5 Malaysia’s Najib takes aim at Mahathir’s legacy Shared 1 China is on the path to global technology dominance 2 The reason China won’t exert economic pressure on North Korea 3 For Hong Kong’s housing squeeze, the easy fix is ... 4 Hong Kong’s future as a bridge from China to Southeast Asia 5 Malaysia’s Najib takes aim at Mahathir’s legacy Commented 1 Will the next chief executive be gutsy enough to tackle the mainland invasion? 2 China is on the path to global technology dominance 3 The chief executive election Hong Kong could have had 4 Working against Lam could backfire for pan-dems 5 Let’s face it: Hong Kong just can’t fix its illegal parking problem       You may also like World Chinese elders’ Canada immigration bids bog down in Hong Kong 23 Mar 2017 - 12:58pm 27 Smart-home control is at your fingertips In partnership with: HKT PREMIER China Chinese soccer fans flock to the streets after surprise win over South Korea 24 Mar 2017 - 8:41am 22 Style Independent watchmakers put their creativity on show 23 Mar 2017 - 12:38pm China 300 flights axed as Beijing airport shuts runway for repairs 23 Mar 2017 - 11:40pm China Hong Kong hopes for boom from AIIB club 24 Mar 2017 - 12:00am 11 Food & Drink The search for Hong Kong’s best Sunday roasts with the trimmings 24 Mar 2017 - 12:03pm 14 Companies Hong Kong home prices to remain buoyant, Li says 23 Mar 2017 - 12:12am 21 China How China’s overseas property dream turned into a nightmare 21 Mar 2017 - 6:09am 45 Hong Kong Hong Kong bans imports of Brazilian meat amid safety scandal 22 Mar 2017 - 5:16pm 10 Tech Chinese QR code scams shine spotlight on consumer security 22 Mar 2017 - 6:13am 7 China Why China stoking anger over South Korea missile system is doomed to fail 23 Mar 2017 - 5:27am 35 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

US President Donald Trump's new budget includes a sharp uptick in funding for the program, which the Air Force says is vital to maintaining air superiority through the next two decades. The US has been inventing new aerial threats at a torrid pace since 2001, first deploying the F-22 Raptor in 2005 before clearing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for combat in 2015. © AP Photo/ LM Ottero Lockheed Martin Decides Not to Sue Government Over F-35 Contract The service is "trying to get this started," Lt. General Arnold Bunch said during a conference on March 22. The US Air Force believes that by investing in the right technologies, it will make smarter decisions in the future, he said. With such investment, the Air Force can “make smart decisions” and "evolve those technologies on multiple fronts." Former President Barack Obama’s administration asked for the Air Superiority 2030 report to be completed in 2017, according to Defense News. When the Air Force released its study to the public, at least one conclusion came as no surprise: the program would require more funding to "adhere to that vision" of Air Superiority 2030. © YouTube/Sikorsky/arronlee33 US Marines' New Chopper to Be More Expensive Than F-35 Disaster "We need to have something by the late 2020s," Brigadier General Alexus Grynkewich said last year, adding that 2028 seemed like a "realistic timeline" to "have some initial operational capability of a penetrating counter air (PCA) capability." The NGAD or PCA jet is planned to eventually replace the Boeing F-15 and Lockheed Martin F-22, the National Interest reported in October. The PCA is a "family of capabilities" that includes, in addition to the actual jet, a host of logistics systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and communications platforms. ...

America is in serious trouble and not one weapon of war will reduce this danger. Lies are killing America, More lies are not going to slow or stop this. If the F-35 program was supposed to produce a top notch aircraft it would have done that long ago. Russia managed this with ease. So the plan is not the public plan but another plan, Seeing the cash involved and the failure to produce it is pretty plain that a big game of theft is afoot.

Washington Health Plan Finder The Trumpcare Vote in the House Is Still Scheduled for Today: But it looks like the GOP could be short of votes to repeal and replace Obamacare. The ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus is meeting with President Trump today to try and negotiate even more cuts to regulations that ensure basic health insurance coverage (like maternity care, emergency services, and check-ups, the New York Times reports). This Could Scare Off Moderate Republicans: Like Washington State's own Jaime Herrera-Beutler, who released a statement saying she couldn't support the GOP replacement bill in its current form. “While I appreciate this week's effort by Speaker Ryan and his leadership team to better protect older Americans from health care cost increases, the difficulties this bill would create for millions of children were left unaddressed," Herrera-Beutler said. During a House Rules Committee hearing yesterday, Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA) also expressed concern about an estimate from the Washington State Insurance Commissioner that 700,000 people in the state could lose coverage under the GOP plan. Seattle Police Fished a Burglary Suspect Out of the Duwamish River: The suspect, who was in a kayak, allegedly pepper sprayed a man who confronted him, then jumped out of the kayak and into the river. "Police say the suspect spent nearly an hour in the water until the Seattle Fire Department cut a hole in the floor of the boathouse and grabbed him," KING 5, which also filmed the low-speed aquatic struggle from the air, reports. "They took the kayak, too." Immigration Attorney Will Run for Sammamish City Council: Minal Ghassemieh is also a board chair at API Chaya, a nonprofit that supports survivors of sexual assault, trafficking, and domestic violence in Asian, South Asian, and Pacific Islander communities. “With the surge in hate crimes and divisiveness across the country, now is our time to be a leader," she said in a press release about her campaign. State and City Officials Consider Clearing the "Tacoma Jungle": Like the Jungle in Seattle, the "Tacoma Jungle" is a homeless encampment that exists under I-5. The Washington State Department of Transportation met with Tacoma city officials to discuss "cleaning and clearing" the Tacoma Jungle, though local homeless shelters are at capacity. Kent Police Officer Shoots Man Holding a Machete: Police were dispatched not long after midnight to a home in Des Moines for a report of someone armed with a knife. "Officers arrived on scene to find a man carrying a machete," KING 5 reports. "The subject was uncooperative with officers and refused to drop the weapon, according to a spokesperson with Des Moines Police." Governor Jay Inslee Is Speaking at the United Nations: Inslee will talk about "the role West Coast states will play in the global effort on climate change and sustainable development" on the panel “Stocktaking on Climate –Ambition and Action.” Over the last two years, Inslee's carbon pricing ambitions have not yielded much action from the state legislature. Dennis McLerren, former regional EPA manager, says that losing federal and state environmental funding would "tip us in the wrong direction." SB Local Environmental Groups Urge State to Fund Puget Sound Cleanup if Feds Cut EPA, NOAA Budgets: Representatives from groups like the Lower Duwamish Cleanup Coalition and Puget Soundkeeper rallied at Waterfront Park yesterday to express concern over the Trump budget blueprint that slashes 31 percent of EPA funding and all money for Puget Sound cleanup. Chris Wilke, executive director of Puget Soundkeeper, said that while the EPA has been muzzled, he had heard advice from an EPA employee that if those budget cuts become realized, "don't drink the water." But will state lawmakers step up to fill the void created by lack of federal funding? Environmental groups say that budget deliberations in Olympia threaten local environmental priorities, too. Local scientific research, the shellfish industry, tourism, and efforts to save salmon runs and endangered killer whales are at stake. Alaska Airlines Is Killing the Virgin America Brand: Alaska acquired the airline last year, and now say the name and logo could expire by 2019. But in order to offer similar Virgin America experiences, Alaska Airlines says that they will offer "blue mood lighting" and high speed wireless on their Boeing jets. Regional Secession Movements Are Thriving: “On election night, we had 100,000 hits to our website, which is a very large spike for us," Brandon Letsinger, founder of the Seattle nonprofit Cascadia Now told Oregon Public Broadcasting. "And we sold out of flags — which we thought we’d be stocked to 2017 — that day." Do Rural Trump Voters Deserve Sympathy? Eli, Dan, and Rich discuss a piece by Frank Rich that argues they don't on the latest Blabbermouth.

The Boeing MD-83 was supposed to take the team to the Big Ten Tournament in Washington, D.C., but ran off the runway at Willow Run Airport near Ypsilanti "after executing a rejected takeoff," according to a preliminary report released by the NTSB on Tuesday, March 21. In an update on Wednesday, the department revealed a mechanical issue was found on the aircraft during the ongoing investigation - a damaged component of the airplane's right elevator. Witnesses recall Michigan basketball's plane wreck; the pilot 'saved our lives' Elevators are the primary way to control a plane's pitch - nose up and nose down, according to the NTSB. Investigators determined the right elevator on the aircraft was jammed in a nose down position and a component of the right elevator - the right elevator geared tab inboard pushrod linkage - was damaged and restricting movement of the right elevator surface, but allowing movement of the control tab on the elevator. According to the National Transportation Board, the March 10, 2017, image depicts the displaced inboard elevator geared tab linkage, highlighted by the arrow, from Ameristar Air Cargo Inc., flight 9363, that went off the runway on March 8. The red piece of metal is included in the image for reference only an is not part of the elevator system, according to the board.Courtesy of NTSB  According to the National Transportation Safety Board, this graphic shows a diagram of one of two elevators of the MD-83 involved in the March 8, 2017, rejected takeoff and runway excursion at Willow Run Airport near Ypsilanti, Michigan. The elevators are the primary means of controlling the airplane's pitch.Courtesy of NTSB  The flight data recorder showed that both elevators moved normally two days prior, when the plane was flown to the Willow Run Airport, but during the taxi and take-off roll on the day of the crash, the right elevator did not move, according to NTSB. The NTSB statement said: "During takeoff roll, the left elevator began a large airplane nose-up movement (consistent with rotation) at an airspeed of about 152 knots and continued for five seconds to about 166 knots. There was no change in the airplane pitch attitude during this time. The airplane data then are consistent with the takeoff being rejected. The maximum recorded airspeed was about 173 knots." The plane went through a fence and over a service road before coming to a stop, from what could be seen at the airport, and the NTSB confirmed that the 109 passengers and seven crew members exited the plane using escape slides. Air control tower was evacuated when UM basketball team plane wrecked Flight and cabin crewmembers indicated that all slides, except that of the right forward door, deployed correctly, according to the NTSB update. The right forward door slide will now be examined by investigators. The NTSB noted that the investigation into the accident could take 12 to 18 months and no conclusions should be drawn from the update released Wednesday. Also party to the investigation is the Federal Aviation Administration, The Boeing Company and the plane's operator, Ameristar Jet Charter Inc., referred to as Ameristar Air Cargo Inc. by NTSB. University of Michigan basketball player Derrick Walton Jr. appears to be the only one injured in the incident, requiring stitches. The team went on to win the Big Ten Tournament and now continues compete in the NCAA Tournament.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Stirling's new industrial facility well on its way to being completed Wednesday Mar 22, 2017 at 5:42 PM Mar 23, 2017 at 8:53 AM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes VICTORVILLE — Progress toward completing Stirling Development’s new facility at Southern California Logistics Airport is well on its way as announced during a wall titling event Wednesday. Construction for the new Distribution Centre 18, a 370,023-square-foot industrial facility located at SCLA in Victorville, first broke ground late last year. Workers now are ahead of schedule, despite previous rainstorms and other weather conditions, while also drawing the attention of many in the manufacturing industry. President and CEO of Stirling Development Dougall Agan told the Daily Press that as testimony to high user demand within the region, the facility has already been 42 percent pre-leased to Plastipak Packaging Inc., a world leader in the design and manufacture of high-quality, rigid plastic containers for the food, beverage and consumer products industries. “None of this would’ve been made possible without everyone's partnership," Agan said. “Today we’re here to celebrate all the workers and everyone's help and support on this project. We’re looking to have the building finished by July.” Agan said the facility is looking to add about 200 jobs to the region while Stirling Development is also in the process of another project that Agan said “we cannot yet discuss.” Representatives from the city attended the event in support of Stirling, including Mayor Gloria Garcia and San Bernardino County 1st District Supervisor Robert Lovingood, who spoke on behalf of Stirling's accomplishments. They both presented Agan with a certificate of recognition. “Stirling's commitment to the Victor Valley continues to pay off and we look forward to seeing what they have in store next,” Lovingood told the crowd. Situated on just over 19 acres at the southeast corner of Phantom West and George Boulevard, DC 18 will include 53 dock-high doors, two ground-level doors, 32-inch clear height, "green" building design features, 186 auto stalls, 75 truck stalls, a fenced yard and on-site property management. Plastipak currently occupies more than 312,000 square feet within SCLA, including two small warehouse locations and one 296,490-square-foot manufacturing facility. It will utilize the new facility for warehousing needs and plans to expand its presence within SCLA once the property is completed this summer. SCLA, the former home of George Air Force Base, is an 8,500-acre multimodal freight transportation hub and is also home to many companies, such as Boeing, Dr. Pepper Snapple, Exel Logistics, Fastenal, FedEx, General Electric, Leading Edge, Newell Brands, Pacific Aviation Group, Plastipak Packaging, Pratt & Whitney, Red Bull, Sparkletts, Solar City Corporation and United Furniture Industries.
