Boeing is analysing two potential designs for a plane that is expected to be called the 737 MAX 10 and would be the largest aircraft in the 737 line. Boeing has held recent discussions with airlines and aircraft leasing firms to gauge interest in such a plane, said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and confirmed a Bloomberg News report. Such a plane would address an important gap between the 737 MAX 9, which can transport 200 travellers and the Airbus plane, which holds up to 240 passengers. The A321Neo has given the edge to the European giant in the lucrative market for middle-range planes, with orders running about 1,000 above those for Boeing’s 737 line, according to data released by the companies. “We continue to look at the higher end of the MAX family,” said Boeing spokesman Doug Alder. “The needs of our airline customers, as well as the business case, will drive our decision and timing.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Boeing sees US$2.1b cost on 787 dreamliners, air tanker Boeing eyes rivals as it turns 100 Ganti cermin retak, Rayani Air terpaksa sewa pesawat Malaysia Airlines Boeing 737 MAX jet completes first flight (VIDEO) Aircraft leasing firm BOC Aviation places order for 22 Boeing B737s Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Spectators and military personnel watch a Jan. 28 missile defense test launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base. (Gene Blevins / Zumapress.com) To the editor: Isn’t this exactly the corruption lurking in the military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned about? ( “Boeing wins big bonuses after failures,” Sept. 4) My heart sinks when I think of the national treasure that has been squandered for decades on gold-plated, ineffective weapons programs such as this. Thank you so much for unearthing this colossal waste of public money. Kent Strumpell, Los Angeles :: To the editor:  So, Boeing has developed a missile that travels at 4 miles a second, that can hit a missile coming at the United States at probably about the same speed, a target which is only about the size of a bus.

I suggest that we buy fewer tanks, fighter planes and ships (used in the last century’s wars) and buy 300 of these antimissiles. On the bonus to Boeing, it’s less than 10%. The company earned it. Jeffrey Pierce, Torrance :: To the editor: Boeing is indeed the master of spin. Billing the taxpayers for failure — no problem. But use these billions to clean up the highly contaminated site it is responsible for at the Santa Susana Field Lab? Nope. Nearby residents have been waiting for years for proper cleanup of the contaminated soil and water. Boeing did not have to wait for its unearned bonuses — why should residents have to wait and continue to fight for a healthy environment? Catherine Lincoln, Van Nuys :: To the editor: Like most readers, I am outraged, but perhaps for a different reason. The argument is that outsourcing provides superior results at lower costs. The problem is that senior government positions are too often held by bureaucrats rather than technocrats (people who understand what they are contracting for). Technical people will tell you that arcane procedures meant to protect against favoritism actually encourage it. Having different contractors write the requirements, determine the products/procedure the project should use, and implement the solution ensures that knowledge about the problem is compromised, if not lost. Also allowing a retiring bureaucrat to join a contracting firm one year (or 180 days in California) after leaving government pretty much explains to me how this drama unfolded. Keep it simple. My suggestions: Pay to hire technical managers who understand what they are purchasing, change the law so no one can leave the government and go to work for a contractor for seven or more years, and keep the bidding/purchasing process as simple as possible. Kay Hammer, Venice :: To the editor: The American taxpayers paid billions of dollars for a missile defense system that essentially doesn’t work, and then gave Boeing billions in bonuses. This is why I believe people vote for someone such as Donald Trump — not because he has any idea what he’s talking about, which he doesn’t; not because he tells the truth, which he apparently can’t; not because he’s the best one for the job, which he isn’t — but because they are so tired of this kind of corruption and ineptitude that they just say “screw it.” Such is the delicate architecture of history.

On behalf of "Boeing" R. Conner expressed his sincere and deep condolences to the Government and people of Uzbekistan in connection with the passing of the First President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov. The high level of mutually beneficial and long-term cooperation with "Boeing" in the field of civil aviation is the result of all-round support of joint projects by the First President of our country Islam Karimov. Today, "Boeing" is a reliable partner of Uzbekistan in the sphere of supply, operation and maintenance of modern passenger aircraft. National airline "Uzbekistan Airways" operates 15 Boeing aircraft, which provide more than half of all traffic of the NAC and make a significant contribution to the strengthening of its position as one of the largest and fastest growing airlines in the region. On the eve of the Independence Day, the park of the National airlines was supplemented with the most modern and comfortable aircraft Boeing – "787 Dreamliner." The new plane started its flights already on September 5, with the flights to Urgench, Bukhara, Nukus. From the next week it is planned to conduct international flights. In November of this year, Uzbekistan will receive the second "Dreamliner." Intensive collaboration is carried out in the field of training of flight personnel and specialists, including by equipping the training centre of our airline with complex equipment. A new joint project – the regional center for repair of large composite structural elements of modern aircraft on the base of aviation enterprise "Uzbekistan Airways technics” was launched in January this year. Raymond Conner expressed his sincere appreciation for the support of joint projects and assured of the readiness of the company to continue the mutually beneficial and fruitful cooperation with Uzbek partners.

(Marc Fiorito/Gamma Nine) Share Written by Aimee Groth Obsession Life as Laboratory September 08, 2016 Black Rock City, Nevada Just before dawn on Sept. 3, 2015, about 100 people gathered in the middle of the Nevada desert for a send-off party. It was a black-tie occasion, Burning-Man style: extravagant feather headdresses, black fishnet tights, white fur coats. They were there to bid a final farewell to Dan Fredinburg, aged 33, who had died four months earlier in an avalanche on Mt. Everest, triggered by the earthquake that killed thousands in Nepal. He had been there as part of an ambitious, some might say reckless mission: to get imagery from the summit of Everest for Google Street View, allowing anyone to see the panorama at the top of the world from within Google Maps. Fredinburg was head of privacy at Google X, the search giant’s “moonshots” division, and Everest was his own moonshot. He had narrowly evaded death on his first attempt to scale the mountain the year before, and had lobbied hard to win approval for a second expedition. And it was a group of like-minded thrill-seekers that largely orchestrated his send-off on the Nevada playa: Summit Series. The invitation-only organization’s stated mission is to “make no small plans,” and its members—totaling some 10,000 worldwide, though the core group is much smaller—elevate risk-taking above all else. Some are based in San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles, and some at the group’s headquarters: Powder Mountain in Eden, Utah, which its co-founders purchased for $40 million in 2013. Many are nomadic, embracing a carefree lifestyle, often fueled by a fortuitous tech IPO or acquisition. But they always find their way back to one another on the festival circuit, and Burning Man—a pop-up metropolis and rave in the desert that draws around 70,000 revelers—is one of those central points of reconnection. When the question “why?” is put before Fredinburg’s family and friends, many turn it around: “Why not?” In a community of risk takers, his endeavors were the status quo, something to aspire to. Indeed, far from deterring them, his death has galvanized Summit’s members to lean even harder into risk. Sitting on a broken couch at Summit’s Utah headquarters, a lodge overlooking the majestic Ogden Valley, Jeff Rosenthal, a Summit co-founder, said, “Attracting people like Dan is the greatest litmus test of whether we’re doing our job.” The Summit community gathered at Google engineer Dan Fredinburg’s memorial service in Napa Valley. Summit co-founder Jeff Rosenthal is front and center (red shoes); Ashley Arenson is second from right (black shirt). (Marc Fiorito/Gamma Nine) The path to Google Alfred Lin is a partner at Sequoia Capital, a venture firm that has invested in the most iconic entrepreneurs of our time, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and the PayPal Mafia (Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Max Levchin). He says the very best entrepreneurs, the truly unstoppable ones, all share a similar trait. “I’ve never met someone who is really well-adjusted who is an entrepreneur,” Lin explains. “They all have a chip on their shoulder, something to prove, and they do it.” Fredinburg certainly had something to prove. His parents, Paul Fredinburg, a bank appraiser, and Debbi Willis, a nurse, divorced when their son was young. He spent his school years in Arkansas, just on the periphery of the Deep South, with his mother and his older sister, Tricia, and summers with Tricia and their father and stepmother, Cathy, in Orange County, California. Fredinburg had a mischievous streak—his mother, he recalled, encouraged him to “break all the rules”—but his parents knew that he was smart and encouraged him to apply to the Arkansas School of Mathematics, Sciences and Arts (ASMSA), funded by Arkansas native President Bill Clinton. The school was his best chance at a life outside of Arkansas, but he risked getting kicked out for bad behavior. If not for a compassionate headmaster, his parents say, his life might have looked very different. “If he hadn’t graduated from ASMSA he wouldn’t have been accepted to the University of California system,” says Paul Fredinburg. “If he went back to the high school he was going to previously, he would have never been admitted.” At the University of California, Irvine, where he earned a computer science degree, his friends remember a very Southern Fredinburg—sometimes joking and playing into the stereotypes of the small-town Southern frat boy, but sometimes genuinely being one. “I don’t think he knew any different,” says Owen Egan, one of his fraternity brothers. “I don’t know how much exposure he had to other people his age at the time.” But UC Irvine was also where Fredinburg met someone who would turn out to be the key to his future: Alex Abelin, a student up the coast at Berkeley, whom he met at a fraternity event in 2002. Abelin would go on to work at Google, and when the two reconnected at a party a few years later, he recommended Fredinburg—by then working for Boeing’s Future Combat Systems division—for a job there. The sprawling, fast-growing tech giant, which he joined in October 2007, was arguably the perfect place for someone like Fredinburg to flourish. He was a skilled engineer; at Boeing he had developed a system to improve the security network even though he didn’t yet have a security clearance. But he also had a high emotional intelligence, a rare trait in Silicon Valley. (He never stopped honing it, either; after his death, his girlfriend Ashley Arenson discovered stacks of books on human psychology in his bedroom.) Combined, these two traits made him a powerhouse at hacking Google itself. Fredinburg got to know all the key players at the company, studying the organizational chart and determining who had influence where. “He would know everything about what was going on at Google, from politics to legal to pop culture,” says Nirdhar “Ninu” Khazanie, a Google product manager who was to become Fredinburg’s close lieutenant. Says Abelin: “Dan just knew how to beat systems. He was a master chess player. He knew the flaws and weaknesses of the people who interviewed him, and used that sixth sense against them so they felt he had to have a seat at the table. Once he got in, he did whatever he wanted.” That included making good use of the “20% time” that Google back then granted its employees to work on projects outside their core jobs. Paul and Cathy Fredinburg recall how their son always maxed out his travel budget and found ways to convince his managers to send him to exotic locations around the world, trips that he would segue into vacations. When Fredinburg married his college sweetheart Leslie Eggers in 2010, he negotiated his way to living in Zurich for a few months, which allowed for an extended European honeymoon. But as idyllic as the situation seemed, it wasn’t enough to ensure a happy marriage. Soon after returning to the states, Fredinburg and Eggers separated, though they never divorced. “That’s when Dan started [partying hard] and climbing mountains,” recalls Abelin. Alex Abelin speaking at Fredinburg’s Napa Valley memorial service. Abelin opened the most important doors in Fredinburg’s life—to Google, to Summit Series, to the people who would change the course of his life. (Marc Fiorito/Gamma Nine) Setting sights on Everest In October 2011, Fredinburg—by then one of the early members of Google’s privacy team—and a few other Googlers trekked to Everest Base Camp. They brought with them a wide-angle lens camera owned by the Google Street View team, which was busy capturing images of every road on the planet. The photos turned out to be good enough to publish. When he returned from the trip Fredinburg sent an email out to Google’s internal mountaineering group, asking if anyone wanted to join him on his next adventure. Only one person showed up to the video-conference: Michele Battelli, a member of the company’s Enterprise Search Group, who had just returned from a climbing trip in the Himalayan region of Ladakh in northwest India. The two had met some years before during an internal startup competition. They agreed to meet in Argentina in December 2011—less than a month later—to climb Mt. Aconcagua, one of the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each of the world’s seven continents. Although they nearly lost their toes, for fledgling mountaineers they fared well. Fredinburg again brought a Street View camera, and again the photos turned out well. Together he and Battelli co-founded a new team, which they called Google Adventures. Its mission: to scale and capture all Seven Summits for Street View. The photos from Mt. Aconcagua would be part of a portfolio that the two planned to use to make the ultimate pitch—asking Google to fund their expedition to Everest. First, though, Fredinburg needed some recovery time. Ever since separating from Eggers he had been operating at an extreme pace—climbing, partying, and experimenting with recreational drugs—and wanted to get grounded again. He asked Abelin to join him in doing a “Sober Q1” for the first quarter of 2012. Abelin agreed, and started inviting Fredinburg to charity galas in New York. At one of them he introduced Fredinburg to Amanda Slavin, a charismatic young woman who worked for the events team at Summit Series. Slavin recalls that Fredinburg was sporting a mohawk. He asked her why she found value in supporting charity when there were no clear returns. “He was kind of polarizing,” she says. “He had no real need or want to be a part of it. His mind was on logistics and engineering.” And yet, he was open to a new way of seeing things. “I told him that what I found is that when I do good, more comes back to me,” Slavin says. “A lightbulb went off for him.” By summer 2012, Fredinburg was ready for his next adventure. He and Battelli planned to scale Mt. Kilimanjaro that July—Africa’s highest peak, and the easiest of the Seven Summits to climb. Fredinburg even invited his younger half-sister, Megan Ezell, to join them, convincing her that it would be good for her college application. She agreed, and celebrated with the team by joining in a dance party once they reached the summit, watching as her brother jumped around in an orange “Pokey” cartoon character costume. So when Florian “Flo” Nagl, an online sales manager based in Google’s Dublin office—and arguably the best mountaineer in the company—sent out a message through the internal network asking if anyone wanted to join him in climbing Mt. Elbrus, the highest peak in Europe, Fredinburg and Battelli responded “yes” immediately. “In climbing terms [Kilimanjaro] is not a mountain, it’s a hike,” says Nagl. “Mt. Elbrus and Aconcagua are different; they require proper mountaineering. On these two mountains if you make a wrong decision it can be fatal.” Two other Googlers also opted in. At the last minute Battelli couldn’t make it, but the others continued with their plans. In August 2012, after a few days of partying, instigated by Fredinburg, the four trekked up Elbrus. It was brutal. One of the Googlers turned around early due to frostbite. For Fredinburg it was so physically and psychologically grueling that Nagl tied a leash around him and carried him the last 100 meters to the summit. “He had no orientation anymore, he was so altitude sick,” recalls Nagl, who is several inches shorter and has a slimmer frame. “On the summit he sank down. I got the [StreetView] equipment ready and told him to push the right buttons, and we got the collection in.” Fredinburg later joked about the experience on Facebook: “It didn’t feel badass,” he wrote to a friend. “It felt like I was absolutely going to die.” But the difficulty didn’t deter him. Instead, he was thrilled to have found such an experienced mountaineer in Nagl for his Seven Summits quest, and invited him to join the Google Adventures Team. He, Nagl and Battelli would go on to style themselves “the Three Musketeers.” “I’m the project manager,” Fredinburg told Nagl. “I’m the politician. I need someone on the ground to make sure it becomes a success. If one day we get to Everest I’ll make it happen, and you make sure we get to the summit.” The boy from rural Arkansas had come a long way. But he was about to take his skills to a whole new level. And once again his friend Alex Abelin would be the one to unlock the door. Dan 2.0 By the fall of 2012, Amanda Slavin—the Summit events team worker who had found Fredinburg “polarizing” when they first met—had left Summit to launch CatalystCreativ and produce events for Tony Hsieh, CEO of the online shoe store Zappos. As part of his own personal odyssey to reinvent business culture, Hsieh had launched the Downtown Project, an ambitious effort to revitalize the area around the Zappos headquarters in downtown Las Vegas. Hsieh wanted to attract enterprising, entrepreneurially minded people in the hope that they might contribute or invest in the area in some way. When Slavin invited Fredinburg to attend a retreat she and Hsieh called Catalyst Week, starting the week before Thanksgiving, he said yes. The week involved days of talks followed by nights of partying. The guest list consisted primarily of members of Summit Series. Invisible Children co-founder Bobby Bailey danced on stage to The Killers’ “All these things that I’ve done” as he talked about his organization’s campaign (later much criticized) against Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony. Adventure Project co-founder Becky Straw spoke about her mission to eradicate poverty. Fredinburg talked about patent trolls. (Google had offered pay bonuses for filing patents and he had filed a number of them.) The retreat culminated with an emotionally charged evening hosted by Slavin and Abelin. As part of a “vulnerability exercise,” attendees were invited to share their biggest weaknesses, or make a confession. Vulnerability is one of the key values of Summit Series, which likes to see itself as recognizing the shortcomings of the Silicon Valley myth. “In the tech space, there’s this success porn that’s propagated non-stop around unicorns,” says Andrew Horn, a Summit member and startup founder. “It creates this culture where everyone feels the need to propagate the image and aura of invincibility. Everyone is scared of sharing their struggle because they think it’ll alienate friends and investors.” Fredinburg, however, seemed conflicted. At one point he stood on the threshold, with one foot inside the room and the other outside in the hallway, scanning the room. His fraternity brothers happened to be in Vegas and were waiting for him out on the Strip, but he wanted to see what would happen next. Finally he made a choice, and stepped forward. “I feel like all of you guys have this incredible ability to feel all these emotions,” he said, eyes searching the room. “I have a Tin Man heart. A robot heart.” The engineer in Fredinburg was always looking for new ways to hack parts of his life, and now he was expressing a desire to reverse-engineer empathy. “In that moment when Dan spoke up, I decided I wanted to help that man find his heart,” says Nyla Rogers, founder of nonprofit Mama Hope. “He was looking for the biggest hearts that he knew, and he knew that we could help him.” Joining the Wolf Pack Fredinburg’s gesture sparked an initiation process. He was introduced to the Summit team and went on a New Year’s trip to Panama. There he met Sophia Bush, an actress who was one of Summit’s core members. She took to Fredinburg and invited him to attend one of the young organization’s traditions, Wolf Pack weekend, in early 2013. The tradition had begun a year earlier when the Summit founders invited around 50 of their closest friends, including Bush, to board a 737, and flew them to Eden, Utah. There they brought everyone to the top of Powder Mountain and told them they were going to buy the land and build a community there. The event’s guest list included those who were felt to embody the true Summit ethos. At first, the core group didn’t take well to Fredinburg. “Sophia brings Dan to Wolf Pack, Wolf Pack is family,” says Sean Carasso, founder of Falling Whistles, which campaigns for peace in the Congo. “It’s the nearest and dearest, the tried and true, the compatriots—and she brings Dan. In the beginning we’re like, ‘Who’s this clown?’ He was still so stiff. He was very engineer, very Google.” But Fredinburg’s relationship with Bush would be transformative. “Sophia completely changed the trajectory of Dan’s life,” says former Googler Max Goldstein. “This incredibly powerful, smart woman was madly in love with him and enabled him to operate at the highest levels of society and business.” Fredinburg, too, fell hard for Bush, and soon he was appearing on red carpets and gaining attention from paparazzi. The relationship also amplified Fredinburg’s pursuit of the Silicon Valley ideal. Bush introduced him to influential people. She also taught him, friends say, a skill that would stand him in good stead as he built towards his Everest expedition: creating compelling story arcs around adventures and connecting them to social enterprise. Sophia Bush “completely changed the trajectory of Dan’s life,” says former Googler Max Goldstein. (Jordan Strauss/AP) Around the same time, Fredinburg began working for Google X. Friends and family say he didn’t secure the job through the traditional channels of applying for one, but tailgated an employee into a building where he knew a Google X meeting was being held. There he pitched the Google X leadership, guided by the division’s head, Astro Teller, on involving his privacy team in their operations. (Teller declined to comment.) However it came about, soon Fredinburg and his team were involved in the company’s hottest projects: self-driving cars, Project Loon (an attempt to deliver high-speed Internet to remote regions of the world using a fleet of balloons), and smart contact lenses (embedded with a wireless chip that helps diabetics measure their glucose levels). With his newfound freedom and status, Fredinburg became obsessed with taking risks and plotting with graphs how he could use his networks. He would often strategize how to make the “maximum impact possible,” says Wayne Price, a filmmaker who is documenting the Summit story and met Fredinburg that fateful week in Las Vegas. His friends called the new phase of his life “Dan 2.0.” Jailbreaking By April 2013, the Google Adventures Team was ready to attempt another of the Seven Summits. These trips were still on their own dime and vacation time, but they carried the Street View equipment with them, and a few other Googlers had joined in. This time the target was Carstensz Pyramid, also known as Puncak Jaya, located off the coast of West Papua, New Guinea, and Indonesia’s highest peak. One of the party, Sara Pelosi, split her elbow on the trek up, and developed a fever, but she kept pressing on and they reached the summit. On the way down bad weather caught them. By now Pelosi was dehydrated and in bad shape. To get her back faster, most of the team opted to take a shortcut and go down through the Grasberg gold mine inside the mountain. But in the mine, Indonesian security forces stopped them. The Googlers were brought to a small jail cell. They explained that they had taken the shortcut so they could get back faster, but the guards accused them of trespassing—and worse, carrying drugs, an offense punishable in Indonesia by the death penalty. They poured out the packets of dry energy mix the Googlers were carrying and told their captives to drink it so that they could observe the effects. Then they demanded ransom. Fredinburg called the one person he knew would come through—Owen Egan, his fraternity brother from back in the days at UC Irvine. “I need your help,” he whispered over the phone into Egan’s voicemail. “We’re being held hostage.” He asked Egan to wire money to a bank in Bali. Egan says it was one of few times he had ever heard real fear in his friend’s voice. Egan called Andrew Swerdlow, one of Fredinburg’s closest colleagues at Google, who arranged the ransom, and they were let go. Friends and family say that Fredinburg managed to escape the Grasberg mine with a piece of gold, which he had made into a piece of jewelry for Bush. But Fredinburg’s friends also say that—notwithstanding Pelosi’s injury—he was planning to test his luck in the gold mine no matter what. “Dan wanted to get himself into prison,” says Nagl. “It’s an adventure. He wanted to get captured for the story.” He got his story, and the Google Adventures Team got their photos. And by now, after conquering four of the world’s Seven Summits, they were confident they could approach Google about funding a mission to Mt. Everest. They secured funding from the Emerging Markets team. That snowballed into funding from the Street View team, with matching funds from marketing, to send a crew of photographers to document the mission. They partnered with International Mountain Guides (IMG), a Seattle-based adventure-travel company, for their mission. All told, Google agreed to invest just shy of $1 million to fund their moonshot. “Dan loved the politics of Google,” says his friend and fellow engineer Mike “Doc” North. “For him there were two Everests: One was going out and climbing Everest, the other was getting Google to pay for him to climb Everest.” First attempt at Everest The Google Adventures Team named their expedition E14, short for “Everest 2014”. Everything was in place. Then, at Wolf Pack weekend in early 2014, just a few weeks before their departure, Bush ended her relationship with Fredinburg. He was devastated. Friends rallied to help him stay motivated for Everest. He spent the next couple of weeks at Sean Carasso’s place in Eden, Utah. “Somehow, he managed to get himself up every morning and carried a large backpack on his shoulders and climbed to the top of Powder Mountain,” says Carasso. “Every single day for a month, he did that.” A week before the trip, Fredinburg joined a group of friends at The Battery, a club in San Francisco. There he invited Price, the filmmaker, and a few others to join the first part of the expedition, to Everest Base Camp. Price noticed that his friend was still in rough shape from the breakup. Yet he agreed and purchased a ticket for Kathmandu for the following week. “No one else in the world could have convinced me to do that,” says Price.

Friends describe Fredinburg as a master game theorist—to the point of wanting to get into prison in order to see if he could escape. (Wayne Price/31 Squirrel) Fredinburg documented his 2014 climb in a series of Instagram images, many of which also included a related quote or reflection on the psychology behind the challenge: Day 25: The icefall is no different than anything else really. To get further, lean just slightly beyond the edge of fear and discomfort. Constantly. In everything you do. #everestawesome #deida A photo posted by Dan Fredinburg (@danfredinburg) on Apr 16, 2014 at 4:22pm PDT   Day 25: Scrawled on my thermos, "Imagine living your life without being afraid to take a risk and explore life." We shot straight up the middle of the icefall to familiarize ourselves. #khumbuicefall #everestawesome A photo posted by Dan Fredinburg (@danfredinburg) on Apr 16, 2014 at 12:54pm PDT But Google’s well-funded camp became a point of contention with other climbers. In a tense exchange, one woman in a neighboring camp made it clear to Fredinburg that her team would start climbing first thing the next morning, before the Google team. Although he consented, Fredinburg resolved that he wanted to be first and convinced his colleagues to depart for the Khumbu Icefall, Everest’s most treacherous zone, in the very early morning. They made their way through safely and arrived at Camp 1 just after dawn broke on April 17. The Three Musketeers triumphant in the Khumbu Icefall: Googlers Florian “Flo” Nagl, Fredinburg and Michele Battelli. They were stranded above the icefall for three days after the 2014 avalanche. Fredinburg’s competitiveness may have been unsporting, but it may also have saved their lives. Had they left the next day, there was a good chance they would have been caught in the deadliest day in Everest’s history up until that point. At 6:45am on April 18, 2014, an avalanche swept through just below the icefall, killing 16 Sherpas who were carrying supplies up for the next group of climbers. The Google team, having gone up the day before, were stranded above the icefall for three days. When they finally returned to Base Camp, Fredinburg infuriated other climbers by dressing in costume and dancing, as he had on Mt. Kilimanjaro. Nagl says he was just trying to break the tension. After the mountain was evacuated Fredinburg went on a 10-day vipassana (silent meditation retreat) in Nepal. He followed that with a trip to Thailand, where he partied hard. At a nightclub he created a VIP section in the center of the bar where he charged guests to enter, and they willingly paid him. “After escaping death, Dan had this newfound sense of confidence and invincibility,” says Breton Carasso, Sean’s brother. “Like he was unstoppable.” Reality distortion field Back in the US, newly single and riding on the hubris of defying death, Fredinburg sought out his close friends Doc North and Max Goldstein. He had another adventure in mind. “Dan wanted to go on a trip together somewhere between the Baltics and the Balkans,” says North, who owns engineering consultancy North Design Labs. “And he said that we needed to have some social good component around it, so we created Save The Ice (to bring awareness around climate change). Dan did some research to come up with the narrative. Around 1550, the Baltics faced the greatest threat of their time, fending off Ivan the Terrible. The Swedish Vikings came down through Scandinavia to support them. So we were Americans coming down from Sweden to fend off the greatest threat of our time: climate change.” They played the part, dressing in Viking costumes and driving around Europe in an art car, Burning Man-style, that they had decorated—somewhat ridiculously—to look like a ship. North and Fredinburg traveled together often and created a “reality distortion field,” as North describes it, an alternate reality where they made up their story as they went along. “To be perfectly honest we didn’t really understand what’s going on,” admits North about the “Save The Ice” mission. “But it doesn’t mean you can’t do it. Both of us were very comfortable operating in a place where we didn’t understand what’s going on.” He and Fredinburg had bonded over that mentality: “You have to just start doing stuff,” he explains, “and when people see it’s working eventually they’ll get behind it.” That was the approach Fredinburg took in lobbying Google to return to Everest. Understandably, the company was reluctant to send its employees back after they had barely escaped death the previous year. When friends and family asked Fredinburg if he was going, he would tell them “not yet.” In reality, “Dan never stopped training after the 2014 expedition,” says North. “He would say he was training for Burning Man.” Fredinburg officiating Mike “Doc” North and Marnie Brumder’s wedding on the Burning Man playa in August 2014. Fredinburg and North were Burning Man soul mates; they were as close as brothers. (Marc Fiorito/Gamma Nine) By fall 2014 the Google Adventures Team had the green light from Street View to climb Everest again in 2015. The Access & Energy team, which Battelli had joined as a technical program manager, agreed to contribute funding if the team tested new wireless technologies at Base Camp. They called the new mission, naturally, E15. Before each of their adventures the Three Musketeers would calculate what they idiosyncratically labeled the MROD, or “Mild Risk Of Death.” The calculation took into account the number of previous deaths on any particular mountain, and their causes (accident, natural disaster, etc.). Scaling Everest, they initially concluded, posed a 5% MROD. For the second expedition they raised the number slightly, to account for the 2014 avalanche and the increasing effects of climate change. Fredinburg continued to operate at a breakneck pace. Ashley Arenson, whom he had recently started dating, pleaded with him to decline parties and get more sleep. She was particularly concerned after he stayed up for 48 hours before the Dublin Web Summit in November 2014, where he sat on a panel to discuss Internet privacy. “But you don’t understand, this is training,” he would tell her. He spent several weekends at Summit’s headquarters in Eden, Utah, and ran with Marshall Birnbaum, an ultra-marathoner, around the grounds on Saturday mornings. Once Fredinburg spotted a man carrying logs on a mountain road, so he decided to find a log, too, and carry it up the mountain. Then, seemingly out of the blue, weeks before the climb, Street View decided to withdraw its funding from Google Adventures. Instead of having Googlers go all the way to the summit, it would have a manager at Base Camp—Sara Pelosi, who had been on the eventful climb up Carstensz Pyramid—coordinate the Street View images with Sherpas and mountain guides, who were trained on how to use the cameras. The Three Musketeers had to find another way. The Access & Energy team was still willing to send them to Base Camp to test its wireless devices. But it was only providing partial funding for the expedition. Fredinburg and Battelli decided to pay the rest, covering their own and Nagl’s expenses out of their own pockets, and joining a different camp at Base Camp instead of Google’s expedition with IMG. That also meant the Three Musketeers were traveling without the Street View cameras that were the whole reason for the Everest expedition in the first place. But by that point, it didn’t matter. Everest had become part of Fredinburg’s identity; he was obsessed. “There was absolutely nothing stopping Dan from that mountain,” says Slavin. Price, the filmmaker, agrees: “Dan had this almost sick joy telling people about the Death Zone on Everest, where many people don’t make it. Their bodies eventually break down. If you rest your muscles for a second you can never get up. When people asked if he was worried, Dan said no. But you still knew he was worried.” In the days before his departure for Nepal, Fredinburg said his goodbyes. He carried Arenson on his back through the steep streets of San Francisco, training up until the last minute. She gave him a parting gift with letters of encouragement from all of his friends to read throughout his journey. Another night, with North, he picked up a few final items, including toilet paper and whiskey. (The previous year, to Nagl’s dismay, Fredinburg had put glass bottles of rum in his climbing shoes to protect them from breakage.) Sean Carasso was one of the last to see Fredinburg. “Stay safe!” he told Fredinburg over and over again that night. He texted Fredinburg the message once again before going to sleep, and woke up to a reply: “Stay strong.” It was the last time Carasso heard from his friend. The final climb Like any high-functioning startup that has defied death, the Google Adventures Team went into their 2015 climb with high confidence and an air of invincibility. Climbing conditions were ideal and the Three Musketeers were all in peak physical condition. Surviving the avalanche the previous year had only made them stronger, they felt. At Base Camp, Fredinburg took what was to become an iconic selfie. Day 19: We're cleared for launch. Now we help the Sherpa celebrate this auspicious day and the next stages of our expedition. #Everest2015 A photo posted by Dan Fredinburg (@danfredinburg) on Apr 22, 2015 at 8:58am PDT Quartz reporter Svati Narula, who trekked to Base Camp with David Breashears, a famed mountaineer and filmmaker, met Fredinburg and Battelli over tea and a game of Tiger & Goats. The two, she recalled, wouldn’t reveal their last names or their mission for Google. Around noon on April 25th, Battelli and Fredinburg were looking through photos in their tent. Suddenly the ground shook and they heard a loud crack beneath them. “We said to each other, ‘Let’s get out, let’s get out!” says Battelli. He ran out of the tent and saw Nagl outside. Together they looked up at what appeared to be a mile-long avalanche of snow and debris coming straight toward them. Both jumped into a ditch and covered their heads as the wind blasted them; when Battelli put his finger into the air, debris cut it like a knife. Battelli thought Fredinburg was behind him, or maybe had run in the other direction. Now he surmises that he probably never even made it out of the tent. “Maybe he lost two seconds grabbing a jacket, grabbing his phone,” says Battelli. “Those few seconds were fatal for him.” Once the avalanche had subsided, Battelli and Nagl plodded through the snow to find their friend lying face-down near a boulder. Battelli slowly turned Fredinburg around, careful not to aggravate any injuries, and felt for a pulse. “Dan? Dan?” he said into the eerie calm. Nothing. Fredinburg’s eyes and mouth were wide open. An Everest doctor walked over and took one look at Fredinburg. “He’s gone,” she said, kissing Fredinburg on the forehead. “That’s how we die,” says Battelli. “Gasping for our last breath.” There was nothing else that they could do, so they covered their friend with a sleeping bag and worked to help others survive. Operating on pure adrenaline, they couldn’t feel the cold as they dug through the snow with bare hands to search for other bodies and supplies to help the injured. With Battelli and Nagl standing next to her, Google’s Pelosi called the Fredinburgs from a satellite phone to give them the news. She reached Fredinburg’s older sister, Tricia Curreri. Curreri remembers Pelosi apologizing over and over again. At dusk the two remaining Musketeers trekked down to Gorak Shep, a village in the valley, to avoid the risk of aftershocks. Neither could sleep. The nightmare just played in their minds like movies. Every few minutes they’d turn to one another: “Flo, you OK?” “Yeah. … Michele, you OK?” “Yeah. … Flo, you OK?” They continued the same conversation over and over again, until dawn the next day, when they made their way back to Base Camp. Send-off on the playa “Can you grab a paint brush and help us?” Courtney Boyd Myers, a Summit staffer, called over to some young women who were testing bikes still covered in the previous year’s playa dust. It was a hot evening in August 2015, and the team was preparing for Burning Man. It was a large-scale operation: Summit, for all its ambitions, is still at its heart an events company, and a warehouse near the town center was filled with supplies for shelter, food, and transportation for many of its members. About a mile across town, a few of the Summit founders and their friends were working on an art car in a garage. The double-limousine was designed as a hover board, a nod to Michael J. Fox’s time travel to 2015 in Back To The Future. Arenson picked up a brush and began painting the large V-shaped wooden structures with grey paint. Since Fredinburg’s death in April, she had spent a lot of time at Eden. Just as the Carasso brothers and the group took care of Fredinburg after his breakup with Bush, they were now doing the same for Arenson. #Repost @maxstossel On Saturday close friends and family came together to celebrate Dan's life and love for adventure. It was an amazing day for an amazing man. #CelebratingDan #AdventuresWithDan #DanimalDID #SaveTheIce #DanFredinburgFoundation Crowdrise.com/CelebratingDan A photo posted by Dan Fredinburg (@danfredinburg) on May 11, 2015 at 8:44am PDT In the aftermath of his death the community has been forced to confront its own mortality—accepting that making “no small plans” and going to the edge sometimes means dying. Yet it seems entirely comfortable with that. “What is 33 years, or 43 years, or 53 years?” asks Abelin, who left Google to launch Liquid Talent, a startup that supports gig-economy workers. “Dan’s death was not a tragedy. The real tragedy is in not living.” Adds Slavin, “We all knew Dan would never make it to a hospital bed. Everyone knew it would be something like this, but not this soon.” Rosenthal, the Summit co-founder, told a story about flying in a test plane with a friend, doing negative-G loops. “If I die like this it’s not going to be surprising, but a tragedy that will affect my loved ones,” he explained. This is a tradeoff many Summit members choose to make. “By putting yourself in these experiences and feeling the edges of life, it made Dan feel alive, and it makes a lot of us feel alive.” The following week at Burning Man, Sean Carasso was among those who made the pilgrimage to Fredinburg’s memorial in the deep playa. His friends drove the art cars from Utah; he took his motorcycle. “100 mile-per-hour winds, my bike broke down, I had no food, no water,” he remarked as he approached the art car, cracking a smile. “The journey made it all worth it.” As the dawn broke, friends, colleagues, and curious onlookers made their way to the Disco Space Shuttle, not too far from the Robot Heart theme camp—a place that held special significance for Fredinburg. For all his outsized adventures, he once said that the biggest risk he took was to become emotionally vulnerable—a direct result of his encounter with Summit Series that evening in Vegas, when he confessed to having a “robot heart.” The farewell on the desert playa was exactly the sort of send-off he would have wanted. Before his death he had arranged for his friends to host parties around the world in his honor should he die—no doubt a sign of hubris, but also of wanting his friends to celebrate life instead of simply grieving. The growing party around the Disco Space Shuttle was a strange combination of both. Many revelers had bloodshot eyes, from a mixture of mourning and recreational drugs. They passed around bottles of whiskey and danced without inhibition. North was there with his partner Marnie Brumder; Fredinburg had married them on the playa a year earlier. They were wearing matching bright yellow onesies. North and Brumder mourn Fredinburg in matching onesies at Burning Man in September 2015, only a year after their friend married them on the playa. Arenson, wearing black fishnet tights, walked over to a young woman who was fully covered in a white slip. Arenson took one look and tore the dress off the woman, revealing only a bra and underwear. Then she christened her with a disco ball necklace, nodded approvingly, and disappeared back into the crowd. Arenson has taken it upon herself to carry on Fredinburg’s legacy. She is a force behind the hashtag #LiveDan, which symbolizes living fearlessly, and is still going strong more than a year and a half after Fredinburg’s death. Friends regularly post photos of themselves wearing the navy-blue “Live Dan” T-shirt with antler ears from places like the Antarctic tundra or atop the Andes. “Immediately after his death we went on the Inca Trail [to Machu Picchu],” says Summit member Max Stossel, a social media strategist and storyteller. “We realized what Dan might have loved about being so high in the air.” “There is a component that is Icarus,” Rosenthal acknowledged, in the lodge at Powder Mountain. “Of all of our friends, he was most certain of his immortality.” Then his voice lifted, buoyed by the thought of his friend on Everest. “If you asked Dan how he would have liked to have died, he would have said, ‘Closer to the top.’” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Airports from across Europe continue to pitch in a competitive battle to make use of the carrier’s ever increasing Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet, but on this occasion it is Barcelona that has come out the winner. Budget carrier Norwegian has this week announced details of its latest long-haul European base with transatlantic flights launching to five destinations in the United States of America from June 2017. Airports from across Europe continue to pitch in a competitive battle to make use of the carrier’s ever increasing Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet, but on this occasion it is Barcelona that has come out the winner. The expanding low-fare carrier will base two 787-8s at El Prat Airport in the Catalan city from next summer launching flights to Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, New York and Oakland. The first aircraft will inaugurate long-haul flights from June 5, 2017 with the second enabling growth to 12 weekly return flights from August 22, 2017 – four times weekly to Newark, three times weekly to Los Angeles and Oakland and twice weekly to Fort Lauderdale. Norwegian will directly compete with United Airlines on the Barcelona – Newark market as well as indirectly with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines into New York. It will be the only scheduled operator on the other three city pairs, albeit American Airlines will provide indirect competition into Florida via its Miami flights. Norwegian will also be the sole carrier to link Spain to the San Francisco Bay area via its flights into Oakland International Airport. “The launch of direct flights between Barcelona and the United States is a new milestone for Norwegian,” said Bjorn Kjos, chief executive officer, Norwegian. “Spain is an important market for us where we have been very well received since its inception.” Norwegian has been growing steadily in the Spanish market and now has seven bases across the country, over 1,000 employees and an extensive network covering domestic and short-haul international routes. It has served the Catalan city since 2008 and opened its short-haul base at El Prat Airport in 2014. After initially linking Barcelona to Moss Airport, Rygge from February 2008, Norwegian expanded its offer before the end of the following year to comprise flights from the main international gateways into Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. Other points across the Nordic region and Scandinavia including Bergen, Gothenburg and Helsinki were added to the Barcelona network over subsequent years. London became the first destination outside the region to be served from April 2013, ahead of the opening of a local base and new flights to Germany, Poland from 2014. Norwegian’s peak summer Barcelona schedule now includes more than 120 weekly departures from Barcelona offering almost 23,000 seats in each direction. Its network now encompasses 21 destinations across ten different countries and it is now the fifth largest short-haul operator from El Prat Airport with a 3.6% share of departure seats, according to OAG Schedules Analyser data. Norwegian launched its first long-haul flights in 2013 between Oslo and New York and shortly thereafter between Stockholm and New York. As the company has phased out more new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the number of transcontinental flights has increased as the airline’s intercontinental strategy has taken shape. Adding to its Dreamliner flights from Scandinavia (which also includes Copenhagen), long-haul links have also been introduced from London from 2014 and from August this year from Paris. The airline now operates 42 routes between Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, London, Paris, Barcelona and the United States and currently offers more routes between Europe and the United States than any other European airline serving nine destinations in the United States: New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas, Orlando, Boston, Puerto Rico and St. Croix. Its Americas network also includes winter flying from the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe to Boston, New York and Baltimore / Washington and from Guadeloupe to Fort Lauderdale. But after Scandinavia, London, Paris and now Barcelona, where will be next for Norwegian’s long-haul growth? Norwegian has led the way in utilising the performance of the 787 to develop a successful low-cost long-haul operation and the recent addition of 787-9s to its fleet will enable it to grow its route structure, while providing more range and capacity. “Future growth and competiveness in the long-haul market depends on the fuel-efficient, state-of-the art 787 Dreamliner. Not least, the Dreamliner offers the best passenger experience,” said Kjos. The airline currently has a North American focus for its 787 long-haul operations with the Thailand capital, Bangkok, the only market outside of the Americas to be served by the carrier with flights from Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm. The current long-haul strategy for the 787 fleet is underpinned by routes into popular leisure markets and those easily stimulated by its low-fare offering. These include New York (via JFK and now Newark), Los Angeles, San Francisco (via Oakland) and Miami (via Fort Lauderdale). The airline is also able to secure some business traffic on these routes to boost its yield and has shown it is not concerned with going head-to-head with long-standing legacy operators that are already well established. But it is not all about O&D traffic and the airline’s expansive short- and medium-haul network across Europe and into North Africa and the Middle East can also provide feed into the long-haul markets. “The Scandinavian and European route networks play an increasingly important role in our long-haul strategy, as many of our passengers use connecting flights with Norwegian,” added Kjos. A new dimension to its long-haul network will be the utilisation of smaller single-aisle airliners on thinner routes as advancements in aircraft technology mean a range envelope that can open up new Transatlantic city pair markets, as per Norwegian’s plan to fly between Cork in the Republic of Ireland and Boston. The airline is the European launch customer for Boeing new generation 737MAX family and has committed to acquire 100 aircraft as part of a January 2012 deal which was the biggest ever single order placed in Europe for Boeing equipment, valued at $11.4 billion at list prices. “In 2017 we, as the European launch customer of Boeing, start taking deliveries of the new 737MAX, then additional routes to the East Coast of the US will be launched, offering direct transatlantic connections to new smaller cities and communities on both sides of the Atlantic carrying additional millions of passengers per year between the two continents,” Kjos has stated. Looking more closely at Norwegian’s summer short-haul programme in Europe you can start to get a picture of possible future Dreamliner long-haul bases. With the exception of London, Barcelona is the carrier’s largest network point outside of the Nordic and Scandinavian region and biggest point in Spain. The airline has a strong presence in other European capitals such as Helsinki (800,000 departure seats), Berlin (305,000 seats) and Rome (276,000 seats) and a growing offer from the likes of Budapest, Edinburgh, Manchester, Prague and Tenerife, all markets that have been suggested for possible long-haul expansion. However, with the impending 737MAX arrival many other markets will now also be on the Norwegian network radar.  Register for Routes Americas 2017 in Las Vegas, USA, 14 - 16 February 2017 Register for Routes Europe 2017 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 23 - 25 April 2017 The Fundamentals of Route Development This essential download gives you all you need to get started with air service development.

(AP photo byElaine Thompson) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on September 07, 2016 at 11:30 AM comments WASHINGTON — From 2002 through early last year, the Pentagon conducted 11 flight tests of the nation's homeland missile defense system. In the carefully scripted exercises, interceptors of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, or GMD, were launched from underground silos to pursue mock enemy warheads high above the Pacific. The interceptors failed to destroy their targets in six of the 11 tests — a record that has prompted independent experts to conclude the system cannot be relied on to foil a nuclear strike by North Korea or Iran. Yet over that same timespan, Boeing Co., the Pentagon's prime contractor for GMD, collected nearly $2 billion in performance bonuses for a job well done. The Pentagon paid Boeing more than $21 billion total for managing the system during that period. A Times investigation also found that the criteria for the yearly bonuses were changed at some point to de-emphasize the importance of test results that demonstrate the system's ability to intercept and destroy incoming warheads. Early on, Boeing's contract specified that bonuses would be based primarily on "hit to kill success" in flight tests. In later years, the words "hit to kill" were removed in favor of more generally phrased benchmarks, contract documents show. L. David Montague, co-chair of a National Academy of Sciences panel that documented shortcomings with GMD, called the $2 billion in bonuses "mind-boggling," given the system's performance. Montague, a former president of missile systems for Lockheed Corp., said the bonuses suggest that the Missile Defense Agency, the arm of the Pentagon that oversees GMD, is a "rogue organization" in need of strict supervision. The cumulative total of bonuses paid to Boeing has not been made public before. The Times obtained details about the payments through a lawsuit it filed against the Defense Department under the Freedom of Information Act. The newspaper also reviewed Boeing-related contract documents obtained independently of the lawsuit. A spokesman for the missile agency, Chris Johnson, said that despite the GMD system's record in flight tests, Boeing had "earned" its bonuses "based on the criteria specified in the contract." He said the payments "complied with all appropriate acquisition regulations." "These types of contracts allow regular and consistent evaluation by the government, and fees are paid only when companies meet clearly defined targets," Johnson said in an emailed statement. A spokesman for Boeing, Dexter Q. Henson, referred questions about the bonuses to the missile agency while defending the company's work on GMD. Boeing "has met contractual requirements and a variety of incentives across a wide range of program objectives," Henson said by email. "As the lead contractor, we have partnered with the Missile Defense Agency in the development and operation of the only homeland defense system that can defeat long range missile attacks," he said. The GMD system, which became operational in 2004, is intended to thwart a "limited" nuclear strike by a non-superpower. It has cost taxpayers more than $40 billion to date. In the event of an attack, interceptors at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County, Calif., and Fort Greely, Alaska, would burst from their silos and begin a fiery ascent toward the upper atmosphere. The interceptors are multistage rockets, each with a 5-foot-long "kill vehicle" at its tip. The kill vehicle is designed to separate from its rocket in space, fly independently at 4 miles per second and crash into an enemy warhead. GMD's roots go back to the Clinton administration, when concern began to mount over the spread of ballistic missile technology. In 2002, President George W. Bush ordered "an initial set of missile defense capabilities" to be put in place within two years. To accelerate deployment, then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld exempted the missile agency from the Pentagon's standard procurement rules and testing standards. The Pentagon's own Operational Test and Evaluation office has documented serious deficiencies in the system. So have other government agencies and independent experts. In a report in February, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, said the system's performance in tests has been "insufficient to demonstrate that an operationally useful defense capability exists." The test failures are unsettling given that the exercises are meticulously orchestrated. Personnel operating the GMD system know ahead of time approximately when the targets will be launched and from where, as well their expected speed and trajectory — information they would not have in an actual attack. Given the system's weaknesses, four or five interceptors would have to be launched for each incoming enemy warhead, according to current and former officials familiar with the missile agency's projections. As a result, the system's arsenal of 30 operational interceptors — four at Vandenberg and 26 at Fort Greely — could be quickly depleted by an attack with multiple missiles. A study by three physicists with expertise in missile defense, released in July by the Union of Concerned Scientists, concluded that "the GMD system is simply unable to protect the U.S. public." The Times asked the Missile Defense Agency in March 2014 for information on bonuses paid to GMD contractors. Boeing objected to release of the data, and the agency denied the newspaper's request, saying disclosure might reveal "trade secrets and commercial or financial data." The Times then sued in federal court last year, asserting that the public had a right to know about the payments. The government's lawyers later agreed to release the information if Boeing would not intervene in the litigation "or otherwise take steps to prevent disclosure." Boeing eventually acquiesced, and the Defense Department settled the suit with a single-page letter listing the sum total of bonuses paid to Boeing from Dec. 31, 2001, to March 1, 2015. The figure: $1,959,072,946. The government also agreed to pay $15,000 to cover the Times' legal costs. The missile agency's chief of staff, David P. Bagnati, made the initial decision to withhold the bonus data, according to a 2014 email from the Pentagon's Freedom of Information office. Johnson, the agency spokesman, said this week that Bagnati "made the determination on the advice of agency legal counsel" and would have no further comment. Boeing holds two contracts to manage GMD. Under their terms, the company is reimbursed for its direct costs in overseeing the system and for some of its indirect costs, such as executive salaries and other overhead. The bonuses come on top of that and can account for all or a significant part of a contractor's profit. One of Boeing's GMD contracts also provides a 3 percent base fee, independent of any bonuses, for some aspects of the work, according to the missile agency. Under the contracts, bonuses are awarded annually and can be up to 100 percent of specified pools of money. The Defense Department letter that settled the Times' lawsuit said the Boeing bonuses fell into three categories. Ninety-five percent of the total sum was designated as "award fees." The rest was described as "incentive cost" fees and "incentive performance" fees. The precise criteria for bonuses could not be obtained for each of the relevant years. However, documents on file with the Defense and Treasury departments show that the missile agency at some point altered a central criterion. At issue was what would make a flight test count as successful for bonus purposes. Boeing's prime contract dated Jan. 1, 2001, states that "the primary performance criteria" were whether the interceptor destroyed its target during the test — an outcome described as "HTK success." (HTK is short for "hit to kill.") The maximum "award fee" for a given year was 15 percent of the contract value. During the first phase of the contract, up to 60 percent of the award fee pool was based on "HTK success criteria." Later contract documents, dated August 2011, list various bonus criteria related to preparing for and carrying out the next scheduled flight test. Successful "mission execution" was worth 30 percent of the award fee pool. But actually destroying the target — "hit to kill" —was no longer specified. Asked for an explanation, Johnson, the agency spokesman, said: "In recent contract terms, the words 'hit-to-kill' have been changed to support the more detailed documented objectives of each respective flight test. For intercept flight tests conducted under the current design and sustainment contract, a successful intercept remains a key performance objective." In 2010, the missile agency granted Boeing a contract extension worth more than $1 billion. The Defense Department's inspector general later raised questions about the extension — including bonus payments — saying that agency officials lost an opportunity to save millions of dollars by failing to wait for an audit they had requested. The controversy centered on the GMD "Core Completion" contract. (The inspector general's report, released in 2014, did not name Boeing, but other records show that the company held this contract.) According to the report, the missile agency asked the Defense Contract Audit Agency to scrutinize the contractor's proposed costs and other terms. The audit was due Feb. 15, 2010, but the auditors asked for an additional month, the report said. Yet the missile agency signed the contract extension March 10, 2010 — five days before the auditors were to deliver their findings. The inspector general concluded that if agency officials had waited to see the audit, they "could have negotiated a significantly lower contract value and saved the government millions of dollars in reduced fees" — a reference to bonuses, which are based on the total contract value. Johnson said officials chose not to wait "because we had sufficient data to reach a determination of a fair and reasonable price for the contract." He added that his agency "has incorporated several substantial changes to our procedures" to make better use of future audits. The missile agency and its lead contractors have sought to put a positive spin on the system's performance. This year, after a flight test on Jan. 28, the agency and several contractors, including Boeing, issued news releases declaring the test a success. In fact, as the Times reported July 6, a thruster stopped working during the exercise, causing the kill vehicle to fly far off its intended course. The thrusters, which help steer the kill vehicle, have a history of performance problems. In the Jan. 28 exercise, a kill vehicle equipped with a new thruster model was supposed to make a close fly-by of a target. None of the press releases acknowledged the malfunction — nor did the missile agency's director, Vice Adm. James D. Syring, in three subsequent appearances before congressional panels. Neither Syring nor the contractors have said publicly why they stayed silent. Whatever their rationale, by characterizing the test as a success, the agency and the contractors may have bolstered the prospects for performance bonuses, according to missile defense specialists.

Daniel Miller (TMFTwoCoins) Sep 7, 2016 at 8:05AM Image source: Getty Images. "You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong." -- Warren Buffett He's right: more often than not, if you simply hold on to a stock over the years through thick and thin, you'll likely be well rewarded. It can be difficult to never sell, especially when times seem dire -- but if you can pick companies with durable competitive advantages, you should be able to sleep at night and avoid pressing the panic "sell" button. Here are four Motley Fool contributors with companies that they recommend never selling: International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Allergan (NYSE:AGN), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), and Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA). A century of adaptation Tim Green: Every stock that I buy I intend to hold for years. Ideally, a stock will produce exceptional returns indefinitely, never requiring me to sell. Things change, of course, and investors can't be afraid to sell a stock if their thesis has been turned upside down. But in general, the longer the holding period, the better. Predicting how technology will evolve is hard, if not impossible, and that makes committing to holding a technology stock indefinitely risky. But International Business Machines, a company that has been around for a century, is one tech stock that I'm comfortable holding for a long time. The company has transformed itself on multiple occasions during its lifetime, shifting from mechanical tabulating machines to computers, then transitioning into a software and services company, and now throwing its weight behind cloud and cognitive computing. Transitions are always painful, and the current one IBM is undergoing is no exception. Revenue has been declining for years, and earnings are being pressured as the company shifts resources from legacy businesses to areas that offer the most potential. There's no guarantee that IBM will succeed, but if I'm going to be holding a tech stock for a very long time, a company with a long history of adaptation makes the most sense. This high-growth pharma stock has a solid foundation George Budwell: There aren't many stocks I would absolutely never sell, but specialty pharma Allergan is an exception to the rule. The short story is that Allergan is currently in the process of shedding its generic-drug business to focus on branded products like the double-chin treatment Kybella, and the IBS drugs Linzess and Viberzi, among many others. As a result, the health of the drugmaker's balance sheet has improved dramatically in the last few months, with the company already retiring $9 billion in debt this year. And Allergan's recent double-digit top-line growth appears to be sustainable for the long haul, given that the drugmaker is in the midst of multiple new product launches at the moment. Having said that, Allergan's penchant for wheeling and dealing is an area of concern. So far, management has carefully guided the company through multiple acquisitions that have led to an overall healthier enterprise. However, one bad deal in the pharmaceutical industry can hamper a company's growth for a decade or more. That's why I would personally prefer for Allergan to pay off even more debt, and perhaps sit tight for the time being, instead of rushing out to spend its recent windfall from the sale of its generic unit. But this is Allergan, after all, meaning that a monstrous acquisition is almost certainly coming down the pike soon. So, hopefully, management can continue their winning ways by adding yet another value-creating asset to the company's already strong product portfolio of branded medicines. Stay tuned. An anchor income holding Matt DiLallo: Midstream pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners has been a part of my portfolio since 2007. I plan on keeping it right where it is, and adding to my position over time, because I view it as an anchor income holding. It is a decision that paid off very well in the past, and one that I expect will continue for many years to come. What drew me toward Enterprise Products Partners was its eye-popping yield, which at the time of my initial investment was just shy of 7%. However, since my first purchase, the distribution has gone up every single quarter. Because of that, the yield on my initial investment is now more than 11.5%. Three factors drive Enterprise's ability to grow the payout. First, it primarily owns fee-based assets that are under long-term contracts, so it generates rather stable cash flow. Second, unlike most master limited partnerships, it does not distribute all of its cash flow back to investors; instead, it retains a substantial portion to reinvest into growth projects, including $5.3 billion since 2011. Finally, the company continues to construct a steady stream of fee-based assets that drive cash-flow growth; currently, it has $5.6 billion of projects under construction to drive growth through 2018. With a solid foundation and ample running room for future growth, Enterprise Products Partners is one company that I have no desire to sell. Still flying high Daniel Miller: Investors hopping off the Boeing Co. bandwagon could be forgiven, especially after a rough second quarter, when the aviation juggernaut took almost $3 billion in pre-tax charges from its 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker programs. However, despite the rough quarter, Boeing still has durable comparable advantages with its commercial and defense businesses, which make it a stock you shouldn't sell. Boeing operates in an intensely regulated commercial aircraft industry, so it's extremely difficult for new competitors to enter the market, leaving Boeing and Airbus to dominate the area. There are very real barriers to entry imposed by the knowledge and experience required to develop, design, assemble and certify commercial aircraft; that isn't changing any time soon, which is great news for investors willing to stick around for the long haul. Another bonus is that over the past five years, Boeing has increasingly focused on returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as you can see below: BA Shares Outstanding data by YCharts. And despite being in a cyclical industry, Boeing has more than $470 billion worth of orders in its combined commercial and defense backlog, which is roughly five years' worth of revenue transparency. On top of that, Boeing made the decision to incrementally improve both the 737 and 777 programs, rather than develop all-new aircraft, which should generate more cash flow and increase its return on invested capital. The downside with Boeing is that the company operates in a cyclical industry, which guarantees turbulence at some point, and when operational mistakes happen they cost a pretty penny – see Boeing's second quarter. But any company that operates in an industry with steep barriers to entry and has a history of returning value to shareholders is a company you shouldn't sell anytime soon.

Even the $85 billion calculated by the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office is a placeholder number that's at the low end of potential costs, according to an Aug. 23 memo from Pentagon weapons buyer Frank Kendall to Air Force Secretary Deborah James. It includes $22.6 billion for research and development, $61.5 billion for procurement and $718 million for related military construction. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. are all competing to build the new ICBMs. But the latest estimate may add to debate about the cost and need for the planned modernization of all three legs of the U.S. nuclear triad of land, air and sea weapons. The nuclear modernization plan contributes to what defense analysts call a gathering "bow wave" of spending in the coming decade on major weapons that the next presidents will face. At this stage of the ICBM program "there is significant uncertainty about program costs" because "the historical data is limited and there has been a long gap since the last" such development program, Kendall wrote. The $85 billion estimate must be revised no later than March 2018 once missile designs are more advanced, technical risks are reduced and the service has a better understanding of overall costs, Kendall said in the memo. Nonetheless, Kendall approved proceeding with early development and efforts to reduce technology risks of the new ICBM. He directed the service to move toward buying 642 missiles at an average cost of $66.4 million each to support a deployed force of 400 weapons and to budget at least $1.25 billion annually from 2036 to 2040 for operations and support costs. The Pentagon's ability to estimate the cost of the new Ground Based Strategic Deterrent was limited by the "incompleteness and significant age of" the "data for comparable ICBM and submarine launched ballistic missiles dating back to the 1960s through the early 1990s," Kendall wrote. The Pentagon and Air Force are "accepting greater risk by going with" the $85 billion estimate that's at the lower end of its calculations, Kingston Reif, an analyst with the Arms Control Association in Washington who follows the program, said in an e-mail. "From a good-government perspective" it is "better to build in contingency and plan for and prioritize around a bigger bill now, lest a sudden big cost increase threaten to wreck the budget and the program five to 10 years from now." Kendall wrote that inflation assumptions and the defense industry's capability to produce the missiles are major sources of cost uncertainty. Still, he said the $85 billion placeholder is "the most reasonable estimate of program cost at this point." In addition to the new nuclear systems, the bow wave of coming costs includes nine Air Force conventional systems and plans for increased construction of naval vessels such as a second Ford-class aircraft carrier. For the air component of the nuclear triad, Northrop defeated a Lockheed-Boeing team in October for the right to build a new dual-use bomber that can carry both nuclear and conventional weapons, a project valued at as much as $80 billion. At sea, the Navy is planning to replace its Ohio-class nuclear-armed submarines through a production program now estimated at $122 billion, which doesn't include development.That estimate will be updated by year's end as the Pentagon reviews moving the program into full development. Kendall's decision to let the ICBM program move forward marks the official beginning of the technology development stage, with spending increasing from about $75 million this year to $1.6 billion in 2021 and $2.6 billion in 2022, according to the Pentagon estimate. The "program plans to buy enough missiles to maintain a 400-missile deployed force through 2075," Air Force spokeswoman Leah Bryant said in an email. "The overall number of missiles acquired in the inventory may vary depending on testing, evaluation, maintenance," she said. The Air Force made its early estimate last year that the new ICBM program would cost $62.3 billion for research, development and production as well as command and control systems and infrastructure. That number, as well as the new $85 billion estimate, is calculated in so-called "then-year," or current-year, dollars. Bryant said "it is important to keep in mind that at this stage," as "in any acquisition program, there can still be some uncertainty about projected" ICBM costs because "the historical data used for estimates, whether ours or another organization's estimate, are limited and very dated." The last ICBM development occurred in the 1980s, she said. Kendall's memo was provided to the staff of the Senate and House defense committees last week.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit Utah football: Hunter Dimick takes center stage for Utah's defense Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

The preliminary report states that following an attempted go-around, the aircraft descended rapidly from a height of approximately 85 feet at 134 knots, back onto the runway, sliding for approximately 800 metres before coming to rest. Details from the report further state:  “As the flight neared Dubai, the crew received the automatic terminal information service (ATIS) Information Zulu, which included a windshear warning for all runways.” The report further states the Aircraft aft fuselage impacted the runway abeam at 125 knots, with a nose-up pitch angle of 9.5 degrees, and at a rate of descent of 900 feet per minute. This was followed by the impact of the engines on the runway. Final investigation awaits All of the 300 passengers and crew were evacuated from the aircraft safely before a fire consumed the cabin, it added. The report confirms 21 passengers, one flight crewmember, and one cabin crewmember sustained minor injuries, and a second cabin crewmember sustained a serious injury. Approximately nine minutes after the Aircraft came to rest, a firefighter was fatally injured as a result of the explosion of the center fuel tank. In accordance with international protocols of aircraft accident investigation, the preliminary report contains only factual information related to the accident and contains no analysis, or conclusions. The final report, which will be issued at the conclusion of the investigation, will contain analysis of the facts, and conclusions. The analysis aims to identify the cause(s) and the factors that contributed to the accident, the GCAA said. The investigation team is led by the AAIS investigator-in-charge, IIC, and comprises the accredited representatives of the states of manufacture of the aircraft (United States) and the engines (United Kingdom). In addition, technical representatives of Boeing, Rolls-Royce and Emirates Airline have been assigned roles as advisers to the IIC and the accredited representatives. The Director-General of the GCAA, Saif Mohammed Al Suwaidi, said, "During the course of rescue and firefighting, an explosion occurred which resulted in the tragic death of a firefighter. “We extend our deepest sympathy to the family of the deceased, and at the same time we hope that the grief of his family is made more bearable by the knowledge that his courageous behaviour helped to ensure the survival of all the people on board the flight." The Assistant Director-General of the AAIS, Ismaeil Al Hosani, said, "The investigation team is continuing to examine the aircraft and flight data. “Analysis of the data extracted from the flight recorders is ongoing to determine the technical performance of the aircraft and systems, and crew control inputs and performance. “In-depth analysis will be carried out to examine the operator’s policies and procedures for such flight conditions."

Henry Oludotun Ogunyemi has reiterated that Nigeria will retain over $3 billion, the equivalent of over N1. 2 trillion annually if operating airlines patronizes local maintenance facilities to carry out heavy maintenance on their aircraft. He spoke at the background of the challenges government and the private sector face in trying to establish a maintenance hangar to take care of the heavy maintenance needs of Nigerian carriers and that of other countries. While disclosing that Onedot has received approval from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to carry out heavy maintenance on some category of aircraft, he urges government to address debilitating challenges of sourcing foreign currencies for the maintenance of their as result of the Federal Government Forex policy. The airlines’ maintenance challenge is further compounded by the foreign exchange rate to carry out major checks such as C- and D-Checks on their airplanes. He hinted that flying aircraft overseas for heavy maintenance like C-Checks on Boeing aircraft now has a far greater cost implication and the ripple effect causes major financial havoc for airlines advising airlines to use local Maintain Repair and Overhaul(MROs). Onedot Aviation approval to carry out maintenance checks both line and heavy for Beechcraft, HS-125, Bombardier among others since 2014 and Boeing 737-200 Series and Boeing 737-300/400/500 series in June 2016. Ogunyemi further stated that Onedot Aviation had already successfully carried out a B-Check on an Air Stream’s Boeing 737-200 cargo aircraft, which is currently flying perfectly. He encouraged other domestic airlines to follow suit, as the services rendered by Onedot Aviation are top notch, as the company has qualified engineers and state of the art tech. He stated that Onedot could also reduce the frenzy for forex as it would charge the airlines in Naira, adding that one of the benefits of carrying out MROs locally is that it would save airlines a lot of funds which according to him can lead to business expansion for such airlines. According to him, “First, putting all the airlines’ maintenance together, Nigeria will be saving $3billon annually if we patronise our own local MROs. There will be reduced stress on the dollar currency and this cut across all the airlines. It is cheaper for the airlines to carry out their maintenance in the country. First and foremost, the ferry cost is saved as it takes time to ferry an aircraft to an from wherever it is done overseas. “ “Even the ground time is saved as sometimes some aircraft stay six months and others stay a year so the airline will save in ground time. Saving money and ground time increases the profit of the airline. Airlines are free to check our services out.” He continued, “With increase of profit, there can also be an increase in fleet which means increment of staff, pilots and cabin crew employing more Nigerians, creating more jobs. In fact, the ripple effect is so numerous and cannot be underscored. Assuming they are not expanding or recruiting, they will be able to pay their staff and not owe, eliminating unnecessary hardships.” He also said using local MROs would enable the maintenance organisation increase its capacity, train and employ more Nigerians as well. In his words, “We have experienced Base engineers in Nigeria already that can take over from the expatriates who are already on ground with the initial know-how and technology. With the MRO there will be jobs for the teeming engineers and retraining of engineers to keep a base of sound technical hands who hitherto flew overseas.” that we have now.

One option Boeing has discussed with airlines and lessors in recent weeks is a simple lengthening of the 737 Max 9 that would offer much of the range and payload of Airbus’s A321neo, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The company is also vetting an alternative, more elaborate revamp that would feature the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. The more straightforward redesign, which would rely on upgrading engines developed for the Max family, would enter the market by early 2020, while the more complex one wouldn’t begin service until almost two years later. Airbus, meanwhile, has already received almost 1,300 orders for the A321neo, with a long-range version scheduled to begin commercial operation in 2019. “Boeing definitely needs to do something,” said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flightglobal’s Ascend Consultancy. “The market wants a choice, not an Airbus monopoly, so they can continue to have access to competitive pricing.” Chicago-based Boeing has struggled for years to find an answer to the A321, and the quandary has grown this decade as the out-of-production 757 has started to fade from airline fleets. Airbus redesigned its largest narrow-body to cruise seven hours from Europe to North America, or cram in as many as 240 people. Its versatility is a crucial reason why the A320 family has outsold the 737, Boeing’s biggest source of profit, by about 1,000 orders, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. ‘Higher End’ Both planemakers have benefited as low-cost carriers gravitate to larger narrow-body aircraft to keep pace with capacity growth. The most popular market segment remains the 160-seat sector served by Boeing’s 737-8 and its midsize Airbus counterpart. But A321neo sales have surged over the last two years, increasing the pressure on Boeing to address its eroding market share at the top of the narrow-body market. “We continue to look at the higher end of the Max family,” Doug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing, said in an e-mail. “The needs of our airline customers as well as the business case will drive our decision and timing.” The manufacturer declined to elaborate on the latest studies for a larger 737. The board must sign off on any new variant before the company can formally market the plane to customers. Size Advantage Airbus has a size advantage and operating economics advantage because the A321 can squeeze more travelers into a frame that is eight feet (2.4 meters) longer than the Max 9, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018. The challenge in extending the 737’s fuselage lies in overcoming the limits of a design dating to the 1960s: The plane has smaller turbines than the A321neo because it rides closer to the ground when on the tarmac. But any redesign can’t be so expensive and difficult to manufacture that it bogs down production of the 737. “This is not a trivial stretch because it will require increasing engine thrust and changing the landing gear,” Douglas Harned, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said of the Max 10 in a Sept. 6 report. “While this would be much less expensive than a new airplane or a major new derivative, it is still a significant modification. It is unclear if the payback would be there.” Extra Thrust Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter As the first 737 Max 8 jets glide through flight-testing ahead of a 2017 debut, Boeing and engine-maker CFM have gained confidence that they can reap enough extra thrust from the plane’s existing Leap-1B engines to speed to market a new, longer variant with relatively uncomplicated landing gear, the people said. Jamie Jewell, a spokeswoman for CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co. and Safran SA, declined to comment. Boeing is also convinced it has solved the manufacturing riddle for a more elaborate design if customers prefer the range and payload gains possible with the larger Leap-1A engines designed for the A320 family. That model would need some modifications to the wing and tail, and taller landing gear that would mechanically shrink to fit into the same wheel well used on other 737s. “It’s not the monumental engineering challenge that people assume,” Mike Delaney, Boeing’s vice president of airplane development, said of the Max 10 options in an interview at the Farnborough Air Show in July. ‘Too Late’ Air Lease Corp. has been among the customers prodding Boeing to act. During an Aug. 4 earnings call, Air Lease founder Steven Udvar-Hazy and Chief Executive John Plueger said Boeing was formulating a two-pronged strategy in which the Max 10 would be followed a half-decade later by an all-new design, a middle-of-market aircraft to bridge the divide between narrow- and wide-body jets. While Boeing had penciled in a commercial debut for the Max 10 in late 2021, “that’s just too late,” Plueger said. “I believe they’re looking at moving that up meaningfully. But if you’re going to do a one-two punch, you’ve got to do a one-two timely, especially the one part.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

X Aer Lingus owner considers curbing aircraft-buying plans Economic slowdown behind IAG’s reassessment of purchasing plans, says Willie Walsh Thu, Sep 8, 2016, 12:35 IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, speaking on Thursday. Photograph: Bloomberg         IAG, the owner of Aer Lingus and British Airways, is considering reining in fleet plans as worldwide economic growth slows and the company grapples with the effects of Brexit. “Without doubt all airlines, including airlines within IAG, are reassessing their requirements for new aircraft,”as the outlook for growth has “softened”, chief executive Willie Walsh said on Thursday. “I don’t think we’re going to see growth rates that were anticipated.” The comments reflect a tougher sales environment for aircraft-makers. Airbus Group and Boeing racked up their lowest tally of aircraft orders in six years at the aviation industry’s annual showcase this summer. While both Airbus and Boeing sit on huge order backlogs, that cushion could provide little protection if headwinds continue and airlines start to feel the pinch from lower fares. Cut spending IAG, which also owns Spanish carrier Iberia, ordered 20 single-aisle Airbus A320neo aircraft a year ago, and Mr Walsh outlined plans earlier this year to buy used wide-body Boeing 777s and lease Airbus’s double-decker A380s for British Airways. Following the UK vote in late June to quit the European Union, Mr Walsh said IAG would have to cut spending amid a plunge in the pound’s exchange rate and a slowdown in traffic growth as business customers scaled back travel in response to the referendum. Corporate customers are still holding off on business trips as they analyse how the Brexit vote will affect Britain’s economy and currency, Mr Walsh said on Thursday. Another question carriers must consider with plane orders is the drop in the price of oil in recent years, and “whether it’s worth buying this new-technology aircraft to get the fuel-cost advantage,” he said. As IAG studies potential orders, “We’d look at how we would finance those aircraft: whether we’d buy them or whether we’d lease them,” so there are “a lot of options for us,” he said.

Currently, American astronauts have to hitch a ride with their Russian counterparts.  It's a critical step in NASA's  Commercial Crew Program  — which relies on private companies to ferry astronauts between Earth and the ISS.  SEE MORE: NASA's Mars Mission Might Be In Trouble The docking adapter  will allow SpaceX and Boeing to park their spacecraft on the space station and allow crew to come aboard.  The capsules designed to fit the dock aren't finished yet. SpaceX is currently working on a manned version of its  Dragon capsule , and Boeing is still finishing its  CST-100 Starliner . But if all goes according to plan, the first missions with those crafts are slated for late 2017 and early 2018.  The  dock itself arrived  at the ISS on July 20, but astronauts aren't installing it until Friday. Two astronauts aboard the ISS will spend about six hours outside the station to connect the dock. NASA plans to live-stream the entire operation.  Recent related news Boeing to consolidate defense and space sitesSt. Louis (UPI) Nov 16, 2016 Boeing is preparing to consolidate Defense, Space & Security...

NASA to Shine Lasers on Future Aircraft Concept by Kathy Barnstorff for LRC News Hampton VA (SPX) Sep 08, 2016 illustration only As NASA aeronautics engineers prepare to develop a series of greener, quieter, faster X-planes, they are already testing concepts that could be candidates. One of those is a blended wing body (BWB). A six-percent scale model of a Boeing BWB is being tested for six weeks in the 14-by 22-Foot Subsonic Tunnel at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. "We're happy to have the model back in our wind tunnel," said Dan Vicroy, principal investigator at NASA Langley. "It gives us a couple of opportunities - to add to our knowledge about this configuration as well as how to improve our testing methods." A blended wing body doesn't look like a conventional airplane. Instead of the usual tube and wing design - it's shaped more like a triangle where the wings are, in essence, merged into the body. Another difference is that it does not have a tail. This same model was put through its paces in the Langley 14-by 22-Foot tunnel in 2014 and in the 40-by 80-Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA's Ames Research Center in California in 2015. That work was part of NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation program, which developed technologies to improve fuel efficiencies, lower noise levels and reduce emissions. But for this test it looks a little different. The top of it has been painted in non-reflective matte black to accommodate laser lights that will sweep across the model in sheets. NASA and Boeing researchers will use those laser sheets combined with smoke in the technique known as particle imagery velocimetry or PIV. That will map the airflow over the model. "We didn't get the opportunity to use PIV in the previous tests," added Vicroy. "It helps us analyze the flow going into the engine inlets, which is one of the challenges with this design since the engines are on top of the fuselage, toward the rear." In most planes flying today the engines are out on the wings, in front, where there is nice clean airflow. Anything in front of an engine can disrupt the flow. "Airflow makes a difference in how well the engine performs," said Vicroy. "It's a matter of how much distortion the engine is seeing. So if you want the engines to perform well you want to have the distortion at a minimum." So if engineers have to worry about airflow - why change where the engines are? Researchers say putting them on top of the plane helps shield noise, especially from people on the ground, and contributes toward NASA's goals of developing greener, quieter planes. The other benefit to NASA from this test has more to do with the tunnel itself. The 14-by 22-Foot tunnel recently completed repairs and an upgrade, so having the same model return can verify how well it's working. And having the same model tested in a totally different facility, such as the one in California also helps add to engineers' knowledge base. "In wind tunnel testing we have to account for how the model is installed, the size and proximity of the tunnel walls in the test section and other factors," said Vicroy. "Testing the same model in two very different tunnels gives us data to improve our test correction methods, some of which were developed in 1940s." For Boeing the tests are part of an ongoing research development program. "Our tests are a continuation of more than two decades of successful research and development of this concept, which is unparalleled in industry," said John Bonet, Boeing's test director for the BWB. "What we learn from this round of testing will be used to complete the definition of our aerodynamic, stability and control low-speed databases - a major milestone in the technology development of the concept." With the exception of Boeing proprietary technology, NASA knowledge gained from this collaborative research will be documented and publicly available to benefit the aviation industry.

China’s low-cost microsatellites may lead to ‘space pollution’, say experts There are now nearly 1,400 satellites orbiting the earth and the number could more than double in next five years PUBLISHED : Thursday, 08 September, 2016, 11:47am UPDATED : Thursday, 08 September, 2016, 9:03pm Comments:   Stephen Chen Share PrintEmail Related topics China science More on this story China China’s hack-proof quantum satellite leap into space leads the world 17 Aug 2016 Related Articles Policies & Politics More doubts cast over Chinese scientist’s claim of gene editing tool ‘breakthrough’ 17 Nov 2016 Policies & Politics Why money and prestige aren’t enough to lure foreign scientists to China 17 Nov 2016 Science & Research Chinese first to test CRISPR gene editing in humans 16 Nov 2016 Chang Guang Satellite Technology, a private space start-up in Changchun, Jilin province, released a series of high-definition satellite images last month that zoomed in on foreign military facilities such as Japan’s naval headquarters, US aircraft carriers, Edwards Air Force Base in California and Area 51 weapons testing grounds in Nevada. It was the first time such images had been released in China and they went viral on mainland social media. The images were taken by JLCG-1, a microsatellite constellation launched last year consisting of four satellites, the smallest of which weighs just 65kg, able to take photographs at resolutions of up to 0.72 metres per pixel. The JLCG constellation orbits 650km above the earth, slightly above the International Space Station. But the satellites have limited orbital manoeuvrability, meaning that if they enter into a collision course with the space station or other spacecraft in the busy lower-earth orbit, their operator would be unable to move them out of the way. The number of satellites orbiting the earth has jumped 40 per cent to nearly 1,400 since 2011, and in five years the number could more than double, according to some space industry estimates. The increase has mainly been driven by technological innovations with have reduced the size of satellites, in some cases down to something the size of a smartphone. In June, US aviation giant Boeing filed an application to the US Federal Communications Commission to launch nearly 3,000 satellites to provide broadband internet services, which prompted traffic jam concerns in the US as no single federal government agency had the means or authority to track a microsatellite and order it to move out of the way to avoid a collision. The situation in China “could be worse”, said Dr Liu Jing, deputy director of the Space Debris Monitoring and Application Centre, a space environmental protection watchdog under China’s National Space Administration. US satellite makers such as OneWeb recognised the risk of space debris and had taken steps to address the issue, she said. Chang Guang, founded two years ago by more than 40 institutional or private investors with technical support from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is one of many microsatellite and nanosatellite assembly plants to have emerged in China in recent years. China’s hack-proof quantum satellite leap into space leads the world Others include the Shanghai Engineering Centre for Microsatellites, the Picosat Development Centre in Zhejiang, the Shaanxi Engineering Laboratory for Microsatellites in Xian, and the Aerospace Dongfanghong Development company in Shenzhen, each with plans to send tens or even hundreds of small satellites into space. China remains a relatively small player at present, with international companies such as Boeing, Airbus, SpaceX and OneWeb planning to launch thousands of microsatellites in the coming years which could provide earth-observation or communication services, such as Wi-fi access, to everyone on the planet. But China could easily catch up in numerical terms because it is building satellites more cheaply, some costing less than a small car. To reduce costs, most Chinese microsatellites do not have rocket engines that need fuel. They also operate in higher orbits to prolong their lifespan. Large international companies tend produce satellites with rockets that operate in lower orbits due to concerns about collisions and the creation of debris. China could pollute space with a large number of small, cheap satellites according to some space environment experts, unless the industry is reined in with strict, clear regulations as quickly as possible. In March, Japan lost contact with Hitomi, its brand new, flagship X-ray telescope. Investigators found the satellite had disintegrated, typically what happens after a space debris collision. China launches high-resolution imaging satellite to service civilian users How to regulate traffic in space as the number of satellites increases has been an international concern for decades, but the issue became urgent in recent years. OneWeb microsatellites are equipped with thrusters that can send them back into the atmosphere to burn up at the end of their service, but Liu said most Chinese microsatellites were not up to that standard and were left drifting freely in space after the end of their operational life. Some were small and operating in high orbits, eluding detection by ground-based radar and posing a severe threat to other spacecraft. The State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence had issued a regulation on small satellites to address such issues, but in practice the regulation was ignored. She urged the central government to immediately raise the bar for microsatellite standards, requiring them to be equipped with mobility thrusters, among other control devices, and restricting their operations to certain low-earth orbits to shorten the time they lingered in space after service and reduce the chance of collisions with other spacecraft. But a representative of a private company in Guangdong that plans to send a couple of microsatellites into space in November opposed such restrictions, describing space debris concerns as an “unfounded scare”. Is China militarising space? Experts say new junk collector could be used as anti-satellite weapon Tens of thousands pieces of debris were currently orbiting the earth, he said, but space was enormous. He likened the situation to “adding a few grains of salt to a lake”, which made no difference. The microsatellite industry in China was still in its infancy, he said, and its development needed support. Too many restrictions would kill the business, he said, requesting anonymity both for himself and his company. He added that the space debris scare had been invented by the owners of big satellites. “Of course they don’t want to see the revolution of microsatellite technology which will allow new, small players to challenge their monopoly,” he said. “They will use or fabricate any excuse to suffocate our development.” New restrictions and regulations would increase the cost of Chinese-made microsatellites, reducing China’s competitive edge in the international market, he said, adding that would be a “betrayal” of China’s national interests. Pioneering space debris researcher Donald Kessler, a former Nasa astrophysicist, said adding a few thousand satellites in orbit was just the start of the issue. If the objects in low-earth orbit reached a high enough density, debris generated by one collision would lead to another and eventually fill space with small, fast-flying junk, making all space activities impossible, a scenario known as the Kessler syndrome. “A 10 to 100kg satellite colliding with a satellite as large as 100,000kg would produce an amount of debris similar to either of the catastrophic collision events that have occurred, i.e., the 2007 China anti-satellite test and the 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision,” he said. China says space junk crashed in eastern province - possibly from failed Russian rocket “If these microsatellites are part of a constellation, a failed microsatellite would eventually collide with another member of the constellation, resulting in a Kessler syndrome effect within the constellation, perhaps quickly expanding to the population of larger objects.” To mitigate the problem, an international Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee had imposed a “25-year rule” which required any object placed into earth orbit be out of orbit within 25 years of the end of service. Kessler said China was a member of the committee and should ensure its launches followed its guidelines. China has more than 100 satellites in space, with mainland media reports saying space debris warning authorities issued 87 red alerts for extremely close encounters with space debris last year. The JLCG-1 constellation will end its operational life by 2020, when the Chinese Space Station is due to start operation.

The retired Boeing aerospace engineer has posted a series of videos to Youtube showing his granchildren enjoying the coasters. The 'Out'n'Back Negative-G' starts from the top of a picnic table placed on his porch and speeds over a series of bumps and dips, before climbing a large slope and retracing the course backwards. Another ride dubbed 'Smaug the Terrible' after the character from The Hobbit barrels its way through the backyard, weaving between trees and looping under itself. The gifted grandfather has so far constructed three coasters, applying the same processes he used when he worked on aeroplanes and military vehicles at Boeing. The materials a bit of a step down from the cutting edge alloy he's used to - mainly lengths of timber and PVC pipe. In a post to Reddit, Mr Gregg described how he carefully designed each coaster with CAD schematics, calculated velocity, kinetic energy and G-forces for each twist and turn using spreadsheets and the accelerometer in his phone.  He carried out extensive safety tests with sandbags strapped to an infant car seat, before finally letting his grandson ride. Mr Gregg has plans for more coasters and has even published his own book, Backyard Coasters, in order to pass his knowledge along to the next generation of budding home-coaster enthusiasts. His efforts already have some dubbing him 'Granddad of the Century' - a claim which would be hard to deny.

Leave your laptop! Bill McGee, Special for USA TODAY 7:33 a.m. EDT September 7, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Tom Hanks stars as Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who safely landed his plane in the Hudson River, saving the lives of 155 crew and passengers. Passengers are evacuated after Delta Flight 1086 skidded off the runway at LaGuardia Airport during a snowstorm on March 5, 2015, in New York. (Photo: Larry Donnell, AP) The images eerily blur together. The latest appeared in August, this time with Emirates Flight 521 in Dubai. But they resembled British Airways Flight 2276 in Las Vegas and Delta Flight 1086 in New York, both in 2015. Ditto Asiana Flight 214 in San Francisco in 2013. And Cathay Pacific Flight 365 in Shanghai in 2011. Those inexplicable photos of passengers fleeing for their lives from smoking and even burning aircraft — while clutching carry-ons and shoulder bags, or maneuvering wheelies down evacuation slides. Such behavior is breathtakingly bizarre, considering that surviving some types of airline accidents has become statistically more common, as the new film Sully makes apparent. In fact, in an exhaustive study of domestic airline accidents over 17 years, the NTSB found 95.7% of occupants survived. But what a hollow victory that so many spectacular aeronautical advancements have reduced deaths due to impact and smoke inhalation and fire — yet you still may succumb anyway, because your seatmate is struggling to retrieve a laptop. Difficulty understanding Over the years I’ve written extensively about airline safety, including best practices for how to enhance your personal safety margins, as well as properly securing infants. But amid all the hotly contested comments, I can’t ever recall a human factors equation defying all logic. Some have suggested these incidents are due to language or cultural barriers, but they’re occurring everywhere. It’s best summed up by Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA: “Passengers stopping to grab their bags during an evacuation can be a matter of life and death for themselves and others around them. Flight attendants are trained to evacuate a plane in 90 seconds or less. Every second counts.” Recently I ranted about wheelie-dragging survivors to a close friend and was stunned by the response: “You’re making too much of it. It only takes A FEW SECONDS to get your carry-on. What’s the big deal?” And that’s when it hit me. Otherwise intelligent, sensible folks offer the “few seconds” argument without fully understanding just how precious such seconds are. Make no mistake: In aviation, life and death come down to nanoseconds. I spent months researching accident survival for my book Attention All Passengers, and discussed it in-depth with experts at the NTSB in Washington and Boeing in Seattle. Boeing employs a three-pronged approach to saving lives: surviving accidents, surviving post-crash fires, and safely evacuating. The most significant technological improvements over time may not seem momentous, but in this life-and-death struggle for that precious 90-second benchmark, such milestones include: • “low heat and smoke release” cabin materials • fire-resistant seat cushions • improved cabin insulation • floor path emergency lighting Technology has become predictable. Human behavior? That’s another matter. Human factors The carry-on conundrum is not a new phenomenon. Back in 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board released a Safety Study that examined 46 real-world evacuations over two years. It cited what 24 of 36 flight attendants found: “Passengers exiting with carry-on baggage were the most frequently cited obstruction to evacuation.” These real-world events included passengers evacuating with guitars, crutches and cases, as well as numerous accounts of heated arguments with flight attendants, blocked exits and minor injuries. Testimony included “waiting behind a passenger trying to maneuver a garment bag through an overwing exit.” Several significant factors have greatly exacerbated such problems: • The percentage of carry-on versus checked bags has soared since the widespread introduction of baggage fees in the late 2000s • Domestic airline cabins have become much fuller, with average load factors increasing from 72.4% in 2000 to 83.8% last year, while industry seat pitch became tighter • Electronic device usage has skyrocketed; a 2015 Pew Research Center study found 68% of U.S. adults carry smartphones and 45% carry tablets Blocking a row or aisle to collect belongings also can foment panic, which can be deadly during emergencies. Furthermore, each exit has been tested for a maximum number of passengers, but this assumes EVERY exit is properly working and not blocked; a decade ago the NTSB found slides failed in one-third of evacuations. And in 2005 Flight Safety Foundation reported the fatality rate with slide problems is 1.7 times higher than without such problems. There’s another overlooked factor: the danger in sending projectiles down a slide, potentially injuring others and/or damaging the slide itself. While working for airlines, I underwent egress training because I rode in cockpit jumpseats on charter and military flights; I recall a colleague breaking her ankle descending the slide. Consider that — a trained airline employee, supervised by safety experts, was still injured under the best of conditions. Yet some choose to descend in smoke, fire and adverse weather clutching a 50-pound bag? Research cites passengers retrieving items like wallets and medication when evacuating; it’s understandable, but hardly worth human lives. When I researched aerophobia I learned fear causes time to slow down for some passengers, so I contacted an expert, Dr. Mitchell Schare, director of the Phobia & Trauma Clinic at Hofstra University. He rejected this as a likely cause, and instead cited the “Beverly Hills Supper Club” syndrome, when people took cues from others and remained seated during a raging fire. Schare stated: “If the person next to you thinks it’s important to get their carry-on, then maybe you should. Before you know it, everybody’s engaging in the same foolish behavior.” Seeking solutions The NTSB found carry-ons were a “serious risk” and in 2000 recommended the Federal Aviation Administration “should develop advisory material to address ways to minimize the problems associated with carry-on luggage during evacuations.” Since then, this problem has grown worse, and aviation experts and airline blogs are weighing in with potential solutions, including: • Briefing cards. The NTSB found many (but not all) U.S. carriers recommend leaving behind personal items on safety briefing cards. But how many passengers actually review such cards? • Oral briefings. During safety briefings, some domestic carriers include warnings about leaving belongings, and some don’t. I asked the FAA for clarification and received this statement: “It is standard industry practice for U.S. airlines to use the pre-flight safety briefing to tell passengers to leave baggage and personal belongings behind during an evacuation.” But “standard industry practice” isn’t a regulation. As for flight attendant training, best practices recommend crews command passengers, “Leave everything!” But for many passengers, this is their first warning about abandoning items — and it comes at the worst possible time. Interestingly, Schare believes there’s sound psychological benefit in improving safety briefings: “People need ‘leaders’ to [advise them] during a crisis ... passengers should be told this philosophy.” • Penalizing passengers. The NTSB found flight attendant training doesn’t address “when passengers do not follow the command to leave everything behind.” AFA-CWA’s Nelson suggests, “Enforcement of fines associated with failing to comply with crewmember instructions may cause people to think twice.” Such enforcement would come from the FAA; if you search its site, you’ll find the agency does offer this advice: “If an emergency evacuation is necessary, leave your carry-on items on the plane. Retrieving personal items may impede the safe evacuation of passengers.” The FAA told me: “We expect passengers to pay attention to the safety briefing and follow their crew’s instructions to safely and quickly evacuate.” As for penalizing passengers, the FAA responded: “We have not fined anyone for taking bags with them in an emergency.” • Locking bins. Some believe crewmembers should automatically lock overhead bins upon activation of either seat belt or emergency floor path lighting. John Goglia, a former board member of the NTSB, recently wrote about this and warned of unintended consequences, particularly if a fire source is a computer or cellphone INSIDE a bin. Others note emergency equipment is sometimes stored in bins. And there’s little doubt the airlines will raise another factor — the potential costs of installing locks. That said, the FAA advised me: “We have no plans to lock the overhead.” Remember ... The NTSB estimates evacuations occur on U.S. aircraft once every 11 days on average. Until the FAA and airlines find solutions, you’ll need to protect yourself and loved ones. Consider the following: • Pay attention during the safety briefing (yes, even platinum frequent fliers). You HAVEN’T heard it all before, since you probably haven’t sat in that identical seat before, so your egress path is different. And count the rows to your nearest exit (there may be darkness or smoke). • Avoid shoes that fall off easily (flip-flops) and heels that are too high or spikey. Wear cotton or wool. • Stay buckled up, especially when instructed. Keep a clear path to the aisle. • The International Air Transport Association offers specific advice for evacuating with infants. • ALWAYS — follow all instructions from crewmembers! Survivability is far from certain if human error hinders safe egress. So one thing is certain. Until common sense becomes more common, you’d better hope such passengers aren’t seated next to an emergency exit.

Joel Kowsky/NASA/Handout via Reuters 2/2 By Irene Klotz | CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. An Atlas 5 rocket blasted off from Florida on Thursday carrying a robot space probe on NASA's first quest to collect samples from an asteroid and return them to Earth in hopes of learning more about the origins of life. The 19-story rocket, built and flown for NASA by United Launch Alliance, lifted off at 7:05 p.m. (2305 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, hurling the satellite explorer Osiris-Rex on its voyage to the near-Earth asteroid Bennu. The 3,300-pound (1,500-kg) solar-powered probe separated from the rocket's upper stage an hour after blastoff, soaring into space at 22,000 mph (35,400 kph) - more than 28 times the speed of sound - to begin its $1 billion, seven-year mission. It will take Osiris-Rex two years to reach its destination, a dark, rocky mass roughly a third of a mile wide and shaped like a giant acorn orbiting the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth. Bennu is thought to be covered with organic compounds dating back to the earliest days of the solar system. “You can think of these asteroids as literally prebiotic chemical factories that were producing building blocks of life 4.5 billion years ago, before Earth formed, before life started here,” NASA astrobiologist Daniel Glavin said before launch. Scientists believe asteroids and comets crashing into early Earth delivered water and organic compounds that seeded the planet for life. Atomic-level analysis of samples from Bennu could help them prove that theory. Once it settles into orbit around Bennu in 2018, Osiris-Rex will spend up to two more years mapping the asteroid's surface and taking inventory of its chemical and mineral composition. Scientists will ultimately choose a promising site on Bennu to sample and command Osiris-Rex to fly close enough to extend its robot arm to the asteroid's surface. A sampling container will then release a swirl of nitrogen gas, which will stir up gravel and soil for collection. "The more big pieces we can get the better ... they could contain the carbon molecules that we want to see," Jim Garvin, chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said on NASA TV. After gathering at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of material, Osiris-Rex will fly back to Earth, jettisoning a capsule bearing the asteroid-sample container for a parachute descent and landing in the Utah desert in September 2023. Only one other spacecraft, Japan’s Hayabusa, has previously returned samples from an asteroid to Earth, but it collected less than a milligram of material because of a series of problems. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is under way, with a return to Earth planned for December 2020. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Although Bennu occupies the same approximate orbital distance from the sun, it poses little threat to Earth. NASA estimates that there is a one-in-2,700 chance that Bennu might hit Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and Boeing (BA.N).

The 19-story rocket, built and flown for NASA by United Launch Alliance, lifted off at 7:05 p.m. (2305 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, hurling the satellite explorer Osiris-Rex on its voyage to the near-Earth asteroid Bennu. The 3,300-pound (1,500-kg) solar-powered probe separated from the rocket's upper stage an hour after blastoff, soaring into space at 22,000 mph (35,400 kph) - more than 28 times the speed of sound - to begin its $1 billion, seven-year mission. It will take Osiris-Rex two years to reach its destination, a dark, rocky mass roughly a third of a mile wide and shaped like a giant acorn orbiting the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth. Bennu is thought to be covered with organic compounds dating back to the earliest days of the solar system. "You can think of these asteroids as literally prebiotic chemical factories that were producing building blocks of life 4.5 billion years ago, before Earth formed, before life started here," NASA astrobiologist Daniel Glavin said before launch. Scientists believe asteroids and comets crashing into early Earth delivered water and organic compounds that seeded the planet for life. Atomic-level analysis of samples from Bennu could help them prove that theory. Once it settles into orbit around Bennu in 2018, Osiris-Rex will spend up to two more years mapping the asteroid's surface and taking inventory of its chemical and mineral composition. Scientists will ultimately choose a promising site on Bennu to sample and command Osiris-Rex to fly close enough to extend its robot arm to the asteroid's surface. A sampling container will then release a swirl of nitrogen gas, which will stir up gravel and soil for collection. "The more big pieces we can get the better ... they could contain the carbon molecules that we want to see," Jim Garvin, chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said on NASA TV. After gathering at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of material, Osiris-Rex will fly back to Earth, jettisoning a capsule bearing the asteroid-sample container for a parachute descent and landing in the Utah desert in September 2023. Only one other spacecraft, Japan's Hayabusa, has previously returned samples from an asteroid to Earth, but it collected less than a milligram of material because of a series of problems. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is under way, with a return to Earth planned for December 2020. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Although Bennu occupies the same approximate orbital distance from the sun, it poses little threat to Earth. NASA estimates that there is a one-in-2,700 chance that Bennu might hit Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

Not since 1987 has India signed a major defence contract with Sweden. The last one was the Bofors howitzer that ran into controversy over charges of kickbacks during Rajiv Gandhi's regime. Parrikar's scheduled visit this month would follow a five-day tour of Sweden in June by Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha. Raha flew in a version of the single-engine Gripen fighter during his visit. The maker of the Gripen, Swedish firm Saab, have proposed to set up capabilities in India to make the aircraft in India. It has also proposed technological cooperation in developing a Mark II version of the Tejas light combat aircraft. Parrikar has said in the past that the government would take a decision on a new line of fighter aircraft by the end of the current fiscal. The Gripen C/D and versions of the F-16 Fighting Falcon (made by the US Lockheed Martin), the F/A-E/F Super Hornet (made by Boeing, also of the US) did not make it through the trials conducted by the Indian Air Force for its tender for 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) since 2007. The Eurofighter Typhoon and the Rafale were "downselected". Rafale beat the Typhoon by quoting a lower price. The tender was cancelled last year after Prime Minister Modi announced in Paris that India will purchase 36 Rafale aircraft through a government-to-government contract with France. The negotiations have been stalled on issue of price for some months. But defence ministry sources say that a contract is now likely with a French delegation expected to arrive in Delhi within weeks. The contract could be the largest signed for the IAF with the value upwards of Euro 7 billion (between Rs 56,000 and Rs 60,000 crore). Sweden and Saab are now pitching the Gripen E for the Indian Air Force requirement of fighter aircraft. Unlike the Gripen C/D variant that was fielded in the trials in India, the Gripen E has a wider undercarriage that folds into its double-delta wings (and not its fuselage). India believes that with a wider and deeper understanding with the US in recent weeks - as exemplified by the Lemoa - the possibility of acquiring weapons platforms with US-origin equipment has brightened. The Gripen E is powered by US-origin GE-414 engines. Many of its avionics components are also of US-origin. The IAF is in the process of acquiring the LCA Tejas - said to be home-grown - that is of the same class as the Gripen in the sense that both are single-engined aircraft. The IAF has contracted 120 LCA Tejas with the GE 404 (US-origin) engine while the Gripen E has a more powerful GE 414 engine tailored for it. Swedish defence minister Peter Hultqvist visited New Delhi and invited Parrikar to the Gripen-manufacturing facilities in June last year. The Swedes have illustrated their offer to develop capabilities by citing experiences in South Africa and Brazil where they have won contracts and are setting up facilities after training local technicians. Hultqvist also visited the facilities of Hindustan Aeronautics and the Bharat Electronics in Bangalore.  More stories in Nation Temple & temporal: Rahul's journeys Other civil servants upset with IAS Akhilesh praises 'good boy' Rahul CPM trains temple gun at Sangh Iron mesh & arrests can't save Shah meet Ad watchdog proposes clearer disclaimers 2 central forces headless for a week 'Bromance' in full flow, questions on gains Jab for Kejri, haze on BJP Satellite milestone 'Trial' tag on surge price in train tickets Glare on Valley perks Modi tough on Pak, not so on China    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Founded in 2008 by arts lovers Jess Brown and Janet Wilson, the annual event brings New Orleans area arts and culture nonprofits to one spot, for one night so people could learn more about what great resources the city has.  Held Aug. 31 in the National World War II Museum's U.S. Freedom: The Boeing Center, Culture Collision 8 featured 62 organizations including Prospect New Orleans, NOLA Project, Birdfoot Chamber Music Festival, New Orleans Photo Alliance, New Orleans Public Library, Ashe Cultural Arts Center, Women's National Book Association/NOLA Chapter (which awards the Pinckley Prizes for Crime Fiction) and the Marigny Opera House. Working with event host WWNO, organizers also added Second Harvest Food Bank, United Saints Recovery Project and NOLA Pay It Forward for attendees to learn more or to donate in response to the Louisiana Flood of 2016. New Orleanians filled the center -- a sampling of people said it was one of their favorite events of the year -- who also enjoyed performances from OperaCreole, Dancing Grounds, National World War II Victory Belles, and a jazz ensemble from Xavier University Department of Music. The performances were in honor of the late Sharon Litwin, a well-known supporter of the arts and culture in New Orleans.  Culture Collision 8 was sponsored by Deveney, Dirty Coast, National World War II Museum, and Yelp, and organized by a planning committee representing the Arts Council of New Orleans, Deveney, Funny Bones Improv, Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, New Orleans Ballet Association, New Orleans Opera Association, Ogden Museum of Southern Art, Southern Rep, and WWNO. According to event co-founder Jess Brown, Culture Collision 8 "was our best year yet!" ******  To reach Sue Strachan, send an email to socialscene@nola.com or call 504.450.5904.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Ideology Not Evidence: What is (Not) Known about Independent Teacher Preparation Programs Ideology Not Evidence: What is (Not) Known about Independent Teacher Preparation Programs Posted on September 8, 2016 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Key New NEPC Brief Takeaway: The expansion of independent teacher education programs is not grounded in research evidence, raising equity concerns about how teachers are prepared to teach “other people’s children.” Boulder, CO (PRWEB) September 08, 2016 Advocacy groups and self-proclaimed social entrepreneurs are working aggressively to deregulate the preparation of teachers and to expand independent, alternative routes into teaching. The policy push is so powerful that it raises a real possibility that the nation may dismantle its university system of teacher education and replace much of it with independent, private programs not connected to colleges or universities. These new routes sometimes emphasize technical skills over deep, professional understanding. Accordingly, some of the new programs are very different from most teacher education programs provided by U.S. colleges and universities, which are usually grounded in core research knowledge—about the subject matter being taught as well as child and adolescent development and learning theory, all taught in the context of practice and of the students’ environment. In a brief released today, Independent Teacher Education Programs: Apocryphal Claims, Illusory Evidence, Ken Zeichner of the University of Washington reviews what is known about the quality of five of the most prominent independent teacher education programs in the U.S., including their impact on teacher quality and student learning. Zeichner is the Boeing Professor of Teacher Education at UW and is a member of the prestigious National Academy of Education. The five independent programs examined in Zeichner’s brief are: The Relay Graduate School of Education (Relay), Match Teacher Residency (MTR), High Tech High’s Internship, iTeach, and TEACH-NOW. His analysis demonstrates that claims regarding the success of such programs are not substantiated by peer-reviewed research and program evaluations. “The promotion and expansion of independent teacher preparation programs rests not on evidence, but largely on ideology,” says Professor Zeichner. “The lack of credible evidence supporting claims of success is particularly problematic given the current emphasis on evidence-based policy and practice in federal policy and professional standards.” Zeichner’s analysis also concludes that two of the programs, MTR and Relay, prepare teachers to use highly controlling pedagogical and classroom management techniques that are primarily used in schools serving students of color whose communities are severely impacted by poverty. In doing so, they contribute to the inequitable distribution of professionally prepared teachers and to the stratification of schools according to the social class and racial composition of the student body. “The teaching and management practices learned by the teachers in these two independent programs are based on a restricted definition of teaching and learning and would not be acceptable in more economically advantaged communities,” explains Zeichner. “Students in more economically advantaged areas have greater access to professionally trained teachers, less punitive and controlling management practices and broader and richer curricula and teaching practices.” At a time when we are working to educate an increasingly diverse student body, this shift away from preparing teachers with deep professional knowledge may negatively impact teacher quality and student learning. Professor Zeichner offers four specific recommendations based on these findings: State and federal policymakers should not implement policies and provide funding streams that promote the development and expansion of independent teacher education programs unless and until substantive credible evidence accrues to support them. There currently is minimal evidence. State policymakers should be very cautious in authorizing “teacher preparation academies” under a provision in the new federal education law (Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA). Such authorization would exempt those programs from the higher standards for teacher preparation that states typically seek to enforce for other teacher education programs. Policies should hold all teacher preparation programs to clear, consistent, and high standards. Teacher education program quality should be determined by an analysis of the costs and benefits of multiple outcomes associated with the programs. Policymakers should thus reject the argument made by two of these five programs (MTR and Relay) that the sole or overriding indicator of teacher and program quality should be students’ standardized test scores. State and federal policies that are designed to support the development of independent teacher education programs should include monitoring provisions to ensure that they do not contribute to a stratified system, where teachers serving more economically advantaged communities complete programs in colleges and universities to become professional educators, while teachers serving low-income communities receive only more technical, narrow training on how to implement a defined set of curricular, instructional and managerial guidelines.

Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Sep. 08, 2016 11:15AM EDT Last updated Thursday, Sep. 08, 2016 11:15AM EDT Comments AA Gordon Reid is president and CEO of Goodreid Investment Counsel. His focus is U.S. equities. Top Picks: Boeing (BA.N) Latest purchase Aug 2016 @ $134 Boeing is in full production and has a commercial aircraft backlog of 5,700 planes, representing over $400-billion. Visibility is good, valuations are reasonable and cash-flow is robust, supporting a 3-per-cent-plus dividend yield. Market Call Tonight: Top Picks from Goodreid's Gordon Reid (BNN Video) Dycom Industries (DY.N) Latest purchase April 2016 @ $84 Dycom is a telecom services company, capturing a large share of the massive amount of work to upgrade wireline networks to accommodate greater bandwidth. Organic revenue growth in the most recent financial report was an impressive 20 per cent. Earnings are soaring, yet valuations are modest, at less than 16 times the current year’s expected results. Home Depot (HD.N) Latest purchase Aug 2016 @ $137 Home Depot is growing, attractively priced, well managed and has multiple favourable trends supporting it. Household formation numbers are rising but are still lagging population growth. Interest rates remain low and lending standards are more relaxed than in past years. Unemployment is falling and GDP growth is steady. At 21 times earnings, Goodreid believes this issue is a buy. Past Picks: September 30, 2015 Facebook (FB.O) Then: $89.90 Now: $131.05 +45.77% Total return: +45.77% Citigroup (C.N) Then: $49.61 Now: $47.48 -4.29% Total return: -3.63% Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) Then: $53.33 Now: $70.90 +32.95% Total return: +34.71% Total Return Average: +25.62% Market outlook: The market’s message is confusing some participants, but Goodreid believes it should be taken at face value. A rate hike by the Federal Reserve is unlikely in September, but when it happens, it is likely to be another one and done until well into 2017. The earnings recession is showing signs of ending. Revenue growth has improved and valuations, given the monetary backdrop, are reasonable.

Buddy, can you spare $81.9 million? Perhaps NASA could adopt that as its unofficial theme song going forward, as that's how much we pay Russia to ferry each of our astronauts to the International Space Station. But the lyrics would have to be repeatedly changed, as the price per ride just keeps going up and up like, well, like a rocket. In 2006, we paid about $21.3 million for each seat on a Russian spacecraft. The trouble, of course, is that since NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011, hitching a ride on a Russian rocket is the only way to go. Russia, obviously aware of that sad fact, has been pricing those rides accordingly. NASA had been hoping that private ventures operated by companies such as SpaceX and Boeing could take over for the government-run National Aeronautics and Space Administration. So far, however, that dream has been little more than science fiction. When SpaceX saw a rocket blow up on the launch pad recently, it marked the second catastrophic failure for the company of late. The rocket and its payload – a commercial satellite – were lost, and the launch pad suffered serious damage. But not as much as the reputation of SpaceX. Boeing, for its part, hasn't been going great guns, either. When NASA decided to ground the space shuttle, the future became clear: The International Space Station would sooner or later become a truly big problem. Sooner or later is now. It's long past time to ask real questions about the future of the space station. Can it be maintained? Should it be maintained? Are we simply throwing good money after bad by continuing? Are the possible rewards worth the prohibitive cost? Is the dream of the International Space Station as a space-based center of cooperation and innovation just so much pie in the sky? Ask even those in the know to list the most significant benefits to have come from the venture, and you'll not get a very impressive response. Perhaps it's time to acknowledge that the International Space Station offered more in our collective imagination than it has provided in reality. Or, rather than actually asking the difficult questions, we could just keep on doing the same old expensive thing over and over again.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Atlas V begins OSIRIS-REx’s round trip to the asteroid Bennu September 8, 2016 by William Graham NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has began a seven-year round trip to the asteroid Bennu on Thursday, beginning its journey via a launch aboard the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V. Liftoff from SLC-41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was on time, at the start of a 115-minute window that opened at 19:05 local time (23:05 UTC). Atlas V – OSIRIS-REx Mission: The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer, or OSIRIS-REx, is NASA’s first sample-return mission to an asteroid, and – excluding the Apollo program – its third sample return mission beyond Earth orbit after the Genesis and Stardust probes. See Also LIVE Atlas V/OSIRIS-REx UPDATES ULA Forum Section L2 BEO Section Click here to Join L2 Japan’s Hayabusa spacecraft was the first mission to return an asteroid sample to Earth, completing operations in June 2010. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission of NASA’s New Frontiers program, following the New Horizons spacecraft which flew past Pluto last year and Juno, which arrived in orbit of Jupiter in early July. New Frontiers is a class of intermediate missions between the low-cost Discovery program and NASA’s flagship missions such as the Mars Science Laboratory. The OSIRIS-REx mission is expected to last seven years, culminating with the reentry of the spacecraft’s return capsule in September 2023. About two and a half years of the mission will be spent at the asteroid (101955) Bennu, from August 2018 to March 2021, with sampling of the asteroid expected to occur in 2020. Bennu was discovered on 11 September 1999 by scientists at the Lincoln Laboratory’s Near Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program using the Experimental Test Site (ETS) telescope at White Sands, New Mexico. It was provisionally named 1999 RQ36. An Apollo-class near Earth asteroid orbiting between 134 and 203 million kilometers (83.4 to 126 million miles; 0.897 to 1.36 astronomical units) from the Sun, Bennu has an orbital period of 437 days and a rotation period of 4.29 hours. The asteroid has a radius of approximately 246 meters (807 feet) and its mass has been estimated at between 60 and 77.6 billion kilograms (59 to 76 million Imperial tons; 66 to 86 million US tons). Bennu is classified as a B-type asteroid, within the wider C-group of dark-coloured carbonaceous asteroids. The B-type is believed to be a particularly primitive class of asteroid, dating back to the early Solar System, so studying and sampling it could provide scientists with a snapshot of conditions when the Solar System was forming. The asteroid was selected as the destination for OSIRIS-REx due to its proximity to Earth, being sufficiently large and with a slow enough rotation rate to make sample collection practical and the scientific interest in its carbonaceous composition. The goals of OSIRIS-REx’s mission are to return a sample of Bennu to Earth for analysis, to conduct a spectral analysis of the asteroid’s surface and characterise its composition, to investigate changes in the asteroid’s orbit due to the absorption and reemission of radiation – a phenomenon known as the Yarkovsky effect – and to study the structure of the asteroid’s regolith. Professor Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona is the principal investigator for the OSIRIS-REx mission, while the mission is being managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The spacecraft was constructed by Lockheed Martin Space Systems. *Click here for additional articles on this spacecraft* OSIRIS-REx will be powered by a pair of solar arrays, generating up to three kilowatts of power at perihelion. Unfuelled, the spacecraft has a mass of 880 kilograms (1,940 pounds) and at launch it will weigh 2,110 kg (4,650 lb). The sample return capsule – the only part of the spacecraft designed to return to Earth – has a mass of 46 kilograms (100 lb). As a sample-return mission, OSIRIS-REx’s primary objective is to collect a sample of Bennu and deliver it to Earth. The Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism, or TAGSAM, will be used to achieve the sampling part of the objective, while a reentry capsule will facilitate its safe return to Earth. TAGSAM consists of a sampler mounted on an extensible 3.35-meter (11-foot) arm. OSIRIS-REx will manoeuvre close to the asteroid without landing and deploy the arm to bring the sampler into contact with the surface. This will use a nitrogen jet to loosen surface material for collection. The spacecraft is carrying sufficient nitrogen to attempt this process three times if an insufficient amount of material is initially captured. At least sixty grams (2.1 ounces) of material is expected to be collected. Once sampling is complete, the sampler head will be stowed within OSIRIS-REx’s return capsule and detached from the arm. The return capsule will remain attached until OSIRIS-REx makes its final approach to Earth in September 2023, at which point it will separate with the main spacecraft bus subsequently performing a course correction to avoid also entering the atmosphere. The sample capsule will use an ablative heat shield to protect it as it reenters the atmosphere, descending under a parachute to a landing in Utah. Following landing, the capsule will be taken to the Johnson Space Center’s Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office for the study of its contents. A suite of instruments aboard OSIRIS-REx will aid in the location of a sample collection site, provide for additional study of the asteroid and give context to the samples returned. The OSIRIS-REx Camera Suite, or OCAMS, consists of three imaging payloads; the 20 cm (8-inch) PolyCam will be used for high-resolution imaging, reaching resolutions of up to one centimeter (0.4 in) while the spacecraft is scouting for a site from which to take its sample. MapCam will be used to produce high-resolution imagery of the asteroid’s surface and to search its proximity for satellite asteroids, while SamCam will observe the sample collection phase of the mission. The OSIRIS-REx Laser Altimeter (OLA) will use LIDAR to produce a three-dimensional map of the asteroid’s surface and to characterise its topography. Higher-resolution surveys will be conducted of candidate sample collection sites ahead of the sampling attempt. The OSIRIS-REx Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or OTIS, will produce spectra for thermal emissions from Bennu, allowing for minerals present in the surface to be characterised. The OSIRIS-REx Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (OVIRS) will analyse the light reflected by the asteroid – providing reflection spectra which can also be used to identify minerals present in the asteroid’s surface. The Regolith X-Ray Imaging System, or REXIS, will use a technique called X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to produce additional surface composition data. By studying the wavelengths of secondary x-rays emitted when the asteroid’s surface is bombarded with incident high-energy radiation, the instrument will characterise the elemental composition of the regolith. This research will complement the mineral composition determined by the OTIS and OVIRS instruments. Scientists also plan to study the Doppler shift affecting radio communication between OSIRIS-REx and Earth, accurately determining the spacecraft’s orbit and allowing Bennu’s mass to be inferred and gravitational field to be characterised. OSIRIS-REx began its mission atop United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket, which was making its sixty-fifth flight since its 2002 debut. The vehicle that launched OSIRIS-REx, tail number AV-067, flew in the Atlas V 411 configuration. Like all Atlas V versions, this consists of a Common Core Booster (CCB) first stage powered by an RD-180 engine burning RP-1 propellant and liquid oxygen, with a Centaur second stage which uses cryogenic propellants; liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. In this configuration, the rocket makes use of the single-engine version of Centaur, with one RL10C-1 providing thrust. The single-engine Centaur was introduced with the Atlas III in 2000 as an alternative to the twin-engine configuration the stage had used since the 1960s, and quickly became the standard. All Atlas V launches to date have used the single-engine model, although Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner – slated to begin launching late next year – will use a dual-engine Centaur. At liftoff, a single AJ-60A solid rocket motor ignited to provide additional thrust in the early stages of first stage flight. Thrust vectoring allows the rocket to remain under control while flying in this asymmetric configuration, which was used for the fourth time with Thursday’s launch. At the nose of the Atlas, OSIRIS-REx was encapsulated within a four-meter (13-foot) Large Payload Fairing – at 12 meters (39 feet) in length this is the shortest of three available four-meter fairings. The Atlas V has been chosen to launch a number of NASA’s exploration missions, beginning with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) in August 2005 and the New Horizons mission to Pluto in January 2006. Other planetary missions launched by the Atlas V have included the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and LCROSS in June 2009, the Juno mission to Jupiter and the Curiosity and MAVEN Mars probes. Atlas V was developed by Lockheed Martin to compete for the US Air Force’s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, which saw it developed alongside Boeing’s Delta IV. Production and operations of both vehicles – along with Boeing’s older Delta II rocket – was taken over by United Launch Alliance upon its formation in December 2006. ULA is currently in the process of phasing out the Delta IV and developing a new rocket, Vulcan, to replace both EELVs. Thursday’s launch began with ignition of the first stage’s RD-180 engine 2.7 seconds in advance of the planned T-0 mark in the countdown. Ignition of the solid rocket motor and liftoff occurred 1.1 seconds after the zero mark. Ascending from Cape Canaveral’s Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41), AV-067 began a series of pitch and yaw manoeuvres after 6.7 seconds of flight to establish an 89-degree launch azimuth taking it almost due East over the Atlantic Ocean. The vehicle reached Mach 1 – the speed of sound – 56.9 seconds after launch before passing through the area of maximum dynamic pressure, or Max-Q, 11.7 seconds later. The AJ-60A booster is designed to burn for around ninety seconds, after which its thrust tailed off. Its spent casing remained attached until the two-minute, nineteen-second mark when conditions were optimal for its jettison. The first stage burned for four minutes and 2.8 seconds before shutting down its RD-180 engine, an event designated Booster Engine Cutoff (BECO). Six seconds after BECO the spent Common Core Booster separated and the Centaur began its prestart sequence, culminating in ignition – designated Main Engine Start 1 (MES-1) ten seconds after staging. Centaur’s first burn lasted eight minutes and 3.7 seconds, establishing an initial parking orbit. Following the conclusion of the burn at Main Engine Cutoff 1 (MECO-1) the Centaur coasted for 21 minutes and 25.7 seconds. After its coast phase concluded, Centaur restarted for a second burn. Lasting six minutes and 50.4 seconds, this burn propelled OSIRIS-REx to Earth escape velocity and into heliocentric orbit. Spacecraft separation occurred a quarter of an hour after the end of the second burn, at 55 minutes and 38.6 seconds elapsed time, over the Indian Ocean. Centaur underwent blowdown and safing 26 minutes and 20 seconds after separation, with the Atlas’ mission concluding one hour, 56 minutes and 58.6 seconds after liftoff. Following launch, OSIRIS-REx will perform a series of manoeuvres as it journeys towards the asteroid Bennu. This will include a flyby of Earth which is scheduled to occur on 22 September next year in order to gain a gravity assist. The spacecraft is currently slated to arrive at Bennu in August 2018, remaining there until March 2021. The sample return capsule is expected to return to Earth on 24 September 2023 while the parent spacecraft will remain in orbit around the Sun. The OSIRIS-REx launch is the first from Cape Canaveral after the explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fuelling for a static fire test on 1 September. The explosion occurred at Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40), adjacent to Atlas’ SLC-41. Although they have always been numbered separately, the two pads were both originally part of the Titan Integrate-Transfer-Launch (ITL) complex along with a shared processing facility which has since been demolished. At the time of the explosion OSIRIS-REx was already atop the Atlas V and enclosed within its payload fairing, having arrived at the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) on 29 August. The Atlas was inside the VIF when the Falcon explosion occurred a little over a mile away. Despite this, NASA and ULA are confident that the payload and rocket suffered no damage and the Atlas launch has continued on schedule. Thursday’s launch is the fifth Atlas V launch of 2016 and the eighth of the year for United Launch Alliance (ULA), who have also launched three Delta IV rockets. ULA’s next launch is currently scheduled for 16 September with another Atlas carrying the commercial Worldview 4 imaging satellite into orbit. That mission will launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket is scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to dispatch the robot explorer Osiris-Rex on a seven-year mission. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Osiris-Rex is headed to a 1,640-foot-wide (500-meter-wide) asteroid named Bennu, which circles the sun in roughly the same orbit as Earth. NASA estimates that there is a one-in-2,700 chance that Bennu might hit Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199. Heating from the sun gently pushes the asteroid, and charting its path is among the goals of the $1 billion mission. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Osiris-Rex is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and begin a two-year study of its physical features and chemical composition. The solar-powered spacecraft will then fly to Bennu’s surface and extend a robot arm to collect at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of what scientists hope will be carbon-rich material. ‘Time capsule’ “We’re going to asteroid Bennu because it’s a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation, back when our planetary system was spread across as dust grains in a swirling cloud around our growing protostar,” lead researcher Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona told a prelaunch news conference Tuesday. Inside the developing solar system, small rocky bodies were beginning to form, many of them studded with water ice and organic materials, which are key compounds that may have made Earth habitable or even given life its start, Lauretta said. If all goes as planned, the capsule containing samples from Bennu will be jettisoned from the returning Osiris-Rex spacecraft on September 24, 2023, for a parachute descent and landing at the U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. Osiris-Rex is the latest in a series of missions to asteroids that began with the 1991 flyby of asteroid Gaspra by NASA’s Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft. Japan’s Hayabusa 1 probe managed to return a few tiny grains of asteroid Itokawa to Earth in 2010, the first asteroid sample return mission. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is underway. The Osiris-Rex launch is set for between 7:05 p.m. and 9:05 p.m. EDT Thursday (2305 to 0105 GMT on Friday).

For starters, two of three Americans, 65 percent, say that globalization—defined as "the increasing connections of our economy to others around the world"—is good for the U.S. That's the highest figure since the council began polling on that question two decades ago, with majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents all holding positive views. (Read the report below.) On the proposed TPP deal itself, 60 percent of those surveyed support it, the council reported, down a bit from 64 percent last year but still a clear majority. Support drops off among Republicans, traditionally the party of free trade, with 47 percent of Trump backers in favor of TPP but 58 percent of GOPers who voted for other presidential candidates in favor of the deal. Somewhat less favorable are results broken down by demographic group. In general, support for international trade and views of its impact on consumers rise with income and educational level. But those surveyed appear to recognize that there's a cost to getting more competition and cheaper prices: Only about a third say international trade is good for "job security for American workers." The survey was conducted for the council by GfK Custom Research. It sampled 2,061 adults online from June 10 to 27. The overall margin of error is plus or minus 2.2 to 3.5 percentage points, depending on the question, but higher among subgroups. So, is there a silent majority of sorts on trade that smart pols could tap? Maybe.

Blasting News > News > 2016 > 09 > NASA OIG report suggests delays of commercial crew vehicles Published on: 7 September 2016 7 September 2016 Published on 07/09/2016 Mark Whittington - Expert in News M. Whittington Follow Following Rate the news NASA OIG report suggests delays of commercial crew vehicles Technical challenges beset the Boeing CST-100 and the SpaceX Dragon development programs Boeing CST-100 Starliner in orbit Advertisements In a report issued before the accident that destroyed a SpaceX Falcon 9 and its Israeli communications satellite payload, and trashed a launch pad, #NASA’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the first commercial crew flights would be delayed until at least late 2018. Both the #Boeing CST-100 Starliner and the #SpaceX Dragon are facing significant technical challenges that have to be overcome before the two spacecraft can fly crews to and from the International Space Station, according to Space News. Previous development delays could be ascribed to funding shortfalls. In this case, the delays are the result of the technical challenges that just about every space system is beset with during its development phase. Boeing is encountering problems in the mass growth of its spacecraft as well as “aeroacoustical loads” that would be inflicted on the Atlas V rocket during launch. SpaceX is experiencing a significant design change from a vehicle that lands on land to one that splashes down on water, much like the old Apollo spacecraft did. It is also having trouble with a number of subsystems, including the parachutes and a tunnel that allows crews to access the International Space Station. The report highlights one of the limitations of the commercial model for spaceflight. While commercial entities are undoubtedly more flexible than the bureaucratic bound NASA in developing space systems and therefore can accomplish the task cheaper. However, the inherent technical challenges of developing new space systems are the same, whether it takes place under the old NASA-centric system or the commercial system. Schedule slippages and even cost overruns are inevitable no matter which approach is used. Too many commercial space advocates have oversold the commercial model, claiming, to paraphrase an old axiom by Arthur C. Clarke, that any sufficiently commercial process is indistinguishable from magic. To be sure, the commercial model is the soundest approach to pursue in the long run since it should provide cost savings once new space systems become operational because of market competition. But problems, whether the ones uncovered by NASA’s OIG, or whatever caused the recent SpaceX Falcon 9, are inevitable and need to be worked through without resort to hype or magical thinking.   Advertisements Donald Trump to avoid Trump University fraud charges with multi-million dollar settlement Donald Trump makes his first cabinet nominations Declawing your cat may soon be a crime in some states Share Share comments comment 0 Share Rate the news   Advertisements Advertisements Most discussed news Trump selects Reince Priebus as Chief of Staff; Steve Bannon for Senior Advisor K.

The unmanned spacecraft, known as OSIRIS-REx, is poised to blast off at 7:05 pm (23:05 GMT) atop an Atlas V rocket in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The weather forecast is 90 percent favorable for liftoff. The $800 million mission will travel for two years on a journey to Bennu, a near-Earth asteroid about the size of a small mountain. The United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft on board is rolls out of the Vertical Integration Facility to Space Launch Complex 41 on September 7, 2016 ©Joel Kowsky (NASA/AFP/File) Bennu was chosen from the some 500,000 asteroids in the solar system because it orbits close to Earth's path around the sun, it is the right size for scientific study, and it is one of the oldest asteroids known to NASA. "For primitive, carbon-rich asteroids like Bennu, materials are preserved from over four and a half billion years ago," explained Christina Richey, OSIRIS-REx deputy program scientist at NASA. These "may be the precursors to life in Earth or elsewhere in our solar system." OSIRIS-REx's main goal is to gather dirt and debris from the surface of the asteroid and return it to Earth by 2023 for further study. Learning more about the origins of life and the beginning of the solar system are key objectives for the SUV-sized OSIRIS-REx, which stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer. The mission should also shed light on how to find precious resources such as water and metals in asteroids, a field that has generated increasing interest worldwide. "We are going to map this brand-new world that we have never seen before," said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator and professor at the University of Arizona, Tucson. Using a suite of cameras, lasers and spectrometers, "we are really going to understand the distribution of materials across the surface of that asteroid," he added. "We are a trailblazer for that kind of activity because our science requires it." The spacecraft is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and spend two years studying it before it begins the sample collection attempt in July 2020. - 'Gentle high five' - NASA hopes the solar-powered OSIRIS-REx will bring back the largest payload of space samples since the Apollo era of the 1960s and 1970s, when American explorers collected and carried back to Earth some 800 pounds (360 kilograms) of moon rocks. The collection device, known as the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM), should pick up about two ounces (60 grams) from the asteroid, but in tests so far it has generally picked up five times that amount. TAGSAM contains a type of reverse-vacuum mechanism that was invented by a Lockheed Martin engineer who tested the concept a decade ago using a red plastic Solo cup in his driveway. The spacecraft will not land on the asteroid, but will get very close and reach out with an arm like a pogo-stick for a quick, three-to-five second maneuver. Rich Kuhns, OSIRIS-REx program manager with Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver, described the movement as a "gentle high-five." The sample collector will shoot a bit of compressed air at the asteroid and gather the dust it kicks up in a container. "Three-quarters of the sample will be set aside for future researchers -- for the science questions we haven't figured out to even ask yet," said Gordon Johnston, an OSIRIS-REx program executive at NASA headquarters. NASA has also promised four percent of the sample to its major partner in the effort, Canada, and another half-percent to Japan. - Orbital nudges - Yet another aim of the mission is to measure how sunlight can nudge asteroids as they orbit, a phenomenon known as the Yarkovsky effect, so scientists can better predict the long-term risk of asteroids like Bennu colliding with Earth. In 2135, Bennu is expected to pass just slightly within the moon's orbit, a "particularly close approach (that) will change Bennu's orbit by a small amount, which is uncertain at this time and which may lead to a potential impact on Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199," NASA said. However, the risk of a collision during this 24-year period is low -- just 0.037 percent, or a one in 2,700 chance. - Past missions - It was the Japanese space agency JAXA that first proved sample collection from an asteroid was possible. JAXA's Hayabusa spacecraft crash-landed into the surface of its target asteroid and managed to return a few micrograms of material in 2010. In December 2014, JAXA launched a follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, that should reach the asteroid Ryugu in 2018. The Hayabusa 2 spacecraft is supposed to place a small lander named Mascot on the space rock's surface, and return asteroid samples by 2020.

India’s next four Poseidon-8I long-range maritime surveillance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft could come fitted with domestically-made composite interior panels. Tata Advanced Materials Ltd (TAML), a subsidiary of Tata Industries, has been awarded a contract from Boeing to provide composite interior closeout panels for the P-8 aircraft that cover the interior wall structure of the aircraft, a statement from the Tatas said. The contract entails supplying interior panels on a global basis. However, industry sources said it is not clear if the Indian version of the aircraft would come fitted with TAML-made panels as they are not the sole providers. The P-8 is designed for long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare as well as armed intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. India had on July 27 signed an over $1-billion deal with American defence and aerospace major Boeing for procuring four additional Poseidon-8I. The contract is a follow-on order to eight P-81 planes already bought by India in a direct deal worth $2.1 billion with the firm.

Podcast: Will Airplanes Ever Fly Themselves? Discuss this Gallery 10 JETTEPILOT on Sep 8, 2016 It has been interesting to follow the development of such procedures over the course of the last 40 years. It appears that it has finally all come together. In the late 70's we had early implementations (in Paris) of simply parallel approaches using ILS. In the early 80's development began on concepts for "data link" to improve the ability to navigate and surveil. I recall writing a paper in '81 describing closely-spaced parallel operations using the former Denver Stapleton as an example. One aircraft was to fly a 3.5 degree glideslope and use a displaced threshold. Eventually such a concept was implemented in Frankfurt. In the middle 80's the promise of the Microwave Landing system allowed experiments with curved or segmented approach paths and the ability to adjust GS angles. But, the promise of satellite based guidance delayed the widespread implementation of those concepts for about 15 years. With the improvements in GPS-based systems manufacturers and airlines were willing to incur the expenses associated with equipping their aircraft and the RNP programs began with incremental implementations of approach procedures using GPS-based navigation and improved data communication systems. If one compares the way aircraft navigated in 1976 (when i got my pilot's license) to what is being demonstrated at SFO it is indeed a revolution. Although, the fact it took 40 years for the technology, operational concepts, equipage, and certification to all come together makes it an evolution. Congratulations to everybody who moved the system forward over the last 40 years. Log In or Register to post comments cageordie on Sep 8, 2016 When I was at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Bedford) in 1983 we had MADGE on the side of the main runway. The RN had deployed on carriers in 1976 and Shell had trialed on north sea oil platforms in the late 70s (they published in 1978) for digitally guided curved precision approaches. MLS had better marketing but never delivered on the promise despite being chosen by the ICAO in 1978. There were some claims that MADGE would not work on specific airfields, made by the MLS marketing people, that ICAO believed but were proved to be false. MADGE marketing people fought too fair. The BLEU developed the autoland systems used to this day from WWII technology and could have delivered blind precision curved approaches 40 years ago. They did for the RN and Shell. It isn't that the technology is not available. There are even uncertified systems which you can run on an iPad which will continuously compute power off approaches for your aircraft from its current position to the best available runway (it searches nearby airports to find which runways are in range and suitable for your landing performance), then all you have to do is fly through the boxes on the synthetic vision display and arrive at the runway. So much technology is available, just not on commercial aircraft. Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Sep 8, 2016 It think Jettepilot is right. Diverse developments have come together with space based navigation aids presenting a revolutionary conclusion to an era of incremental development. Eighty years ago the Low Frequency Adcock Range system was just replacing a system if beacon lights spaced along the airways. As one station was located near an airport it was possible to use them for non-precision approaches. In Europe the Lorenz Beam landing system was developed and adapted by Deutsche Lufthansa. The somewhat similar Diamond-Dunmore system was developed by the Bureau of Standards. The USA didn't adapt it but France did. The US system eventually was developed into the CAA Instrument Landing System (ILS). After WW II it became a world standard. The immense deficiencies of the Low Frequency range was addressed by the VHF Omni Directional Radio Range. VOR required many more stations but it was not rendered useless by weather and could be used in 360° rather than just 4 directions. Add Distance Measuring Equipment (DME). Finally there was Autoland CAT II in 1972 and you have the world Jettepilot was introduced to. The whole time from earliest radio navigation systems c1919 to the combination of ILS and VOR in 1946 was one of fragmented developments. The period 1946 to Autoland CAT III in 1975 was a period of refinement and integration. What this article portends is an integrated system of navigation, air traffic control approach and landing with a fantastic possibility. All previous systems were dependent upon land based transmitters and therefore were to some, often a large degree limited in range and application. It is not mentioned in the brief article but I think the replacement of NDB approaches with a precision system available in every equipped aircraft world wide is more remarkable than more efficient use of major airport runways. Precision landings will need ground-based augmentation system but a precision approach should be available anywhere procedures have been established. Jettepilot is right, it is all coming together again and it looks to be great. Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement JETTEPILOT on Sep 8, 2016 Well, true, I guess it's a bit short-sighted of me to only look back 40 years. The history of navigation goes back to the Phoenicians, but I'm not quite that old to speak about it from personal experience. There is a great exhibit at the smithsonian on navigation, by-the-way, "Time and Navigation" that traces the last 300 years or so. The contents of the latest cockpits are in fact the results of some brilliant efforts by thousands of people over hundreds of years. Pilots are a fortunate group to be there to enjoy the accomplishments. ...Never in the course of history have so few owed so much to so many . Log In or Register to post comments stsmark on Sep 8, 2016 They actually had one of the Max8 flight test aircraft doing demo approaches for this a few weeks earlier at SFO. Log In or Register to post comments bucket on Sep 9, 2016 I am totally confused! What is a precision approach if it's not 3 dimensional? As long as an aeroplane is airborne, it is flying in a 3 dimensional environment. Log In or Register to post comments DTRT on Sep 9, 2016 bucket - yes, a precision approach via standard ILS is three dimensional guidance, just as is provided by an LPV GPS approach. The difference with the RNP approaches at airports like SFO is that they are not limited to approach fixes connected by straight line paths (both vertical and horizontal), but can also include curved approaches (again, both vertical curves and horizontal curves). Conceptually these RNP approaches in 3D space resemble a freeway ramp or flyover that has both horizontal and vertical parabolic curves, leading to the runway. The standard ILS or LPV approach would be more like a grid road layout, with straight lines between the intersections. This allows a more efficient, shorter approach path which in turn enables higher traffic loads at busy airports.

An aerial view of the campus on 66th Avenue West in Lynnwood, as it looks in 2016. As Edmonds Community College prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary, President Dr. Jean Hernandez points to what she sees as the college’s greatest strength: its middle name. “I tell people that at Edmonds Community College, there’s a really strong sense of community,” said Hernandez, who has been at the helm of EdCC since 2011. “When I first got here I was really impressed with how many faculty and staff knew their students, knew them by name, knew their life stories. They cared about them.” Hernandez said she feels that same community connection as she travels throughout the college’s Snohomish County service area. (The Washington State Legislature established service areas for each of the state’s 34 community colleges, although students can attend any college depending on their educational needs.) Edmonds Community College President Dr. Jean Hernandez “I’ve met so may people who’ve gone to school here and many of them have just taken a couple of classes,” Hernandez said. “But they’ll often say they are still in contact with their faculty, that they still have colleagues that they met here that they are connected with.” The college now serves an average of 11,600 students per quarter, with as many 20,000 students taking classes in a year. That includes 850 students who are enrolled in the college’s Running Start program, which allows high school juniors and seniors to take college-level classes tuition free and earn dual high school and college credit. Edmonds Community College was formally dedicated 49 years ago, on Sept. 7, 1967. On Friday, Sept. 16, the school officially launches a yearlong celebration of 50 years in the community with festivities at Triton Field. Starting at 4 p.m. that day, there will be live music, food from local food trucks and drinks from a no-host beer and wine garden – and everyone in the community is invited. Appropriately, the master of ceremonies for the Sept. 16 celebration is Don Wick, EdCC’s first elected student body president. Now retired, Wick served as executive director of the Skagit County Economic Development Association. In 2002, the Edmonds Community College Foundation named him a Distinguished Alumni. The college offered its first classes in leased space at the former Woodway High School, and portable buildings also housed classrooms on college property while the school was being built on the former site of the U.S. Army’s Northwest Relay and Radio Receiving Station. The radio station, constructed in 1930, was operated by the U.S. Army and the Alaska Communication System to provide service to Alaska during World War II. An Enterprise newspaper clipping announcing the college’s graduating class of 24 in 1969. EdCC’s first graduate – in 1968 – was Susan Blackborn. The following year, in 1969, the college graduated 24 students. As Edmonds CC enters its 50th year, the college now sits on a 50-acre campus in Lynnwood. It features 28 computer labs, nine science labs, three restaurants, two greenhouses, a digital recording studio, an art gallery, a theater, a child care center, a gym, Triton Field, a transit center, an on-campus residence hall and a university satellite center for Central Washington University. Mountlake Terrace City Councilmember Laura Sonmore Over the years, the college has produced many leaders – both in the ranks of its alumni and its employees. Among them is Mountlake Terrace City Councilmember Laura Sonmore, a Mountlake Terrace native who has served on the city council for 16 years. Sonmore earned her bachelor’s degree in law and justice from Central Washington University but prior to that received her paralegal degree from Edmonds CC, where she served as student body president and received a Distinguished Alumni Award in 2004. Now a Boeing Company employee, Sonmore recalled being one of seven students selected – out of more than 700 applicants – to participate in an Edmonds CC leadership program in 1980 called Lead and Earn. “ It was fabulous! “ she said. “We worked on every program on campus during the summer — for the president office, financial office, bookstore. During school I ran the art and cultural program with a budget of $35,000.” Lynnwood Mayor Nicola Smith City of Lynnwood Mayor Nicola Smith was serving as Edmonds CC’s Dean of Student Life and Development when she was elected to lead the city in 2013. Smith, who started working at the college in 1987, remembered being on the planning committee for the college’s 25th anniversary. “At that time the college was climbing to great heights with an entrepreneurial attitude, quickly adjusting to serve local and international educational needs,” Smith said. “Through the years, EdCC has adjusted educational services to serve the economic ebbs and flows, developed degrees to train people to current job needs and embraced a culture that included students in a holistic community experience,” including on-campus housing and a strong athletic program, she added. Describing the college as “a jewel in South Snohomish County,” Smith pointed to “child care that teaches parenting skills and supports family success; the LEAF School that partners with tribes, government agencies, non-profits, and businesses to engage students through service-learning and community-based research; and, through student leadership and government.” Edmonds Mayor Dave Earling Edmonds Mayor Dave Earling remembers being hired to start the instrumental music department at nearby Shoreline Community College in 1967 just prior to the establishment of Edmonds CC. “My, my, my and EdCC is now a leader in the state community college system,” Earling said. “Innovative, creative, proactive and engaged in the communities. Jean Hernandez and her staff truly understand the importance of working locally and at the same time being a regional player.” For Hernandez, the school’s success comes back to that sense of community. As an example, she cited a scholarship program, set up by faculty in the adult basic education pre-college program, designed to cover students’ pressing needs. “Whenever any of their students need tuition money or money for books, they can give it to them from this pot of money, and that has been just an amazing support,” Hernandez said. There is also a support system for employees, started by an Edmonds CC staff member who first came to the college 20 years ago as a financially struggling single mother, Hernandez said. The woman was able to attain her high school diploma through the Edmonds Career Access Program (EdCAP), which helps students earn a high school diploma in a college setting. Now in her early 40s, she went on to earn both associates and bachelors degrees and now serves as a counselor and case manager for the EdCAP program. “She came to us and said, ‘Why don’t we have an emergency fund for our own employees?’” Hernandez said, adding such a system is now in place for employees in need. That EdCAP counselor also serves as a role model for others, Hernandez noted. “When she meets with students, she tells them, ‘Hey, I was homeless, I was poor and look at me now, working as a full-time advisor in higher education. You can do it too.’” Anyone walking around the Edmonds CC campus can’t miss the school’s diverse student population, which includes 38 percent students of color. The school also has nearly 1,500 international students from 62 countries. Of those international students, about one-third come to Edmonds CC as high school juniors and senior so they can obtain a U.S. high school diploma, and another one-third participate in the college’s intensive English as a Second Language program. Upon completing those programs, students usually don’t stay at the college for a two-year degree but instead jump directly to a four-year university. International students contribute to the school’s cultural diversity. International student tuition helps to support the college financially, Hernandez said, noting that students coming from other countries “have to prove they have the financial means” before attending EdCC. Even though they pay three times more in tuition than domestic students, international students find it’s cost-effective to complete their two-year degree at Edmonds CC, then transfer to a four-year school, she added. The issue of college affordability weighs on Hernandez’s mind. “It’s sad to see people in their mid-20s leaving college with this huge debt,” she said. She supports President Obama’s call for free community college tuition for students coming directly out of high school, although there appears to be little likelihood of such a measure coming out of the gridlocked U.S. Congress. She stressed the importance of college students “really figuring out what is your goal or purpose in life and then what do you need to have a living wage or a means of supporting your family or yourself financially.” That may mean a two-year or four-year college degree, or it may mean a certificate program for a specific skill. “There’s a lot more talk about work readiness, job readiness and that’s definitely a hallmark for community colleges,” Hernandez said. “For most of us, 35-50 percent of our programs are work-related, while at a university those pretty much are all, ‘get your bachelors or masters and then you can get a job.’” Statistics show that students are more likely to complete college if they start right out of high school and take a full class load. That’s why the college this year launched a program offering to cover the cost of first-quarter textbooks to any graduating high school senior from the Edmonds School District. Students must have a 2.5 GPA or higher, and register for at least 15 credits to receive a voucher of up to $500 for books at the on-campus Barnes and Noble bookstore. “If a student is full time, not only do they save money, they save time and are more likely to complete,” Hernandez said. “The momentum’s there.” Some of the state’s community colleges have expanded their scope to include four-year degrees. In Bellevue, for example, the school now offers a bachelor of science degree in nursing and has dropped “community” from its name. Edmonds Community College is moving toward also offering a select number of four-year “applied baccalaureate” degrees, which focus on skills-based training, but will continue to be known as a community college, Hernandez said. A bachelor of Applied Science in Child, Youth, and Family Services has just been approved and still in planning stages, and Edmonds CC hopes to offer it in either spring or fall 2017. Other possible degrees are in the early planning stages, Hernandez said. But the bottom line is to ensure that students are following the path that is right for them. “Sometimes you don’t need a bachelor’s degree for what you want to do in life,” she said. “You need a certificate or two-year degree. So if we help you figure it out sooner, it’s going to save you time and money.” To that end, the college is looking into developing a program called guided pathways, which works to help students identify sooner what career path they’d like to follow, and what specific classes they need to get there. The college is exploring development of a guided pathways program to help students identify a career path. The idea is this: In the first quarter, students are part of a cohort – such as engineering, health or business – that includes career exploration. If you are in the health cohort, for example, you’d be asked whether you were interested in becoming a doctor, a registered nurse or a pharmacist. “You have students learn what those options are and then based on that, you get them into the right pipeline,” Hernandez said. “If you want to go into pharmacy, get a two-year pharmacy tech, then transfer to the University of Washington for a bachelor’s in biology and go on to become a doctor of pharmacy.” “It’s much more intrusive but it’s also very upfront, very clear what classes you need to be successful in those particular fields,” she added. “About 25 percent of our students are the first generation in their families to go to college, so they are not really sure why they’re here or where to begin. It helps to provide that sort of support for them.” The college also has a major capital project in the pipeline: construction of a $36 million science, engineering and technology building that Hernandez said will become “a hub for engineering, physics, chemistry, all the sciences that are out there.” While funding hasn’t been officially awarded, the Edmonds CC building is first on the list for community college capital projects, “and I would be very surprised if we did not get it,” Hernandez said. Groundbreaking for the building, to be located between the college gym and Mountlake Terrace Hall, is anticipated in summer 2017. New banners on campus celebrating the school’s 50th anniversary also sport a new logo featuring the Triton, the school’s mascot. Despite five decades of success, Hernandez said there is still more work ahead for Edmonds Community College – and that comes down to educating the community about what’s available to them close to home. “I would like to see us do a better job of saturating our community,” she said. “I think there are still a lot of individuals in our backyard who either don’t realize how easy it is to get into college or how there are so many ways to pay for it. “I would love to see higher percentage of our community educated over the next two to four years, knowing that they are going to have a better chance of making a living wage if they have a year or two years (of college) under their belt.” — By Teresa Wippel SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleReminder: American Association of University Women to host kickoff event Sept. 10 Next articleEditor at large: Till fence do us part Administrator First and last name must be used for comment to be approved.

Elected officials joined representatives from the U.S. Department of Defense and others to christen the San Jose, Calif., headquarters and research facility of NextFlex America's Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Institute. The Department of Defense (DoD) previously awarded the cooperative $75 million in grant funding so the cooperative - comprised of a mix of public and private companies with advanced scientific capabilities, as well as leading universities - could ensure that the United States leads the world in producing the kinds of wearable electronic devices that could have groundbreaking applications for the military and health care. The cooperative brings together a diverse set of members - other Fortune 500 companies in addition to Eastman include General Electric, Boeing and Raytheon - that can bring diverse scientific and technology expertise to the table and accelerate innovation. Eastman, which has a research and development site in nearby Palo Alto, contributes world-class materials science capabilities and a materials understanding is an essential building block of flexible hybrid electronics (FHE). This FHE technology combines printed electronics manufactured on flexible substrates with semiconductor devices. Members of NextFlex America's Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Institute are working together to develop, pilot and manufacture these technologies in forms that can be attached to the human body. These FHEs could also be attached to vehicles or other structures. A key facet is that FHEs can be bent, rolled, folded and integrated physically in ways that traditional, rigid electronics cannot. The potential to put technology on human bodies in order to monitor the health and stress levels of soldiers on the battlefield - or for medical patients in the health care setting - could vastly improve medical response time or provide advance notification that medical intervention is necessary, which would improve health and save lives. FHE devices could also be leveraged to improve other devices that include robotic prosthetic limbs for injuries soldiers, amputees or cancer survivors, as well as sensor patches for premature babies that are too fragile for traditional blood work and tests.  "Eastman is excited to collaborate with other innovation leaders who are driving the cutting edge of advanced technologies," said Steve Crawford, Eastman senior vice president and chief technology officer. "The Eastman team values this type of collaboration and believes this could be a true differentiator in accelerating the development of technologies that will have a significant impact on how we live in the future." The cooperative is part of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation program, a federal initiative to support advanced manufacturing in the United States and secure U.S. leadership in emerging technologies. The $75 million award from the DoD was augmented by another $96 million in public and private funding.

By Jeffrey Lin & Peter W. Singer China Will Resurrect The World's Largest Plane Signs deal to restart Ukrainian An-225 By Jeffrey Lin and P.W. Singer posted Sep 7th, 2016 at 10:15am Antonov An-225 The An-225, which can carry 250 tons of cargo, is the world's heaviest aircraft. China buying and building An-225s would exponentially increase its power projection capabilities not just in Asia, but across the world. On August 30, members of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AICC) and the Antonov Corporation, the leading Ukrainian aviation company, signed an agreement to restart production of the AN-225, the world's largest cargo aircraft. Antonov To Space The An-225's large size was the result of its initial mission to transport the massive Soviet Buran space shuttle, which could weigh up to 105 tons, to launch. Unrealized Soviet planes also intended for the An-225 to launch other reusable space launch systems in mid air. The 640 ton, six engine An-225 is the world's largest aircraft. Measuring at 84 meters in length and a wingspan of over 88 meters, it carries a world record payload of 250 tons (to put this into comparison, it can carry around 300,000 lbs more than the US military's Boeing made C-17). The sole operational An-225 began flying in 1988, initially carrying the Soviet Buran, a 105 ton reusable spaceplane, on its back. It was put into storage after the Soviet collapse, but restored and put into commercial service in 2002. Since then it has been rented out, flying super heavy cargos like gas and wind turbines, as well as military supplies for NATO forces in the Middle East. Ivchenko Progress D-18T The powerful Ivchenko Progress D-18T turbofan, which produces 23 tons of thrust, will also be license produced by China to power domestically built An-225, and possibly other Chinese heavy transport aircraft. The first phase of the agreement between AICC and Antonov will result in the completion and flight of the incomplete second An-225 in 2019. The second stage of the project will involve the complete transfer of technology, including the 23 ton thrust Progress D-18T turbofan engines, to China, for licensed production of a modernized version in Sichuan Province. =GT at China Defense Forum 3325 3325 is the first of China's domestically built Zubr armed hovercraft, commissioned in early 2014. Weighing over 400 tons fully loaded, it can carry three battle tanks or company of armed soldiers. Presaging the An-225 deal, China purchased Ukrainian built Zubrs, as well as domestically building Zubrs at Chinese shipyard under license produciton. Despite China's close relationship with Russia, Ukraine's rival, China has purchased outright and licensed a number of Ukrainian aviation and naval platforms, such as the ex Varyag aircraft carrier, the Zubr hovercraft and the An-178. Antonov itself has also provided design and technical advice for the Chinese ARJ-21 region jetliner and Y-20 heavy transport aircraft. CCTV Forward Sino-Ukrainian Relations The official announcement and signing of the understanding to restart the An-225 production line was given high support by the Chinese government, despite the official Chinese partner, AICC, being relatively undersized compared to the AVIC industrial giant. With the ceremony signed in the Diaoyu state guesthouse in Beijing, and presence of senior government officials, it is clear that there is strong government support for China for this deal. While AICC itself is a relatively small company, it could leverage its government connections to draw heavily on aviation giant AVIC's extensive Sichuan production base. Antonov Waiting for 2019 With much of the fuselage structurally complete, the second An-225 will have its wings, engines and avionics integrated on in the next three years before being handed over to China in 2019. Compared to the first An-225, it has a rear mounted cargo door and single tail, suggesting a greater emphasis on transporting internal cargo, compared to its Buran space shuttle carrying older brother. Finishing the second An-225 by 2019 is an achievable goal, given that the airframe is already 60-70 percent complete. AICC will likely provide the majority of $300 million needed to complete the aircraft. Assuming that the second phase of the deal is completed, a completely Chinese version of the An-225 could begin first flights in the mid 2020s. Ukrainian Internet Belly of the Mriya In addition to carrying space shuttles, the An-225 could carry multiple tanks, such as these four main battle tanks. A Chinese An-225 could not only carry a platoon of China's latest heavy tanks, but also other military cargo like missile launchers and heavy artillery. For China, the An-225 would open whole new frontiers in commercial and military air transportation. A fleet of civilian An-225s could quickly ship heavy and bulky cargoes of massive scale, ranging from construction equipment to consumer goods. For humanitarian purposes, the An-225 could support disaster relief operations, able to fly in not just large amounts of aid, but also by bringing infrastructure like power generation and water treatment that are normally too big for airlift. On the military front, the An-225 would provide China with the kind of large and global lift that not even the US has possessed, except by rental. The plane is large enough to carry helicopters, tanks, artillery and ballistic missiles to anywhere in the world, or even other aircraft like smaller fighter jets. The An-225's unparalleled payload could even make it a space launch platform, or the ultimate mothership for drone operations. In many ways, China's build up of global airlift capabilities mirrors the immense gains it has made in global sealift, investing deeply to reach across the globe in coming year.

What Happened to Sea Launch by Staff Writers Bethesda MD (SPX) Sep 07, 2016 Rumors about the future of Sea Launch are frequently aired. As of last week, media reports indicated that the floating launch platform was to be sold in 2017, probably to Russian investors. So, stay tuned for the next, or final, chapter in the bumpy life of Sea Launch. Sea Launch is a unique space launch system intended to be an attractive way to launch geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites. It was developed as a multinational endeavor that uses a mobile maritime launch platform for equatorial launches of commercial payloads on a specialized Zenit-3SL launch system. The first launch took place in March 1999 with launches occurring for the next 15 years. A total of 36 attempts produced 32 complete successes and one partial success. Almost all payloads were communications satellites intended for geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). Customers included EchoStar, DirecTV, XM Satellite Radio, PanAmSat, and Thuraya. Launch vehicle assembly and payload integration were done on a special-purpose ship, Sea Launch Commander, in Long Beach Harbor, California. Before leaving the harbor, an assembled vehicle was placed on top of a self-propelled seagoing platform, Ocean Odyssey, and both the ship and platform steamed to an equatorial launch location on the Pacific Ocean, south of Hawai'i. A sea-based launch system means launches can be made from the optimum position on Earth's surface for geostationary satellites. This situation leads to increased payload capacity and reduced per-kg launch costs compared to other launch locations. Furthermore, the satellite may experience extended life on station due to a lower propellant expenditure upon final GEO injection. Unfortunately, due to financial and geopolitical complications, in 2014, Sea Launch had to mothball both ship and platform, and stop operations. Looking back to 1995, Sea Launch was originally established as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and U.S. It was managed by Boeing and based in Long Beach, CA. Operations were carried out by participants from the shareholder companies. Normal operations took place for 10 years, but in 2009, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Nevertheless, Sea Launch claimed it would continue normal business operations after filing for reorganization. However, about a year later, Energia, a 25% owner, announced a plan to acquire controlling interest in the company. One result of this was the introduction of land-based launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in early 2011. Sea-based launches were to resume later that year. Sea Launch did emerge from bankruptcy in October 2010 as Energia Overseas Limited, a Russian corporation. Boeing and other U.S. companies did retain minority shares. However, in 2013, Boeing sued the Russian Energia and two Ukrainian partners, claiming the companies refused to pay more than $350 million following the joint venture's bankruptcy filing in 2009. Jumping to mid-2014, following the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, a number of Russian media reports indicated Sea Launch might mothball the Odyssey launch platform. These claims were denied. Nevertheless, in August 2014, Sea Launch reduced staff and stopped operations, because they had no launches scheduled until late 2015. In fact, its last launch was in May of 2014. Rumors about the future of Sea Launch are frequently aired. As of last week, media reports indicated that the floating launch platform was to be sold in 2017, probably to Russian investors. So, stay tuned for the next, or final, chapter in the bumpy life of Sea Launch.

The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines’ flight MH370 remains one of the greatest modern aviation mysteries.

In an apparent attempt to reassure people that the search is being performed to the highest standards, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau’s latest update contained a detailed explanation of the methods employed. The explanation coincided with a special briefing for families of MH370 passengers and crew by search contractor Fugro and the ATSB in Perth. Thk for the hospitality and clarification, it's emotional, informative & educational.

She posted her gratitude for the information on social media, tweeting “thanks for the hospitality and clarification”. #mh370 Fugro/ATSB briefing pic.twitter.com/RUkFApN2cX— Jennifer Chong (@Jannilixious) September 7, 2016 Jennifer Chong with her husband Chong Ling Tan who was on board the Malaysian Airlines’ flight that vanished. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied The meeting was organised by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre at the request of Malaysian next of kin, desperate to see the search continued until the plane is found. Ministers from Australia, Malaysia and China decided in July that without fresh evidence, the search would be suspended once the entire 120,000 square kilometre priority zone was completed. So far more than 110,000 square kilometres of seabed has been searched, leaving less than 10,000 square kilometres to go. Almost done. Less than 10,000 square kilometres of the search zone is left to be scoured as the MH370 operation nears an end. Picture: ATSBSource:Supplied The ATSB update pointed out the sonar data collected by search vessels was reviewed and analysed on board for signs of the aircraft, and then subsequently examined by analysts in the Fugro office in Perth and by the ATSB in Canberra. “A final independent analysis of the data is then conducted by experts in the United States of America,” said the report. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has played a major part in the investigation but it was unclear if the experts were part of the organisation. At least 22 sites will be revisited before the end of the search with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle capable of operating in more challenging terrain. The main problem is the AUV can only be used in relatively calm conditions associated with the spring and summer months in the Southern Indian Ocean. Tough job. Rough conditions have plagued the MH370 search in the winter months. Picture: ATSBSource:Supplied There are currently no vessels in the search area, due to bad weather and scheduled resupply of Fugro Equator. Tomorrow (September 8) marks exactly two-and-a-half-years since MH370 disappeared on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. All communication with the Boeing 777 was lost less than an hour into the flight, but satellite transmissions have allowed experts to plot a path for the plane into the Southern Indian Ocean. Debris recovered from islands in the western Indian Ocean and east and South Africa, continue to be examined for information about how the plane entered the water and where. Larry Vance on evidence MH370 was glided into ocean0:29 Senior air crash investigator Larry Vance told Channel 9?s 60 Minutes program, a flaperon found on Reunion Island last year and handed over to France for analysis was the strongest clue yet the aircraft was ?glided? into the ocean.

The S&P 500 and Dow Industrials both edged higher last week after a weaker-than-expected monthly jobs report on Friday bolstered the view that the Fed won't raise interest rates in September, fueling a rise in stocks and other assets perceived as relatively risky. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 46.16 points, or 0.3%, at 18,538.12. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 26.01 points, or 0.5% to a new closing high of 5,275.91. The S&P 500 index rose 6.50 points, or 0.3%, to close at 2,186.48, led by sharp gains in energy, utilities, and telecom stocks. The benchmark index erased its opening loss by midday as heavily-weighted health care and technology demonstrated relative strength. The broader market settled near its best level of the day with seven sectors ending in the green. The defensively-oriented telecom services and utilities sectors followed energy on the top of the board. Conversely, financials and industrials led the downside. Chevron Corp and Boeing shares led the average higher, closing up more than 1%, while shares of Nike, United Technologies, Home Depot and General Electric weighed on blue chips. The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its nonmanufacturing index fell to 51.4% last month from 55.5% in July. That was the weakest showing since February 2010. The key takeaway from the ISM report is that it appears as if both the manufacturing sector and the non-manufacturing sector experienced a noticeable slowing of activity in August. U.S. employment data released last Friday had already shown slower overall job growth in August and an unemployment rate holding at 4.9%. The added takeaway is that the slowdown seen on both sides of the economy will likely leave the Fed reluctant to raise the fed funds rate at its September meeting. A number below 50.0 denotes a general contraction in manufacturing activity. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was down 1.1% as gold prices settled. The greenback and dollar-denominated commodities tend to move inversely. Bullion prices rallied on Tuesday, 06 September 2016 to log their highest settlement in nearly three weeks as a fall in the U.S. service-sector index to its weakest level in over six years appeared to diminish the likelihood of a U.S. interest-rate hike this month, fueling a drop in the dollar. December gold jumped $27.30, or 2.1%, to settle at $1,354 an ounce. December silver soared higher by 77.2 cents, or 4%, to $20.138 an ounce. Gold prices last week had eked out a weekly gain of less than 0.1%, but lost 3.4% for the month of August, the first monthly loss since May. Crude oil futures settled on a mixed note on Tuesday, 06 September 2016 with West Texas Intermediate crude ending at a one-week high and Brent crude finishing with a loss as traders eyed a pact between the world's two largest crude producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia, aimed at stabilizing the market. October West Texas Intermediate crude rose 39 cents, or 0.9%, to settle at $44.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after trading as low as $43.84 during the session. November Brent crude meanwhile, fell 37 cents, or 0.8%, to end at $47.26 a barrel after settling Monday up 1.7% at $47.63. Russian and Saudi officials on Monday said they would set up a working group to monitor the oil market and come up with recommendations to promote stability. The announcement gave a lift to crude prices though those gains faded by afternoon as the news underwhelmed traders who had been hoping for a production freeze. Treasuries ended on a higher note with yields dropping through the curve. The yield on the 2-yr note ended lower by seven basis points (0.72%) while the yield on the 10-yr note settled lower by seven basis points (1.54%). Today's participation was above the recent average as more than 835 million shares changed hands on the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the 7:00 ET release of the weekly MBA Mortgage Index. Separately, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July and the Fed's Beige Book for September will cross the wires at 10:00 ET and 14:00 ET, respectively.

Exploited is the word, according to prisoners and their advocates. So on Sept. 9, prison inmates are planning what's said to be an unprecedented national work strike, "a call to action against slavery in America." It's a story you may not hear much about, but one worth paying attention to. Prison demonstrations have been growing across the country in reaction to overcrowding, poor living conditions and unpaid labor at the hand of prison systems and the corporations that profit from them. In April, inmates at seven Texas prisons went on a work strike to protest living and working conditions. Prisoners in Alabama, Michigan, California and Wisconsin this year have organized work stoppages and hunger strikes. We're now looking at the first national strike, maybe the largest coordinated act of resistance in U.S. prison history. The date, Sept. 9, is the anniversary of the nightmarish Attica prison rebellion in 1971. More than 1,000 inmates took over Attica in western New York, demanding better conditions. Gov. Nelson Rockefeller ordered state police to storm the place, and they shot and killed 29 inmates and 10 hostages. Prison conditions overall improved after the 1970s, largely due to lawsuits and court orders, says Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project, a non-profit advocating for criminal justice reform. But with the 1980s crack epidemic came the start of mass incarceration – tough-on-crime laws that locked up many more low-level offenders, a disproportionate number of them black, for longer periods of time. The number of people in U.S. prisons and jails is five times what it was in the '70s. Ohio's prison system was built for 38,000 inmates, but it houses more than 50,000 and is expected to grow more. We're among the worst states for over-incarceration in a country that leads the world in incarcerating its citizens. There's enormous profit potential in captivity. Corporations now own a prison in Ohio (the first state to sell a prison), and operate prisons throughout the land. For-profit companies have a piece of the action in health care and food services. Prisoners work on farms and in factories, and staff call centers for corporations. They often earn nothing or up to a few dollars a day. Starbucks, Boeing and McDonalds all have profited off prison labor. Private prison companies have spent millions lobbying for stricter laws to keep the inmates flowing, and they have occupancy quotas in their contracts. Ohio guarantees payment to Corrections Corporation of America, which owns Ohio's Lake Erie Correctional Institute, for 90 percent occupancy. The U.S. Department of Justice in August underscored the failings of corporatization with a stunning announcement that it would end the use of private prisons. The DOJ concluded private prisons are too dangerous, their programs and services are subpar, and they don't save much money. But that's only a piece of the federal prison system. Meanwhile, Ohio insists corporatizing prisons is a money-saver. Through legislation passed last year, the state plans to sell a second state prison, the North Central Correctional Institution in Marion. This is after the 2011 sale of Lake Erie Correctional in Conneaut prompted a state inspection committee and the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio to expose terrible conditions there -- increased violence, rampant drug use, unsanitary food and general dysfunction. There was no running water in certain areas, forcing inmates to shit in bags. The ACLU made a film about it, Prisons for Profit, which premiered at the Cleveland International Film Festival last year. "Privatization, exploitation of labor, this all branches off the same rotten tree, which is our mass incarceration system," Mike Brickner of the Ohio ACLU says. "Because of that, all these problems come cascading down." North Central Correctional Institution is already privately operated by Management and Training Corp. JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the Ohio prison system, says both privately operated facilities "perform in a manner that is safe and secure, as demonstrated by their contractually required accreditation status by the American Correctional Association and compliance with Ohio internal management audit standards." Smith did not comment on the prospect of a Sept. 9 prison strike, nor would she answer questions about contracting out prison labor. But at least one person who helps organize prisoners from the outside said Ohio is among states she expects to have strong participation. Azzura Crispino handles media for the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, a new labor organization that has had a hand in strikes in various states. The labor group two years ago spun off from Industrial Workers of the World, a union formed in 1905 and headquartered in Chicago, after prison organizers and outside supporters sought help addressing working and living conditions. Crispino said more than 800 prisoners affiliate with the group, and there are more supporters who don't want to be known as members for fear of punishment. "The prisoners who are getting paid a wage at all for their labor is rare," she says. "The system is doing exactly what it's designed to do: Extract as much money off the backs of prisoners as possible." A few months ago, incarcerated organizers put out the call to action: "On Sept. 9 of 2016, we will begin an action to shut down prisons all across the country. We will not only demand the end to prison slavery, we will end it ourselves by ceasing to be slaves." It would be nice to know how it plays out, but those involved say prisons most certainly will black out communications to whatever extent possible. Ohio had a prison watchdog – a maverick named Joanna Saul, who exposed troubles at Lake Erie Correctional and who called out the state's food-service vendor for serving up maggots. It's hard to argue against the need for a watchdog. But Saul apparently ruffled too many feathers in a Republican legislature gaga over corporatizing public services. They forced her out in June.

A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket was scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida to dispatch the robot explorer Osiris-Rex on a seven-year mission. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Osiris-Rex is headed to a 500 metre wide asteroid named Bennu, which circles the sun in roughly the same orbit as Earth. Scientists estimate there is a one-in-800 chance that Bennu might actually hit Earth 166 years from now. Nasa’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (Osiris-Rex) spacecraft is seen on display at Kennedy Space Center, Florida August 20, 2016. — Reuters pic Heating from the sun gently pushes the asteroid, and charting its path is among the goals of the US$1 billion (RM4 million) mission. The US space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Osiris-Rex is expected to reach Bennu in August 2018 and begin a two-year study of its physical features and chemical composition. The solar-powered spacecraft will then fly to Bennu’s surface and extend a robot arm to collect at least 60g of what scientists hope will be carbon-rich material. “We’re going to asteroid Bennu because it’s a time capsule from the earliest stages of solar system formation, back when our planetary system was spread across as dust grains in a swirling cloud around our growing protostar,” lead researcher Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona told a prelaunch news conference yesterday. Inside the developing solar system, small rocky bodies were beginning to form, many of them studded with water ice and organic materials, which are key compounds that may have made Earth habitable or even given life its start, Lauretta said. If all goes as planned, the capsule containing samples from Bennu will be jettisoned from the returning Osiris-Rex spacecraft on September 24, 2023, for a parachute descent and landing at the US Air Force Utah Test and Training Range. Osiris-Rex is the latest in a series of missions to asteroids that began with the 1991 flyby of asteroid Gaspra by Nasa’s Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft. Japan’s Hayabusa 1 probe managed to return a few tiny grains of asteroid Itokawa to Earth in 2010, the first asteroid sample return mission. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is underway.

"It typically takes nine to 12 months for people to return to flight. That's what the history is," Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters. Bruno did not mention SpaceX by name. A SpaceX Falcon 9 booster exploded on the launch pad on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test. A $200 million Israeli communications satellite was destroyed in the blast, the second failed mission for technology entrepreneur Elon Musk's privately owned SpaceX in 14 months. The cause of the accident is under investigation. SpaceX has not publicly disclosed the extent of damage to its launch pad. Bruno said the main issue after accidents involving space launches has "always been figuring out what went wrong on the rocket, being confident that you know ... how to fix it and then actually getting that fix in place." Repairing damage to the launch pad is usually not a significant issue, he said. "Historically, it had never been the pad that's taken the longest time," he said. Bruno spoke with Reuters a few hours before ULA, a partnership of Lockheed-Martin Corp and Boeing Co , was preparing to launch its 111th rocket, so far all successfully. The Atlas 5 rocket, carrying a NASA asteroid sample-return spacecraft, blasted off at 7:05 p.m. EDT (2305 GMT) on Thursday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, about 1.2 miles (2 km) away from the SpaceX launch site. Bruno also said he had called SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell shortly after the accident to extend his sympathies and offer help. "It's a small community and issues especially around safety - but even mission success - kind of transcend the competitive piece of this," Bruno added. ULA and SpaceX are rivals for private space missions and launches by U.S. government agencies. Musk's company in May broke ULA's monopoly on flying U.S. military and national security satellites, winning an $83 million Air Force contract to launch a Global Positioning System satellite in 2018. The two firms are expected to square off over a second satellite launch services bid, which closes on Sept. 19. Bruno declined to say specifically if ULA would submit a proposal. Bruno said factors that prevented ULA from competing for an earlier military launch, including a trade ban that stymied imports of Russian rocket engines, are no longer obstacles. But ULA will still have to compete with SpaceX on price. "It is still a priced-only competition, which I think is unfortunate and not necessarily, in our view, the best way to select this type of complex and risky service," Bruno said.

"It typically takes nine to 12 months for people to return to flight. That's what the history is," Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters. Bruno did not mention SpaceX by name. A SpaceX Falcon 9 booster exploded on the launch pad on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test. A $200 million Israeli communications satellite was destroyed in the blast, the second failed mission for technology entrepreneur Elon Musk's privately owned SpaceX in 14 months. The cause of the accident is under investigation. SpaceX has not publicly disclosed the extent of damage to its launch pad. Bruno said the main issue after accidents involving space launches has "always been figuring out what went wrong on the rocket, being confident that you know ... how to fix it and then actually getting that fix in place." Repairing damage to the launch pad is usually not a significant issue, he said. "Historically, it had never been the pad that's taken the longest time," he said. Bruno spoke with Reuters a few hours before ULA, a partnership of Lockheed-Martin Corp and Boeing Co , was preparing to launch its 111th rocket, so far all successfully. An Atlas 5 rocket, carrying a NASA asteroid sample-return spacecraft, was poised for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida about 1.2 miles (2 km) away from the SpaceX launch site. Bruno said he called SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell shortly after the accident to extend sympathies and offer help. "It's a small community and issues especially around safety - but even mission success - kind of transcend the competitive piece of this," Bruno added. ULA and SpaceX are rivals for private space missions and launches by U.S. government agencies. Musk's company in May broke ULA's monopoly on flying U.S. military and national security satellites, winning an $83 million Air Force contract to launch a Global Positioning System satellite in 2018. The two firms are expected to square off over a second satellite launch services bid, which closes on Sept. 19. Bruno declined to say specifically if ULA would submit a proposal. Bruno said factors that prevented ULA from competing for an earlier military launch, including a trade ban that stymied imports of Russian rocket engines, are no longer obstacles. But ULA will still have to compete with SpaceX on price. "It is still a priced-only competition, which I think is unfortunate and not necessarily, in our view, the best way to select this type of complex and risky service," Bruno said.

That’s what the history is,” Tory Bruno, chief executive of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters. A SpaceX Falcon 9 booster exploded on the launch pad on September 1 as it was being fuelled for a routine pre-launch test. A $200 million Israeli communications satellite was destroyed in the blast, the second failed mission for technology entrepreneur Elon Musk’s privately owned SpaceX in 14 months. The cause of the accident is under investigation. SpaceX has not publicly disclosed the extent of damage to its launch pad. Bruno said the main issue after accidents involving space launches has “always been figuring out what went wrong on the rocket, being confident that you know ... how to fix it and then actually getting that fix in place.” Repairing damage to the launch pad is usually not a significant issue, he said. “Historically, it had never been the pad that’s taken the longest time,” he said. SpaceX rocket explodes on launch pad - and blows up a key Facebook plan, too Bruno spoke with Reuters a few hours before ULA, a partnership of Lockheed-Martin Corp and Boeing Co , was preparing to launch its 111th rocket, so far all successfully. An Atlas 5 rocket, carrying a NASA asteroid sample-return spacecraft, was poised for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida about 1.2 miles (2 km) away from the SpaceX launch site. Bruno said he called SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell shortly after the accident to extend sympathies and offer help. “It’s a small community and issues especially around safety - but even mission success - kind of transcend the competitive piece of this,” Bruno added. ULA and SpaceX are rivals for private space missions and launches by US government agencies. Musk’s company in May broke ULA’s monopoly on flying US military and national security satellites, winning an US$83 million Air Force contract to launch a Global Positioning System satellite in 2018. The two firms are expected to square off over a second satellite launch services bid, which closes on September 19. After explosion, SpaceX satellite customer says it’s owed US$50 million or a free ride Bruno declined to say specifically if ULA would submit a proposal. Bruno said factors that prevented ULA from competing for an earlier military launch, including a trade ban that stymied imports of Russian rocket engines, are no longer obstacles. But ULA will still have to compete with SpaceX on price. “It is still a priced-only competition, which I think is unfortunate and not necessarily, in our view, the best way to select this type of complex and risky service,” Bruno said.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hong Kong lawmaker Lau Siu-lai wins one legal challenge, but faces yet another 2 Syringe used to spike chocolate drink at Hong Kong convenience store 3 South Korea’s umbrella movement?

Sep 8, 2016 Comments Dear President Obama, There is much commentary these days about your legacy and your continued strivings to further extend your administration’s reach in the remaining months of your second term of office. Your recent expansion of public land reserves and the large expansion of our country’s ocean sanctuaries in the regions surrounding Hawaii and Guam are described as part of your environmental legacy. I write once again to invite you to meet with the Washington-based, full-time nonprofit civic action and service community. On several occasions during your presidency, I have recommended that you speak to a thousand or more leaders of the national civic community in a downtown D.C. hotel ballroom or auditorium such as historic Constitution Hall. Nonprofit organizations have millions of dues-paying members throughout the country supporting the fundamental bulwarks and seed corns of our beleaguered democracy. They cover the important advocacy areas of peace, civil liberties and civil rights, antipoverty and health, consumer protection, environment, labor safety, access to justice, worker rights and many traditional secular and religious charities that minister to the needy. Yet there has been no response to these invitations except a reply by the office of Michelle Obama on July 17, 2011 saying the President was too busy. Of course, Presidents are very busy, but they find time, as you did to attend nearly 500 fundraisers around the country and to visit numerous factories and other corporate destinations. Even during a visit to India, you found time to extol Boeing Airplanes and Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. No President has explicitly reached out to the broad civic community since President-elect Jimmy Carter attended such a special mass convocation in Washington, D.C., late in 1976. He came to listen and to meet the constituency that he knew was crucial to enacting many of the substantive programs he was planning at the time. It was a grand, motivating success. Late in your second term, you could come to serve several other purposes. First, you can give necessary visibility to those committed people whose groups are left in the shadows during presidential election years despite their ability to enrich the content of such electoral activities with their exceptional hands-on knowledge and experience. Second, you can make recommendations regarding various facilities, checkoffs and new directions which can enlarge nonprofit membership and programs. Third, you can educate the public about the critical role this “voluntary sector” has played in American history. Fourth, you can herald the significant number of jobs and economic activity—millions of staff and tens of billions of dollars coursing through the economy—which can only expand with larger philanthropy by billionaires, mega-millionaires, and regular citizens you might inspire to contribute to nonprofit organizations. Your address can become a presidential marker for your successors and for future generations of Americans inspired by your concrete words and proposals. It is difficult to understand why you have not yet embraced this opportunity. Certainly you have mentioned civic duty, civic engagement and civic visions for posterity on a number of occasions. Especially now when all elections are behind you, isn’t it time to highlight the civic values and the civic heroes who reflect them in ways both dutiful and dramatic? Lastly, such a presentation will set a finer, higher stage for your successor to inherit. What say you, President Obama? Ralph Nader P.S.

(Photo by Watchara Phomicinda, San Gabriel Valley Tribune/ SCNG) When a manufacturing company can hang around for 65 years and still remain vital despite increasing global competition, that says a lot about how well the business is run. Gordon Brush Mfg. Co. Inc., based in the City of Industry, has managed to do both. The company recently moved from Commerce to a new $16 million, 183,000-square-foot building in Industry that’s three times bigger than its previous facility. “We’re continuing to grow and we added over 750 customers this year,” said Alan Schechter, the company’s vice president of sales and marketing. “We tried to expand many times in Commerce, but there was a lot of red tape. We were also heavily recruited by other states. We had a private meeting with the governor of Arizona — they were rolling out the red carpet for us. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas was also interested. We pride ourselves on being an American manufacturer.” Company opts to remain in California That philosophy is what prompted Rep. Grace F. Napolitano, D-El Monte, and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, to visit Gordon Brush a couple of weeks ago to thank the company for staying in Southern California. “Despite foreign competition and companies replicating their products, Gordon Brush, one of the last brush makers in the U.S., continues to manufacture its goods right here in the San Gabriel Valley, employing local residents and stimulating our region’s economy,” Napolitano said during her visit. More than 15,000 types of brushes made Founded in 1951, Gordon Brush is a leading manufacturer of specialty, custom and standard brushes for industrial, commercial and consumer uses. The company employs about 125 full-time workers. Many of them have been with Gordon Brush for 30 to 40 years. And brushes? The company makes more than 15,000 types that are used in the aerospace, medical, electronics, janitorial, military, aerospace and pharmaceutical industries. Duster brushes, strip brushes, bore brushes, detail brushes, flow-thru brushes — the list is long and this specialty manufacturer has amassed a roster of clients that includes Boeing, McMaster-Carr, Motion Industries and Techni-Tool, among others. A big investment in equipment “Fifty percent of our business is custom brushes,” Schechter said. “Many times we don’t even know what the brushes are used for. A company will send us the specs and we make them.” The company’s facility at 3737 Capital Ave. in Industry houses an array of high-tech equipment — with some of the machines valued at more than $1 million — but some of the work is still done by hand. On Wednesday, 30-year employee Roberto Valenzuela, 68, placed a couple of steel wires between two clamps on a machine that proceeded to twist the wires tightly together. When that process was completed he inserted the bristle material onto the wires and the machine bound them together. Advertisement “I like this job,” said Valenzuela. “Been here a long time.” Products for the military and the public Gordon Brush produces custom-made brushes that the U.S. Army uses to clean the main gun on its Abrams tanks. The effectiveness of the brushes — and the fact that they were produced and delivered when the Army desperately needed them — combined to save the Department of Defense more than $1.5 billion. The company’s products have been used on NASA space shuttles and lunar modules and its brushes are also used to clean the guidance system and guns on the Apache helicopter. At the other end of the spectrum, one of the company’s more popular products is the FootMate System. The unit includes a set of brushes that are attached to a rubber base lined with small suction cups. The FootMate can be placed on the floor of a shower stall or bathroom. After a gel is applied, users can rub their feet back and forth through the brushes, which massage tender areas of the foot and remove dead skin. Gordon Brush has managed to thrive amid economic ups and downs in the economy. But the threat of competition remains real as lower-priced Chinese products continue to flood the market. “Companies that have nothing to differentiate themselves on besides price are the most vulnerable to the threat of lower-priced Chinese-made products,” company President and CEO Ken Rakusin said in a statement. “In spite of all of these issues, I was determined to build and grow my business in the United States by reinvesting profits into the purchase of millions of dollars in manufacturing equipment and machinery. Pride in contributing to the American economy is near and dear to my heart.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Reach the author at Kevin.Smith@sgvn.com or follow Kevin on Twitter: @SGVNBiz.

System Architecture: Pivotal Decisions in Complex Systems A new online-only MIT certificate course explores how a small number of key decisions makes a big impact on system performance. by Dr. Bruce G. Cameron September 8, 2016 Provided by Our world runs on increasingly complex systems. From cars to power plants, we increasingly expect immediate connectivity, machine learning on product data, and technology infusion, all of which are driving up the complexity of modern systems. These systems—found in industries ranging from aerospace to automotive, from high technology to healthcare, and beyond—rely on professionals who have a deep understanding of both the components of the system and their system-level behaviors, desirable and undesirable alike. Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems New four-course online certificate program begins September 12. Register today! Consider Twitter. Follow a spate of outages during the 2010 World Cup, where peak activity crashed its infrastructure, Twitter re-architected its entire monolithic codebase. Today, it routinely processes about 5,700 tweets per second, and has handled a peak of 143,199 tweets per second (on August 3, 2013, during the airing of a popular TV show in Japan). That’s just one example of the rising demands users put on these systems. These demands go beyond surges and scalability. For products to capture market share, we ask systems to innovate on existing offerings, incorporate novel technologies, and address multiple markets. For companies to compete on tight margins, we ask that systems be designed to optimize manufacturing cost and be delivered through multi-tiered supply chains. My experience is that a substantial portion of a system’s performance is determined by a relatively small set of decisions—architectural decisions. For engineers, program managers, and business owners, such decisions make all the difference. I’m excited to announce that MIT is launching a new four-course professional-certificate program to explore these architectural decisions along with industry leaders. The online-only program, Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems, begins Sept. 12, 2016. Every Built System Has an Architecture Products such as mobile phone software, cars, and semiconductor capital equipment are defined by a few key architectural decisions made early in the program lifecycle. Those early decisions drive downstream decisions. In the real-world design of complex systems, however, engineers often don’t have full knowledge of those systems’ eventual scope before making decisions that may have a big impact—from creating bottlenecks that constrain performance, to restricting potential manufacturing sites, to reducing after-market revenue share. For example, MIT worked with NASA on the architecture of next-generation communication satellites. NASA currently operates three sets of relay satellites, each the size of a school bus, to convey government data from science and military space missions. NASA officials felt an architectural change was needed to reduce costs, which today are two to three times more than those of commercially operated satellites. MIT worked with NASA over a three-year period to identify the architectural decisions—such as the presence or absence of on-board data storage, the choice of orbit, the number of satellites per orbital plane, and technology development for inter-satellite links—and analyzed millions of combinations of decisions to identify the top candidates for new architectures. Despite the uncertainty around scope, my experience is that spending time upfront on architectural decisions—whether you are sequencing the decisions to be made based solely on your team’s experience or sequencing them more explicitly using decision models to estimate sensitivities—can have a substantial return on investment. In other words, good architectural decisions can create competitive advantages in difficult markets, but bad decisions can hobble large development programs down the road. Models and Methods In launching the new Architecture and Systems Engineering program, we’re excited to be exploring such decisions with industry leaders. We’ve brought together some of the biggest organizations involved in complex systems—including GE, Boeing, Raytheon, GM, NASA, and Caterpillar, among others—to talk about the state of the practice today.   One of the trends we’re most interested in exploring is the movement away from paper-based design that’s often known as “model-based system engineering” (MBSE). The big idea behind MBSE is to digitize the design process. Despite big improvements in software, from product lifecycle management software (PLM) such as Siemen’s Team Center or PTC’s Windchill, to simulation software such as large airflow simulation or mature structural codes, much of the design process is still based on paper documents. These documents carry a legacy of long rework cycles and are often the culprits in quality issues. The vision of MBSE is to combine large models to where the team works on a central model with a focus on concurrency. “Systems engineers who are working on these complex systems really have to be the ones that understand where the margin is, understand the system performance, and then advocate for the entire system,” explains Greg Hyslop, Boeing CTO and senior vice president of Boeing Engineering Test and Technology Group. We will discuss the promise of MBSE for making system architecture decisions, and we’ll explore the failure modes and management issues that underpin it. The computer-aided design (CAD) revolution took decades to mature—our approach to MBSE is to take a hard look at the challenges, and to foster a discussion about the implementation that’s grounded in the experience of a consortium of companies. Making Better Architectural Decisions Which architectural decisions did Twitter engineers make in their search for scalability after the 2010 World Cup? They decided the gains from their original, monolithic code base had been exhausted—at the time, it was one of the world’s largest Ruby on Rails installations. So they reinvented their architecture as a Java Virtual Machine installation, modularizing its functionality and placing more emphasis on concurrency. It may sound like motherhood and apple pie, but architectural changes like these take a measure of courage — we’d prefer to make them from a position of analysis and strength rather than as a gamble. Join us in exploring these issues in more depth in MIT’s new Architecture and Systems Engineering professional-certificate program, beginning Sept. 12. Bruce G. Cameron is faculty director for MIT’s new professional-certificate program, Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems. He is the director of MIT’s System Architecture Lab, a lecturer in engineering management in MIT’s existing System Design and Management master’s degree and distance programs, and a co-founder of Technology Strategy Partners, a boutique consulting firm. His research interests at MIT include technology strategy, system architecture, and the management of product platforms.

Now 50 years later, Hurt is a physicist working at the California Institute of Technology on NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, peering deep into areas of space that have always been hidden from us. Like Captain James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship USS Enterprise, Hurt is a space explorer. After Star Trek first aired - 50 years ago today - on Sept. 8, 1966, people could envision a time when the human race would explore space and "boldly go where no man (or woman) has gone before." The show, which ran for three seasons, also began to inspire those kids in PJs or hanging out with friends watching Kirk and Mr. Spock meet aliens and explore distant planets. For many researchers today, their passion for science was fed by the original series, along with the later spin-offs and movies that followed. Robert Hurt Robert Hurt, a physicist working at the California Institute of Technology. "It really fueled our interests," said Hurt, adding that there's a good chance he wouldn't be a scientist today without Star Trek's inspiration. "One of the things that was most formative for me as a child was that...with Star Trek, science isn't something we fear. The second in command of the Enterprise was the science officer. That was a really powerful symbol growing up. Science doesn't create monsters. Science is what we use to face problems and solve problems." That original show has been followed by five more TV series, including The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager. And the franchise isn't dormant. A seventh television series, Discovery, is expected to begin airing on CBS All Access in January. There also have been 13 Star Trek films, including this year's latest movie Star Trek Beyond. All served to create a mythology around space exploration, multi-cultural diversity and cooperation and an optimism around science. John Smith, who does trajectory design for outer planets missions at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said Star Trek was one of the very first shows he can remember watching as a kid. It influenced his career, as well as his outlook on life. John Smith John Smith, who does trajectory design for outer planets missions at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "It drove me towards aerospace engineering," Smith said, noting that he's seen each of the original episodes at least a dozen times. "For that time period, there were few shows that reflected the optimism and the acceptance that was present in that show.... It was very revolutionary for the day and it was present throughout Star Trek." For Lee Sheldon, who today is a professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) but was a writer and producer on the fourth season of The Next Generation, it was important to carry the message that science is cool and important throughout the different series. Lee Sheldon Lee Sheldon, a WPI professor who was a writer/producer on the fourth season of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." He also noted that in his conversations with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, the people involved in the shows were conscious of the influence the series and movies had on kids and on the scientific community. "Oh, I think we were all very aware," Sheldon said. "Even though it's set centuries in the future, we were very aware that the science should be as good as it could be. If we were going to speculate, it should be an extrapolation of science. It set goals for scientists today." Star Trek writers and actors even went out to talk to students about the importance of science. "Everyone was very aware that we had something important to say and that we could affect the future," said Sheldon. "I think a lot of kids were incredibly inspired." Seeing that you could have an exciting job working in science was an 'Aha' kind of moment for Emily L. Howard, a senior technical fellow with The Boeing Company. "Many of the women were scientists on the show," she said. "I don't know that I knew I was destined for a future in science, but seeing women who were solving problems and using their creativity absolutely inspired me." The real-life Apollo space program, the first moon landing in 1969 and physicist Sally Ride's becoming the first female NASA astronaut, offered a lot of positive scientific influences for Howard. But the fictional world of Star Trek carried its own importance. "I can't give all that power to a single show, but it certainly helped fuel my interest," she said. "There were other things happening at the time, but at that young [age] to be exposed to these amazing possibilities about the future, planted a seed very deeply in me." It planted a similar seed in Marc Rayman, the director and chief engineer of NASA's Dawn mission. Marc Rayman, director and chief engineer of NASA's Dawn mission. Rayman has been a serious Trekkie since the original show began when he was in the seventh grade. The first class he ever skipped in his life was when a Star Trek movie was opening at same time as his graduate class in statistical mechanics. He would not only go on to himself be involved with spacecraft that explore alien worlds. And when he worked on NASA's Deep Space 1 program, the first interplanetary mission to use low-thrust propulsion technology, Rayman began calling it ion propulsion -- in honor of Star Trek. "Star Trek didn't so much inspire me, but it fueled the passions that were already burning within me," he said. "Star Trek showed the future I wanted to be a part of.... It would never have occurred to me that in the year 2016 -- 50 years after the first show was on -- that the show would have that kind of longevity. That's a testament to how powerful it was and how much it meant to so many people." Rayman said he found out a few years ago that he was working with a colleague who didn't know the original series or the spinoffs. "You kind of wonder how JPL could even hire a guy like that," he said, laughing. "You'd think NASA would be a little more discriminating. Apart from that he's a good guy, but this major deficiency in his education was troubling." Rayman has set about "rectifying this major flaw." Robert Federking Robert Frederking, an associate dean for Carnegie Mellon University's school of computer science. That kind of education wouldn't have been an issue for Mike Ciaraldi, a professor of computer science and robotics engineering at WPI. Ciaraldi still remembers watching the first episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap," when it premiered. For him, science fiction in general, and Star Trek in particular, is all about using your brain to solve problems and how a hero avoids a fight or outright calamity by out-thinking an opponent. Star Trek also let kids know there were other people interested in science. Robert Frederking, an associate dean for Carnegie Mellon University's school of computer science, had a fan club membership -- and he still owns a set of blueprints of the starship enterprise. "It made me think about things like were would warp drives really be possible and would transporters work. It made me think," he said. "It certainly encouraged me. I think it's safe to say I still think it's interesting. Like Spock, I would say it's fascinating."

Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Sep 8, 2016 at 12:47PM Drones are starting to be a big business for Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. Image source: Getty Images. What happened Shares of defense contractor Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc (NASDAQ:KTOS) jumped a whopping 58.3% in August, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after reporting earnings and some key contract wins. So what Second-quarter revenue grew 4.8% to $168.2 million and net loss improved from $15.0 million a year ago to $10.4 million, or $0.17 per share. Within that, the unmanned systems division showed a 25.3% increase in revenue to $17.8 million, showing strong performance in drones.   Kratos also won a $20 million contract to provide a tanker training system to Boeing and got a $14 million drone order during the month. New contracts are key because the company has been keeping engineering staff in high anticipation of winning drone contracts in the future. Some of those orders are now coming to fruition, which should lead to better financials over the next year. Now what It's important to keep in mind that Kratos is still losing money, so there's still a lot of financial risk for investors. But shares had fallen so far -- as low as $2.80 per share in the last 52 weeks -- that good news could result in huge gains for investors. As losses shrunk and new contracts poured in during August, the stock started to see that leverage in action. Just keep an eye out for more momentum in sales, because Kratos needs to show continued growth or the losses will persist. Travis Hoium has no position in any stocks mentioned.

By Dan Cancian September 8, 2016 17:35 BST IAG CEO Willie Walsh's comments are another warning for Airbus and Boeing, the world's leading aircraft manufacturersReuters International Consolidated Airlines Group said it will review its plane orders amid a global economic slowdown and the outcome of Britain's decision to leave the European Union. The owner of British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus said after the referendum in June that it would have to cut spending on the back of weaker demand from business customers, while the sharp decline suffered by the pound only exacerbated the problem. Both issues are yet to be resolved, group chief executive Willie Walsh said on Thursday (8 September), while speaking at an airline conference in London. He added that the FTSE 100 giant and its sector peers were likely to rein in spending on new aircraft for the foreseeable future. "Without doubt all airlines, including airlines within IAG, are reassessing their requirements for new aircraft, as the outlook for growth has softened," he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg TV. "I don't think we're going to see growth rates that were anticipated." Walsh's latest comments are another warning for Airbus and Boeing, the world's leading aircraft manufacturers, which have registered their lowest order figures in six years, as the aviation sector continues to swim against the tide amid a challenging environment. Last year IAG ordered 20-single single-aisle Airbus A320neo and, earlier this year, the group indicated it would purchase used widebody Boeing 777s and lease Airbus's double-decker A380s for some of its British Airways routes. However, IAG's chief executive was more optimistic over the outlook for the sector, indicating a number of airlines wanted to join the conglomerate, although the company was not looking to consolidate its operations at the moment. "We're always looking for the opportunity," he said. "We're structured to facilitate further consolidation if the right opportunity comes along. We're not actively looking at anything in particular at the moment."

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FL – Today is ‘Earth Departure Day’ for OSIRIS-REx, NASA’s first mission to snatch “pristine materials” from the surface of a near Earth asteroid named Bennu and deliver them back to Earth in seven years on a mission to unlock mysteries on the formation of our Solar System and ourselves 4.5 Billion years ago. The 4.5 Billion mile roundtrip ‘Journey to Bennu and Back’ begins today. All systems are GO for a spectacular dinner-time blastoff of NASAs OSIRIS-REx spacecraft from the Florida Space Coast. Earth departure for NASA’s Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security – Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is slated for shortly before sunset this evening, Thursday, September 8 at 7:05 p.m. EDT. Excited spectators are filling local area hotels for this once in a lifetime mission to ‘Bennu and Back.’ Bennu is a small, carbon-rich asteroid – meaning it contains significant amounts of organic molecules, the stuff of which life is made. Bennu is only about a third of mile in diameter, measuring 500 meters or 1,614 feet across and it crosses Earth’s orbit around the sun every six years. You can watch the sure to be a spectacular launch live in person here in sunny Florida or live via a choice of webcasts. NASA’s OSIRIS-REx launch coverage will be broadcast on NASA TV beginning at 4:30 p.m. EDT Sept. 8, as well as on a ULA webcast. You can watch the launch live at NASA TV at – http://www.nasa.gov/nasatv You can watch the launch live at ULA at – www.ulalaunch.com Today’s weather forecast remains very promising and is currently 80% GO for favorable conditions. The only concern is for cumulus clouds. There are 3 opportunities in a row to launch OSIRIS-Rex. In case of a delay 24 or 48 hour delay, the forecast drops only slightly to 70% GO.

Credits: NASA/Lockheed Martin The United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and OSIRIS-REx spacecraft were rolled out some 1800 feet from the Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) – where the rocket is assembled- to launch pad 41 starting at about 9 a.m. yesterday morning September 7, 2018. Watch this OSIRIS-Rex trailer from NASA Goddard illustrating the probes Earth departure launch phase: NASAs OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is on a mission to explore asteroid Bennu and return a sample to Earth. The OSIRIS-REx launch window opens on September 8, 2016, when the spacecraft begins its two-year journey to Bennu aboard an Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral, Florida. After arriving at Bennu in 2018, OSIRIS-REx will spend over a year exploring the asteroid before approaching its surface to grab a sample. This pristine material, formed at the dawn of the solar system, will be returned to Earth in 2023, providing clues to Bennus origins and our own. Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center/David Ladd OSIRIS-REx will gather rocks and soil and bring at least a 60-gram (2.1-ounce) sample back to Earth in 2023. It has the capacity to scoop up to about 2 kg or more. The mission will help scientists investigate how planets formed and how life began. It will also improve our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth by measuring the Yarkovsky effect. Bennu is an unchanged remnant from the collapse of the solar nebula and birth of our solar system some 4.5 billion years ago.

Probe is slated for Sep. 8, 2016 launch to asteroid Bennu from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com It was chosen as the target because it is little altered over time and thus ‘pristine’ in nature. Bennu is a near-Earth asteroid and was selected for the sample return mission because it could hold clues to the origin of the solar system and host organic molecules that may have seeded life on Earth.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The 189 foot tall ULA Atlas V rocket is launching in the rare 411 configuration for only the 3rd time on this mission – which is the 65th for the Atlas V. The Atlas 411 vehicle includes a 4-meter diameter payload fairing and one solid rocket booster that augments the first stage. The Atlas booster for this mission is powered by the RD AMROSS RD-180 engine and the Centaur upper stage was powered by the Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C-1 engine. The RD-180 burns RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1 or highly purified kerosene) and liquid oxygen and delivers 860,200 lb of thrust at sea level. The strap on solids deliver approximately 500,000 pounds of thrust. The solids will be jettisoned about 2 minutes after liftoff. OSIRIS-REx will return the largest sample from space since the American and Soviet Union’s moon landing missions of the 1970s. OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA’s New Frontiers Program, following New Horizons to Pluto and Juno to Jupiter, which also launched on Atlas V rockets. NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is responsible for overall mission management. OSIRIS-REx complements NASA’s Asteroid Initiative – including the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) which is a robotic spacecraft mission aimed at capturing a surface boulder from a different near-Earth asteroid and moving it into a stable lunar orbit for eventual up close sample collection by astronauts launched in NASA’s new Orion spacecraft. Orion will launch atop NASA’s new SLS heavy lift booster concurrently under development.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version September 8, 2016 - 12:31 AMT SHARE NASA’s record-breaking astronaut, Russian crew return safely to Earth NASA astronaut and Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams returned to Earth Tuesday after his U.S. record-breaking mission aboard the International Space Station, NASA website reports. Williams and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, landed in their Soyuz TMA-20M at 9:13 p.m. EDT southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan (7:13 a.m. Sept. 7, local time). Having completed his fourth mission, Williams now has spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. Skripochka now has 331 days in space on two flights, while Ovchinin spent 172 days in space on his first. Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins Aug. 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter’s main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. During his time on the orbital complex, Williams ventured outside the confines of the space station for a second spacewalk with Rubins to retract a spare thermal control radiator and install two new high-definition cameras. Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity’s only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Williams was involved in the grapple of Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft in March, the company's fourth commercial resupply mission, and SpaceX’s eighth Dragon spacecraft cargo delivery in April, and welcomed a second Dragon delivery in July. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo craft also docked to the station in April and July delivering tons of supplies. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command. He, Rubins, and Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, will operate the station for more than two weeks until the arrival of three new crew members. Shane Kimbrough of NASA and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch Sept. 23, U.S. time, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.

Nasa’s Jeff Williams, 58, logged 534 days in space over four missions. The ISS commander landed at 07:13 local time on the steppes of central Kazakhstan aboard a Russian-made Soyuz capsule along with Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka. "Touchdown! Welcome home @Astro_Jeff, officially back on Earth after 172-day mission & total 534 days on 4 missions," NASA tweeted. A Nasa live video feed showed Williams on the ground smiling and waving while talking on a satellite phone before being carried away for medical tests. The three men undocked from the ISS nearly three and a half hours earlier after spending their mission largely conducting scientific experiments. Williams performed five spacewalks, including one along with Nasa astronaut Kate Rubins to install a docking adapter for future commercial Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the space station. "Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft," Nasa said in a statement. He also helped set up an experimental temporary inflatable module designed by Bigelow Aerospace to test expandable habitats astronauts might use on the Moon or Mars in the coming decades.

Kelly has 520 days in space over his career. Williams, a grandfather, is also the oldest American to spend live on the space station. Williams first blasted to space aboard the shuttle Atlantis in 2000. He returned to the International Space Station in 2006 when the space station was far smaller - with just two modules and three crew members - and again in 2009. Today, the ISS is staffed by six astronauts and cosmonauts and spans the size of a football field. Williams may hold the US record for time in orbit, but Russia's Gennady Padalka still holds the record for the person with the most cumulative days in space at 879.

As premises go, it sounds like it’s heading straight for the slush pile accompanied by condescending sniggers. But think again: it’s actually Ian McEwan’s latest work, Nutshell, and it’s the best thing he’s written in years. Granted it’s a pretty preposterous conceit, not least because of the overtones of Hamlet – "My mother is involved in a plot, and therefore I am too, even if my role might be to foil it. Or if I, reluctant fool, come to term too late, then to avenge it." This foetus’s loquaciousness is instantly recognisable, but just in case we need a few extra clues Gertrude becomes "Trudy", her paramour (and husband’s brother) "Claude" to the original Claudius, and the motive for their crime the contemporary Londoner’s equivalent of a kingdom: a £7 million townhouse in leafy St John’s Wood – an Englishman’s home is his castle and all that. In principle it shouldn’t work, but somehow McEwan manages to pull it off. A feat all the more impressive since the satisfaction of an enticing idea followed through to fruition has been sorely missing from so much of his back catalogue – don’t get me started on the disappointment that was Atonement (2001). Humour is the name of the game here. Surely that’s the only way to read a foetus soliloquising about the delights of a good burgundy or Sancerre "decanted through a healthy placenta", ranting and railing about "trigger warnings", or describing in gut-wrenching detail his uncomfortable front row seat during the actual adultery: "I close my eyes, I grit my gums, I brace myself against the uterine walls. This turbulence would shake the wings off a Boeing." Some will cite middle-class privileged pomposity, but the exuberance of the prose points to a knowing twinkle in McEwan’s eye; gone is the earnestness we’ve come to associate with his more recent work. As is often the case with the cleverest of ideas, it’s really rather simple. The promise of the murder, coupled with the question of whether the foetus will prove more proactive than his princely predecessor, is more than enough to propel the plot. Sure, buying into this particular narrator requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but McEwan makes enough of an effort to address the inevitable questions pedantic readers will ask: the mother-to-be listens to "podcast lectures, and self-improving audio books", the information from which fuels her offspring’s enquiring mind, and "immersed in abstractions" it’s "the proliferating relations between them [that] create the illusion of a known world". Perhaps you’ve got to read it to believe it? That’s certainly what I urge. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. Lucy Scholes is a freelance reviewer based in London.

South Africa's first nuclear plant was built 40 years ago - on time and within budget. There is no reason this process cannot be repeated, argues the author. File picture: Bruce Sutherland Recently, Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe and his top team had to face a grilling by parliamentarians. That is the checks and balances system in operation, and it is good that it happened. During the session, while talking about wind and solar power, Molefe said he did not want to be forced to buy renewable electricity at R5 000 per megawatt-hour (MW/h), which is what the independent power producer (IPP) agreements force him to do. Bear in mind that Eskom’s average selling price for electricity is less than 20 percent of that figure. So who thinks that it is good business to buy a commodity at more than five times the amount that you can sell it for? I am glad that Molefe mentioned that figure, because there is a popular misconception that wind and solar electricity are cheap. They are not. Recently, when I was in Port Elizabeth, a fellow said to me that they were surprised their electricity bills had not come down since the wind turbines had started operation in the area. Surprised, I asked him why he expected electricity bills to fall. He replied that they had constantly been told that wind and solar energy were free. Conversion to useable Yes, the energy radiating from the sun is free; the energy in the wind is free. But by that argument oil, coal and gas is also free. These commodities are just freely lying underground... all you have to do is dig them up, process them, transport them and then convert them to a useable form. It is the collection, transport and processing that a consumer primarily pays for, not so much for the material itself. Same with wind and solar. By the time renewable electricity arrives at your house as 220 volts in an alternating current system, you are paying for the collection, conversion and transport. I am not opposed to wind and solar power. I am in favour of them, but in favour of them being used where they make real economic sense, like in stand-alone specialist applications. Trying to feed reliable base-load power to the grid from wind and solar power is not the best application. The renewable enthusiasts often tell people that not only are wind and solar cheap, but that prices are falling all the time, as if the solar and wind technologies are improving so fast that prices will tumble. This is plain and simply not true. In South Africa, wind and solar prices, as charged by the suppliers, have fallen, but that has nothing to do with changes in technology. That is because the IPP system of the government forced them to bid in a free market-type manner, so that they bid against each other for the lucrative long-term contracts. It now merely means that the solar and wind people are not overcharging as much for the later bidding rounds as they were in the beginning. We often hear in the news that wind and solar are such good investments, and that such a large amount of foreign investment money has come into South Africa for renewables. Yes, they are good investments - if you are the owner of the solar and wind plants, because you make so much money out of the government agreements. It is terrific to get a long-term government contract at a high guaranteed price. That is why foreigners are keen to put their money into such projects. They intend to take more money home. They did not rush to come here for the social good of South Africa; they came for economic advantage for themselves. Molefe is now saying that he does not want to be the one forced to pay their large returns for years into the future, when Eskom does not now need that electricity. Bear in mind that solar electricity only comes in the daytime; for that matter only during part of the daytime, either side of lunch time. Wind only comes when the wind blows, which is random. So Molefe’s engineers cannot tell him that they will have renewable electricity available for dinnertime, when the country really needs it, because they know there will be no solar power then, and wind power is random. So Molefe has to have an entire non-renewable system in place at all times to ensure that we do not have blackouts. Molefe has been griping about that and he certainly has my support on that position. Currently nuclear power is Eskom’s cheapest electricity. Read that last sentence again, if you did not fully absorb it. If you want to buy milk from the corner cafe you want to know how much, per litre, the shop owner sells it for. You are not the slightest bit interested in how much each dairy farmer paid for his cows. If one cow costs twice as much as another it does not matter, as long as the higher priced cow produces twice as much milk. There is no public uproar that some farmer bought expensive cows, which might affect the milk price. Why is Koeberg nuclear power station’s electricity inexpensive now? Well that is how the system designed it. That is a property of nuclear power. Nuclear fuel is inexpensive and its price is very predictable, decades into the future. Some renewable enthusiasts say that it is “unfair” to quote the Koeberg price of electricity now “because Koeberg is already paid for”. Well, that is how the system was designed. For the anti-nuclear lobby to complain about this is something like complaining that someone is living in their house cheaply; merely because their bond is fully paid. Well, that is why you take a bond on a house, with the intention of paying it off. The public does not think that all dairy farmers are fools, because they pay different prices for cows. South Africa’s nuclear scientists and engineers are not fools either. Believe me; they know very well that the electricity from a nuclear power station has to be sold to the public. What is more, it must be sold so that Eskom makes a profit. Decades ago, when the first team of nuclear fellows sat down to plan for South Africa’s new nuclear power stations, they had as a starting point that the selling price of the electricity should be about the same price as the sale price of coal-fired electricity. That is still the case. Does any sensible reader think that a team of aerospace engineers would sit down to design a new Boeing or Airbus passenger jet, without the selling price of a seat being a firm design criterion, on day one. Nuclear design folks do the same. The selling price of the electricity is a firm design criterion, on day one. Mutual design stage Years ago South African authorities decided to add 9 600MW of nuclear power to the national grid. Note that nuclear power runs all day, every day and not only when the sun shines, or the wind blows. You really can run an electric train from Johannesburg to Durban on nuclear power. You can also run mines, harbours, motor car assembly lines, steel plants and so I could go on. The 9 600MW will be made up of three nuclear power stations. Each power station will produce around 3 500MW of power, depending on the arrangement that we come to with the foreign nuclear companies, when we arrive at the mutual design stage. Each power station will have either two or three nuclear reactors on each site. The reactors will each have a power output of between 1 000MW and 1 500MW. The three power stations will be built in sequence, over a period of about ten years. This is a sensible way to do it, because skilled construction and fabrication teams will move from one plant to the next carrying their skills with them, and teaching others along the way. Thoughts that the nuclear power programme will all be paid in one cheque, so to speak, in one year, are silly in the extreme. Now for another very important consideration, which the anti-nuclear lobby just simply ignores. There is a national localisation target figure of 50 percent. Think about it. Who do you think will be driving the bulldozers and earth moving trucks? Will it be South African or Russian, Chinese, American, French or Korean drivers? Who will lay the water pipes, electrical cables and build the access roads and new bridges to the sites? On site, who will lay the concrete foundations, and the concrete for the walls? Weld the pipes, connect the electrical cables? And I can go on. Why this very strange belief among some members of the public that somehow South Africa will put one cheque in the post, for the total amount for three nuclear power stations, and then a short while later a foreign country will arrive with three nuclear power stations neatly wrapped in a delivery box, and that all South Africans have to do is sit on the hillside and watch as the foreigners put them in place, and switch on? In the case of the construction of Koeberg, some forty years ago, there was zero planned local content, but 43 percent was achieved anyway. By the way, Koeberg is currently internationally respected as one of the best run nuclear power plants in the world. During the entire construction of Koeberg it was difficult even to find a single foreign face anywhere on the construction site. Highest quality standards The nuclear industry internationally operates to the highest of quality assurance standards, and within the most stringent set of self-imposed procedural regulations. The capital cost of building a nuclear power plant is more expensive than that of a coal plant. However, a nuclear plant is designed to last for 60 years, and the fuel price for those 60 years is very little and is predictable. As a mental image: if Koeberg were a coal-fired plant it would use six trainloads of coal per day, but in fact it uses one truck load of nuclear fuel per year. So, ten or twenty years’ worth of nuclear fuel could be stored on-site, indoors, if you wanted to. Imagine a ten or twenty year pile of coal. The total cost of the new nuclear fleet will be finally decided between South African nuclear specialists plus the specialists of the foreign vendor companies chosen by the bidding process. Clearly, there are tight rules and specifications within which such determinations will take place. South African nuclear engineers have calculated a total cost of some R650 billion. Note that nobody in authority has ever quoted a figure of R1 trillion. The R1trln refrain constantly emanates from the anti-nuclear fraternity. Of this R650bn, half or more should rotate domestically within our economy. South Africa also plans to export nuclear components to the world. In fact such fabrication and export have already started. The most assured way of running over budget and over time is by allowing poor project management and task execution to creep into the system. That has to be guarded against at all costs. Koeberg was built on time and within budget, 40 years ago. There is no reason why South Africa cannot do it again. We have far superior skills and technology now than we had then. We are not incompetent wimps waiting for a foreign crutch. * Dr Kelvin Kemm is a nuclear physicist and chairman of the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation. * The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of Independent Media.

According to Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis, the U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when the Russian SU-27 jet made the risky maneuver. Russia’s defense ministry, meanwhile, said that the U.S. spy plane tried to approach the Russian border, and the SU-27 jet was scrambled in response with adherence to international rules, BBC reported. “These actions have the potential to unnecessarily escalate tensions, and could result in a miscalculation or accident,” Davis reportedly said. However, Russian officials said that the U.S. plane was intercepted because it was heading toward the Russian territory with its transponders switched off. When the Russian jet approached the U.S. spy plane to visually identify them, it changed direction and flew away from the border, Russia’s RT.com reported. A P-8A Poseidon assigned to the Bureau of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 20 flies over the Chesapeake Bay.

But only one of the incidents was what the pilot determined was unsafe,” an anonymous U.S. official told Reuters. Wednesday’s incident is likely to spark more tension between the U.S. and Russia whose relations have been strained since the latter annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The latest incident also comes as the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are expected to meet Thursday to discuss the ongoing conflict in Syria. In April, the U.S claimed that Russian warplanes had confronted one of its reconnaissance aircraft over the Baltic Sea while Russia said at the time that the American jet had turned off its transponder signal. In July, NATO leaders agreed to deploy four multinational battalions to the Baltic states and Poland on a rotational basis against Russian aggression. Moscow also responded to the move saying that NATO’s buildup in those regions would be inevitably followed by a “military technical” response.

Bombardier cuts its C Series delivery forecast for 2016 because engine supplier Pratt & Whitney is having production issues with its new Geared Turbofan engine. Bo Rader File photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Just as the parent of Wichita’s Learjet had gained some momentum on its new narrowbody airliner program, Bombardier said it would cut by more than half the number of C Series aircraft it was planning to deliver this year. In an update this week, Bombardier said it would deliver seven C Series jetliners in 2016, down from the 15 deliveries it had expected to make. But Bombardier said the cut to its delivery forecast wasn’t of its own doing. Rather it’s because the C Series’ engine maker, Pratt & Whitney, can’t deliver its geared turbofan engines fast enough. A fairly quick resolution to the slow engine production is something Bombardier needs to meet its plan of reaching financial stability and profitability in the next few years, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said Wednesday. “The main problem is just Bombardier has a very tight window in terms of ramping up production and achieving profit by 2020,” he said. “Developments like this just complicate that problem.” Bombardier, which employs about 1,800 people in Wichita, was already two years behind schedule and $2 billion over budget before delivering its first C Series CS100 airliner in June to Swiss International Airlines. Swiss has since taken delivery of a second CS100 and both aircraft have accumulated nearly 600 flight hours, almost 400 hours of which were revenue flights. Analysts have pointed to the C Series delays and cost overruns that nearly drained the company of cash as one reason why Bombardier last year canceled development of the Learjet 85 business jet. That led to the layoff of 600 Wichita workers. Bombardier said in its update it doesn’t expect a “material” effect to its 2016 earnings before interest and taxes but revenue in its commercial aircraft unit will be lower, though it didn’t say by how much. “We are working very closely with Pratt & Whitney to quickly address this supplier ramp-up issue and to ensure we have a strong supplier based to support our long-term growth objectives,” Bombardier Commercial Aircraft president Fred Cromer said in the update. For its part, Pratt & Whitney said in an e-mailed statement Wednesday it is working to overcome the production delays. “In terms of production, we’ve made significant headway in the supply chain, but there is some pressure on new engine deliveries for this year,” the statement said. “We are working closely with our customers on the delivery schedule, and we are keeping them apprised of the progress being made.” Pratt’s Geared Turbofan engine has won five national and international awards, including from Popular Science, Aviation Week and the China Aviation Association and AVIC Science and Technology department. Pratt claims the engine offers a 16 percent reduction in fuel burn, a 75 percent decrease in the noise footprint and a 50 percent reduction in regulated emissions. Former Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson said in January that the geared turbofan engines are “really the first big innovation since the (Boeing) 787.” About three months later, Delta placed a firm order for 75 CS100s and options for 50 more. It’s not unusual for early production delays to occur on a new airplane or jet engine. But Aboulafia thinks Pratt is struggling with the engine because it will be used on a variety of commercial airplanes – Airbus A320neo, Embraer E190-E2, Mistubishi Regional Jet and Irkut MC-21 – and each one of those aircraft will have a different version of it. “What really complicates things is that Pratt is trying to ramp up and develop an unprecedented number of variants of the same engine at once,” he said. “There’s always complications between variants.” Aboulafia thinks there’s a “very good chance” Pratt will successfully work through its engine production issues and not upset Bombardier’s turnaround plan. But if that effort takes too long, “it just complicates Bombardier’s efforts to keep its head above water,” he said.

NASA’s Jeff Williams, 58, logged 534 days in space over four missions. The ISS commander landed at 7:13 local time (0113 GMT) on the steppes of central Kazakhstan aboard a Russian-made Soyuz capsule along with Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka. “Touchdown! Welcome home @Astro_Jeff, officially back on Earth after 172-day mission & total 534 days on 4 missions,” NASA tweeted. A NASA live video feed showed Williams on the ground smiling and waving while talking on a satellite phone before being carried away for medical tests. The three men undocked from the ISS nearly three and a half hours earlier after spending their mission largely conducting scientific experiments. Williams performed five space walks, including one along with NASA astronaut Kate Rubins to install a docking adapter for future commercial Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the space station. “Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft,” NASA said in a statement. He also helped set up an experimental temporary inflatable module designed by Bigelow Aerospace to test expandable habitats astronauts might use on the Moon or Mars in the coming decades. The retired Army colonel beat the previous US record set by astronaut Scott Kelly during his year in orbit. Kelly has 520 days in space over his career. Williams, a grandfather, is also the oldest American to spend live on the space station. Williams first blasted to space aboard the shuttle Atlantis in 2000. He returned to the International Space Station in 2006 when the space station was far smaller — with just two modules and three crew members — and again in 2009. Today, the ISS is staffed by six astronauts and cosmonauts and spans the size of a football field. Williams may hold the US record for time in orbit, but Russia’s Gennady Padalka still holds the record for the person with the most cumulative days in space at 879. — AFP TAGS Jeff Williams SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleCrown Blue clinches Morning crown Next articleAiming for closer ties to Laos, Obama honors its culture Sadiq Hussain NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,486,011FansLike 41,110FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Deterrent for non-recurrence Nov 18, 2016 Sexual harassment Nov 18, 2016 Women in Riyadh feel more at ease without niqab Nov 18, 2016 American couple ruin stereotypes about Saudis Nov 18, 2016 Saudi Arabia set to reinforce its climate change commitments Nov 18, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

NASA's Williams passes Scott Kelly's U.S. space record James Dean, Florida Today Wednesday, 24-Aug-16 17:50:27 PDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest MELBOURNE, Fla. — Scott Kelly is widely known as the Ironman of U.S. astronauts after his recent yearlong mission aboard the International Space Station, during which he set a NASA record for most cumulative days in space with 520 over four flights. But as of Wednesday, that career record belongs not to Kelly but Jeff Williams, an unassuming NASA veteran who doesn't mind if his six-month tour lacks the promotion and buzz of Kelly's "#YearInSpace." The commander of the station’s six-person Expedition 48 crew marked his 521st day in space Wednesday, a total expected to reach 534 days by the time he returns to Earth on Sept. 6 to conclude his fourth spaceflight. On Wednesday, Kelly called Williams to congratulate him on his achievement. "I wanted to congratulate you on passing me up here in total number of days in space," said Kelly. "It's great to see another record broken. ... But I do have one question for you. And my question is: You got another 190 days in you?" .@StationCDRKelly congratulates @Astro_Jeff on breaking his record of 520 total days in space by a U.S. astronaut! https://t.co/y9BxzUWtgH— Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 24, 2016 Williams said, "That question's not for me, that's for my wife." Don’t expect the retired Army colonel — a 58-year-old grandfather who is the oldest NASA astronaut to live on the orbiting laboratory complex — to boast about the achievement. “It’s an honor to spend any day in space, and certainly to have accumulated that time is truly an honor for me,” Williams told NASA TV recently. But he prefers to shift the attention to the station itself, which he considers humanity’s greatest technological feat, and the international partnership that has put it together. USA TODAY Spacewalk opens door for Boeing, SpaceX crews “That’s really the bigger story to me, personally,” he said. Williams’ 20-year astronaut career has spanned the station’s assembly, which began in 1998. His first flight was a 2000 shuttle mission that helped set up the fledgling outpost for its first permanent crew later that year. Crews have now lived continuously on the space station for nearly 16 years. Since that 10-day shuttle flight, it’s been all long-duration missions for the Wisconsin native, who has launched three times from Kazakhstan on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. He’s the first American to serve on three International Space Station expeditions, which typically last five or six months each. The previous two were in 2006 and 2010, before station construction was officially complete. Williams’ current mission has helped set the stage for the station’s next chapter, which will rely more on commercial operations. .@Astro_Jeff breaks @NASA_Astronauts time in space record held by @StationCDRKelly. https://t.co/QlMHon6rzt pic.twitter.com/mUTlOMLM22— Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 24, 2016 On Friday he performed his fourth spacewalk, pairing with NASA’s Kate Rubins to install a docking port that opened the door for Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the outpost late next year or in early 2018. They are preparing for another spacewalk next week. Williams also has helped set up a prototype habitat module designed by Bigelow Aerospace, a potential precursor to private space stations that could follow the space station. A West Point graduate in 1980, Williams later earned two master’s degrees and finished first in his class at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Still, it took him about 10 years and multiple applications to win entry into NASA’s astronaut corps in 1996. He preaches perseverance to young people. Williams is old enough to remember Russia as a Cold War adversary. Now he sees the space station partnership involving the U.S., Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada as a model for peaceful international relations. USA TODAY NASA astronaut Williams to set U.S. spaceflight record “I trust that it serves as a very positive example to the world below,” he said. When he returns to Earth in less than two weeks, Williams told CBS News recently that he looks forward to seeing family and friends and to “the simple things in life.” Those include smells of Earth often taken for granted, relaxing in quiet without the station’s constant hum of fans and pumps, and anything his wife will cook for him. “She’s the real hero in all of this, putting up with me being up here that many days over the years,” he said. And Williams knows records are made to be broken. In fact, Peggy Whitson, currently fourth on NASA's career list with 377 days in space, is scheduled to launch to the International Space Station in November and set a new U.S. record next year.

Sully Speaks Out facebook twitter linkedin pinterest print By Carl von Wodtke 9/7/2016 • Aviation History Magazine, HistoryNet, Homepage Hero, Mag: Aviation History Hero The “Miracle on the Hudson” was no miracle; it was the culmination of a 35-year military and airline flying career Captain Chesley Sullenberger was the right person, in the right place, at the right time. His entire flying career had prepared him for the unimaginable crisis he and copilot Jeff Skiles faced on January 15, 2009, when their Airbus A320 lost both engines after striking a flock of geese soon after takeoff from New York’s LaGuardia Airport. The US Airways pilots were at about 3,000 feet over one of the world’s most densely populated cities, flying what was essentially a 75-ton glider with no runway within reach. In a testament to his skill and calm professionalism, Sullenberger managed to safely ditch the stricken A320 in the Hudson River, saving all 155 aboard. “Sully” Sullenberger, as he refers to himself, graciously agreed to share with Aviation History’s readers recollections of his military and airline career, the events of that fateful day seven years ago and his views on the challenges the airline industry faces today. He also talked about Sully, the Clint Eastwood–directed motion picture based on Sullenberger’s bestseller Highest Duty, starring Tom Hanks and set to be released on September 9. Tell us a little bit about how you got into flying. By the time I was 5 I knew I wanted to fly airplanes, and I never considered anything else; I didn’t have a plan B. So I was fascinated by airplanes, built my first model at probably age 5½ or 6. I had learned to fly in high school—typical pattern, soloed as soon as I could, at minimum age, at 16; got my private pilot’s certificate at the minimum age, 17; commercial pilot’s certificate at the minimum age, 18. By the time I entered the Air Force Academy, I had a couple hundred hours of flying time. I quickly became a flight instructor—by the time I was 20 I was a flight instructor in airplanes and in gliders—and in the four years I was at the Air Force Academy I flew a thousand hours, which I’m told is quite remarkable; I’m not sure it has been done since. Mostly in instruction given to other cadets, teaching them to fly airplanes and gliders on my weekends and after school. And then I went to graduate school at Purdue, then Air Force pilot training and became a fighter pilot. So it’s been something that’s been a lifelong passion and continues to be so. You had kind of a mentor in L.T. Cook. Sounded like he was the right person for you at the time. He was a cropduster that I was introduced to, and if he liked the look of you he’d take you on as a student. He did, he had his own grass strip east of Sherman, Texas. He had a couple of airplanes, one he sprayed with—a Super Cub—and then he had this Aeronca 7DC that he taught me to fly in. I soloed pretty quickly. Of course flying was a little bit simpler then. I think I had a little over 7½ hours when I soloed. It was a great way to learn deeply internalized, well-learned fundamental skills that would last a lifetime and be accessible even decades later, even though I’d been flying jets for a long time. You were named the outstanding cadet in airmanship at the Air Force Academy. To what do you attribute that honor? Well, first of all I did so much of it, both as an instructor in the glider program and in the aero club in powered airplanes. I also did parachuting, and I think just the fact I’d done so much and I had such a passion for it, it sort of set me apart from my contemporaries. That’s really it; it’s not that I was the best in every way, it’s just I had approached it with such passion and done so much of it—and been noticed. Of his time in F-4s, Sullenberger said. "It's the best flying I've ever done." (courtesy Chesley Sullenberger) You went on to fly F-4s in Britain and at Nellis Air Force Base. What did you think of the Phantom? It was an older airplane even then, a workhorse of the Vietnam era, and of course my active service was toward the end of the Vietnam War. I never actually went to Vietnam, never saw combat, and then much of the rest of my active duty service was during the Cold War. Flying a jet fighter is the pinnacle of tactical military aviation. It’s like driving a Formula One racer on steroids—in three dimensions, not just two. It’s thrilling, it’s demanding. Unless you’re someone who’s done it, words fail me in describing to you what it’s like and what it takes, except to say that it’s the best flying I’ve ever done. You need to be on at all times. Yeah, especially as we were flying in formation at ultra low levels while I was at Nellis over the desert ranges, 100 feet above the ground at 600 knots. You’re covering a nautical mile every six seconds, you’re traveling just over 1,012 feet per second. How do you think your Air Force training prepared you for Flight 1549? I think anyone who has been a military aviator brings to the table a certain discipline, a certain diligence. It’s an attitude with which we approach the job, it’s a profession, it’s a calling. And it’s something that if you answer that calling, it leads one to be a continuous lifelong learner, to constantly be striving for excellence to try to always make the next flight better than the previous one. In our military debriefings after every flight, we would not hold back, and in brutally honest discussions we would hold each other, leaders and followers alike, accountable to the same high professional standards. We talked about what worked and what didn’t, and why and what we could do to make it better next time. So it’s that sort of rigor that I think military aviators bring to any flying they do. It’s a professional attitude, to the nth degree. And you understand clearly, you’ve done your homework, there are no major gaps in your knowledge. You understand high-altitude aerodynamics, high-altitude physiology, you understand the mechanics of all the systems of the airplane, you leave no stone unturned, and you know not just what and how to do things, but you know why we must do them. And I think that’s certainly part of our National Transportation Safety Board’s formal lessons-learned process also when they investigate major transportation accidents. Pilots of my generation can quote you chapter and verse of the last half century of seminal accidents—where they occurred, why, and what we learned from them and how that knowledge has informed not only our airplane designs but our policies, our procedures and our training. Walk us through the decision-making process you went through after you struck that flock of geese and lost both engines. What were your options and why did you choose to ditch in the Hudson? Well, first I should set the stage for this and say that at this point it had been 29 years since I had been a fighter pilot. For 29 years I’d worked in this airline environment where we worked so hard to plan and anticipate and have alternatives for every course of action. We worked very hard never to be surprised by anything, to keep it smooth and routine, and we’d do a very good job of that. And very suddenly, just 100 seconds after takeoff, we encountered this flock of birds that were just visible a few seconds before we struck them. But at that point we were traveling 316 feet per second, so I saw them probably three football field lengths ahead of us, but clearly not enough time and distance to maneuver a large, fast jet airliner away from them. And so within a few seconds we had encountered an ultimate challenge of a lifetime. I’d never before been so challenged in an airplane. And within a few seconds of that the engines had been damaged and had failed, and it was obvious from the very beginning that this was going to be unlike every other flight I’d had for 42 years and 20,000 hours in the air. And the startle effect, the shock of this, was intense, and our bodies reacted in a normal human physiological way. I was aware that had happened—my pulse shooting up, my blood pressure spiking, my perceptual field narrowing because of the sudden, life-threatening stress. But I did three things. I was able to force calm on myself, which isn’t really calm, it’s just having the discipline that I talked about to be able to compartmentalize and focus clearly on the task at hand in spite of the stress. Second, even though we’d never trained for this, and in fact in our airline flight simulators you cannot train for water landings—they aren’t programmed for it; the only training we’d ever gotten was a theoretical classroom discussion—I was able to take a lifetime of experience and training and impose that paradigm on this situation, thereby making it then one I knew how to solve. And finally, because of the extreme workload and time pressure, I knew I didn’t have time to do everything I needed to do, but because I could set priorities, because I understood not just the what and how of my profession but the why, because I knew my airplane so intimately—I’d been on the airplane almost 5,000 hours, 6½ years—I could set clear priorities even in this situation we’d never trained for. And so I chose to do only the highest priority items but do them very, very well, and then I had the discipline to ignore everything I did not have time to do as being only potential distractions. I knew from having visited and flown into New York many times that we only had three options. There were only two runways that were even possibly close enough for us to be able to use our minimum altitude and glide to: LaGuardia, from which we had departed but at that point were heading away from, and Teterboro across the river in New Jersey. It turned out, and the NTSB ultimately validated this in a flight simulator study at the Airbus factory in France, that, seeing this for the first time as we were, and including reaction time, there was not altitude to make it back to any runway. And that I knew intuitively up front, and I suspected we were going to end up in the river, but I had to consider trying to make it to a runway first. I chose the third option, the only remaining viable option, which was the Hudson—the only place in the entire metropolitan area of New York, one of the most densely populated areas on the planet, that was long enough, wide enough and smooth enough to attempt landing an airliner. So I quickly set priorities, I load shed—pared down this problem to its essential elements—did the few things that had to be done, did them very well and I was willing to goal sacrifice. I knew that the highest priority was to save lives, and I was more than willing to give up trying to save the airplane very early on in order to do that. And that was an easy choice for me to make, although as [First Officer] Jeff Skiles would tell me later, “You put a $62 million airliner in the river and they call you a hero. Is this a great country, or what?” But the options were so clear. Ultimately we had the advantage of a relative lack of ambiguity. I saw the birds, we heard and felt them going into the engines. We didn’t have to spend a lot of time saying what just happened, and instead immediately started analyzing this problem. We were able to go very quickly into how do we solve it. That saved a lot of time, when we only had, as it turned out from the time we hit the birds and the thrust loss until we had landed, 208 seconds, just under 3½ minutes. So we quickly began to work together. And it’s also important to note that Jeff Skiles, like I do, has 20,000 hours of flying time. He had been a captain on the 737, a different type of airplane, before. So we were able to collaborate wordlessly, when there wasn’t time to have a discussion about this, there wasn’t time for me to direct his every action. I had to rely upon him immediately and intuitively knowing what was happening and knowing what he should do to help me, because I didn’t have time to tell him to do that. Had he been less experienced, we couldn’t have had the same outcome, and that’s why experience is so important, because you never know throughout an entire career when or even if you’re going to face such a challenge or what it will be. What’s so remarkable about this, I think, is the fact that under these extreme conditions of crisis we got so much so right so quickly, and every choice that we made at every juncture the NTSB later verified was the one that led to the best outcome. Passengers wait to be rescued on the wings of Flight 1549. (AP Photo/Steven Day) You mention in your book the Airbus A320’s various safety systems—did that in your mind help or hinder, or both, your ability to ditch in the Hudson, because I know specifically you mention about not being able to pull the nose up quite as far as you might have wanted to? The answer is both. Let me back up a little bit. Within two seconds of the bird strike and thrust loss, we know from the cockpit voice recorder and from the flight data recorder, I had taken by memory the first two remedial actions that would help us the most, that we would later get to on the checklist over a minute later, over a third of the way through the remaining flight time, and that was to turn on the engine ignition so the engines would recover if they could (it turned out they were irreparably damaged), and I started the airplane’s auxiliary power unit, the APU, to provide a backup source of electrical power. Since this is a fly-by-wire airplane and there’s no longer a direct mechanical connection with the flight controls, instead you have electrical impulses that are fed through computers that then move actuators. So I knew how important it was to have uninterrupted electrical power, and we never lost electrical power. By the time the left engine rpm decayed enough that it was no longer powering its own generator, the APU generator was online. So we stayed in normal law—all the flight envelope protections were intact. That helped provide essentially guardrails to prevent us from exceeding certain extremes in terms of speed or attitude, for example. So I had that as an ace in the hole. It turns out we didn’t need those protections; we never got to the limits at which they would have protected us from ourselves. At the very end of the flight, as you note, I had not yet achieved the maximum aerodynamic performance of the wing—we had not yet gotten to what we call alpha max—and I was during the landing pulling the stick further aft, further aft, trying to maximize the performance of the wing to get to the nose-high attitude we needed for entry into the water, to get to the slowest rate of descent that we could. And it turned out we discovered later—the investigators discovered by studying the data from the digital flight data recorder—that in the last four seconds of the flight, a little-known software feature of the fly-by-wire system known only to a few software engineers at Airbus, but to no airline pilots and no airline operators, prevented me from achieving that last little bit of performance because of something called the phugoid mode. And had that not inhibited our performance, had that not, as the NTSB in the report euphemistically said, “attenuated” my inputs—nose-up command—we wouldn’t have hit quite so hard, we wouldn’t have had as much damage and [Flight Attendant] Doreen Welsh might not have been injured in the back when a piece of structure came up through the floor, and the airplane might have floated a little bit higher in the water and a little bit longer. So it’s a mixed blessing: It prevented us from making egregious errors, but we didn’t anyway, and at the very end it prevented us from getting the nose up quite as much as we theoretically should have been able to. How do you think it might have been different if you were, say, flying a Boeing airliner? Except for that one flight control mode, I don’t think it would have mattered. As long as I was flying an airplane that was similarly configured, in other words the overall geometric structure of the airplane was similar, with low-slung engines in about the same position, I think we would have had a similar outcome. To what do you attribute the public fascination with your successful ditching? I think just the way it happened, when it happened at the time in the world’s history, during the ’08-’09 financial meltdown when it seemed as if everything was going wrong and no one could do anything right. It had affected so many people so negatively that some people had begun to question human nature and wonder if it was really mostly about self-interest and greed. And then this group of people all came together, rose to the occasion and in concert made it their mission in life to see that good was done and that lives were saved. I think at a time when we all needed it, it gave people hope, it reassured us that there was still this human potential for good in each of us. And I think one of the biggest surprises for all of us directly involved is that this story did not fade away at the end of the news cycle like most stories do, because of the way it happened when it happened and the way that it continues to touch and inspire people, even people not associated with this flight. And so I feel a special responsibility to this story to treat it with the respect that I feel for it, because of the way it touches people.

(AP Photo/Stephen Chernin) And the people of New York, too, were part of that whole equation. Absolutely. So as a result of this, both our first officer Jeff Skiles and I feel an obligation to use this notoriety for good, to use this bully pulpit to improve the safety of the traveling public, to improve the state of the piloting profession. Not to do so would be a dereliction of duty in our minds, because we feel like we owe it to our colleagues still working at all the airlines to do that. Since we’ve been chosen temporarily by fate as the de facto spokespersons for the profession, we don’t want to let them down. Tell us a little bit about what you’ve been up to since your 2009 book. A lot. People know that a year after the famous flight I retired after just over 30 years from the airlines, but they don’t always know all the things I’ve done, that I really didn’t retire; I just traded that one profession for several others. As an author I wrote a second book, Making a Difference: Stories of Vision and Courage From America’s Leaders, that I’m very happy with. I profile about a dozen people, and when I chose people whom I admired to profile as exemplars of leadership, I neither asked nor considered their political affiliation, but instead I chose people who had exhibited moral courage, and by doing the right thing at the right time for the right reasons, they had made a difference in people’s lives. And so that’s something I’ve been passionate about my whole life, and I was very fortunate to have so many outstanding Americans participate in this story and come up with answers to all the questions I had about leadership—like are leaders born or made, how important is culture, how do you manage your own ego and prevent it from getting in your way? So that was a real labor of love, and that came out in 2012. I’ve been doing a lot of speeches around the country and in fact around the world. I’ve talked to audiences, as many as 15,000 people, from Australia to Switzerland and everywhere in between. And as I’ve traveled the world and met important people, including some world leaders, I’ve learned a lot about different audiences, and I work very hard to do that every time I speak to them—audiences as diverse as nuclear power operators to financial risk managers to medical professionals. I’ve done a lot of talking to medical audiences about how we’ve made aviation so safe and the ways that we can transfer that knowledge to medicine to make patient care safer. I’ve also been a consultant to industry, again on applying aviation-type methods to chemical and other industries. And I’ve also been an advocate for the safety of the traveling public; I’ve used this notoriety for good to go to Capitol Hill. I testified just a year ago before the House and the Senate aviation subcommittees. I was in Washington, D.C., just last month to try to improve aviation safety and try to include in the FAA reauthorization bill measures that would make flying safer for everybody. So that’s a big focus of mine. So I’ve been very busy in trying to say that even though I had a 40-year career in flying—even before the famous flight, and then there was the famous flight, which was a major contribution to safety—I’m trying to keep on working so that it may be that if I’m fortunate and work hard enough, my greatest contributions still lie ahead. What do you think are the main challenges the airline industry faces today? I think the main challenge is to find ways to keep making air travel safer. We’ve made huge strides, particularly in the advanced Western world and especially in the United States in the last decade. In fact, the last passenger fatality on a large U.S. jetliner in the U.S. was 15 years ago, in November 2001. That’s not true at the regionals, although the last regional airline accident now has been awhile—the February 2009 crash of Continental Connection–Colgan Air 3407 in Buffalo. It’s been largely due to the efforts of the victims’ families of the Buffalo crash, because of their ardent support for safety measures, that the Congress in 2010 really improved some things, including pilot experience minimums that were really very low before and now are more reasonable. So there’s still a lot of pressure, especially within the regional industry, to do things that are just good enough, to do things that are less costly, that are more expedient, that are easier. And we have to keep reminding everyone—the airlines, the FAA and others—that when we go up in an airliner together, what we’re really doing, in spite of how routine and safe it seems, is we’re pushing a tube filled with people through the upper atmosphere, 7 or 8 miles above the earth, at 80 percent of the speed of sound, in a hostile environment with outside air pressure one-quarter that at the surface and outside temperatures to minus 70, and we must return it safely to the surface every time. We make it look easy, but it’s not. So we can’t take our eye off the ball. We have to use big data, we have to use all kinds of safety reporting and auditing systems to look for risks and mitigate them before they can lead to a bad outcome. And we need to make sure that as we transition from my generation of pilots to the next generations that they have that same diligence, that same discipline, that same understanding that just good enough isn’t, and that they have learned and internalized the lessons of historic accidents to remember why it’s important that we do all the things we do to keep our passengers safe on every flight on every day. What is your opinion of the airline pilot shortage, and why do you think fewer youngsters are interested in learning to fly? Well, all of us choose our life path based upon not only our passion but its ability to be a viable, sustainable path for ourselves and eventually for our families. Your passion only carries you so far. At some point all of us are going to want to be able to have the means to buy a car, to get married, to buy a house—to have a path that makes economic sense for us. And if the entry-level wages and working conditions and benefits of some of these small regional airlines are not sufficient to do that, of course they’re not going to attract experienced applicants in the numbers they would like. There isn’t currently a shortage of pilots in this country, but there is a shortage of pilots willing to work for starvation, food-stamp-level wages at some of the smallest carriers that have a rightly deserved reputation for being not good places to work. And so I think the industry as a whole needs to look at this broken economic model that some of the regional airlines continue to try to use, and some of the large major carriers have helped to create because they have created a system in which the smaller regionals compete on the basis of cost to be their regional affiliate. In other words, the large major carriers often choose the lowest bidder to be their affiliate in a region, and so I think they’ve helped to create the problem and they have a responsibility in helping to fix it. How about the increasing reliance on automation—do you think there’s been an erosion in airline piloting skills? I not only think that, but studies have indicated that. And it’s even worse than that. There have been several studies that have shown that not only has overreliance on automation given pilots fewer opportunities to manually practice flying skills, and that their flying skills have somewhat eroded because of that, but even worse, these studies have found that being an observer, a monitor of automated systems flying the airplane during large portions of the flight, has eroded the pilots’ ability to be mentally engaged, keep track of what’s happening with the airplane and respond quickly enough and effectively enough when they need to intervene. So it’s sapped their flying skills, it’s sapped the confidence they have in their manual flying skills, and it’s slowed their willingness and their ability to quickly and effectively intervene when they must exercise their flying skills, and instead keep on trying to use or fix the automation. So this lack of ability to quickly analyze and figure out what’s going on because of this mentally taking a step back and not being as actively mentally engaged with the whole process throughout the flight is what troubles me even more than the lack of or the diminution of manual flying skills. But they go hand in hand. And so we need to find better ways to keep pilots sharp, to keep them engaged in every aspect of the flight. And it may mean that we need to rethink the design of our cockpits to give pilots a more active role, and have the automation do more of the monitoring instead of the reverse, because humans are not inherently good at monitoring. A lot of people consider you a hero, and in your book you said you’re not comfortable with that. How do you feel about that now? Well, I’ve spent years coming to terms with that. And I’ve gotten a greater appreciation for people’s need to feel that way. And I take it as a real responsibility for me to be the public face of this event, and to receive people’s thanks because they have a need to give it. And I want to honor that, but at the same time I know that while we were doing our jobs that day, we did our jobs exceptionally well, probably better than could have been expected under the circumstances.   Sully: The Movie Director Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks discuss a scene on location in New York City. (Photo by Steve Sands/GC Images) When did you learn that they wanted to make a movie from your book, and what was your reaction? Well it was in 2010 that I was approached by a producer who optioned the dramatic rights to my first book, Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters, and she hired a screenwriter and came up with a script. And then it had not found a home until early May 2015, when the script was read by Clint Eastwood and he loved it. He immediately contacted Warner Bros, and the train left the station and has been hurtling down the tracks ever since. He actually came to the house last May [2015], and then once some of the casting decisions were made Tom Hanks came to the house last summer. Principal photography began in New York in late September, and it was all completed by late November or early December. And of course it’s in post-production now and it will be released in theaters in the U.S. on September 9. So the story has found a good home, it’s in good hands—veteran filmmakers and great storytellers. And of course Tom Hanks is our “everyman,” he’s played a lot of real people before, including people I’ve met, like Captain James Lovell of Apollo 13, so we’re looking forward to it. How does it feel to have America’s everyman actor playing you? Well, Jimmy Stewart wasn’t available [laughter]. I think it’s a great choice. What’s the nature of your involvement? I’ve had a small role as a consultant on the film, which I’m very glad, because, I mean, it’s my life and the life of my family and the lives of the people on our flight. So this obviously matters to me. And I’m really impressed with the way that they’re handling it. The few times my wife and I had a chance to visit on the set during filming, it seemed like everybody in the cast and crew, and there were sometimes hundreds of people there, treated this with the kind of respect that I really was impressed by. What’s it been like working with a Hollywood legend like Clint Eastwood? It must be a privilege. It is. Class act, very dedicated, been doing this a long time. Very successful coming off the heels just a year ago with American Sniper. And he’s got a well-earned reputation for being very efficient and getting it done quickly, on time and under budget. And taking good care of the story.

When NASA astronaut Jeff Williams returned to Earth from the International Space Station on Sept. 6, he had been in space for 172 days. Adding those days to his three previous space flights, Williams has spent a total of 534 days off the planet, the longest for a NASA astronaut. The previous record holder, Scott Kelly, logged a three-flight total of 520 days.

Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls Less than a week after winding up a successful spacewalk, outgoing space station commander Jeff Williams, America’s most experienced astronaut, joined two Russian cosmonauts for a fiery return to Earth Tuesday, closing out a 172-day mission with an on-target landing in Kazakhstan. Descending under a billowing orange-and-white parachute, the charred Soyuz crew module completed a jolting rocket-assisted touchdown at 9:13 p.m. EDT (GMT-4; 7:13 a.m. Wednesday local time). As sometimes happens, the capsule tipped over on its side after landing, but Russian recovery crews stationed nearby were on the scene in minutes to tilt the spacecraft upright and to help the station fliers, getting their first taste of gravity in five-and-a-half months, out of the cramped compartment. Williams, Soyuz commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka appeared healthy and in good spirits as they were carried out of the descent module and set down in recliners for satellite phone calls home while flight surgeons carried out quick medical checks. All three were scheduled to fly by helicopter to Karaganda later in the day. From there, Williams was to board a NASA jet for the long flight back home to Houston while Ovchinin and Skripochka planned to head for Star City near Moscow for debriefing and reunions with family members. “I will certainly miss this view!” Williams tweeted from the station early Tuesday, sending down a photo of Earth’s limb in brilliant sunlight. “Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family.” “We’ve enjoyed a great stay up here over the last five-and-a-half months,” he said earlier. “This is a very significant time, in my opinion, in the life of the space station, going into the full utilization mode, being the orbiting laboratory we’ve always said it was going to be.” Williams, Ovchinin and Skripochka undocked from the lab’s upper Poisk module at 5:51 p.m., slowly backing away as the two spacecraft passed more than 250 miles above the western Pacific Ocean. Looking on from inside the station were Expedition 49 commander Anatoly Ivanishin, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins. Launched to the station July 6 aboard the Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft, Ivanishin and his crewmates will have the space lab to themselves until Sept. 25 when three fresh crew members arrive. “We’ll be missing you here,” Ivanishin said Monday during a change-of-command ceremony. “Have fun riding though the atmosphere, enjoy seeing plasma in the windows and have a very safe, and exceptionally soft, landing. All the best.” After making sure the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft was ready for its descent, Ovchinin, flanked on the left by Skripochka and on the right by Williams, monitored a computer controlled de-orbit rocket firing starting at 8:21 p.m. The four-minute 41-second burn slowed the ship by 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit deep into Earth’s atmosphere. After a 25-minute free fall to just above the top of the discernible atmosphere, the three modules making up the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft separated. A few moments after that, the central crew cabin, the only module protected by a heat shield, slammed into the atmosphere at an altitude of 62 miles and a velocity of some 17,000 mph. Rubins managed to capture a photograph of re-entry from her vantage point aboard the station, showing the central crew module descending as a point of light while the discarded upper and lower compartments burned up in in the atmosphere as planned, leaving long streaks of flaming debris in their wake. NASA astronaut Jeff Williams, Soyuz commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Oleg Skripochka were greeted on the Kazakh steppe by Russian and U.S. recovery crews. Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls The crew module dropped out of the plasma heating zone in good shape and its main parachute deployed at an altitude of a little less than seven miles. The spacecraft then slowly settled to the steppe of Kazakhstan. Asked what he was looking forward to the most, Williams said “obviously, family is the first thing, my wife, she’s the real hero in all this putting up with me being up here that many days.” “I look forward to quiet, just relaxing someplace, enjoying the views, enjoying the smells of Earth, all those things that we normally take for granted,” he told CBS News last month. “You miss that when you’re up here. We have continuous noise up here from fans and pumps, it’s not loud, but it’s continuous.” All in all, he said, “just the simple things in life. Good food, anything my wife wants to cook, I look forward to that, those kinds of things, friends.” Williams and his two crewmates were launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 18 and landing closes out a busy increment highlighted by two spacewalks, the arrival of two Russian Progress cargo ships, a pair of SpaceX Dragon freighters, an Orbital ATK Cygnus supply craft and the Soyuz MS-01 crew. During a spacewalk Aug. 19, Williams and Rubins attached a new docking mechanism to the front of the station that will allow new commercial crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to dock at the lab complex, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russia’s Soyuz for transportation. During a second spacewalk last Thursday, Rubins and Williams, making his fifth EVA overall, retracted a cooling radiator, installed two high-definition cameras and performed other routine maintenance. The two astronauts logged 12 hours and 46 minutes during the two excursions, pushing Williams’ overall total through five EVAs to 31 hours and 55 minutes. Those spacewalks cover much of the history of the International Space Station with his first excursion coming during a shuttle maintenance mission in May 2000. He then ventured outside a second time with a Russian cosmonaut in June 2006 to perform maintenance on the Russian segment of the station. Two months after that, he went back outside with a European Space Agency astronaut to work on the station’s cooling system. Williams served as commander of Expedition 22 during his second long-duration stay aboard the lab and again as commander of Expedition 48 during this most recent mission. With touchdown, Ovchinin, completing his first space flight, logged 172 days in space while flight engineer Skripochka’s record over two flights now stands at 331 days. For Williams, the end of the mission marked a personal milestone. On Aug. 20, he surpassed the U.S. record for most cumulative time in space — 520 days — that was set earlier this year by astronaut Scott Kelly at the end of his nearly yearlong mission. With landing Tuesday, Williams’ mark now stands at 534 days aloft over four missions, moving him up to 14th on the list of most experienced spacemen. The overall record is held by Gennady Padalka, who has logged 878 days in space over five missions. “I appreciate, Jeff, your efforts as space station commander,” Ivanishin said during the change-of-command ceremony. “I’ll take care of the crew and the station. And I promise you, when you return to celebrate your first 1,000 days in space, the station will be in better shape!” Williams, Ovchinin and Skripochka will be replaced aboard the station by the Soyuz MS-02 crew, scheduled for launch from Baikonur on Sept. 23. After a two-day rendezvous, vehicle commander Andrey Borisenko, flight engineer Sergey Ryzhikov and NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough will dock at the Poisk module to boost the lab’s crew back to six. Ivanishin, Onishi and Rubins are scheduled to return to Earth Oct. 30.

Here are the details from that article: Provincial Aerospace Ltd. and CarteNav Solutions Inc. have entered into an agreement under which PAL has acquired CarteNav. CarteNav is a Nova Scotia based software developer that provides situational awareness and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions for maritime, land, and air environments. Its flagship product is AIMS-ISR which is being used in more than 30 countries around the world, the two firms pointed out in their news release. “There are many synergies between our two companies as we are each leaders in our specific segments of the ISR market,” Brian Chafe, Chief Executive Officer, PAL Aerospace, noted in a statement. “Together we look forward to enhancing the product and service offerings we are each able to offer.” Top Aces Corp. says it recently completed German Army Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) training support. Top Aces TA-4J Skyhawks flew multiple sorties and successfully completed all scheduled JTAC training events for German Army personnel on training ranges near Boise, Idaho, the firm added. Directed by controllers, Top Aces says its pilots flew close air support missions, simulating the delivery of munitions in close proximity to friendly forces. Rheinmetall will supply the Royal Canadian Navy with decoy ammunition for the next thirty years Rheinmetall and General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems–Canada have recently signed a licence agreement to produce Omnitrap decoy ammunition for the RCN. The contract encompasses the supply of core components by Rheinmetall for Omnitrap decoy ammunition, the company’s news release pointed out. Rheinmetall will provide technical assistance in setting up the assembly line at the General Dynamics facility in Repentigny, Que., where final assembly will take place. Rheinmetall pointed out that in 2009 it won a contract to outfit twelve Canadian Halifax-class frigates with MASS, the Multi Ammunition Softkill System, an automated decoy system which offers protection against incoming anti-ship missiles. Most Canadian Halifax-class frigates have been equipped with MASS systems along with a basic load of Omnitrap and MASS Dueras decoy ammunition, the firm noted. In 2015, Canada placed an order for 2,450 Omnitrap decoy rounds with Rheinmetall and General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems–Canada. The newly signed agreement will continue this supply relationship as well as the support that both companies provide the Canadian government for the next 30 years, according to Rheinmetall. Field Aviation says it has delivered the third of four missionized Challenger aircraft to Cobham Aviation Services. These aircraft are to provide enhanced search and rescue capabilities in support of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s (AMSA) operations, according to Field Aviation. The firm noted that it designed, installed, flight tested, and certified structural, electrical and aerodynamic changes to the aircraft. Esterline CMC Electronics (CMC) has been awarded a contract by Pilatus Aircraft Ltd to supply its cockpit avionics for eight PC-21 turboprop trainer aircraft. Those planes are for the Royal Jordanian Air Force. Esterline CMC said it will supply the cockpit displays, dual flight management systems (FMS) and GPS Global Positioning System (GPS) landing system sensors as well as the head-up display (HUD) sub-system. Esterline CMC Electronics (CMC) has also been awarded a contract by Pilatus Aircraft Ltd to supply its advanced cockpit avionics for the Royal Australian Air Force fleet of forty-nine PC-21 turboprop trainer aircraft. The Canadian government has awarded Lockheed Martin a $14.5 million contract to provide long-term, support for the Submarine Fire Control System (SFCS) installed on all four Victoria-class submarines and land based team trainers. The scope of the contract will contain in service and field service support, obsolescence management, and technical investigations as requested by the Department of National Defence, according to Lockheed Martin. The work on this program will be conducted at Lockheed Martin’s facilities in Manassas, Virginia and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, and via field service support at Canadian forces bases Halifax and Esquimalt. Boeing will be supplying more Apache helicopter to the United Kingdom. A deal was signed that will see Boeing deliver 50 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters to the British Army. The first helicopters will be built by 2020. Flight operations with the British Army would begin two years later. In addition, in early June, the U.S. government announced that Qatar will acquire 24 AH-64E Apache helicopters. Boeing also received in April a significant contract from the U.S. Army. That will see 117 AH-64D Apaches remanufactured to the new AH-64E model. The agreement, which also includes the acquisition of Longbow Crew Trainers, logistical support and spares, carries a total contract value of about $1.5 billion U.S., according to Boeing. That work is being done at the Apache production facility in Mesa, Arizona. The work will be completed in May 2018. Jesse Farrington, senior manager for Apache global sales and marketing, told Esprit de Corps earlier this year during a tour of the Mesa facilities, that the U.S. has made it clear it has a long-term commitment to the Apache. “Right now the U.S. Army is saying that they will be flying these aircraft to 2060,” he explained. “Customers around the world will benefit from that.”   Canadian bomb disposal specialists taking part in operation at Guadalcanal Spanish supply ship back on east coast to help Royal Canadian...

NASA Tests New Insulation for SLS Rocket by Kim Henry for MSFC News Huntsville AL (SPX) Sep 07, 2016 Amy Buck, SLS core stage insight lead at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, holds up a sample of foam that recently went through testing in Marshall's Hot Gas Facility. The facility is used for development and qualification of material systems for use on launch vehicles, like NASA's Space Launch System. These foam panels were tested to determine recession characteristics of the foam during the ascent phase of flight. The surface of the foam reaches more than 500 degrees Fahrenheit as it undergoes a hot gas flow at speeds of up to Mach 4 to simulate the environment during launch. NASA engineers then take the samples and measure how much foam is lost during the test to characterize the materials for use in the launch vehicle design and analysis. Image courtesy NASA/MSFC/Emmett Given. For a larger version of this image please go here. You may not think about insulation much, but it's one of those unsung industry heroes that keeps our drinks cold and homes warm on those bone-chilling winter days. Insulation also is a key component to protecting NASA's Space Launch System and its super-cold fuels for the journey to Mars. Different types of cryogenic foam - used for very low temperatures - will insulate the rocket's core stage and launch vehicle stage adapter, which connects the core stage to the interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS). The core stage is the backbone of the rocket, and houses the avionics system, propellant and RS-25 engines. On the first flight of SLS with the Orion spacecraft, called Exploration Mission-1, the ICPS will give the Orion the big push needed to fly beyond the moon before the spacecraft returns to Earth. The rocket's fuel is comprised of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Liquid hydrogen is cooled to -423 degrees Fahrenheit, and the liquid oxygen is cooled to -297 degrees Fahrenheit. Insulation protects the outside of the core stage from ice build-up resulting from the subzero propellants inside the aluminum walls. Insulation also reduces heat flow to the propellants, hardware and flight systems during launch and atmospheric re-entry. So, what kind of insulation materials can measure up for the world's most powerful rocket? Engineers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, are peeling back the layers to find out. "NASA has developed new, more environmentally friendly insulation materials for future launch vehicles," said Michael Frazier, nonmetallic materials branch chief at the Marshall Center. "The cryoinsulation materials for SLS are not only more environmentally compliant, but they are also just as efficient and lightweight as the previous generation of materials." Three types of foam have been developed and are being tested for SLS. The foams are all closed-cell materials, which means they are stronger and have greater resistance to heat flow and moisture. They also are non-ozone-depleting and flame resistant. The different types of insulation are applied by varying methods: automatically by a robot; manually using a hand-held spray system; and hand mixed for pouring into molds. "With some parts of the rocket being so massive, like the core stage, robotic applications help reduce time and manpower with more control and continuous sprays," said Amy Buck, SLS core stage insight lead. The thickness of the insulation varies depending on the hardware, but it is typically about one inch. Hundreds of 24-by-24-inch panels have been covered with the three types of foam for a variety of tests, which are being conducted by NASA and prime contractor Boeing, headquartered in Chicago, to qualify the insulation for the challenging environments SLS will experience before and during flight. Tests range from density measurements to exposing the foams to heating environments similar to those the SLS will see during ascent. Qualification testing of all the foam systems is anticipated to be completed later this year. At that point, the materials will be ready to use on Exploration Mission-1 in late 2018. "There are some follow-on aging tests that we will run over the next few years, but those are just being done to ensure we don't have any problems with long-term storage of the cured-foam products," Frazier said. So the next time you reach for a drink inside your cooler or shed the cold of winter in your home, think about another type of insulator that will be headed to deep space. The initial SLS configuration, known as Block 1, will have a minimum 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capability. The next planned upgrade of SLS, Block 1B, will use a more powerful exploration upper stage for more ambitious missions with a 105-metric-ton (115-ton) lift capacity. Block 2 will add a pair of advanced solid or liquid propellant boosters to provide a 130-metric-ton (143-ton) lift capacity. In each configuration, SLS will continue to use the same core stage and four RS-25 engines.

Nasa's Jeff Williams, 58, logged 534 days in space over four missions. The ISS commander landed at 7:13 local time (0113 GMT) on the steppes of central Kazakhstan aboard a Russian-made Soyuz capsule along with Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka. "Touchdown! Welcome home @Astro_Jeff, officially back on Earth after 172-day mission & total 534 days on 4 missions," Nasa tweeted. A Nasa live video feed showed Williams on the ground smiling and waving while talking on a satellite phone before being carried away for medical tests. The three men undocked from the ISS nearly three and a half hours earlier after spending their mission largely conducting scientific experiments.Williams performed five space walks, including one along with Nasa astronaut Kate Rubins to install a docking adapter for future commercial Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the space station. "Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft," Nasa said in a statement. He also helped set up an experimental temporary inflatable module designed by Bigelow Aerospace to test expandable habitats astronauts might use on the Moon or Mars in the coming decades. The retired Army colonel beat the previous US record set by astronaut Scott Kelly during his year in orbit. Kelly has 520 days in space over his career. Williams, a grandfather, is also the oldest American to spend live on the space station. Williams first blasted to space aboard the shuttle Atlantis in 2000. He returned to the International Space Station in 2006 when the space station was far smaller - with just two modules and three crew members - and again in 2009. Today, the ISS is staffed by six astronauts and cosmonauts and spans the size of a football field. Williams may hold the US record for time in orbit, but Russia's Gennady Padalka still holds the record for the person with the most cumulative days in space at 879.

QRZ Callsign Search  Page last updated on: Wednesday, September 7, 2016 NASA’s record-breaking astronaut, crewmates safely return to Earth NASA astronaut and Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams, KD5TVQ returned to Earth Tuesday after his U.S. record-breaking mission aboard the International Space Station. Williams and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, RN3FU, of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, landed in their Soyuz TMA-20M at 9:13 p.m. EDT southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan (7:13 a.m. Sept. 7, local time). Having completed his fourth mission, Williams now has spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. Skripochka now has 331 days in space on two flights, while Ovchinin spent 172 days in space on his first. “No other U.S. astronaut has Jeff’s time and experience aboard the International Space Station. From his first flight in 2000, when the station was still under construction, to present day where the focus is science, technology development and fostering commercialization. Jeff even helped prepare the space station for future dockings of commercial spacecraft under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program,” said Kirk Shireman, ISS Program manager at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. “We’re incredibly proud of what Jeff has accomplished off the Earth for the Earth.” Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins Aug. 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter’s main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. During his time on the orbital complex, Williams ventured outside the confines of the space station for a second spacewalk with Rubins to retract a spare thermal control radiator and install two new high-definition cameras.  Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity’s only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Williams was involved in the grapple of Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft in March, the company's fourth commercial resupply mission, and SpaceX’s eighth Dragon spacecraft cargo delivery in April, and welcomed a second Dragon delivery in July. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo craft also docked to the station in April and July delivering tons of supplies. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command. He, Rubins, and Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, will operate the station for more than two weeks until the arrival of three new crew members. Shane Kimbrough of NASA and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch Sept. 23, U.S. time, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.

By: Reuters | Beijing | Published:September 7, 2016 1:59 pm Passenger plane China’s long-delayed C919 jet may make its maiden flight by the end of this year, state-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) said on Wednesday. “We are working hard to achieve our maiden voyage by around the end of 2016,” Lu Zheng, COMAC’s deputy head of marketing, said at a press conference in Beijing. The C919 narrowbody jet is currently undergoing rigorous testing and is the first large-scale Chinese civilian plane developed in accordance with international test-flight standards, Lu said. China is keen to establish itself as a global supplier of aircraft and it hopes the C919 will compete with Boeing Co’s 737 and Airbus Group SE’s A320. It also plans to produce a larger widebody plane in a joint venture with Russia. However, it has been held back by inexperience, a shortage of local aerospace design and engineering talent, as well as a lack of home-grown companies with the technology to help drive the project, say aerospace industry sources familiar with its programmes. The challenges have led to multiple delays for the C919, as well as the ARJ-21 which made its maiden commercial flight in June.

 SpaceX and NASA have released full statements about Thursday's rocket explosion — here's what they said Dave Mosher Sep. 3, 2016, 11:45 AM 107,565 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, left, and the September 1 explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket, right, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Max Whitaker/Getty Images; USLaunchReport.com; Business Insider More than a day after the fiery explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket on a launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Florida, both SpaceX and NASA have issued full statements. The rocket catastrophically blew up at a launchpad called Space Launch Center 40 (SLC-40) at 9:07 a.m. on September 1, right before a routine engine-firing test. Although no one was hurt during the blast, Facebook's $200 million Amos-6 satellite — bound to provide internet service to the developing world — was utterly destroyed. The blast reportedly shattered windows nearby, knocked sliding doors off peoples' homes farther away, and was heard as far as 30 miles from SLC-40, according to local Florida TV stations. The cause of the mishap isn't known at this time, and experts say it will hamper the ambitious launch schedule planned by aerospace company, which is owned by entrepreneur Elon Musk. SpaceX's statement SpaceX's launch Pad 39A in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX/Flickr Business Insider contacted representatives at SpaceX about the nature of the explosion, damage to SLC-40, and the event's potential impact to the company's launch plans. After issuing brief statements through Twitter, they provided us with the full statement below on Friday evening, more than 33 hours after the blast. We've replaced instances of "anomaly" with "explosion" for easier reading and emphasized certain parts in bold: "SpaceX has begun the careful and deliberate process of understanding the causes and fixes for yesterday's incident. We will continue to provide regular updates on our progress and findings, to the fullest extent we can share publicly. "We deeply regret the loss of AMOS-6, and safely and reliably returning to flight to meet the demands of our customers is our chief priority. SpaceX's business is robust, with approximately 70 missions on our manifest worth over $10 billion. In the aftermath of yesterday's events, we are grateful for the continued support and unwavering confidence that our commercial customers as well as NASA and the United States Air Force have placed in us. "Overview of the incident: Yesterday, at SpaceX's Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, an [explosion] took place about eight minutes in advance of a scheduled test firing of a Falcon 9 rocket. The [explosion] on the pad resulted in the loss of the vehicle. This was part of a standard pre-launch static fire to demonstrate the health of the vehicle prior to an eventual launch. At the time of the loss, the launch vehicle was vertical and in the process of being fueled for the test. At this time, the data indicates the [explosion] originated around the upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Per standard operating procedure, all personnel were clear of the pad. There were no injuries. "To identify the root cause of the [explosion], SpaceX began its investigation immediately after the loss, consistent with accident investigation plans prepared for such a contingency. These plans include the preservation of all possible evidence and the assembly of an Accident Investigation Team, with oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration and participation by NASA, the United States Air Force and other industry experts. We are currently in the early process of reviewing approximately 3000 channels of telemetry and video data covering a time period of just 35-55 milliseconds. "As for the Launch Pad itself, our teams are now investigating the status of SLC-40. The pad clearly incurred damage, but the scope has yet to be fully determined. We will share more data as it becomes available. SpaceX currently operates 3 launch pads – 2 in Florida and 1 in California at Vandenberg Air Force Base. SpaceX's other launch sites were not affected by yesterday's events. Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base is in the final stages of an operational upgrade and Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center remains on schedule to be operational in November. Both pads are capable of supporting Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. We are confident the two launch pads can support our return to flight and fulfill our upcoming manifest needs. "Again, our number one priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, as well as to take all the necessary steps to ensure the highest possible levels of safety for future crewed missions with the Falcon 9. We will carefully and thoroughly investigate and address this issue." NASA's statement A model of SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which is designed to carry astronauts. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images We also contacted NASA about any potential disruptions to its Commercial Crew Program (CCP) through which SpaceX and Boeing are designing, building, and testing spacecraft to launch astronauts to the International Space Station. The ultimate goal of CCP is to replace the astronaut-launching ability of the Space Shuttle program, lost in mid-2011 — and prevent the space agency from having to pay Russia billions of dollars for the privilege. NASA spokesperson Tabatha Thompson told Business Insider on Friday evening (our emphasis added): "NASA remains confident in our commercial partners and in the goals of the Commercial Crew Program to take astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit. It is too early to know whether Thursday's incident will impact their development schedules. Spacecraft and launch vehicles designed for the Commercial Crew Program must meet NASA's stringent safety criteria before being certified to launch crews into space. Successfully meeting those requirements has always taken precedence over schedule. "Both companies working with the Commercial Crew Program are required to carry numerous additional safeguards including a launch abort system that can be activated while the rocket is still on the launch pad. Those systems must be proven in flight tests before NASA will certify them for missions carrying astronauts. SpaceX tested its launch abort system from the pad successfully in May 2015. Both SpaceX and Boeing plan to further test launch abort systems in 2017. "NASA and our partners remain committed to meeting the goals of the Commercial Crew Program." 'This will definitely affect their business' Space Launch Complex 40 in Cape Canaveral, Florida, prior to the September 1 Falcon 9 rocket explosion. SpaceX Although SpaceX is bullish about getting back to launching Falcon 9 rockets and its $10 billion worth of payloads, John M. Logsdon, a space-policy expert and historian at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, said there will be some kind of disruption. "This will definitely affect their business," Logsdon told Business Insider. "SpaceX had six more launches from [SLC-40] scheduled between now and January. They were going to launch one basically once a month, one every three and a half weeks." Beyond any deviations from its previous launch plans, Logsdon said Musk may have more immediate concerns. "You have to put this into the context of Mr. Musk's plans in about three weeks to announce his long-term strategy and approach to colonizing Mars," Logsdon said. "This is going to put a little tweak in the excitement surrounding that." Then again, says Logsdon, "we didn't stop going to the moon when we had early problems with Apollo."

The Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft carrying astronaut Jeff Williams of NASA and cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka of the Russian space agency Roscosmos landed near the town of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. Veteran NASA astronaut Williams has now spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. "From his first flight in 2000, when the station was still under construction, to present day where the focus is science, technology development and fostering commercialisation, Williams even helped prepare the space station for future dockings of commercial spacecraft under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme," said Kirk Shireman, ISS programme manager at NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston. "We're incredibly proud of what Williams has accomplished off the Earth for the Earth," he added. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins on August 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter's main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity's only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command until the arrival of three new crew members. Shane Kimbrough of NASA and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on September 23. --IANS na/ksk Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Demonetisation: Get Rs 2,000 cash at petrol pumps from Nov 18 ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready More trouble ahead as Tata Trusts get I-T summons for tax avoidance Modus Operandi: How black money hoarders are trying to escape I-T lens Ratan Tata should step down for crisis to abate: 6 suggestions from NYU's Damodaran More From Current Affairs Senior UP official injured in Expressway crash Morocco to support Fiji in organising COP23 Our railway budgets aim development, not politics: PM Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh calls for scrapping income tax Demonetisation main issue in Bengal by-polls [ more ] Top Stories No note exchange at banks tomorrow; senior citizens exempted Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready Bajaj commences production of 400-cc bike from Chakan plant Demonetisation: Govt may do away with cash exchange gradually [ more ] Markets MCX to levy concentration margin from December Gold quotes at huge discount, price hits 4-month low Diamond exporters eye 8-10% rise in exports in coming quarter Nifty nears 6-month low, Sensex ends 77 points lower Vakrangee, Oil India, Engineers India, Infibeam Incorporation hit 52-week high [ more ] Companies Vikram Johri: Lessons from a scandal Bajaj commences production of 400-cc bike from Chakan plant Natco plans to double drug filings next year Infosys invests Rs 14.5 crore in Danish artificial intelligence start-up No Indian Pharma company in world Access to Medicine Index [ more ] Opinion Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance Why Gruh Finance isn't a top pick among analysts anymore?

"We are working hard to achieve our maiden voyage by around the end of 2016," Lu Zheng, COMAC's deputy head of marketing, said at a press conference in Beijing. The C919 narrowbody jet is currently undergoing rigorous testing and is the first large-scale Chinese civilian plane developed in accordance with international test-flight standards, Lu said. China is keen to establish itself as a global supplier of aircraft and it hopes the C919 will compete with Boeing Co's 737 and Airbus Group SE's A320. It also plans to produce a larger widebody plane in a joint venture with Russia. However, it has been held back by inexperience, a shortage of local aerospace design and engineering talent, as well as a lack of home-grown companies with the technology to help drive the project, say aerospace industry sources familiar with its programmes. The challenges have led to multiple delays for the C919, as well as the ARJ-21 which made its maiden commercial flight in June.

A recent report by NASA's chief watchdog raised new doubts about the readiness of contractors to deliver astronauts to space, even before Thursday's explosion of a SpaceX rocket. Any further delay, NASA's Inspector General found, could mean a continued reliance on Russia to deliver American astronauts to space, a ferry ride that has been growing steadily more expensive. Since the last shuttle mission blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center in 2011, NASA's astronauts have had to hitch rides to the International Space Station with Russia, the country America bested in the Cold War race to the moon. That has come with a pricetag that grew precipitously after the shuttle was retired in 2011. A report issued this week by NASA's Inspector General found the cost Russia charged to ferry U.S. astronauts jumped 384 percent over the last decade, growing from $21.3 million in 2006 to $81.9 million last year. Before the shuttle was retired, Russia kept its costs relatively consistent, with the prices growing modestly, the report found. But after the United Space couldn't get to space on its own, the prices jumped from an average of $26.4 million a seat in 2010 to $51 million in 2012. In all, the U.S. has paid Russia $3.4 billion for rides on its Soyuz rocket, and the IG said NASA could have saved $1 billion of that if it had met its original goal of flying human missions in 2015. The agency's watchdog said that Russia will rake in even more taxpayer money if there are additional delays to NASA's efforts to fly again from U.S. soil. In 2014, NASA awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to fly its astronauts to the station. But the so-called “commercial crew” program is facing delays, the IG found, so that “NASA may need to buy additional seats from Russia to ensure a continued U.S. presence” on the space station. The report was written before SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket blew up as it sat on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Thursday. It's unclear whether that failure will contribute to any delays in the commercial crew program. But it was the second time one of SpaceX's rockets has blown up in the last 15 months, raising concerns about its ability to fly people safely and whether it will be able to meet its timeline. NASA has stood by SpaceX through both failures, saying it recovered quickly after the first. And on Thursday agency officials said they “remain confident in our commercial partners.” In its report, the IG noted that SpaceX did not think its first failure, which happened in June 2015 on a mission to resupply with space station with $118 million worth of cargo, would cause a delay in the commercial crew program. The company said “it had built sufficient margin into the schedule,” according to the report. But it also said SpaceX “noted the lack of margin remaining to accommodate any additional unexpected issues that may arise.” The report was released on the same day SpaceX's rocket exploded. Boeing has already said it would have to push back its first crewed flights to early 2018. SpaceX has maintained that it would fly by the end of 2017. But the IG investigators weren't buying either of those timetables: “Notwithstanding the contractors' optimism, based on the information we gathered during our audit, we believe it unlikely that either Boeing or SpaceX will achieve certified, crewed flight to the ISS until late 2018.” More Nation Winter weather to move in across U.S. Trump taps Sessions, Flynn, Pompeo for top positions Cozy retirement?

April this year was hottest on record: NASA Venus may have once been habitable: NASA NASA makes 56 patents free for commercial use An American astronaut who set the US record for cumulative time in orbit safely returned to Earth today along with two Russian cosmonauts after a six-month mission aboard the International Space Station. NASA's Jeff Williams, 58, logged 534 days in space over four missions. The ISS commander landed at 7:13 local time on the steppes of central Kazakhstan aboard a Russian-made Soyuz capsule along with Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka. "Touchdown! Welcome home @Astro_Jeff, officially back on Earth after 172-day mission & total 534 days on 4 missions," NASA tweeted. A NASA live video feed showed Williams on the ground smiling and waving while talking on a satellite phone before being carried away for medical tests. The three men undocked from the ISS nearly three and a half hours earlier after spending their mission largely conducting scientific experiments. Williams performed five space walks, including one along with NASA astronaut Kate Rubins to install a docking adapter for future commercial Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the space station. "Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft," NASA said in a statement. He also helped set up an experimental temporary inflatable module designed by Bigelow Aerospace to test expandable habitats astronauts might use on the Moon or Mars in the coming decades. The retired Army colonel beat the previous US record set by astronaut Scott Kelly during his year in orbit. Kelly has 520 days in space over his career. Williams, a grandfather, is also the oldest American to spend live on the space station. Williams first blasted to space aboard the shuttle Atlantis in 2000. He returned to the International Space Station in 2006 when the space station was far smaller -- with just two modules and three crew members -- and again in 2009. Today, the ISS is staffed by six astronauts and cosmonauts and spans the size of a football field. Williams may hold the US record for time in orbit, but Russia's Gennady Padalka still holds the record for the person with the most cumulative days in space at 879.

The Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft carrying astronaut Jeff Williams of NASA and cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka of the Russian space agency Roscosmos landed near the town of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan. Veteran NASA astronaut Williams has now spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. "From his first flight in 2000, when the station was still under construction, to present day where the focus is science, technology development and fostering commercialisation, Williams even helped prepare the space station for future dockings of commercial spacecraft under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme," said Kirk Shireman, ISS programme manager at NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston. "We're incredibly proud of what Williams has accomplished off the Earth for the Earth," he added. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins on August 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter's main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity's only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command until the arrival of three new crew members. Shane Kimbrough of NASA and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on September 23.

The deal is the latest move by Vietnamese aviation giants to boost fleets and feed demand from a mushrooming middle class with money to burn on air travel both at home and abroad. Hollande, the third French president to visit Vietnam since independence, said the “very important deals” deepened ties with its former colony where France’s legacy is ubiquitous, from the country’s colonial-era buildings to French-influenced cuisine. “We agreed to encourage both countries to establish economic partnerships on the basis of technology transfer,” Hollande said after Airbus signed three separate deals. Low-cost private airline VietJet, known for its bikini-clad hostesses, bought 20 planes while national carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Jetstar Pacific bought 10 each in “deals worth $6.5 billion”, Airbus Asia spokesman Sean Lee said. He did not provide a breakdown of each deal’s value, but VietJet said later in a statement it was spending $2.39 billion on its new planes. The VietJet purchase comes after it bought 100 passenger jets from US aircraft maker Boeing for $11.3 billion in May, during a visit by President Barack Obama. It called the deal the largest single commercial air plane purchase in Vietnam aviation history. Founded in 2007, VietJet has gained notoriety with bikini-wearing air stewardesses and along with Vietnam Airlines and Jetstar is making a major move into the lucrative Southeast Asian aviation sector. Hollande, who arrived in Vietnam with around 40 French business leaders, will spend much of Tuesday in Hanoi meeting communist top brass. — AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← JBS CEO ordered to step aside in Brazil pension fund probe Bayer raises offer to buy Monsanto → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Fed’s Yellen vows to serve out term, signals rate hike Saudi visa fees no deterrent to investors Iraq’s oil contracts make joining Opec output cut more painful Euro slips below $1.0620 to lowest level since Dec 3 Read More ...

Williams and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, landed in their Soyuz TMA-20M at 9:13 p.m. EDT southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan (7:13 a.m.Sept. 7, local time). Having completed his fourth mission, Williams now has spent 534 days in space, making him first on the all-time NASA astronaut list. Skripochka now has 331 days in space on two flights, while Ovchinin spent 172 days in space on his first. "No other U.S. astronaut has Jeff's time and experience aboard the International Space Station. From his first flight in 2000, when the station was still under construction, to present day where the focus is science, technology development and fostering commercialization. Jeff even helped prepare the space station for future dockings of commercial spacecraft under NASA's Commercial Crew Program," said Kirk Shireman, ISS Program manager at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. "We're incredibly proud of what Jeff has accomplished off the Earth for the Earth." Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. The first International Docking Adapter was installed during a spacewalk by Williams and fellow NASA astronaut Kate Rubins Aug. 19. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter's main purpose is to connect spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, now in development in partnership with NASA. During his time on the orbital complex, Williams ventured outside the confines of the space station for a second spacewalk with Rubins to retract a spare thermal control radiator and install two new high-definition cameras.  Together, the Expedition 48 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard humanity's only orbiting laboratory. The crew members also welcomed five cargo spacecraft during their stay. Williams was involved in the grapple of Orbital ATK's Cygnus spacecraft in March, the company's fourth commercial resupply mission, and SpaceX's eighth Dragon spacecraft cargo delivery in April, and welcomed a second Dragon delivery in July. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo craft also docked to the station in April and July delivering tons of supplies. Expedition 49 continues operating the station with Anatoly Ivanishin of Roscosmos in command. He, Rubins, and Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, will operate the station for more than two weeks until the arrival of three new crew members. Shane Kimbrough of NASA and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch Sept. 23, U.S. time, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.

(Credit: Reuters)  Three space explorers, including NASA's most experienced astronaut, have landed safely back on Earth after spending six months in space. NASA's Jeff Williams and cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka of Russian space agency Roscosmos landed the Soyuz TMA-20M spacecraft in Kazakhstan at 9:13pm (local time). Russian recovery teams helped the crew exit as they adjusted to gravity back on land after spending the past six months in space. External Link: NASA tweets: Welcome home @Astro_Jeff NASA broadcast the landing live from the moment the trio disconnected from the International Space Station (ISS) to their descent to Earth. The mission was Mr Williams' fourth trip to the ISS, allowing him to accrue 534 days in space — the most by any US astronaut in history. Mr Williams was instrumental in preparing the station for the future arrival of US commercial crew spacecraft, NASA said. The space juggernaut also sung Mr Williams' praises for his role in installing the first ISS docking adapter in August, during a six-hour spacewalk. Described as a "parking spot for spacecraft" the installation will allow more astronauts to travel to the ISS. The first users are expected to be Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft.

All funds raised go directly to the CentralFlorida STEM Education Council (CFSEC). The Council strives to develop a unified STEM program to include mass communication, mentorships, and resources for parents, students, and educators.The tournament is a casual family-friendly fun-filled 9-hole event open to all skill levels. This year's goal is to raise $20,000. In 2012, DiSTI turned their company team-building golf event into an annual charity fund raiser for the CFSEC. The 2015 event raised $14,000 bringing the total contribution amount to nearly $30,000 for K-12 STEM activities, camps, and scholarships in Central Florida. Since 2014, the Duffer has helped fund 118 teachers from five Central Florida Counties to attend the STEM Teacher Workshop held annually at the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation, and Education Conference (I/ITSEC). Teachers work on several hands-on projects and listen to NASA engineers speak about engineering design challenges. Duffer funds also support the U.S. Army PEO STRI High School Engineering Internship that introduces students to the concepts of technical evaluations and program management through building of the SeaPerch underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). The funds help the camp buy the robot kits. Over the past two years, the DiSTI Duffer has contributed $5,900 towards the YMCA of Central Florida Summer Zone Scholarship Program. This equates to paying for more than 130 weeks of Summer Zone registrations. "The DiSTI Duffer tournament has played a huge role in making sure that ALL students can get involved with STEM programming, no matter their financial situation," said Cory Johns, Executive Director, YMCA of Central Florida. "There's no doubt, that this year's contribution from the DiSTI Duffer will have a DIRECT impact on our Central Florida youth and our Y Family could not be more appreciative." DiSTI invites the public to donate, sponsor, and/or play in the tournament to support the growth and development of STEM education within the Central Florida community. No experience is necessary.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Austrian steel firm Voestalpine targets more savings in tough market By Reuters Published: 09:37 EST, 8 September 2016 | Updated: 09:37 EST, 8 September 2016 e-mail By Kirsti Knolle and Alexandra Schwarz-Goerlich VIENNA, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Austrian specialty steel maker Voestalpine plans further efficiencies to make sure it hits mid-term targets in a tough trading environment, its chief executive told Reuters. The new programme will be for several hundred million euros and focus on improving operations rather than restructuring, Wolfgang Eder said on Thursday. Voestalpine's current 1 billion euro efficiency programme runs out at the end of the business year in March. "There will be a follow-up package for sure," Eder said. The Linz-based group, which like rivals is adjusting to sharp commodity price falls, sector overcapacity and tough global competition, aims to increase revenues by more than a third to 15 billion euros ($17 billion) and its operational (EBIT) margin by 1 percentage point to 9 percent until 2020. Eder said July figures made him feel confident that Voestalpine's traditional weak second quarter results were at least on the same level or even better as in the previous April-June period. Eder confirmed the group's target of reaching full-year EBIT close to last year's 888.8 million euros. In response to a global steel glut, Voestalpine has changed its focus from pure steel making towards offering higher value specialised products. It has been investing heavily in new production sites and now makes finished parts for the automotive, aerospace and rail industries. Its products can be found in Volkswagen cars, Airbus planes and in switches for high-speed trains. Traditional steel generates about 30 percent of revenue and as prices did not drop but stabilised after the summer period for the first time in five years, there was good reason to hope for "a further steel price increase in autumn", Eder said. The CEO, who also heads the World Steel Association, said discussions with clients in several industries had encouraged him in his assessment. Eder also voiced cautious optimism regarding oil and gas prices. "We will see the bottom in demand and in prices in the second half of our business year," he said, adding it would be too early to bet on a significant increase in demand from customers in the oil and gas industry. Talks in Voestalpine's divisions about savings potentials have started and will be finished in February. One focus of the new programme were newly opened plants, which could be operated more efficiently than anticipated. Voestalpine plans to invest around 1.1 billion euros in the current business year, a large part of which will be spent on new plants to serve automobile and rail customers while about 200 to 300 million euros will be reserved for acquisitions. Aviation was one interesting sector for potential takeovers to expand services for plane makers like Boeing, but in an era of low interest rates, only family-run businesses were affordable for Voestalpine because - unlike financial investors - it had to follow economic criteria.

 US-Russian crew safely lands on Earth after months in space Rebecca Harrington Sep. 6, 2016, 10:20 PM 4,848 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Soyuz capsule carrying NASA astronaut Jeff Williams and Russia's Roscosmos cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka floats down from the International Space Station to Earth on September 6 ET. Bill Ingalls/NASA A US astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts strapped themselves inside a Russian Soyuz capsule and flew away from the International Space Station, landing just after sunrise in Kazakhstan. Station commander Jeff Williams, with NASA, and flight engineers Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, both with Russia's Roscosmos agency, pulled away from the station at 5:51 p.m. ET Tuesday as the ships sailed 258 miles over eastern Mongolia, said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. "I will certainly miss this view!" Williams wrote on Twitter earlier on Tuesday, posting a picture of sunlight glinting off the planet. "Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family." I will certainly miss this view! Vast gratitude toward my crewmates, ground teams, supporting friends, and family. pic.twitter.com/op9vFyWSFT — Jeff Williams (@Astro_Jeff) September 6, 2016 Right on the 'bullseye' The Soyuz capsule carrying NASA astronaut Jeff Williams and Russia's Roscosmos cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka lands just after sunrise in Kazakhstan. Bill Ingalls/NASA There's always a chance something can go (terribly) wrong during a spacecraft landing, but Tuesday night's was right on the "bullseye," NASA's Dan Huot said in a phone call on the livestream from Kazakhstan. The gumdrop-shaped capsule undocked from the ISS at 8:02 p.m. ET, starting an approximately three-hour descent. A couple hours after undocking, the capsule fired its thrusters to fall out of orbit. When it reached 400,000 feet above the Earth, the planet's atmosphere drastically slowed down the Soyuz — from about 17,250 mph to less than 600 mph. Around 9 p.m. ET, the parachutes deployed and further reduced the Soyuz's speed from about 515 mph to roughly 7 mph. Two different views of Soyuz parachuting to a landing just seconds away from touchdown. https://t.co/C7LVQGQ6Xn pic.twitter.com/gAO5LDOb7y — Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) September 7, 2016 A quick engine burst then safely landed the capsule near the Kazakh city of Zhezkazgan at 7:13 a.m. local time on Wednesday, which was 9:13 p.m. Tuesday on the East Coast. The Soyuz landed on its side, but that actually made hauling the astronauts out of the spaceship a little easier. Astronauts are typically a little weak and woozy after returning from the microgravity of the ISS and after pulling so many G-forces upon their return, so they usually need help getting out of the car-sized capsule. Doctors are always on hand to evaluate them once they get out. NASA astronaut Jeff Williams (left) and Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin (R) relax after a textbook landing. NASA A record-breaking mission The mission comes the same day a US space probe was cleared for launch on Thursday to collect and return samples from an asteroid in hopes of learning more about the origins of life on Earth and perhaps elsewhere in the solar system, NASA said. Williams, 58, returns to Earth with a career total of 534 days in orbit, more time than any other astronaut in US history and 14th in the world. Welcome home! @Astro_Jeff returned to Earth after US record-breaking @Space_Station mission: https://t.co/DWsir5wsiH pic.twitter.com/aizcDNMGNP — NASA (@NASA) September 7, 2016 The Russians remain champions of long-duration spaceflight, with cosmonaut Gennady Padalka currently the world record-holder with 878 days in space over five missions. Before leaving the station, Williams turned over command of the $100 billion outpost, a project of 15 nations, to cosmonaut Anatoly Ivanishin, who remains aboard the station with NASA astronaut Kate Rubins and Japan's Takuya Onishi. "We'll be missing you here," Ivanishin said during a change-of-command ceremony on Monday. "Have fun riding though the atmosphere ... and have a very safe and exceptionally soft landing." A replacement crew is due to launch on Sept. 23 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. A high price tag The US is paying Russia around $70 million to get Williams home. That's how much it costs to send one NASA astronaut to and from the space station now, according to a new report that NASA's Office of Inspector General released on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016. How much NASA will pay Russia to send US astronauts into space from 2006 through 2018. The cost has increased 372% in 10 years. Skye Gould/Business Insider Thursday also happened to be the day that an unmanned SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launch pad just before a routine test. SpaceX and Boeing are both trying to prove they can launch NASA atronauts from American soil again, but they are at least three years behind schedule, according to the report. The US has had to rely on Russia to ferry our astronauts to and from the floating research lab ever since NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011. Obviously, explosions like SpaceX's could further delay matters, though NASA told Business Insider it was "too early to tell whether Thursday's incident will impact their development schedules." The cost-per-seat should be about $58 million once SpaceX and Boeing develop their astronaut-ready spaceships, Business Insider's Dave Mosher reports. That's still a high price tag, but at least it would be going to American companies instead of a foreign government. Reuters contributed reporting.
