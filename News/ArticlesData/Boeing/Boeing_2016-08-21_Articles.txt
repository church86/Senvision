Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other NASA classes MMOD as primary threat to commercial crew vehicles August 22, 2016 by Chris Bergin NASA has claimed the threat of MicroMeteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) – small pieces of space debris capable of punching bullet hole wounds into spacecraft – is the “primary” threat to the safety of Commercial Crew vehicles. The claim was made as the Agency works on closing the gap between the current analysis of the Loss Of Crew (LOC) numbers with the Program’s goal. Commercial Crew Advancing: NASA’s latest status overview of its Commercial Crew Program was provided to the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) during its recent meeting at NASA’s Headquarters in Washington DC. The meeting saw the chair of the panel change hands, with VADM (Ret.) Joseph Dyer handing over the reins to Dr. Patricia Sanders. The ASAP is NASA’s primary oversight body focused on crew safety. It was particularly outspoken during the Shuttle extension debate and was actively opposed to any additional missions past Atlantis’ STS-135 swansong. See Also CCP Vehicles Section L2 SpaceX Section L2 CCP Section Click here to Join L2 Since the Shuttle’s retirement, the ASAP has refocused its attention on NASA’s current and future programs involving astronauts, namely the International Space Station and the missions involving Orion and the Space Launch System (SLS), all while playing an active role in the formulation of certification plans for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The panel was skeptical of the link up between NASA and commercial providers during the early days of CCP. However, its opinion has since thawed, not least following the observation of the progress being made between NASA and its commercial partners on elements such as transparency and data sharing – and is on “a trend that the panel appreciates”. The latest CCP status update was provided to the ASAP by Kathy Lueders, CCP Program Manager, focusing on the two vehicles – SpaceX’s Dragon 2 and Boeing’s Starliner (CST-100) – that will be tasked with launching NASA astronauts to the ISS. “Both providers are working to the schedule, which is challenging. The next year or so will be a defining moment,” noted the minutes from Ms Lueders’ overview. “The Program is about to enter the hardware testing phase. At this point, the providers are tracking to schedule and making significant progress.” While the ASAP will have been pleased by the report card, the panel’s gaze is mainly fixated on paper elements such as programmatic risks. This includes areas such as “requirements changes” where commercial companies attempt to find a “commonality of process” within NASA’s strict rule book. Both SpaceX and Boeing have proposed changes to NASA’s “standards and policies” – although no examples were cited to the ASAP. However, the CCP overview noted the requests are currently being evaluated by NASA. The other item of interest is also related to requirements, with NASA’s standards for crew safety working via a probability matrix known as the LOV/C (Loss Of Vehicle/Crew) ratio. LOV/C is a product of the Shuttle era, where a number of LOV scenarios resulted in a “no win” situation for the crew, equating to a LOV/C. In a number of cases, that was the fault of the vehicle’s design, such as the lack of crew escape options during key phases of the mission. Shuttle had improved its rating via the post-Return To Flight (RTF) modifications, allowing for a LOC ratio of “about 1 in 90”. Although the vehicle’s safety was improved throughout the final flights, the options for saving the crew – such as ISS “Safe Haven” – helped improve the LOC ratio. For the new breed of vehicles, a number of the Shuttle-style threats have been removed, not least during launch. Should a commercial crew launch vehicle, or indeed SLS, suffer a major issue during ascent, the crew will be pulled free of the failure by the Launch Abort System (LAS) on the crew vehicle. Ascent and re-entry/landing were two of the three major LOC threats for the Space Shuttle. The third, however, will remain a threat for the commercial crew vehicles, along with Orion and any spacefaring vehicle. That threat is MicroMeteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) – the unseen threat that all spacecraft need to be protected from, not least because they are impossible to track and thus avoid. This is in contrast to the larger debris threats that the ISS can dodge via a Debris Avoidance Maneuver (DAM). Impacts from MMOD strikes are usually noticed when they strike areas such as windows of the spacecraft. Such strikes were observed on a large amount of Space Shuttle missions, especially late into the mission when the orbiter had undocked from the protection of the ISS and was preparing to head home. Although spacecraft are designed with a level of protection from such impacts, MMOD was the third biggest threat to losing an orbiter during her mission – second only to launch and re-entry. With the improvements to crew launch via the new era of vehicles, launch and landing are not close to the Shuttle’s danger levels. During the Space Shuttle era, all of the orbiters would receive flesh wounds from MMOD strikes. The most serious event was during STS-109 when a small piece of debris was lodged in Columbia’s coolant loop 2 and restricted the flow of Freon-22 in that coolant loop. While the option for an immediate return to Earth was discussed, mission managers opted to press on with what was a successful flight. Atlantis and Endeavour both suffered “bullet hole” impacts to their radiators, with Atlantis’ damage sustained when she was hit by a tiny piece of circuit board on orbit – likely from a destroyed satellite. The damage held no mission impact and was only noticed once she had returned home and was in post-flight processing inside her Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) Extensive evaluations took place ahead of each shuttle mission, not least Atlantis’ STS-125 flight into space, a mission that provided one final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. This mission held the largest risk to the orbiter, given it was the only post Return To Flight mission that did not have the “safe haven” option of docking with the ISS, ahead of a rescue orbiter being flown to pick up the crew. STS-125 would also see an increase in the concentration of MMOD, due to the region of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Atlantis flew in for the majority of her mission. The Program Requirements Control Board (PRCB) results – which took into account satellite breakups and a variety of other components evaluated to be in Atlantis’ orbital neighborhood – showed that the overall risk of a Loss Of Vehicle and Crew (LOC/V) scenario due to MMOD impact(s) to the Thermal Protect System (TPS) was 1 in 185, with an error factor of 1.35 based on MMOD distribution, velocity, and density uncertainties. As noted, most of the risk was associated with impacts on the TPS, as opposed to the windows. In the end, Atlantis completed her mission successfully and without any major MMOD concerns. Data has already been gained on the Orion spacecraft’s performance, via the Exploration Flight Test -1 (EFT-1) mission. The review of Orion’s TPS did show a slightly higher than predicted level of MMOD impacts to the outer shell of the vehicle. This was based on computational predictions and post-flight inspections. However, being a test flight, engineers have taken lessons learned and have already been applying them to the Exploration Mission -1 (EM-1) Orion, with further refinements to the TPS and outer shell of the vehicle. EM-1 will also be an uncrewed flight, allowing for more refinements head of EM-2 in the 2020s. MMOD also played a role in dismissing a level of post-Shuttle bravado from the Constellation Program (CxP), which was quick to boast the crews of Orion – launching on the Ares I rocket – would enjoy a LOC of 1 in 1000, based on a 2005 study. However, as the Constellation system design process began and the program started looking at hazards and threats, they found that 1 in 1000 was going to be an impossible number to meet, not least due to MMOD threats. The LOC was reduced to 1 in 270 – or three times better than Shuttle at end-of-life – which was still thought to be an exaggeration by the ASAP. However, it was used as a benchmark for the Commercial Crew vehicles, to “ensure an even playing field.” “NASA needs to be careful as it picks what the controls will be and to be smart about how to make up the gap,” noted the ASAP last year. “Bottom line, there is still a 1 in 270 requirement; some of that has been allocated to the contractors and some to the Program.” It is understood both Dragon 2 and Starliner – designed to be extremely safe vehicles – have yet to satisfy NASA on the LOC ratio, again due to the factors surrounding MMOD. “(There is an) effort involved with closing the Loss of Crew (LOC) gap between what the Program goal is and what the current analysis indicates that the systems will achieve,” noted the minutes from the ASAP meeting during which Ms. Lueders was speaking. “The primary threat to both vehicles is MMOD damage for the long-duration time in orbit.” However, there are factors that can help the MMOD threat numbers, such as the period in which the vehicles will be docked with the ISS. As seen with the recent addition of the new International Docking Adaptor (IDA-2), in the same port the Space Shuttle utilized, the Station can provide a level of protection from MMOD strikes, with the structure of the Station in the direction of travel, effectively providing a shield to vehicles docked to the US segment. The main challenge will be at the beginning and end of missions, where the spacecraft are alone on orbit. While Starliner has yet to fly in space, some data will have been gained from the cargo version of Dragon during her missions to the Station, albeit with a different OML (Outer Mold Line). The key will be to refine the MMOD threat data, which is based on historical flight information and may be – due to NASA requirements – overly conservative. “The MMOD damage analysis depends on the modeling of the environment, which is in many aspects speculative and quite robust,” added the minutes. “There are discussions regarding gathering additional historical information to determine if the environmental model is perhaps too robust. All answers are yet to be determined.” (Images: NASA, L2 Shuttle and numerous L2 Renderings by Nathan Koga.

Delta will begin offering service Oct. 4 between Cedar Rapids and Atlanta on the 110-seat aircraft. George C. Ford The Gazette More stories from George Aug 22, 2016 at 2:44 pm | Print View CEDAR RAPIDS — Delta Air Lines will operate a 110-seat Boeing 717 airliner between Cedar Rapids and Atlanta on daily flights beginning Oct. 4. The service will bring “mainline” service operated by a major airline back to The Eastern Iowa Airport. “It will be morning-originating flight and then come back in the evening for the aircraft to spend the night in Cedar Rapids,” Airport Director Marty Lenss said. “That two-a-day pattern will continue through the fall and winter. We are optimistic that we will get back to our seasonal three-a-day service during the summer.” The Delta flights will be the first mainline service to the Cedar Rapids airport since 2005 when United Airlines transitioned to regional partners providing air service. The Cedar Rapids Airport Commission on Monday ratified an agreement with the Iowa Department of Transportation that will provide up to $25,000 to market the new Delta flights. The airport will be required to match the IDOT Air Service Development Program funding. Delta Connections carriers primarily have been using 65-seat regional jets for flights between Cedar Rapids and Atlanta. Lenss said the larger Boeing 717s will increase the number of available seats by 480 each week, offer more first-class seating and larger overhead bins for carry-on luggage. “It’s a great investment by Delta in the Corridor,” Lenss said. “We will need to fill those seats, but the market has been performing well for Delta. That’s why they are making this additional investment.” The Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport competes with Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, N.C., Lenss said. American Airlines announced plans in July to offer two daily, nonstop flights from Cedar Rapids to Charlotte beginning Nov. 4. Both airports offer hundreds of connecting flights to North American and international destinations. “I haven’t had any conversations with American or Delta, but it certainly looks like a competitive response,” Lenss said.

In March, defense contractor Boeing unveiled its 51-foot unmanned submersible, the Echo Voyager, designed to perform reconnaissance missions. © Sputnik/ Ministry of defence of the Russian Federation Hydrogen Fuel Cells Being Developed to Power Underwater US Navy Drones "Echo Voyager is a new approach to how unmanned undersea vehicles will operate and be used in the future," Boeing Phantom Works president Darryl Davis said in a statement. This fall, the unmanned vessel will begin sea trials, as part of the Pentagon’s effort to maintain its presence in the Pacific. "As tensions continue to grow with China and Russia, two militaries that have sophisticated and very large navies, there is a growing interest in making use of unmanned technology in the maritime sphere," said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College, according to Stars and Stripes. "They are scalable, they are dependable, they can operate with a fairly high degree of autonomy. All these things would have been useful 30 years ago, but the technology wasn’t quite there." © YouTube/Saab AB Underwater Mine Hunting Drone Starts Tests With US Agencies The Navy has proposed $319 million for the coming fiscal year to develop drone submersibles. In addition to Echo Voyager, the Pentagon is perfecting the larger Sea Hunter, an unmanned submarine designed to identify and track enemy vessels. Developers must overcome hurdles unique to underwater drones, however. Transmitting data is more difficult for a submersible than a UAV, and storms can force some models to remain in port. Relying on a hybrid electric-diesel battery and marine-diesel system, Echo Voyager can remain submerged for months at a time, avoiding inclement weather, surfacing periodically to charge its battery. During this time, it can transmit data to relay satellites. © Flickr/ Konny Zürcher Russian Navy to Showcase Modern Robotic Systems at Army-2016 Forum - Defense Ministry Boeing vessels also feature a certain degree of autonomy, with onboard sonar sensors and radar. While this helps cut down on personnel cost, it also comes with its own set of challenges. "The autonomy side of the equation, the research is happening at a very quick pace," Michel said. "But as you see time and time again, it’s very challenging to make unmanned systems that can make intelligent and dependable decisions on their own." Still, with a number of defense and commercial companies pursuing the technology, it’s only a matter of time before underwater drones become just as common as their aerial cousins. ...

SHARC has the Boeing technology/sensors on it that make applicable to defense missions. (Boeing) LOS ANGELES (Los Angeles Times/TNS) - This fall, an unusual vessel will begin sea trials off the coast of California. The 51-foot-long Boeing Echo Voyager will have no crew. It will glide underwater for days or weeks, quietly collecting data from the ocean floor to send back to crews on ships or on land. Ever since the start of the war in Afghanistan in 2001, the U.S. military has relied more and more on flying drones to take on dangerous air missions. But increasingly, drones are taking to the sea as well. The U.S. Navy has proposed about $319 million for the development and purchase of underwater drones in the president’s budget for the coming fiscal year. It envisions them stealthily gathering intelligence on opponents, detecting and neutralizing mines, hunting submarines and charting the ocean floor. Last year, the Navy created the first deputy assistant secretary position focused on managing the development of unmanned systems, including underwater, surface and aerial efforts. Recent advances in autonomy, data transmission and miniaturized computing power coincide with the military’s increased interest in finding ways to integrate unmanned systems into its war planning. It’s part of a much broader strategy to leverage artificial intelligence and stay one step ahead of rivals, as the Pentagon did with guided weapons in the 1990s. “As tensions continue to grow with China and Russia, two militaries that have sophisticated and very large navies, there is a growing interest in making use of unmanned technology in the maritime sphere,” said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. “They are scalable, they are dependable, they can operate with a fairly high degree of autonomy,” he said. “All these things would have been useful 30 years ago, but the technology wasn’t quite there.” The potential for naval drones to operate free of human operators was shown this year when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency unveiled its Sea Hunter, a largely autonomous, unmanned anti-submarine vessel. The prototype 132-foot-long Sea Hunter is designed to sail on its own for as long as three months, find a submarine using sonar and other sensors and trail it while sending location data to human operators. The vessel completed its first performance trials off San Diego in late July, its builder, Reston, Va., company Leidos said. Underwater drones face different challenges than their aerial counterparts. For one, communication is more difficult, making it hard for an autonomous vehicle to report information it might pick up underwater. That hurdle is being worked on by Liquid Robotics, a Sunnyvale, Calif., firm that makes the Wave Glider. The unmanned vehicle floats on the surface and uses wave and solar power to propel itself and its sensors for as long as a year. The surfboard-shaped drone functions as a kind of gateway between underwater acoustic communications and air-based radio transmissions. The vehicle’s sensor computer connects a surface radio modem and antenna with an underwater acoustic modem, allowing information to be transmitted quickly back and forth. The same connection can be established with ships, though that can be expensive, or with buoys, which don’t allow for much movement. Other underwater vehicles have towed long antennas, but that is a much slower method of transmitting data, said Graham Hine, senior vice president of global partner development at Liquid Robotics. “We’re thinking it would be the router of the ocean,” he said. “Once you start to network things and then have ubiquitous communications and positioning, things start to get interesting.” The Wave Glider can carry a range of acoustic sensors that listen for vessels on the sea or piece together a picture of the ocean floor. Originally developed by company co-founders Roger Hine and Joseph Rizzi to listen to whale songs, the Wave Glider caught the interest of the Navy, which has worked with the company since 2008, Graham Hine said. Two years ago, the company struck a partnership with Boeing Co. to develop a military version, the Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft, or SHARC, that combines the Wave Glider platform with Boeing’s sensor technology. Boeing sees the platform as a potential communication conduit between underwater vehicles and aircraft, ships or satellites. It is working with the Navy’s research lab to develop additional capabilities for SHARC. “Ultimately, it is a more efficient and effective way to do maritime surveillance, we think, in large ocean areas,” said Egan Greenstein, senior director of autonomous maritime systems at Boeing. But to do a thorough job of surveillance and undersea data collection, drones need to stay submerged for weeks or even months without external help or power. In March, Boeing unveiled the 50-ton Echo Voyager, which is designed to carry out months-long surveillance and reconnaissance missions for defense, commercial and scientific customers. Powered by a hybrid electric-battery/marine diesel system, the drone periodically surfaces to snorkel depth to recharge its batteries by raising a mast and running the diesel engines. That’s when the drone also can connect to satellite operations to transmit data to operators. It can send limited communications while submerged, but only to a nearby ship. To bolster its endurance, the Echo Voyager has backup systems. To give it a degree of autonomy, the navigation system incorporates motion and rotation sensors, as well as sonar to avoid obstacles. The 51-foot Boeing Echo Voyager is an unmanned undersea vehicle intended to roam the ocean for weeks or months. (Boeing) Autonomous systems have the potential to cut personnel costs, but developing them has proved to be complex and costly. In February, the Navy canceled further production of a remote mine-hunting system developed by Lockheed Martin Corp., cutting down the expected order from 54 to 10 that had already been delivered. The system was to be used in the Navy’s new littoral combat ships, but the autonomous vehicles that towed mine-hunting sensors were unreliable. “The autonomy side of the equation, the research is happening at a very quick pace,” said Holland Michel of Bard College. “But as you see time and time again, it’s very challenging to make unmanned systems that can make intelligent and dependable decisions on their own.” Filed under: Drone, Navy Print Email Gmail Related Move Over Drones – Driverless Cars, Unmanned Ship Up Next Drones May Provide Big Lift to Agriculture When FAA Allows Their Use 4.3 Million Hobbyist Drones Will Be Sold by 2020, FAA Predicts Elbit Unveils the Seagull, a Seacraft That Can Take on Subs and Neutralize Sea Mines Navy Upgrades Despite Budget Cuts Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in Technology Another Failure in Search for Treatment to Slow Alzheimer’s INVESTIGATIVE REPORT: How Kellogg Worked With ‘Independent Experts’ to Tout Cereal Study: Dementia Rates Decline Sharply Among Senior Citizens Best Weather Satellite Ever Built Rockets Into Space Rocket Blasts Off for Int’l Space Station OP-ED Parties Don’t Matter.

Boeing Will Provide Justine First Posted: Aug 22, 2016 06:02 AM EDT Boeing will soon provide space taxis to the International Space Station. (Photo : NASA / Handout / Getty Images) After being dependent on Russia in flying astronauts to and from the space station for five years, Boeing is getting ready to take charge. Its CST-100 is currently on its way to replacing Russia's Soyuz. Advertisement Known as the Chief Builder of the International Space Station, Boeing thought it should be the one providing taxi services to American astronauts, reports Air & Space Mag. As of writing, the company's goal is becoming closer to reality as a new parking spot gets installed in the station. On Friday, August 19, NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins made a spacewalk and had an adapter attached on the docking port of the shuttle, according to a report made by TRT World. This device will enable the taxis being developed by Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies to park. In 2015, NASA aimed to install the first new docking port. The equipment, however, was destroyed due to a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident.  Williams and Rubins routed a cable for the installation of the second docking port in 2018. Priority maintenance tasks were also expected to be done; but, communication problems occurred with the space suit of Williams, leading to the spacewalk's end. Advertisement On September 1, the two astronauts are set to make another spacewalk. The activity aims to install a high-definition camera on the exterior frame of the station and take back an unused solar array cooling panel. Relying on Russia costs $70 million for each person; hence, ending the dependence will apparently lead to saving a significant amount of money which can be used for the development of other projects. Boeing, since the beginning of its operations, contributed a lot to the International Space Station's integration particularly its complicated parts. It also supports other enhancements for the station in 2024 and beyond. The enhancements include lithium-ion batteries for the solar arrays and new communication system. Lastly, it supports laboratory experiment racks. TagsBoeing, CST-100, international space station ©2016 ScienceWorldReport.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

By: PTI | Mumbai | Published:August 22, 2016 9:42 pm The Boeing Corporation on Monday said Jet Airways has asked it to delay the delivery of ten 787 Dreamliners scheduled for next year. The Boeing Corporation on Monday said Jet Airways has asked it to delay the delivery of ten 787 Dreamliners scheduled for next year. “Jet Airways has informed us that it does not want to take the delivery of the 10 787s as per schedule. The move follows its decision to retake a similar number of 777s from Etihad and Turkish Airlines, which were given on lease by the airline earlier,” Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president for sales, Asia Pacific & India at Boeing told reporters. Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the annual meet of the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, Keskar said Jet leased out these when the oil prices had hit the roof and now they are taking them back. On the commercial implications of the move on Boeing, he said, “This is just a delay in taking the deliveries and that there is plenty of orders with us, including from Jet and the decision is perfectly fine with us.” He said the company has USD 8 billion worth of orders from Jet for as 75 planes of 737-Max and an order from Spicejet for 55 such planes worth USD 6 billion. Also, there is USD 3 billion worth of orders from Air India for six Dreamliners and three 737-Maxes, he said. Keskar said over the past one decade alone, Boeing has got orders worth USD 25 billion from domestic airlines and is expected to touch USD 265 billion or 1850 commercial planes over the next 20 years. Sounding very optimistic about Boeing’s prospects in the country, given the unprecedented growth in domestic aviation sector that has been clipping at over 20 per cent, and the rapidly increasing cooperation in the defence space, he said going forward his company will increase businesses with domestic companies both in software and hardware. While Boeing has technology partnerships with Infosys, Wipro, HCL and Infotech, it has manufacturing tie-ups with a many Tata Group companies and Bharat Forge. Both of this will only increase going forward, he said without quantifying it. On the defence side, Boeing is increasing collaboration with the Air Force and the Navy and has delivered five P-8is Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to the Navy, on schedule as part of a contract for eight aircraft for over USD 1 billion contract awarded in 2009. Watch Video: What’s making news That apart, it has also delivered C10 -17s and worth USD 4 billion and will be co-producing the attack choppers Apaches and the Chinok brand of transport choppers for the Navy and the Air Force.

Korolev Rocket and Space Corp (RSC Energia) and the US aerospace giant Boeing reached an agreement to solve their dispute over the Sea Launch rocket project, Energia’s General Director Vladimir Solntsev has said. The Izvestia report on the settlement has not yet been confirmed by US sources. The dispute goes back many years and in September 2015 the US District Court for the Central District of California awarded Boeing a multimillion dollar compensation from its former partners in the Sea Launch project, including Energia, following the bankruptcy procedure. Energia and its Ukrainian counterpart Yuzhnoe claimed that Boeing had given unwritten assurances to its Sea Launch partners that it would not seek reimbursements. “We have signed a preliminary agreement with Boeing to settle a dispute on Sea Launch in that context a court in the United States suspended all the activities to collect debts. Before the end of the year we are planning to sign a final agreement with Boeing, which should stipulate conditions of the [dispute’s] settlement,” Solntsev said, as quoted by the Russian Izvestia newspaper. He added that Energia and Boeing had already evolved a programme of long-term cooperation, which included projects covering space exploration. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by US aerospace giant Boeing. The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator – the best possible location for launch – which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth’s rotation. Sea Launch resumed operations in 2011 after a 30-month hiatus that saw passage through US Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now the company is 95-per cent owned by Energia Overseas Limited, a subsidiary of Energia. Despite the re-started operation, orders for Sea Launch satellite work has dried up. There are ‘orders’ for new rockets to be built, but as yet no customers. Its last launch was for Eutelsat back in May 2014.

By Paul Ausick August 22, 2016 9:35 am EST Print Email Tweet As of August 16, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) has taken net orders totaling 38 for its four wide-body jets: the 747, 767, 777 and 787. The company guided full-year orders for all its commercial planes at 535 and wide-body orders totaling 215. To date, the company has booked 335 orders, of which 297 are for the narrow-body 737. With just over a quarter of the year remaining, Boeing has taken orders for less than 20% of the wide-body planes it has forecast. The company has begun walking back its planned increase of 787 production, currently 12 per month, to 14 per month by the end of the decade. In Boeing’s conference call discussing second-quarter results, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said: Our principle here is to keep wide body supply and demand in balance. And we’re confident in the 787 program across that span of scenarios, and we’re going to continue to work campaigns to fill out to the 14 a month rate step-up, and we’ll evaluate timelines and decisions around that. But you can be very confident that whatever we decide, we’re going to keep supply and demand in balance. In what may be an even more important decision, the company is now planning to reduce production of the current model 777 from 8.3 per month to 7.0 per month early next year, with an eye to reducing the rate to 5.5 per month in 2018. The 777 Classic, as it’s called, is a bridge to production of the new 777X, which is due for production in 2020. Last month the president of the company’s commercial division said that orders for the 777 Classic are “pretty solid” through the third quarter of 2017. According to Aviation Week, 777 production is about 55% sold for 2018 and 30% sold for 2019. Boeing’s chief financial officer told a conference audience earlier this month that over the next couple of months the company will have more insight into orders for the 777 Classic, “We’ll either solidify those orders and be able to [match the bridge plan], or we’ll modify the production rate, at least through that bridge.” Through August 16, Boeing’s backlog of orders totaled 5,697 commercial jets, of which 4,404 are orders for the 737. The 777 backlog is 476, including both the Classic and the 777X, of which just 170 are orders for the Classic. At a production rate of seven per month that backlog will last two years, but that leaves Boeing with no backlog until the 777X is in production. The company has admitted it needs 40 to 50 new orders per year for the 777 in order to bridge the production gap between the new and old versions of the plane. So far this year it has taken eight new orders.

The deal includes the first two “production lots” of 7 and 12 planes respectively, as well as spare parts. Including future options, Boeing plans to build a total of 179 of the 767-based refueling aircraft for the Air Force to replace their KC-135 fleet. “The KC-46 tanker will provide the Air Force with unprecedented refueling capabilities, operational flexibility and combat readiness,” said Leanne Caret, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and CEO. “It’s an important day for the company and program. We’re excited about building low-rate initial production aircraft, and it’s only possible because of the hard work of the joint Boeing-Air Force team.” The deal follows a Defense Acquisition Board review and announcement that the KC-46 program completed “Milestone C” - a set of required ground and flight-test tests - and is approved for initial production.  Those tests included refueling flights with F- 16, F/A-18, AV-8B, KC-10, C-17 and A-10 aircraft and a cargo handling demo. Boeing received an initial contract in 2011 to design and develop the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation tanker aircraft. As part of that contract Boeing built four test aircraft – two configured as 767-2Cs and two as KC-46A tankers. The test aircraft have completed more than 1,000 flight hours to date. The KC-46A is a multirole tanker that can refuel all allied and coalition military aircraft compatible with international aerial refueling procedures and can carry passengers, cargo and patients. Boeing is assembling KC-46 aircraft at its Everett, Wash., facility. The company will begin delivering tankers to the Air Force in 2017.

Will it win the gold? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 21, 2016 at 10:13AM Destination: International Space Station. But who will win the gold medal for getting there first? Image source: NASA. Two years ago, NASA tapped Boeing (NYSE:BA) and SpaceX to run Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) missions for it, ferrying U.S. astronauts from Earth to the International Space Station and back. According to the agency, this switch from NASA-operated (or Roscosmos) taxi service to the ISS will save U.S. taxpayers tens of millions of dollars annually. This is because, ever since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, we've been paying Russia to send our astronauts to the ISS -- at a price that now stands at $82 million per seat. In contrast, once up and running, the CCtCap service promises to drop that cost down below $60 million. The terms According to the terms of the contracts, each contractor will be required to: Conduct "at least one crewed flight test per company with at least one NASA astronaut aboard to verify the fully integrated rocket and spacecraft system can launch, maneuver in orbit, and dock to the space station." Prove that all systems aboard its respective spacecraft "perform as expected." "Once each company's test program has been completed successfully and its system achieves NASA certification, each contractor will conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station." But while both companies won contracts, it was pretty clear which firm NASA favored. All contractors are equal, but some more than others Last year in May and December, NASA awarded Boeing orders for the first two CCtCap missions it is guaranteed under its contract. In contrast, SpaceX got only one order last year in November. It had to wait until July of this year to receive its second, bringing it up to even with Boeing in orders secured. With that award, NASA fulfilled its minimum obligation to place two orders with each contractor. (Note that these will be separate from and subsequent to each company's initial flight test). Now, mind you, none of these four orders have dates attached to them. NASA has not yet decided precisely when they will go up, saying only that "orders... are made two to three years prior to actual mission dates in order to provide time for each company to manufacture and assemble the launch vehicle and spacecraft." That implies that the first private, manned mission to ISS may take place as early as May 2017 or as late as May 2018 (if awarded to Boeing). Nor is it certain which of the two companies will win the honor of making the first private, manned mission into space. It might be Boeing or it might be SpaceX. But given the timing of the awards so far, it looks like NASA is leaning toward Boeing. And some contractors are less equal That's curious because, to date, it actually looks like SpaceX is doing a better job on the CCtCap contract -- and cheaper, too. Earlier this summer, Boeing announced that delays in its program will prevent it from conducting its initial manned flight test (again, this is prior to its two actual delivery missions) until Feb. 2018 at the earliest. That makes it impossible for Boeing to launch its first delivery mission by the optimistic May 2017 date. It leaves an awfully small window to squeeze through if NASA is hoping for Boeing to send a full complement of four astronauts plus 220 pounds of cargo in May 2018 of that year. One more delay and Boeing could miss its window entirely. In contrast, SpaceX, which has also suffered delays, still says it will be ready to conduct its flight test by Aug. 2017. If SpaceX hits that target, it would leave ample time for the company to conduct its first delivery mission by Nov. 2018 (three years post-order), or even Nov. 2017 (two years). Indeed, it's not out of the realm of possibility that, if NASA was hoping to launch in both Nov. and Dec. 2017, SpaceX could fulfill both those launches. Less equal and more expensive All of that is even more curious in light of the dollar amounts involved in these contracts. While both Boeing and SpaceX were given identical missions to conduct with similar spacecraft, the fees the companies will receive couldn't be more different. For the same work, NASA has promised to pay Boeing $4.2 billion, but SpaceX only $2.6 billion. That decision is going to start looking pretty strange if Aug. 2017 rolls around, and SpaceX has its spaceship up and ready for launch, while Boeing is still fiddling around under the hood of its more expensive spacecraft. If that's how things look a year from now, there's going to be a lot of pressure on NASA to go ahead and give SpaceX the honor of conducting the world's first private, manned spaceflight to ISS (and the money from that contract as well). So what's the upshot here for investors? Ultimately, both Boeing and SpaceX are making progress, and both will probably, eventually launch. But SpaceX does appear to be making more progress and at a more affordable cost. In the long run, this is not looking like good news for Boeing's space business.

It has been able to lower its loss and enhance profitability, owing to fuel savings and reduced maintenance cost offered by the aircraft,” Keskar said on the sidelines of an Indo-American Chamber of Commerce event. AI made operating profit of a little over Rs 100 crore in 2015-16, gaining benefits from reduced jet fuel prices. Its accounts are yet to be audited and it has not shared other financial details. This will be its first operating profit since merger with Indian Airlines in 2007. AI had 27 Boeing 787s on order and has inducted 21 of these. It will add two more this year and the other four next year. And, take delivery of three Boeing 777-300ER planes from 2018 onwards.  The deliveries are part of a $11 billion deal in 2005, for 68 planes. Its low cost arm, Air India Express, is inducting six Boeing 737s on lease this year. Last week, TAL Manufacturing Solutions, a subsidiary of Tata Motors, supplied the  5,000th advanced composite floor beam used in the 787 aircraft.  TAL's facility in Nagpur,  the only non-US facility to supply the floor beams used in the 787, has been providing the floor beams as a part of the manufacturer offset clause in AI's aircraft order of 2005. “We have fulfilled our obligations, including construction of a MRO (maintenance and repair outfit) in Nagpur and AI has begun carrying out checks on aircraft there,” said Keskar.

(Photo : Getty Images/NASA) The United States astronauts went on a spacewalk on Aug. 19, Friday to install a new door or 'parking space' for the visitors at the International Space Station.    The two American astronauts, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, took just a few hours to hook up the docking port. SpaceX had earlier in July accomplished the task of delivering this new gateway packed in the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule.    Advertisement Like Us on Facebook Williams told  NASA TV, "It is a significant door opening in the history of human space exploration," Florida Today reported. NASA has termed the gear as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will pave the way for emergence a new breed of US spacecrafts. This pivotal and first of its kind step which will result in the launch of commercial crew capsules sooner than expected -- It can happen sometime in the next year. The Americans haven't launched into orbit from their home turf since 2011, when NASA rocketed its last shuttle flight.   SpaceX and Boeing are now expected to begin human launches from Cape Canaveral in a year or two. But it would have been impossible for their crew capsules to dock without this new parking spot, which has replaced the old-fashioned shuttle setup. Friday's success will open new avenues for the future of spaceships."We have a port of call for the new U.S. commercial crew vehicles,' announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias,The Daily Mail reported.  A year from now, SpaceX will conduct a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts on board.  Boeing too is aiming to test its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until that happens, Russia will continue to provide all the rides.  The docking adaptor will be the first among two such additions to the space station, with the second likely to be installed in 2018.  Boeing has built the circular adaptor which measures around 42 inches (one meter) long and about 63 inches wide. Kenneth Todd, ISS operations integration manager has termed Friday's installation a "very significant milestone on the path to the establishment of commercial crew capability."  The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction which aims to carry astronauts to the space station.  The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment as it allows automatic parking instead of the grapple and berthing process in place currently, and which requires astronauts.  A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival.  Advertisement Tags:International Space Station SpaceX Astronauts Jeffrey Williams Kate Rubins parking spaces Copyright 2015 en.yibada.com All rights reserved.

The ambitious plan sounds almost laughable when it reveals that it could begin testing as early as 2017, but then you remember that whole part about being the second largest aeronautics company in the US and the fact that most of the technology to do this already exists. Passengers looking for an autonomous taxi ride would book a seat on a zenHop ‘City Airbus’ drone and proceed to a zenHub helipad. From the helipad, they’d be flown to their destination for approximately the same cost as a taxi due to the cost-savings in sharing the ride with several passengers. Since space is at a premium, luggage (if you have any) would be ferried across town by another service, zenLuggage, all while security experts at — wait for it — zenCyber keep you safe from hackers. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Aside from the fascination with the word zen, the plan — codenamed Vahana — makes sense. It’s also feasible, at least in a hypothetical sense. Airbus is keeping the electric aircraft design under wraps, but it did release an artist rendition of what the autonomous taxis could look like. Airbus has been working on the drone-like design for two years, and according to the press release it “could soon become reality without having to wait for too many regulatory changes.” Fingers crossed. via Engadget Future of urban mobility on Airbus Read next: Watch an iPhone fall to its death in this crazy bungee jumping incident Tech Share on Facebook (339) Share on Twitter (406) Bryan Clark is a reporter from San Diego, CA.

The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, quickly began hooking up a docking port that will be used by future commercial crew capsules. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. SpaceX is shooting for a launch of its supped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person test flight of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides – at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA divested itself of cargo deliveries a few years back, hiring private U.S. companies to carry out shipments. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger step. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. A repeat effort This is actually NASA’s second newfangled docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-by-5-foot ports at the 250-mile-high lab. Another one, cobbled together from spare parts, should fly up in about a year. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. First, though, Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on September 1 to retract a radiator. Williams, a veteran spacewalker, was the first one through the hatch Friday morning. “Come on out,” he urged Rubins. “The view is phenomenal,” Rubins marveled before getting straight to work. Rubins is now part of an exclusive sorority: She is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th woman in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder that, along with this new docking port, arrived on a Dragon cargo capsule in mid-July. Travel plans SpaceX’s crew Dragon – an enhanced version of its cargo ship – will fly from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission’s end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing’s Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance’s trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights, intended to go all the way to the space station and dock, will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots.

But unlike Kiwisaver, ordinary working people in NZ don’t have any choice about where NZ Super invests our money even though we are paying for it,” said Auckland Peace Action member Valerie Morse “It is totally abhorrent that our retirement fund is making money from war,” said Ms Morse. “Our screens are filled with the horrors of war every day. We see children being killed by bombs and missile strikes across the Middle East. The very least we can do is to make sure that we are not contributing to this devastation.“ “It doesn’t take an investment specialist to know that investing in war is wrong and unethical. Weapons companies profit from war and misery.” The NZ Super Fund currently has $27 million in investments in Boeing, $7.6 million in BAE, and $9.1 million in Raytheon. These are just three of many of the companies that NZ Super invests in that are involved in weapons production.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Table of contents LM Handed $10B Deal on C-130J Super Hercules | Kalashnikov Opens Store at Moscow Airport | Japan’s MoD Looks to Increase Defense Budget Aug 22, 2016 00:53 UTC by Defense Industry Daily staff Americas The US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has scheduled the testing of the SM-3 Block 2A ballistic missile defense interceptor this October. A joint development involving both the MDA and Japan, the interceptor has been previously flight tested twice by the agency without any target intercepts initially planned. October’s test will see it engage and destroy a medium-range ballistic missile target. If successful, the SM-3 will be in full-rate production in 2017. Contractors aiming to secure deals in relation to the Navy’s MQ-25A program have been given vague hints at what the service is expecting. Hopefuls looking to secure a slice of the action have been told they need to get that “sweet spot” between supporting mission tanking and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Born out of the scrapped Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS) program, the MQ-25 Stingray looks to include higher endurance for ISR capabilities in addition to just refueling. A lot of food for thought for those looking to get involved, but at least the initial “stealth tanker” concept has been shelved, for now. Chemical and biological contamination testing is one of the few remaining tasks left to be ticked off on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter before certification for full-rate production. In order to do this, a decontamination system and facility has been constructed at Edwards Air Force Base in California and an F-35A attached to the 461st Flight Test Squadron will be the lucky volunteer. The late August tests will see the fighter (modified to be able to collect test data) contaminated several times and towed into the decontamination facility to see if it can be cleaned of chemical or biological weapons exposure. Last week ended on an extremely good note for both Boeing and Lockheed Martin after the companies were awarded major multi-billion contracts by the USAF. For Boeing, an impressive $2.8 billion award was granted on Thursday as part of the low rate initial production of the KC-46A following the tanker’s Milestone C decision earlier this month. 19 aircraft will be produced alongside spare parts, engines and refueling pods. However, this was astronomically dwarfed on Friday when Lockheed Martin was handed a $10 billion deal for all future orders of the C-130J Super Hercules production program as well as any foreign military sales for the aircraft. Europe Surplus military vehicles have made their way to the Lithuanian armed forces over the last six months through a bilateral defense agreement with the Netherlands. The influx comes as part of a $7.89 million deal, which is providing a phased delivery of vehicles and equipment to bulk up Lithuania’s Baltic Fleet. Lithuania, alongside neighbors Estonia, Latvia and Poland are playing host to a four-battalion NATO force sent to provide a deterrent to any further Russian expansionism. Moscow, on the other hand, sees their presence so close to its own borders as inflammatory and expansionist in its own right. Flying from Moscow and need a last minute gift for a friend on the other side? Well alongside the usual airport fare of fridge magnets and duty-free vodka, Sheremetyevo airport now has its very own Kalashnikov store. Known across the world for the being the father of the infamous AK-47, the company has set up shop selling all things AK including pens, umbrellas, bags, hats, camouflage gear and “I love AK” T-shirts. Model guns are also available, but we’ve been assured that they don’t pose any security problems. Kalashnakov: looking to saturate its wares in the retail market as well as on the battlefield. Asia Pacific Japan’s ministry of defense is to request some $51 billion for its 2017 budget, a new record. The request comes as the government of Shinzo Abe further angles toward increasing the country’s military prowess and rewriting the constitution to remove a pacifist clause imposed on its armed forces at the end of the Second World War. An increasingly daring Chinese military has been a cause for worry for many of its neighbors, all of whom are currently rushing to modernize their naval and air capabilities with US and European hardware. If the funds are secured, Tokyo plans to funnel a portion of the money to its joint development of the new SM-3 Block 2A interceptor and upgrade its F-15 fighters. Approval has been given for the Indian ministry of defense to procure one additional C-130J Super Hercules, adding to six recently ordered by New Delhi in a $1 billion deal. The new aircraft was earmarked to replace one that crashed during an exercise in 2014, resulting in the death of five crew members. Once delivered, the aircraft will most likely be based in West Bengal’s Panagarh, which has been slated to be the base of the Indian Air Force’s second C-130J hub.

If the sightings by multiple witnesses in the early morning hours of March 8, 2014 — the day the Malaysia Airlines plane carrying 239 passengers and crew cut off all communication and vanished — were authentic after all, the final location of Flight MH370, as well as the prevailing theory as to why the plane went missing in the first place, would need to be completely reevaluated. #MH370: Malaysia’s DCA confirms receiving debris from Madagascar found by m Blaine Gibson as we reported yesterday pic.twitter.com/zhdmOEiQe8 — Sumisha Naidu (@SumishaCNA) July 20, 2016 Gibson, a lawyer turned world traveler from Seattle, Washington, discovered several pieces of aircraft debris on beaches in Mozambique and Mauritius, in the western Indian Ocean off the coast of southeast Africa, earlier this year. The debris, authorities have determined, is “highly likely” to have come from Flight MH370. #MH370 MOT Release: Summary of possible MH370 debris recovered (15 Aug 2016) https://t.co/rIdu26I5cy pic.twitter.com/M2u1eFm2Fl — WLP (@Bookofresearch) August 18, 2016 The independent researcher — who describes his private investigation into the Malaysia Airlines disappearance as a “quest” — has now teamed up with South Africa teenager Liam Lotter, who also found a piece of debris believed to be from the plane, to continue the hunt for further wreckage. Gibson and Lotter explain their search in the following video interview, conducted by South Africa’s East Coast Radio earlier this week. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcHG-RvHnZw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Maldives is a country of just over 390,000 inhabitants spread over nearly 1,200 small islands in the northern Indian Ocean, about 550 miles southwest of Colombo, Sri Lanka. At about 6:15 a.m. local time on March 8, 2014 (9:15 p.m. the previous night United States Eastern Time), several residents of the Kuda Huvadhoo, an island in the southern reach of the Maldives archipelago, reported sighting a large aircraft flying at low altitude with a deafening noise, zooming from the northwest over the island. Officials looked into the sighting, but dismissed the residents’ accounts, saying they had either seen a regularly scheduled, propeller-powered tourist plane, a private jet, or nothing at all. “The Maldives government first claimed there was ‘no plane,’ then the plane was a ‘private jet.’ then fifteen months later a ‘domestic propeller plane flight,’ then back to ‘no plane,’ then finally to say it cannot be discussed due to ‘national security,” Blaine Gibson wrote in an August 12, 2016 report posted online (see link below). “And previously reputable international media have been readily willing to mop up and regurgitate each of those evolving claims.” The official search team, led by the governments of Australia and Malaysia, also “debunked” the witness accounts as inconsistent with satellite “ping” data that appeared to show the rogue Malaysia Airlines on a course from the east, headed toward Antarctica and terminating in the ocean waters approximately 1,200 miles off the coast of western Australia. That location would be roughly 3,000 miles by air from the sightings in Maldives — too far for Flight MH370 to make it without running out of fuel. In fact, according to the August 12 Blaine Gibson report, the Malaysia Airlines plane would have been “nearing fuel exhaustion” by the time it reached Maldives — meaning that if the sightings there are authentic, the wreckage of the plane lies hundreds, even thousands of miles north of the current, official search site. Read the complete Blaine Gibson report by clicking the link in the following Twitter posting. #MH370 Maldives Revisited by Blaine Alan Gibson – 12 August, 2016. https://t.co/e5hrbQ0AIT — Ken S (@kstaubin) August 13, 2016 Gibson traveled to Maldives and re-interviewed numerous eyewitnesses who reported sighting the plane that day, and he came away believing that their reports were credible. And even more startling, the witnesses say they saw the Boeing 777 take a hard turn to the south — which would indicate that someone, whether the pilot, a hijacker or another person, was at the controls. Gibson as well as the official investigators have previously held to the belief that the Malaysia Airlines plane was a “ghost flight,” operating on automatic pilot after the passengers and crew were incapacitated by some on-board calamity, such as a fire or rapid, accidental cabin decompression.

It merely sets the record straight that the jet plane that overflew Kudahuvadhoo has not yet been identified,” Gibson wrote. Blaine Gibson wrote that he investigated claims of a propeller plane, or private jet, and found no evidence that either type of flight was anywhere over Maldives on March 8, 2014, a finding that coupled with descriptions offered by multiple witnesses led him to believe that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may indeed — for some mysterious reason — have made a low-altitude pass over Maldives that morning.

The step was considered to be quite crucial for NASA to regain an independent access to the lab complex since 2011 when the shuttle fleet was retired. The International Docking Adapter (IDA) has been built by Boeing that will help spacecraft from both the organizations to bring crews to the outpost. With this, NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz ferry ships will come to an end. In 2018, the second IDA would most probably be attached. Station commander Jeff Williams and astronaut Kate Rubins have attached and outfitted the IDA. Williams was of the view, “It is amazing that now we’ve opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles. Congratulations to the entire team”. The spacewalk started at 8.04am EDT. The IDA reached the ISS aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship in June. On Wednesday, the station’s robot arm pulled the IDA from the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk and placed it at a spot where it would be easier for the spacewalkers to install it. Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi was involved in the mission though he did not perform the spacewalk. He was working inside the station and once sensors indicated that the IDA has been properly aligned, he asked the astronauts to firmly lock down the IDA. The astronauts have installed new laser reflectors that would be used by the Boeing and SpaceX spacecraft to determine distance and relative velocity. NASA has planned to install the IDA last year, but it was postponed because the initial unit being carried by the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket met a catastrophic failure.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Betting on aero biz, TAL Manufacturing eyes Rs 1k cr turnover Press Trust of India | New Delhi Aug 21, 2016 10:57 AM IST Tata Motors arm TAL Manufacturing Solutions is betting big on its aerospace business as it eyes a five-fold increase in turnover to Rs 1,000 crore in the next five years, for which it will invest Rs 100 crore to augment its manufacturing capacity. The company expects its aerospace vertical, with supplies players such as Boeing and RUAG Group - a tier I parts supplier for Airbus - to contribute up to 70 per cent of its turnover by 2021 while the rest would come from robotics and other allied businesses. TAL has already started selling from July this year its industrial articulated robot BRABO priced between Rs 4-10 lakh as it looks to tap the opportunity in small and medium enterprises sector in India by offering cost effective solutions. "Today, our revenue is around Rs 220 crore. We are looking at five-times growth in our revenue in the next five years," TAL Manufacturing Solutions Executive Director and CEO Rajesh Khatri told PTI. Sharing the break-up of the target, he said the aerospace vertical is likely to account for Rs 650-700 crore and the rest would come from robotics and allied business in automotive and heavy engineering. When asked about investments to meet the target, Khatri said the company plans to invest about Rs 100 crore in the next two to three years for setting up a third unit for composites and large assemblies. TAL already has a unit dedicated for supplies to Boeing and another one to meet its commitments to the RUAG Group at its Nagpur facility. In terms of employment, Khatri said the company could increase the headcount to 1,200-1,250 by 2021 from the current 880. The company had last week shipped the 5,000th advanced composite floor beam assemblies for Boeing 787-Dreamliner. It had started supplies to the US aerospace major from its Nagpur facility in October 2014. Khatri said the company is also looking for "several new packages" in the aerospace segment as it looks to expand portfolio. These could include fuselage parts, sheet metals and composites. On the robotics segment, he said: "From the end of July this year we have started selling our robot. We intend to offer cost effective solutions with strong value proposition to small and medium enterprises in India which need automation but don't have that big capital to invest on it.

On Sunday Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said “we are close to our targets” on employment and inflation, adding to recent comments from his central bank colleagues that suggest the Fed might raise rates sooner than previously thought. That further raised the already-high anticipation for a speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, this Friday, at the annual central bankers’ meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Her comments will be scrutinised for fresh clues. “Stan Fischer’s comments clearly raised the risk of a more hawkish tone from Yellen on Friday,” Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York, told Bloomberg. “So that’s impacting the dollar, risk assets and commodity prices.” Wall Street was mixed. In 2.43pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.09 percent. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.03 percent higher. In 2.28pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.15 percent. In the Dow, declines in shares of Apple and those of Johnson & Johnson, last 1 percent and 0.7 percent weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Visa and those of Boeing, up 0.5 percent and 0.4 respectively. “We have been moving back and forth with this [Fed] rate increase for a while,” Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels, told Bloomberg. “If you look at valuations, they’re not particularly cheap, so indeed markets have been very well supported. Therefore, they’re worried that interest rates will go up.” Deal news offered a boost. Shares of Medivation jumped, up 19.7 percent as of 2.49pm in New York after Pfizer won a takeover battle for the maker of cancer drug Xtandi, with a deal worth about US$14 billion. Shares of Pfizer traded 0.4 percent weaker as of 2.45pm in New York. “The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,” Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer’s Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.1 percent slip from the previous close, as a drop in mining stocks weighed on the market. France’s CAC 40 index declined 0.2 percent, the UK’s FTSE 100 index fell 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX index retreated 0.5 percent. Shares of Syngenta rallied, closing 10.6 percent higher, as state-owned China National Chemical won approval from the US national security regulator for its US$43 billion takeover of the Swiss chemical and seed company. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz said it was a “major milestone for the deal,” adding in a note to clients that “approval removes a major potential hurdle and should come as a relief to Syngenta shareholders,” Reuters reported.

You won’t find a class like it anywhere but at the new Richland 2 Institute of Innovation. The students of the inaugural class at what officials call R2i2 were introduced to their new $40 million facility at the Village at Sandhill on Monday. This is not your mama’s career center. In fact, it’s not at all what R2i2 director Kevin Alberse would consider the typical career and technology education center for students. “We want our kids to be immediately and immensely employable,” Alberse said. “The advantages that they’ll have is when they learn these skills ahead of their counterparts, they’re actually going to be ahead of the curve. The goal is to make the students “the creators and the innovators of the next thing that happens rather than waiting on something else to happen,” he said. About 80 students, – juniors and seniors drawn from Richland 2’s five high schools – are taking take one of six unique classes offered this semester: ▪  Mobile and nontraditional food service. ▪  Application development for Apple equipment. ▪  Supply chain and global logistics management. ▪  Managerial accounting and finance. ▪  Computer-aided design and manufacturing. ▪  Alternative energy and fuel cell development. These classes are designed to be geared toward local industries and employers such as Volvo and Boeing and exclusively use computer software that R2i2 students will get to learn earlier than their counterparts in college, Alberse said. “I would hope for any of (the students) to get a better understanding of what they might like to do in the future, but also to get a better understanding of what opportunities there are in the future,” said Kirstin Bullington, who teaches an class that will focus on non-fossil fuel energy and engineering for environmental sustainability. “Here, we’re not really restricted by end-of-course exams or whatever else, so if they have an idea, we can explore it,” she said. “This is the way education’s supposed to be.” Unique building features – such as exposed pipes and ducts for study of energy sources and classrooms big enough to drive a food truck into – are designed to complement classes that can also mesh with each another. For example, the food truck entrepreneurship class might partner with the supply chain class and the managerial accounting class as students learn the basics of running a business. Abriana Gibbs, a 17-year-old senior at Blythewood High, is one of five classmates in Mincey’s the food truck class. Already accepted to Johnson & Wales University culinary school in Charlotte, Gibbs said she expects to learn skills about working collaboratively and how to treat people in service situations. She and fellow students will not only learn the basics of entrepreneurship and managing a business, but will work directly with food truck businesses from the community to create and serve meals at R2i2. Some of Gibbs’ classmates said they were drawn to the class because they enjoy cooking or, like 16-year-old Megan Boyd, because they hope to run or own a business one day. “I’m hoping to learn patience because you’ve got to be able to work with people and know how to handle different attitudes and personalities day-to-day in customers.” said Boyd, a Blythewood junior. The roughly 215,000-square-foot R2i2 facility – paid for with $40 million in unused bond debt – is home to much more than the six initial R2i2 courses. Sharing the space are: ▪ 185 new offices and spaces for district personnel, including Superintendent Debbie Hamm, along with a new room for school board meetings. Richland 2 officials long wanted new headquarters to replace the one next to Forest Lake Elementary. The concept of R2i2 started about six years ago just as new district offices before expanding to the idea of a learning center, said Jack Carter, the district’s chief operations officer. ▪  The relocated Sandhills branch of the Richland County library, which is expected to open in its 30,000-square-foot wing by November. ▪  A conference center capable of seating nearly 700 people. The space can be rented for community events as which beer and wine can be served. The center already is reserved for a fundraiser, a business expo and two proms, Carter said.

GovCon Index gainers outnumbered laggers and unchanged stocks by a 2-to-1 ratio and eight of the GCI’s 11 S&P 500-listed stocks posted gains with Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) the top net performer and Boeing (NYSE: BA) the best percentage mover of companies listed in both indices. Orbital ATK (NYSE: OA) led all GCI net gainers Monday and the Dulles, Virginia-based aerospace company’s stock traded at a volume of 1.02 million shares versus the three-month average of 653,053, while Leidos Holdings (NYSE: LDOS) topped on percentage. Reston, Virginia-based Leidos’ Monday volume totaled 5.83 million shares compared to the three-month average of 2.97 million and the government services contractor has climbed 5.63 percent since Aug. 17, the company’s first full day after its merger with the former Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) services segment. The U.S. stock bellwether S&P 500 composite index has slowed down from its rally since early July as investors have examined comments from Federal Reserve leaders on monetary policy and also turned some attention to commodities such as crude oil ahead of a September OPEC meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to address the Economic Policy Symposium Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Crude futures in New York fell 3.03 percent to $47.05 and that decline sent the S&P energy sector down nearly a percent, while the London Brent benchmark tumbled 3.36 percent to $49.17 a barrel.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED US stocks end mixed as oil falls Margreet Dietz Tuesday August 23, 2016 Share Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen Play NBR radio on The latest hawkish comments from a US Federal Reserve official weighed on equities and lifted the greenback as investors try to gauge the timing of a US interest rate increase. Lower oil prices also pushed energy stocks down. Major US stock indexes haven’t covered much ground in recent weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500 notched its 31st consecutive session without a move of 1% or more in either direction, the longest such stretch in two years. The index hit its 11th record of the year on August 15 but has since pulled back. On Sunday, Fed vice-chairman Stanley Fischer said: "We are close to our targets" on employment and inflation, adding to recent comments from his central bank colleagues that suggest the Fed might raise rates sooner than previously thought. That further raised the already high anticipation for a speech by Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen, this Friday, at the annual central bankers' meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Her comments will be scrutinised for fresh clues. "Stan Fischer's comments clearly raised the risk of a more hawkish tone from Mrs Yellen on Friday," Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York, told Bloomberg. "So that's impacting the dollar, risk assets and commodity prices." Wall Street mixed  At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 23.15 points, or 0.1%, to 18,529.42. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.1% higher to 5244.60  higher while the S&P 500 Index moved down just 1,2 points to 2182.36. In the Dow, declines in shares of Apple and those of Johnson & Johnson, last 1% and 0.7% weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Visa and those of Boeing, up 0.5% and 0.4 respectively. The S&P 500’s energy sector lost 0.9%. Shares of Marathon Oil fell 6.9%. Halliburton lost 3.8%. US crude oil snapped a seven-session winning streak to close down 3% at $US47.05 a barrel, its biggest drop since August 1. Pfizer wins Medivation bidding Deal news offered a boost. Shares of Medivation jumped, up 19.7% after Pfizer won a takeover battle for the maker of cancer drug Xtandi, with a deal worth about $US14 billion. Shares of Pfizer traded 0.4% weaker. "The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer," Ian Read, Pfizer's chief executive officer, said in a statement. "The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer's Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.1% slip from the previous close, as a drop in mining stocks weighed on the market. France's CAC 40 index declined 0.2%, the UK's FTSE 100 index fell 0.4% while Germany's DAX index retreated 0.5%. Shares of Syngenta rallied, closing 10.6% higher, as state-owned China National Chemical won approval from the US national security regulator for its $US43 billion takeover of the Swiss chemical and seed company. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz said it was a "major milestone for the deal," adding in a note to clients that "approval removes a major potential hurdle and should come as a relief to Syngenta shareholders," Reuters reported. Kepler Cheuvreux rates Syngenta shares a "buy." (BusinessDesk) Click the hamburger symbol top right of our homepage to access the Rich List 2016 and other sections. Got a question about this story?

(Photo : NASA/Newsmakers) Recent news revealed that top U.S. space agency NASA is considering to hand over the ISS to private companies. Advertisement This was after the new docking system was installed on the International Space Station (ISS). The new docking system will enable private spaceflight companies such as Boeing and SpaceX to dock their own space shuttles capable of transporting crew from the Earth to the ISS and back.   Newest addition at station will allow future crew vehicles from Boeing and SpaceX to dock. https://t.co/IVWrl6hvDS pic.twitter.com/bgGV5bGj3d — Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 20, 2016    NASA's management of the ISS is about to end in 2024 and according to a news report, NASA has confirmed that it has plans to transfer the management of the space laboratory to private or commercial companies in 2024. According to reports, this is due to NASA's move to shift focus in deeper space explorations such as the Journey to Mars. Traveling beyond the low-Earth orbit, NASA will have to rely on new and more innovative space systems to allow observation and even human landing on the red planet. The ISS is a key space laboratory where various experimentations are being held. It is an integral part of space research and in the maintenance of satellites and other engines in space that are governed by the U.S. government. Of course, NASA's hunger to go in deep space shouldn't mean the end of the ISS, so a transfer of management might be inevitable. Over the years, the ISS has been a prolific testing ground for breakthrough space technologies, like the Bigelow Aerospace's expandable module called BEAM. ISS and NASA have always been in cooperation with other nation's space agencies to man the space station. Roscosmos of Russia and ESA of Britain have been partners of NASA for a long time sending their astronauts and cosmonauts to perform space duty for months at a time. After the news broke out, the next question was who are the top companies being considered for the management of the ISS? Although there are no confirmed names yet, rumors are Boeing and SpaceX are more likely to be considered since they are developing space shuttles for NASA that fits the newly installed modules on the ISS. Boeing is developing its CST-100 Starliner that is set to launch in 2018. "We're working toward our first unmanned flight in 2017, followed by a manned astronaut flight in 2018," Leanne Caret, Boeing's executive vice president, said in an interview with GeekWire. The ISS will deorbit in 2020 with the operational mission set until 2024.

(NYSE: NOC) has begun testing its clean-sheet design for a new U.S. Air Force training jet to replace the decades old T-38. According to a report at Aviation Week, the new trainer, designated as the T-X by the Air Force, began taxi testing in Mojave, California. Northrop Grumman and its partners, BAE Systems and L-3 Communications Holdings Corp. (NYSE: LLL), are one of four teams that are expected to compete for the $8.4 billion contract. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) has partnered with Saab and is expected to offer its own clean-sheet design, while Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) has teamed up with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and they are expected to offer a modified KAI T-50. The fourth competitor is a group led by Raytheon Corp. (NYSE: RTN) that includes Italy’s Leonardo and Canada’s CAE Inc. (NYSE: CAE), and it is expected to present a version of Leonardo’s M-346 trainer that the group calls the T-100. The U.S. Air Force has released a draft request for proposal (RFP) for a fleet of some 350 training jets to replace the T-38. The draft is expected to be followed by a final RFP by the end of this year with a contract award due in 2017 or early 2018. The unique draft RFP offers incentives for exceeding threshold performance specifications, including high-g force maneuvering, high angle-of-attack maneuvering and aerial refueling. The threshold for high-g force maneuvering is 6.5 g and the objective is 7.5 g. For every 0.1 g above the threshold, the bidder receives a point bonus. Other things equal, including price, the bidder with higher sustained g-capability will receive a higher rating overall. Aviation Week included the following unattributed photo with its story. Source: Courtesy Aviation Week Lockheed and its partners completed the first test flight of the modified KAI T-50 in June. The Raytheon team had their trainer a last month’s Farnborough Airshow, and the Boeing-led team has said next to nothing about their entry.

WARRENDALE, Pa. (PRWEB) August 22, 2016 The SAE 2016 Aerospace Systems and Technology Conference provides attendees the opportunity to participate in plenary panel discussions with the industry’s experts and leaders at the show September 27-30, 2016 in Hartford, Connecticut. With a plenary panel discussion happening each day of the conference, attendees have the ability to learn the latest innovations in the industry and renew and develop important business relationships within the international aerospace industry. Innovations in Integrated Propulsion Systems & Aircraft Systems On Tuesday, September 27 at 9:30 AM, representatives from MIT, AHS, GE Aviation, Lockheed Martin, Rolls-Royce and Air Force Research Laboratory will examine how in this age of higher fuel costs, lower profits margins, high competition, and environmental stewardship, the integration of propulsion and aircraft systems has increasingly blurred the lines between systems and added complexity. This panel seeks to expound upon the innovations that are under development in the classic component areas and the integrated systems development, and then further that discussion with a view of the future. What needs to be done now to assure the Aerospace and Defense Industry maintains the level of safety, technology, and economics advantages while addressing the pressures of the consumer markets? For more information on the panel and the speakers, please click here. Innovations in Intelligent Aircraft Systems Kicking off day 2 of the conference at 8:30 AM is the keynote plenary panel discussion comprised of representatives from Pratt and Whitney, Boeing, NASA, UTAS, Airbus Americas, and Sikorsky. It is envisioned that the Connected Aircraft will follow the “internet of things” evolution, with resulting value added services to all parties in the value chain. Providing services to the operators, such as real-time analytics and diagnostics, improved scheduling of catering, fuel delivery and other ground services are just some examples of a true “Connected Aircraft”. Unlike the consumer sector, the aircraft industry poses some unique challenges, the longevity of the aircraft coupled with the complexity and cost of modification goes against the consumer sector’s approach for continuous and frequent changes. The additional IT complexity and infrastructure required will necessitate significant changes in facilities, personnel and operations. Operators of multiple fleet types, containing different aircraft equipment, face an added challenge of having consistent and uniform connected aircraft operations across their fleets. The goal of the panel is to explore the technologies in development and map out those that need to be developed, discuss potential solutions and foster dialogue among panel participants and attendees on new approaches and ideas. For more details on the panel or speakers, please click here. Innovations in Aircraft Systems Integration To begin the final day of the conference at 8:30 AM, speakers from UTRC, Moog, NASA, Thales and drR2 will examine innovations in aircraft systems integration. It is envisioned that the More Electric Aircraft and Transformative Vertical Flight will result in higher performance, added capability, and more reliable platform. The initial demonstrations by NASA in the early 1990’s are being used in the latest commercial and military planes. The next generation of more integrated systems, such as integrated propulsion, power, and control, is well underway and yielding positive results. The challenges of integrating seemingly disparate functions are well documented, and present real obstacles to implementation, not to mention the cost of designing/testing/certifying entirely new systems. For more information on this panel and panelists, please click here. In addition to the keynotes, there is a full technical program in place. Be sure to secure your attendance at the only event that provides the breadth and depth of technical presentations across commercial, military and general aviation.

By Christian Davenport, The Washington Post Published: August 22, 2016, 6:00 AM A   A Later this year, tech entrepreneur turned space pioneer Elon Musk is planning the blastoff of a new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, that would be twice as powerful as any other in use and one of the biggest since the Apollo era’s mighty Saturn V. The stage for the rocket’s debut: the Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took off for the moon in 1969. SpaceX’s use of 39A is the ultimate symbol that the government’s monopoly on space travel is over. To Musk, it also is proof of an additional triumph — over his fellow billionaire and rival Jeff Bezos, who had fought to secure the launch pad for himself. Nearly five decades after the United States beat the Soviet Union to the moon, another space race is emerging, this time among a class of hugely wealthy entrepreneurs who have grown frustrated that space travel is in many ways still as difficult, and as expensive, as ever. Driven by ego, outsize ambition and opportunity, they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in an attempt to open up space to the masses and push human space travel far past where governments have gone. Musk, who made his first fortune on Zip2 and PayPal, and Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, are the most prominent of a quartet of billionaires aspiring to open the frontier of space the way the public-private partnerships of the 19th century pushed west at the dawn of the railroad age. The two others are Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. All have upended industries, including retail, automobiles and credit cards, and are now embarking on the greatest disruption of all — making space travel routine — in a business long dominated by commercial-space contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. While their efforts have reignited interest in space, they also have raised moral complexities and regulatory challenges in pursuing an endeavor that is inherently dangerous. Congress has opted to regulate the industry only loosely, granting it an extended “learning period” that would allow companies to grow and to practice space travel. Already, one pilot has died in the quest to make commercial space travel a reality. But his sacrifice came in the service of a company, Scaled Composites that was operating a spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, not a government acting in the national interest. Some critics, such as Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, said that safeguards should not be overlooked. “When the inevitable accident with significant loss of life occurs — whether it’s a year from now or five years from now,” she said, “the American public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how we could be so short-sighted?” Since late last year, when Musk and Bezos traded what were interpreted as barbs on Twitter over who pulled off the most daring feat in space, they’ve apparently entered a detente, with peace offerings, even words of encouragement. But there’s something about the exchanges that still bothers Musk, who in a recent interview wanted to make it clear: Space is not orbit. That’s what he meant when he lit up Twitter after Bezos’s Blue Origin flew a rocket to the edge of space and landed it at its West Texas test range, a feat that NASA has never achieved. Bezos declared the reusable rocket “the rarest of beasts.” “Not quite ‘rarest,’ ” Musk shot back, pointing out that SpaceX has previously launched rockets in test flights and landed them after relatively short trips. In a series of tweets, he vowed something even more spectacular, and difficult — landing a much larger and more powerful rocket capable of traveling many times the speed of sound, which is required for going into orbit. Later, after SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 rocket, Bezos tweeted what many considered a backhanded compliment: “Welcome to the club!” Months later, Musk still was fixated on it. Bezos’s Blue Origin may have crossed the boundary into “space,” a somewhat arbitrary barrier generally agreed as starting at 62 miles above Earth’s surface. But Musk’s SpaceX spacecraft don’t just go up; they go up and out, following an arc and moving so fast — about five miles per second — that they stay aloft and can circle the Earth in less time than it takes to watch “Star Wars.” Reaching the threshold of space is a somewhat simple up and down endeavor — “like shooting a cannon ball up and then the cannon ball falls down for four minutes of free fall,” Musk said. Orbit and space “are different leagues,” Musk said. The tension began appearing in legal briefs in 2014. SpaceX challenged a patent held by Blue Origin that gave it the right to land rockets on floating barges at sea — a feat SpaceX has now pulled off multiple times. The point of landing the rockets, though is to reuse them, which then would dramatically lower the cost of space flight. SpaceX has yet to refly any of its rockets, however. Blue Origin, by contrast, has flown the same booster four times in test flights, showing that recovering the rocket is not the same as reusing it. And there was Launch Complex 39A. Musk won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed a legal protest, arguing that the criteria NASA used to come to its decision were flawed. Musk derided the protest as a “phony blocking tactic and an obvious one at that.” Blue Origin had not yet sent a rocket to space, which Musk eagerly pointed out, and didn’t have one qualified to carry people. “If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote in an email published at SpaceNews.com. Then in a taunt that shot across the internet, he added, “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.” At the time, Blue Origin was tight lipped about the remarks. But years later, it responded by announcing that Bezos had secured a spot of his own at Cape Canaveral: Launch Complex 36, just down the road from 39A, so he and Musk will be neighbors. It was supposed to have happened by now: Space tourism. Bases on the moon. Humans to Mars and beyond. The next giant leap. And the next. Life-long quest Bezos was 5 years old during the Apollo 11 moon landing and remembers watching it on his living room television with his parents and grandparents. “It was a seminal moment for me,” he has said. In 2013, he embarked on a three-week quest to recover from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean the F-1 engines used in the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets. Using deep-water rovers, his team found its quarry: castaway engine parts, more than three miles down, deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. Where others might have seen piles of rusted debris fit for a junkyard, Bezos saw art. “A magic sculpture garden,” he called it. After Musk sold his first company, Zip2, to Compaq, for more than $300 million, he started thinking more seriously about space exploration and wondered when NASA was planning on getting to Mars. He searched the space agency’s website for its Mars plan but could not find one. “Because, of course, there had to be a schedule,” he said in a 2012 speech. “And I couldn’t find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well-hidden. And it turned out it wasn’t on the website at all. Which was shocking.” Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors, plans to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. While that seemingly impossible goal remains aspirational, SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Last year, however, a unmanned Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station blew up, forcing the company to delay all launches for six months. But it now has a backlog of more than 70 missions representing more than $10 billion in revenue. “We’re sort of checking the various boxes that are needed to do this,” Musk said, “while providing useful services to NASA and commercial companies.” As a child, Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, knew the names of the Mercury 7 astronauts, as if they were the star players of his favorite baseball team. “Like countless other boys, I planned to become an astronaut when I grew up,” he wrote in his memoir. “For sheer adventure, you couldn’t beat outer space.” Dreams of space tourism In 2004, Allen teamed up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million contest, and became the first commercial vehicle to reach space. Allen licensed the rights to the technology behind the spacecraft to Branson and concentrated on other interests. But now he’s back. He’s building Stratolaunch, that would become the world’s largest airplane with a wingspan wider than a football field, end zones included. It is designed to carry a rocket tethered to its belly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The rocket would drop away from the plane, fire its engines and “air-launch” into orbit. Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. And he’s proud that more than 700 people — more than the approximately 550 people who have actually been to space — have bought tickets to ride on his spacecraft, some paying as much as $250,000. “Perhaps it is in our culture, perhaps it is in our DNA, or perhaps it is a bit of each of those, but we humans seem hard-wired to explore,” Branson’s Virgin Galactic says on its website. “But because government space agencies are not asked to help ordinary citizens to become astronauts, most of our planet’s seven billion people have had no opportunity to experience space and all of its possibilities for themselves.” The last time the United States was not able to launch its own astronauts to space, the hiatus lasted 2,098 days, from the last of the Apollo-era missions in 1975 to the first space shuttle flight in 1981. Today, NASA is again in a hiatus, this one beginning when the shuttles were retired in 2011. But now there is a painful twist: The United States has to rely on Russia, the country it bested in the Cold War race to the moon, to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. That is expected to end by late 2017, or early 2018, when a cadre of carefully chosen NASA astronauts would board a spacecraft on the Florida Space Coast and launch from U.S. soil. That historic moment would feature a rocket that for the first time would be owned and operated by a commercial company, not NASA. Today, SpaceX and Boeing, the companies that NASA is entrusting with the lives of its astronauts, are vying to see which will fly first. The victor would become the company that restores U.S. human spaceflight in what would be one of the most tense and dramatic launches in decades. Then could come the birth of regular commercial space-tourism trips. Wealthy ticketed passengers, fresh off days of space training camp, could board a private spacecraft, buckle into luxurious window seats and shoot just past the edge of space, where they would float weightless, joining the ranks of the world’s first space tourists in a flight that would last several minutes. ‘Crest of another wave’ For years, many have been waiting for the commercial space industry to become a real market, one where companies actually make money and prosper. William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA’s human spaceflight division, said he thinks that the industry “is on the crest of another wave.” “There’s a lot of hype,” he said at a Federal Aviation Administration space conference this year, citing other times when industry felt it was on the cusp of revolutionary change. “But will we be able to generate enough demand?” he said. “It can’t just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector. … Will that be enough to push us over or to reach that tipping point that actually enables this industry to become more self-sufficient than it was in the past?” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Facts 2016-08-22T14:59+02:00 14:59 22.08.2016 Consideration of Ukraine's claim against Russia over terrorism financing to start by end of year - Klimkin Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin expects the UN International Court of Justice to start hearing Kyiv's claim against Russia regarding violations of the International Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism before the end of 2016. "An arbitration proceeding regarding the International Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism is due to begin this year," the minister told the press in Kyiv on Monday. Speaking of the UN International Court of Justice's hearing on this claim, Klimkin said Ukraine was not expecting any problems. "As to the convention, that situation is clear from the legal angle, because Russia has recognized jurisdiction of the UN International Court of Justice over a limited list of conventions, among them the Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism," the minister said. Also, the investigative team tasked with identifying and indicting persons behind the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 crash in Donbas on July 17, 2014, comprising representatives of the Netherlands, Australia, Malaysia, Belgium and Ukraine will post initial results of its criminal inquiry in late September, the Ukrainian foreign minister said. "You must have heard that our Dutch friends plan to publish the second part of the report on the Malaysian Boeing tragedy in late September. We will definitely keep that in mind," he said. Klimkin also mentioned Ukraine's claim against Russia related to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in the context of Crimean events. There is another area of work of the Ukrainian authorities: "assistance to our Ukrainian companies which have lost their assets. A number of claims are being processed," he said. "We have presented our formal stance on the temporary occupation of Crimea, and we are ready to represent it. Every arbitration court will naturally make its own decision, but in each case, in the case of either Ukrainian companies, Naftogaz or Ukrzaliznytsia, we will seek compensation for our companies which have lost their assets, have lost their income. These are the two levels we will continue to work on," Klimkin said. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry is closely interacting with legal counselors and international partners in this area to win at international courts, the minister said.

The Business of Travel: why is Norwegian adding to an already saturated market? Simon Calder @SimonCalder Monday 22 August 2016 10:00 BST Click to follow The Independent Travel Three other airlines already fly from London to Reykjavik Getty You need not delve far back into aviation history to discover when competition in European air travel really began. Thirty years ago this summer, British Midland started flying from Heathrow to Amsterdam.  The UK and the Netherlands were the first nations to acknowledge that allowing direct competition against existing “flag carriers” – in this case, British Airways and KLM – might actually be good for business. And so it proved: the market between the two airports expanded by more than the capacity that British Midland added.  In other words, once lower fares and higher standards stimulated the market, BA and KLM benefited from increased passenger numbers. Nine years later, much the same thing happened when easyJet started flying from Luton to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Even though the upstart wasn’t flying from “fortress Heathrow”, British Midland and BA suddenly found themselves exposed to cut-price competition – and once again the market grew.  Since those aviation milestones, ferocious competition has thrived in Europe. The arrival of open skies means any EU airline can fly between any two European airports – an arrangement that is likely to continue function for the UK even after Brexit. The trajectory for the past two decades has been relentless expansion. To the enormous benefit of business and leisure travellers alike, we now enjoy a near-saturated market. With many city pairs looking full, things are about to get interesting, and business travel costs on some routes could tumble. Most of the big flag carriers are still around, sparring with the low-cost giants, Ryanair and easyJet. New planes are being delivered every week from Airbus and Boeing to help fuel expansion. The fundamental of European aviation in the 21st century is that aircraft make money only when they are flying. That is when the dark art of network planning comes in. Any rational firm will allocate its assets – in this case, planes and crews – to the routes that look most profitable. That’s why, when Stelios Haji-Ioannou started easyJet, his first routes from London were to Scotland’s three biggest cities. Thousands of passengers were already flying on those links, ready to be tempted by the prospect of halved air fares.  Amsterdam and Nice were first on the international route network, and remain prodigious providers of profits. They carry healthy proportions of business and leisure passengers, and both ends of each route generate plenty of traffic.  The latest route announced by easyJet – its 107th from Gatwick – shows how far the airline has gone from those early cherry-picking days. It is to Ostersund in central Sweden. When flights begin on 11 December, the passengers will almost all be skiers and snowboarders heading for the resort of Are. At least easyJet faces no competition from other UK scheduled airlines to Sweden’s ski heartland. In contrast, another northern link announced this week looks like the height of commercial optimism from one of Europe’s leading budget airlines, Norwegian. Every year, November is the month of lowest demand for air travel. There are no school holidays of note in the big countries for aviation; resorts from Greece to the Algarve are in hibernation; and the winter-sports season has yet to begin. So it is not the most auspicious time to begin a new route. This year, 1 November happens to fall on a Tuesday, which is the day of the week of lowest demand for air travel. It is also the day that Norwegian has chosen to launch its latest route from Gatwick. The destination: Reykjavik. If you thought there were already one or two flights from the London area to the Icelandic capital, you’d be right. On that quiet Tuesday alone, easyJet has four flights from three London airports: two from Luton, one from each of Stansted and Gatwick. If the timing from the Sussex airport doesn’t suit, then Wow Air and Icelandair also have planes waiting for you – with the Icelandic national carrier throwing in two more services from Heathrow. That’s about 1,500 seats already shuttling between London and the capital of a country with fewer than one-third of a million inhabitants. While a fair few of the passengers on Icelandair and Wow may be transferring to onward flights to North America, easyJet’s customers won’t.  Into this already well-served market comes Norwegian, promising seats for as little as £30. That’s for a journey that’s further than from London to Palermo in Sicily – which, in November, might be a more tempting destination. Sicily, by the way, has a population of five million, and has only two flights from London on that day. Will Norwegian still be on the route by the winter of 2017-18? The airline’s network planners clearly think so, because dipping a toe into the market is an expensive undertaking. Its Tuesday and Thursday flights could appeal to business travellers, as the first London departure of the day to Iceland. But I can’t see many executives wanting to take the Saturday afternoon outbound service, nor the inbound trip which arrives back at Gatwick at 10.45pm. Should your travels take you north this winter, prepare for the lowest air fares in history between the UK and Iceland. But history also tells us that fares wars rarely stretch beyond a season before one or more of the players retires hurt, and tries to think of the next great destination.  More about: Business Travel cheap flights Iceland Reykjavik Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

But unlike Kiwisaver, ordinary working people in NZ don’t have any choice about where NZ Super invests our money even though we are paying for it," said Auckland Peace Action member Valerie Morse "It is totally abhorrent that our retirement fund is making money from war," said Ms Morse. "Our screens are filled with the horrors of war every day. We see children being killed by bombs and missile strikes across the Middle East. The very least we can do is to make sure that we are not contributing to this devastation." "It doesn’t take an investment specialist to know that investing in war is wrong and unethical. Weapons companies profit from war and misery." The NZ Super Fund currently has $27 million in investments in Boeing, $7.6 million in BAE, and $9.1 million in Raytheon. These are just three of many of the companies that NZ Super invests in that are involved in weapons production. Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

(Photo: Robin Buckson / The Detroit News)Buy Photo While thousands looked to the sky Sunday at the Thunder Over Michigan Air Show at Willow Run Airport, a pair of co-workers enjoyed the view from 2,000 feet up. The air show featured modern aircraft such as L-39C Albatros Jets, flown by France’s Breitling Jet Team, along with a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor and a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet — but Jim Queen and Mario Vano came for a 71-year-old Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. Both men’s grandfathers fought in WWII aboard the same model; Queen’s grandfather was killed within a month of flying missions, while Vano’s grandpa was a gunner on one of the planes, which featured 50-caliber machine guns. The two men, who work side-by-side at Rizzo Environmental Services in Sterling Heights, grinned as the propellers began to whirl, the engine whined and the airplane shook. “You better be good with your maker when you go up in one of these things,” Queen said as the airplane rumbled down the runway and lifted off. It was a bumpy half-hour ride, with the plane ascending to 2,000 feet. After takeoff, Vano unstrapped his seat belt to explore the aircraft, while Queen stayed in his seat, snapping pictures of the landscape outside the small windows. After the plane touched down, Vano uttered a one-word review: “Awesome.” “We both have ties to this airplane,” Queen added. “This was really cool.” David Callanan, director of outreach services for the Yankee Air Museum, which restored the B-17, said people often get emotional when they see the airplane. “I’ve seen WWII vets with tears in their eyes when they see how we take care of the airplane that means the world to them — and that means the world to us,” he said. Callanan’s grandfather also flew B-17s during WWII. “I’m not a veteran, but this is one way I can honor our veterans,” he said. The theme of this year’s air show was helicopters, which was a departure from the usual WWII theme, air show director Kevin Walsh said in a news release. The show, themed “HELOtown USA,” hosted helicopters from around the world, including the Soviet Mi-24 Hind, AH-1 Cobra, CH-47 Chinook and UH-1 Huey. “We have a unique show in so many ways,” Walsh said in the release. “From the jet team and all of the helicopters to the WWII and modern battle re-enactments.” The air show is a fundraiser for the Yankee Air Museum. “It costs a lot of money to restore and maintain these old planes,” Callanan said. ghunter@detroitnews.com 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2bNeAcI TOP VIDEOS Detroit police on shooting of WSU officer 3:23 Pistons return to Detroit 2:35 Apartment manager talks about police shooting 1:36 Surveillance video of armed robbery on East 7 Mile 1:26 Surveillance video of truck connected to fatal hit-and-run 0:05 Meryl Davis and Charlie White skate at Campus Martius 0:47 Robert P.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (no reporter narration) STORY: An unmanned Atlas 5 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Wednesday to put a mostly classified experimental space plane into orbit for the U.S. military. The 206-foot (63-meter) tall rocket, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, soared off its seaside launch pad at 11:05 a.m. EDT (1505 GMT) to deliver an X-37B drone ship into orbit for a fourth mission. As with previous flights, the U.S. Air Force would not say what the space plane, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, will be doing in orbit or how long it will stay there. After the X-37B is released into orbit, its upper-stage engine also will deploy 10 tiny satellites, called CubeSats. One spacecraft is a crowd-funded technology effort called LightSail to develop a propulsion system that uses the pressure of photons from the sun, a technique known as solar sailing, rather than chemical propellants.

Makona told a parliamentary committee on transport and infrastructure development that management and the board had crafted a four year recovery plan for the airline, which forecast a $7 million loss for the full-year to December despite a modest growth in the global aviation industry. The company has projected $148 million in revenue against total expenditure of $155 million in 2015. Under the proposed three-phased plan, which is yet to receive government approval, management will initiate measures that will arrest the current loss-making position before break-even and profitability. Air Zimbabwe, Makona said is currently saddled with a $298 million debt and wants government to expunge the liability. Of the debt, $272 million is local. “Honourable members, this team would be lying under oath to say that Air Zimbabwe can be turned around overnight. With the current set up of $298 million debt, it is not possible to come up overnight in a turnaround process and find ourselves in a profitable situation,” said Makona. “The economic life of our aircraft is 20 years, beyond 20 years, they are saying no matter how much you strive, you will be operating but you may not be making a profit. At 20 years our Boeing aircraft, the two types, are beyond 20 years. In terms of safety, the lifespan is 75,000 cycles, which is given in terms of landings and take-offs. At the moment, our most utilised aircraft, which is the Boeing 737 is nearing 40,000 cycles. So our aircraft in terms of utilisation, have always been underutilised. In terms of safety, they are still safe.” Global airlines are this year expected to post an aggregate net profit $25 billion from $19,9 billion reported in 2014. The airline’s general manager in charge of finance and support services, Pagiel Chimudzi said the airline is technically insolvent and requires fresh capital to turn around its fortunes. “The airline is actually insolvent, if it was a private company with no government involvement the directors would need to be prosecuted for reckless trade. This is the reality,” he said. “Maybe people have not been saying it clearly so I am going to say it clearly that what is needed from the shareholder is to put in money to pay off creditors because we owe them. Further to that, there is need to put in money to recapitalize the business.  But right now we have a situation where (the shareholder has) not put in the resources.” He compared Air Zimbabwe to “a patient who is in dire need of fluids otherwise they die of dehydration.” At the moment, the airline was getting government support on an adhoc basis, he added. Chimudzi said the Air Zimbabwe should also change its model to cater for the low end market in the face of new entrants on the domestic market. Makona said the airline is currently flying three out of its fleet of 10 aircraft and hopes to have two that are currently being serviced in neighboring South Africa by month-end. The airline also wants to reintroduce domestic flights to Buffalo Range to widen its revenue inflows. The funds, the company said would also help in acquiring two turbo prop aircraft. Last December, Makona said he expected total passenger traffic to double to 365,000 this year on increased tourists. Government has said it expects foreign arrivals to rise to 3,2 million this year from 2,5 million last year.

Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins floated outside the station’s airlock and headed towards the berthing slip once used by Nasa’s now-retired space shuttles, a Nasa TV broadcast showed. “Great view,” said Rubins, who made her first spacewalk. Since grounding the shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost of more than $70 million per person. During Friday’s spacewalk, Williams and Rubins attached an adapter onto the shuttle’s docking port that will allow commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies and Boeing to park at the station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. “It’s a gateway to a new era in commercial space,” said Nasa mission commentator Rob Navias. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing’s debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. Nasa had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. A replacement docking port is under construction and expected to be delivered to the station in early 2018. On Friday, Williams and Rubins routed a cable for the second docking port’s installation in early 2018. The astronauts had planned to tackle a few other lower-priority maintenance tasks, but Nasa decided to end the spacewalk after an intermittent communications problem developed with Williams’ spacesuit, Navias said. Williams and Rubins are scheduled to make another spacewalk on September 1 to retract a solar array cooling panel that is no longer being used and to install a high-definition television camera on the station’s exterior frame. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Hawaii is 50th American state Crime thanks to social media → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent His Majesty’s greetings conveyed Children celebrate National Day Iraq forces close in on IS fortress in Mosul Brexit fallout to cost UK £122 billion over 5 years Read More ...

The Kochi-headquartered Air India Express (AIE), which gives a taste of the cultural, national and geographical heritage of the country in general and Kerala in particular through the ‘Express Tail Art,’ is all set to give passengers a taste of various ethnic cuisines.  Speaking to Express, officials of the airline said Air India Express had a fleet of 20 aircraft, and each of them carried images of the country’s cultural ethos or geographical diversity on the tail. “On the World Elephant Day, the AIE had used its flight bearing the image of elephant as a tool to honour elephants, create awareness on the critical threats faced by elephants and to ensure their survival,” they said. Similarly, Air India had a practice of naming its aircraft, and had named its Boeing fleet after various emperors of the country. Taking a cue from that, AIE came up with one of the most unusual liveries in the global airline industry. Each of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft has a different tail art with each side of the tail reflecting a particular aspect of India. Its exotic liveries are in sync with the airline’s theme, which include ancient martial art Kalarippayattu; snake boat; painted stork; peacock; white tiger; spotted deer; dance forms like bharatanatyam, kathakali, garba of Gujarat and Assamese folk dance Bihu; historic images of Ajanta and Ellora; Charminar; the Sun Temple of Konark; Victoria Memorial; Qutab Minar; Mysore Palace; and the Mehrangarh Fort Palace of Jodhpur. The images of towering snow capped Himalayas and the sun-kissed beaches across the Indian Peninsula have also found a place on the tail of AIE aircraft. Besides, AIE is currently all set to give a taste of the ethic food to its passengers. As part of the initiative, the airline has made a provision for passengers to book their favourite ethnic dishes 24 hours in advance. The airline will serve the food items demanded by passengers onboard the flight, be it the spicy fish curry of Kerala or the sweet dessert Gulab Jamun, along with the complementary meal. “It is an attempt to give passengers a taste of their own ethnic food, irrespective of the place of boarding, and the make the trip ‘homely,” said the officials. “AIE has also started an online platform on Facebook, on which passengers can book ticket and food and even lodge complaints,” they added.

The Defense Ministry said in a statement on its website that the long-range exercises staged Aug. 19 pitted a red army against a blue one in a simulated bomber attack on a naval task force. It said the primary ships in the exercise were the Jingzhou, a latest-generation type 054A class stealth frigate of which China is planning to deploy more than two dozen, and the type 052C destroyer Xi’an. The statement made no mention of what sort of conflict the exercise was intended as a response to, prospective foes or why the Sea of Japan was chosen as the location of the drills. China claims a chain of uninhabited islands controlled by Japan. AP   Woman sentenced for exporting U.S. military gear to China A California woman has been sentenced to more than four years in federal prison for illegally exporting U.S. military gear to China including jet fighter engines and a drone aircraft. Court records show a Miami federal judge imposed the sentence Aug. 19 on 45-year-old Wenxia Man of San Diego. A jury convicted her in June of conspiring to export and actually exporting military equipment without the proper license. Federal prosecutors say evidence in the case showed Man worked with a person in China to export engines used in F-135, F-22 and F-16 fighter jets as well as an MQ-9 Reaper drone aircraft capable of firing Hellfire missiles. Man allegedly told an undercover Homeland Security Investigations agent she worked with a spy who helped the Chinese military copy items from other countries. AP   Boeing issues layoff notices to 100 employees Boeing issued about 100 layoff notices in Washington state Aug. 19. The Seattle Times reports the 60-day notices will go to 16 employees in the Commercial Airplanes division with the rest going to people in the defense division and corporate units reporting to company headquarters in Chicago. Spokesman Doug Alder says it’s possible that not all who receive the notices will be laid off at the end of two months because in many cases employees find another job at the company. Employees say the layoffs will include some staff in the flight test unit at Boeing Field. Boeing employed almost 75,700 people in the state at the end of July, down more than 3,500 since Jan. 1.

While you were sleeping: Hawks weigh on mood Aug. 23 (BusinessDesk) – The latest hawkish comments from a US Federal Reserve official weighed on equities and lifted the greenback as investors try to gauge the timing of a US interest rate increase. On Sunday Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said “we are close to our targets” on employment and inflation, adding to recent comments from his central bank colleagues that suggest the Fed might raise rates sooner than previously thought. That further raised the already-high anticipation for a speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, this Friday, at the annual central bankers’ meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Her comments will be scrutinised for fresh clues. “Stan Fischer’s comments clearly raised the risk of a more hawkish tone from Yellen on Friday,” Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York, told Bloomberg. “So that’s impacting the dollar, risk assets and commodity prices.” Wall Street was mixed. In 2.43pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.09 percent. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.03 percent higher. In 2.28pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.15 percent. In the Dow, declines in shares of Apple and those of Johnson & Johnson, last 1 percent and 0.7 percent weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Visa and those of Boeing, up 0.5 percent and 0.4 respectively. “We have been moving back and forth with this [Fed] rate increase for a while,” Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels, told Bloomberg. “If you look at valuations, they’re not particularly cheap, so indeed markets have been very well supported. Therefore, they’re worried that interest rates will go up.” Deal news offered a boost. Shares of Medivation jumped, up 19.7 percent as of 2.49pm in New York after Pfizer won a takeover battle for the maker of cancer drug Xtandi, with a deal worth about US$14 billion. Shares of Pfizer traded 0.4 percent weaker as of 2.45pm in New York. “The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,” Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer’s Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.1 percent slip from the previous close, as a drop in mining stocks weighed on the market. France’s CAC 40 index declined 0.2 percent, the UK’s FTSE 100 index fell 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX index retreated 0.5 percent. Shares of Syngenta rallied, closing 10.6 percent higher, as state-owned China National Chemical won approval from the US national security regulator for its US$43 billion takeover of the Swiss chemical and seed company. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz said it was a “major milestone for the deal,” adding in a note to clients that “approval removes a major potential hurdle and should come as a relief to Syngenta shareholders,” Reuters reported. Kepler Cheuvreux rates Syngenta shares a “Buy”.

Designed by Northrop in the 1950s, the T-38 was the world’s first supersonic trainer aircraft. Now, after serving for over half a century, the US Air Force is looking for a replacement. Northrop’s internally-funded T-X prototype is one of four options under consideration. The defense giant has kept details of the project under wraps. But a photo that surfaced on Friday provides some idea of the new trainer. — David Kern (@David_Kern) August 19, 2016 The photo, taken during high-speed taxi trials at Mojave Air and Space Port, shows a design that doesn’t stray too far from the T-38. The model is a twin-seat aircraft with wings fixed low on the fuselage, but features a single engine, unlike the twin-engine T-38. © Wikipedia/ United States Navy/ Kelly M. Agee Quite a Spin: US Navy F-35C’s 'Precision' Damages Runways The prototype was built by Northrop subsidiary Scaled Composites, despite earlier plans to work with partner BAE Systems. The T-X will compete with trainer aircraft designs from Raytheon-Leonardo, Lockheed Martin-Korean Aerospace Industries, and Boeing-Saab. The US Air Force is expected to make a decision by the end of 2017, with plans to purchase 450 of the aircraft. The photo was taken ahead of the T-X’s highly-anticipated first test flight. © Flickr/ Joint Hometown News Service 'Green Glow' Helmet Issue Is Blinding F-35 Pilots During Landing"We intend to fly the aircraft at a time which we believe aligns with the competition. So we will fly it when the competition dictates it," Tom Vice, president of Scaled Composite’s aerospace sector, said at the time.

In a video showing a panel discussion on NASA's plans towards a mission to Mars, Bill Hill, Deputy Associate Administrator of NASA's exploration systems development division, said the US agency is exploring to hand over the international orbiting laboratory to a commercial entity in the next decade. "NASA's trying to develop economic development in low-Earth orbit. Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit. We figure that will be in the mid-20s," technology website The Verge quoted Hill as saying on Monday. The news came as Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins concluded their five-hour and 58-minute spacewalk last weekend where the two NASA astronauts successfully installed the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs). The IDAs will be used for the future arrivals of Boeing and SpaceX commercial crew spacecraft in development under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme. In the video, Hill also explained how NASA is preparing for a crewed Mars mission soon. Earlier this year, NASA awarded the second round of commercial contracts to resupply the International Space Station to three private spaceflight companies - Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada and SpaceX. Every one of these companies gets at least six flights to deliver cargo to the space station, which will begin in late 2019 and extend through 2024. Orbital ATK of Virginia and SpaceX of California, the winners of the first round of NASA's Commercial Resupply Services contracts, have already used their own space capsules to send supplies several times to the orbiting lab about 400 km above the Earth.

Your mission – a DNA experiment in space to find out whether it was the sushi or burgers that were tainted with e.coli. That was the problem put to pupils and teachers at the Genes in Space workshop at the Emirates College for Advanced Education yesterday. It offered advice for pupils to fine tune their entries in the Genes in Space competition, the winners of which will have their experiments tested by astronauts on the ISS. The seminar started with a presentation about the space station and the type of experiments conducted on board. Pupils could then bounce their ideas off the co-founders of the miniPCR, a portable DNA lab that can carry out molecular biology, genetics and biological engineering experiments. The ideas included studying the effect of cosmic radiation on cancer cells, researching microgravity’s effect on vestibular ataxia – a condition in which astronauts’ balance, vision, and eyes are affected by space – and reproduction of plants in space. After the session, teachers and pupils had the chance to learn about the technologies that will be used by the astronauts. One pupil who has already had three experiments sent to space said working with the miniPCR would go a long way to help put another into orbit. "This is my first time using the machine. It’s very exciting," said Anoushka Ghosh, 13, of Gems Modern Academy Dubai. Her experiments on effects of microgravity on soft contact lenses, battery life and seed germination were sent to space this year as part of Nasa’s 2015 Cubes in Space. Maitha Al Kitbi, a laboratory technician at Al Sariya school in Sweihan, said she used a PCR machine in her previous job at a hospital laboratory, but had not had the chance to use the mini version. "The children will no doubt benefit from experimenting with it," she said. The competition, organised by the UAE Space Agency, The National and Boeing, allows pupils from Years 7 to 12 to design an experiment that addresses real challenges in space exploration. Mohammed Al Otaiba, The National’s Editor-in-Chief, said the event allowed those attending to expand their knowledge of space and microbiology, while gaining first-hand experience in the use of latest technology. "This is a one-of-a-kind workshop for a one-of-a-kind space contest, which will generate excitement not only among those here but everyone involved in the competition," Mr Al Otaiba said. Chief innovation officer at the UAE Space Agency, Sheikha Al Maskari, said she was astonished by the level of curiosity and knowledge the pupils had. "One of our main goals at the agency is to develop human capital and promote STEM learning and education and we think this competition is going to add a lot of value," she said. Ezequiel Alvarez-Saavedra, one of the miniPCR founders, told pupils theirs was only the second Genes in Space contest in the world. The other is in the US.

Blackbear Bosin, the renowned Kiowa-Comanche artist, died in 1980, a brief six years after his iconic sculpture was given to Wichita in 1974.

It has come to represent the largest city in Kansas, and was also adopted for a time by a flying unit at nearby McConnell Air Force Base, where an image of the sculpture emblazoned the sides of giant Boeing Stratotankers. The sculpture is forged from weathering steel, and stands at the eastern tip of the park.  Two bow and arrow inspired pedestrian bridges provide access to the spot, and there are nightly (weather and river levels permitting) ceremonial Rings of Fire that light the statue and the surrounding landscape.    In addition to his work as a fine artist, Bosin—the grandson of a Kiowa chief—was a veteran of World War II, and a commercial artist as well. His designs, sculptures and paintings are in several prominent public spaces, and are much sought-after by collectors. But it is his steel Keeper, designed, installed and gifted to commemorate the U.S. Bicentennial, that he created to represent a brotherhood of all Native Americans, and the confluence of all the communities of the Plains.  #native americans#rivers#fires#nature#parks#monuments Know Before You Go Keeper of the Plains statue is at the eastern point of the park at the Mid-American All-Indian Center, where the Little Arkansas River meets the Arkansas River. Entrance to the park for cars is off N. Seneca Street, and by footbridge across the Rivers. The park is free and open to the public all year (closed between the hours of midnight and 5am).

Tweet Mumbai, Maharashtra, August 22, 2016 /India PRwire/ -- Etihad Airways has teamed up with renowned Indian fashion designer Manish Malhotra to showcase the artiste's latest collection at the forthcoming Lakmé Fashion Week in Mumbai. The award-winning airline will join the highly acclaimed designer at India's leading fashion event for the unveiling of his winter collection, taking place in the country's commercial capital from August 24 - 28. Known for designing lavish costumes for Bollywood film stars and Indian cinema for more than two decades, Manish Malhotra has captured the imagination of fashionistas around the world. His opening night show on August 24, 'Etihad Airways Presents Manish Malhotra', will be shot in virtual reality allowing viewers to feel the excitement of being present at the show, whether backstage, front row or at the post-show party. It comes just months after Etihad Airways used the pioneering technology to give viewers unprecedented access to the airline's award-winning Airbus A380 by immersing them in the aircraft cabins in a virtual reality film 'Reimagine' featuring Hollywood actress Nicole Kidman. The collaboration with Manish Malhotra is the latest initiative by the Abu Dhabi-based airline following its recently-announced sponsorship efforts to become the fashion industry's preferred airline. This will help further elevate the airline's premium brand positioning alongside the world's most revered luxury brands. Earlier this year, Etihad Airways struck a comprehensive global agreement with WME | IMG as a long-term partner of the fashion industry, connecting the airline with the fashion capitals of the world. The agreement is the first multinational, multi-year airline sponsorship supporting the fashion industry. Mumbai is the latest stop in Etihad Airways' global fashion sponsorship, supporting 17 fashion week events in London, Milan, Sydney, New York and Mumbai, worldwide every year. It follows on from the airline's recent participation at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Berlin and Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia. The tie-up with Manish Malhotra, announced at a Press Conference in Mumbai today featuring an exclusive preview of his new collection, is the second designer collaboration for Etihad Airways after the successful partnership with the Oscar de la Renta fashion house in Australia earlier this summer. Patrick Pierce, Etihad Airways Vice President Sponsorship, said: "The fashion industry and Etihad Airways represent an ideal brand fit, sharing attributes of being ambitious, innovative and creative - key characteristics that are reflected in our renowned inflight service and hospitality. "We are therefore delighted to collaborate with Manish Malhotra, one of India's most celebrated fashion designers, for his opening night event at Lakmé Fashion Week. It promises to be a remarkable show featuring the same VR technology that we premiered with our recent A380 film Reimagine." Addressing the Press Conference, Manish Malhotra commented: "I am delighted to be partnering with Etihad Airways as two future forward brands come together. This will be the very first fashion show that will give viewers an experience beyond frontiers, space and time." Added Neerja Bhatia, Etihad Airways Vice President Indian Subcontinent: "Etihad Airways is a proud partner of India with the largest international network of flights connecting India and the world, with our strategic partner Jet Airways. Together with our award-winning A380 recently introduced on the Mumbai - Abu Dhabi route featuring The Residence, a stylish and iconic three-room suite in the air, this is a perfect fit for high flyers from the fashion industry. "Etihad Airways truly encompasses all areas of design, innovation and style to become the ultimate premium lifestyle airline. Our A380 service from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi and onwards to New York provides a seamless service to and from these leading fashion cities onboard our luxurious aircraft."

The Norfolks are doing marriage right Edward 18th Duke of Norfolk and his wife, Georgina, on their wedding day in 1987 Credit: Mark Richards/ANL/REX/Shutterstock Lucy Mangan 22 August 2016 • 3:31pm It seems that the secret suspicion that owning a castle could solve most of life’s problems is not as ridiculous as you might have been told (mostly by people who own castles and don’t want to give you theirs). In 2011 the Duke and Duchess of Norfolk separated after nearly a quarter century of marriage, saying they had grown apart. The duke went to the east wing of Arundel Castle, the family seat, and she took up residence in the west wing.  They were so bitterly hostile to each other that they turned down an invitation to the Royal Wedding because they couldn’t bear to be in a room together, even one so generously proportioned as Westminster Abbey.  The couple in 2008 Credit: Graham Franks/Camera Press As ever with ducal separations, there was great anxiety and speculation. Who would get custody of the dogs? The paintings? The award-winning village gastropub? But no-one need have worried. The Norfolks have unexpectedly and happily reconciled (one assumes they took it slowly – maybe a few date nights in the folly at first, some trial weekends in the gatehouse followed by a fortnight in the dower house, and so on) and it seems clear that the castle that allowed them to retreat from each other without fully rupturing the relationship must take no small share of the credit. I signed up for sex on tap, not sweating, snoring and scratching all pigging night Couples are always being encouraged to “give each other space”, by cultivating their own hobbies, their own friends, their own nights out and so on. Which is all good advice, but actually what you need first and foremost is real space. The literal, not metaphorical kind. But of course this is tricky for most of us – castle-light and mortgage-heavy as we are – to arrange. Of course there are some people for whom the whole purpose of love and marriage is to have someone with you all the time. Constant companionship is, for them, the greatest advantage of the marital state. Someone to eat with, talk with, sit on the sofa with, go to parties with – they never tire of any of it or of each other.  Arundel Castle, seat of the Duke of Norfolk, in West Sussex Credit: Derek Croucher / Alamy  These are people who need people and indeed they are the luckiest people. They love it, for instance, when a spouse shouts “What are you doing?” whenever you move out of their sightline in the house. They don’t wish you dead for that at all. For the rest of us, it’s a bit more complicated. We need those separate wings. Failing that, we must try to carve out smaller private spaces.  Couples comprising one person who executes their daily ablutions with a bucket of water and bar of carbolic and one who views the two-hour bath surrounded by candles and whale music as essential to civilised living will aim for separate bathrooms.  For introverts like me, having someone around as much as a spouse generally is, is deeply trying If you’ve got one reader and one television watcher or music lover in the pair, you will try  arrange separate sitting rooms.  Or – and anecdotal evidence gathered over many a drunken evening with my female friends suggests this might be top pick among women at least – there is the option of separate bedrooms.  As one of those friends, who shall remain nameless, once put it over a bottle of Chateau d’un Peu Too Much Information: “I signed up for sex on tap, not sweating, snoring and scratching all pigging night. GO TO YOUR ROOM.”  It is a position supported, albeit slightly more decorously by Princess Michael of Kent herself, who, when faced with the prospect of downsizing and having to reside full-time in Kensington Palace, argued that having different sleeping quarters from a husband “keeps you fresher for each other. You won’t see each other being cross or saying ‘I can’t do this up, it’s too tight!’” Couple hoping to get married get divorced by mistake Play! 01:48 I have, in my eight years of married life, tried for all of these divisions at one time or another. I managed to get a super-king-sized bed as a result, which is almost as good as separate bedrooms (“Hmm,” said my husband on our first night in it, from four feet away. “I feel it’s not so much saving our marriage as deluding us into thinking it continues to exist.” “I know,” I said delightedly. “Money well spent!”).  My husband and I both have home offices, which have been only a limited success, however.  As I type this in the (converted) loft, I can hear my husband two floors below. It sounds like he’s wrestling a bear in the wreckage of a Boeing 747 but long experience has taught me that this is just the sound of him making a cup of tea.  Soon he will stomp up the stairs, slam his own study door and return to swearing loudly at the computer. I, meanwhile, will pop another paracetamol and try and make it through another day of marital disharmony.  The more distance we could put between my need for peace and quiet and his inability to move through time and space without leaving what seems like the noise of 17 unfolding disasters behind him, the happier we – by which I mean I, who amnevertheless an important part of We – would be. Could adultery save your marriage? For introverts like me (and there are a lot more of us around than you think, because we prefer to get quietly depressed than make a fuss), having someone around as much as a spouse generally is, is deeply trying. Even if he or she is quiet, there is still a presence in the house. There are still conversations that you don’t want to have, questions you don’t want to answer, and other constant depredations – as your temperament perceives what normal people would call simple human interactions - on your resources.  Good thick walls and a discouragingly long walk between the two of you (I would paste an “Is your journey really necessary?” poster on every door along the way) is very much what’s needed here. We might not have an east (or west) wing to retreat to when the going gets tough, but most of us could carve out some space for ourselves – or our partner, if she/he’s the one prowling round the relationship like a caged lion, that loves you, but will savage you if you don’t stop smashing up Boeing 747s in the kitchen. Ahem – if we just realise that it’s a safety valve, not the thin end of the divorce wedge.  Share all the hobbies and friends you like – but give each other some space.

A recent survey of over 1,500 people in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, conducted by YouGov revealed that 43 per cent of Emirates’ residents are planning to travel during the Eid holiday. “The economic slowdown hasn't seemingly deterred UAE residents from their annual travel plans and with a wealth of cultural, relaxing and city destinations reachable from Dubai in under four hours by air, we are seeing a surge of interest for stays at our member properties in destinations ranging from legendary India and the natural beauty of Georgia to pure relaxation in the Maldives,” said Saurabh Rai, executive vice president of Preferred Hotels & Resorts, the world’s largest independent hotel brand. According to YouGov, four and five-star hotels are the top choice for families with 32 per cent of accommodation requests by UAE residents for four-star options and 48 per cent choosing to go the full luxury route. Popular destinations winning the public vote include India, just 3.5 hours away which, with the recent introduction of the e-Tourist Visa has seen rising numbers of UAE visitors since 2015. In India, the growing line-up of Preferred hotels include Chennai’s stunning The Leela Palace Chennai. This five-star hotel combines Indian tradition and contemporary comfort. Guests can enjoy the Spectra restaurant which boasts seven interactive kitchens and views overlooking the Adyar River and Bay of Bengal. The Greater Caucasus, with its dramatic mountains and abundance of outdoor activity options is becoming increasingly popular with regional travellers. Just a three hour’s flight from the UAE is Georgia, which attracted over 17,000 UAE visitors in 2015, up 687 pe cent year-on-year according to Georgian National Tourism Administration. Home to Georgia’s historic viticulture community, the five-star Hotel Kabadoni, located in the picturesque cobbled street town of Sighnaghi is one of Georgia’s most exclusive country hotels. Overlooking a vista of terracotta roofs and colourful balconies, guests can relax in the traditional Georgian interiors style in any of the 21 guestrooms or enjoy a local glass of grape at the rooftop restaurant. Egypt is another perennial favourite in the under four-hour bracket, and the country’s tourism ministry figures revealed 180,000 MENA region tourists in the first quarter of 2016. UAE visitors topped demand, with 100,000 visitors, boosting the Egyptian economy to the tune of an average US$140 per night. The ultimate R&R destination, the Maldives may be at the high end of the affordable short break spectrum, but is also a preferred destination for UAE travellers, just 4.25 hours away. Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu in the Maldives is another Preferred hotel that defines luxury escapism in every sense of the word. “The availability of low cost carriers is also helping boost demand, with Air Arabia and FlyDubai’s route networks adding new destinations all the time, and opening up a number of new and exciting destinations to intrepid travellers,” said Rai. Data released by global aviation leader Boeing, revealed that in 2015 Asian low cost carriers recorded average annual growth of 24.5 per cent over the previous decade against just 13.4 per cent by European carriers. “Staycations are also a popular alternative, and with 23 per cent of local residents unable to travel due to work commitments, a stay at our partner property Palazzo Versace, could be just the answer for 72 hours of upscale downtime,” said Rai. Newly added to the Preferred portfolio, Palazzo Versace Dubai enjoys a prime waterfront location on the Dubai Creek in the heart of the upcoming Culture Village development. With its architecturally noteworthy exteriors and interiors already attracting a host of local VIPs and international celebrities, guests enter an all-Versace environment complemented by an Olympic-sized pool and collection of on-trend restaurants. - TradeArbaia News Service   Tags: UAE | hotels | travel | Eid | Preferred | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Dubai Parks and Resorts unveils UAE National Day offers Dubai Outlet Mall to host art festival Air Arabia confirms options for five Airbus A320s Motiongate Dubai unveils sneak peak trailer of Step Up Dubai Bab Al Qasr Hotel unveils special F1 offers Kuwait Airways launches direct flights to four destinations Supercasa awards RAK hotel consultancy contract ME hotel revenues down in October, Africa results mixed Lufthansa cancels 900 flights as pilots go on two-day strike InterCon to restart work on 350-room UAE resort Jumeirah Al Naseem to open in December New digital membership card for Qatar Airways' Privilege Club members Sofitel Abu Dhabi Corniche welcomes new chef de cuisine Turkish Airlines adds new on-board entertainment option Labranda Hotels expands its portfolio in Turkey US approves Airbus sale of over 100 jets to Iran Lufthansa cancels 876 flights on Nov 23 Iata appoints new regional VP for Middle East, Africa Wyndham Hotel Group welcomes new MEA regional VP Abu Dhabi Airport welcomes over 20m passengers till Oct RJ honours best-selling travel agents for 2016 Earn Gulf Air Falconflyer miles with Al Salam Bank visa credit cards Slovenia sees rise in ME tourist numbers Dubai Culture, ArtintheCity launch 24th edition of ArtMap Etihad Aviation Group showcases future of air travel Abu Dhabi food festival to serve culinary extravaganza Wataniya Airways inks key deal to boost passenger service system Gulfstream to showcase business jets at MEBAA 2016 RAK to launch adventure tours Turkish Airlines wins new award in advertising Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

In a video showing a panel discussion on Nasa's plans towards a mission to Mars, Bill Hill, Deputy Associate Administrator of Nasa's exploration systems development division, said the US agency is exploring to hand over the international orbiting laboratory to a commercial entity in the next decade. "Nasa's trying to develop economic development in low-Earth orbit. Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit. We figure that will be in the mid-20s," technology website The Verge quoted Hill as saying on Monday. The news came as Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins concluded their five-hour and 58-minute spacewalk last weekend where the two Nasa astronauts successfully installed the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs).The IDAs will be used for the future arrivals of Boeing and SpaceX commercial crew spacecraft in development under Nasa's Commercial Crew Programme. In the video, Hill also explained how Nasa is preparing for a crewed Mars mission soon. Earlier this year, Nasa awarded the second round of commercial contracts to resupply the International Space Station to three private spaceflight companies - Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada and SpaceX. Every one of these companies gets at least six flights to deliver cargo to the space station, which will begin in late 2019 and extend through 2024. Orbital ATK of Virginia and SpaceX of California, the winners of the first round of Nasa's Commercial Resupply Services contracts, have already used their own space capsules to send supplies several times to the orbiting lab about 400 km above the Earth. US President Barack Obama has proposed $19 billion (roughly Rs. 128,000 crores) for the US space agency in the fiscal 2017 budget -- a little less that $19.3 billion Nasa received for the fiscal 2016.

Last week, Tactical Missile Systems Corporation general director Boris Obnosov told Russian media that he was confident that Russia would be introducing hypersonic missiles capable of speeds between Mach 6 and Mach 7 by the year 2020. © Photo: Youtube / Vasya Ivanov Moscow's No-Fly Zones: Russia to Get New Long-Range Missile InterceptorThe director emphasized that such weapons would significantly weaken the potential of enemy missile defense. "It's obvious that with such speeds – when missiles will be capable of flying through the atmosphere at speeds of 7-12 times the speed of sound, all [air] defense systems will be weakened considerably." Tactical Missile Systems Corporation (KTRV by its Russian acronym) is based in Korolyev, outside Moscow. Several dozen specialized research institutes and industrial enterprises are involved in the development of Russia's hypersonic missile potential, with KTRV a leader in this area not only in Russia but also compared to defense engineering companies globally. Obnosov's comments come on the heels of a recent speech by Admiral Cecil Haney, the Head of US Strategic Command, in which the admiral warned that American anti-missile and anti-aircraft defense systems will be virtually incapable of intercepting the Russian hypersonic systems expected to be deployed soon. Commenting on these developments in a piece for Svobodnaya Pressa, Russian defense analyst Vladimir Tuchkov pointed out that while supersonic weapons have become a very popular topic of discussion today, their development actually began much, much earlier, going back to the Cold War. The analyst recalled that "in the 1970s, the Raduga Design Bureau, now a part of KTRV, began research exploring the possibility of creating a cruise missile with a speed of Mach 5 or greater. At the time, the problem was little studied. Firstly, it was impossible to use ordinary turbojet engines for speeds in excess of Mach 3. The sharp increase in air speed pressure resulted in a loss of efficiency in the engines, with a sharp rise in temperature in the combustion chamber of the air-fuel mixture also reducing efficiency. The higher the temperature, the lower the thrust. Moreover, as temperatures rose, so too did the risk of the rocket's turbine blades becoming deformed and simply melting." © Photo: YouTube/ styropyro Pentagon Developing Secret Anti-Drone Death Laser and They Want Your Help!"In this situation," Tuchkov noted, "the only option is the use of a ramjet engine — in this case a hypersonic scramjet. The use of a rocket engine, either liquid or solid fueled, for cruise missiles, is impossible, since the entire trajectory of the flight must be actively controlled and adjustable." "The design of the scramjet is very simple, with the number of moving parts reduced to a minimum. Theoretically, these craft can reach speeds of up to Mach 25, although the practical ceiling of operation is about Mach 17-19. However, the scramjet also has a significant drawback – its normal operation begins at speeds exceeding Mach 3. Before this speed, it is necessary to accelerate the missile using a solid booster, or some other method, similar to the kind used to launch a high-speed aircraft." The analyst recalled that when development of hypersonic missile technology first began in the Soviet period, one of the key problems for engineers was overheating. "It was necessary to create the kind of heat shield through which the onboard flight control equipment would continue to work flawlessly." In the 1980s, Raduga Design Bureau created several prototypes of a new cruise missile – the Kh-90, NATO codenamed Koala. The cruise missile weighed 15 tons, had a length of 9 meters, and a 7 meter wingspan. With an expected range of up to 3,000 km, the missile had a design speed of Mach 5. © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov A hypersonic missile design displayed at an exhibition staged by the Raduga Design Bureau "The project," Tuchkov noted, "advanced far enough for several test launches to be conducted. During the last of them, the missile reached speeds ranging from Mach 3 to Mach 4." The missile was aircraft-launched. Of course, "all of the USSR's hypersonic weapons designs were strictly classified. It was only due to the fact that the project was closed in 1992 thanks to a lack of financing and the collapse of the defense industry in general that some information about the Kh-90 has become publically available." After a period of stagnation in the 1990s, development resumed. Today, the analyst noted, Russia has reached a point where it has created and is actively testing at least two hypersonic systems. "This includes the 3K-22 Zircon anti-ship cruise missile, the main developer of which is the NPO Machine Building plant in Reutov, outside Moscow, which is also part of KTRV. At the same time, an export version of the missile, known as the Brahmos, is being developed for the Indian Navy." © Photo: militaryrussia.ru The Indo-Russian BrahMos II hypersonic cruise missile (pictured here at Defexpo 2014) is the export variant of the Russian 3M22 Zircon missile The first information about the Zircon appeared in 2011, with testing beginning a year later. "To date, five test launches have been made…During the last launch, in March of this year, the rocket was successfully tested in normal operation mode." Effectively, Tuchkov noted, "work on the Zircon is progressing so rapidly that the first state testing is expected to begin next year, and mass production the year after that, in 2018. In this connection, the Tactical Missile System Corporation director's forecasts about the year 2020 looks quite modest." © AP Photo/ DARPA STRATCOM: Russia's 7,680MPH Hypersonic Glider 'Challenges' America’s Defenses"Of course, he is talking about speeds of Mach 6-7, while the Zircon's design speed is 'only' Mach 5. Various estimates suggest its range may be between 400 and 1,000 km. Precise information on the engines is not available, but informed analysts suggest that acceleration is carried out via a reactive solid booster, with a scramjet used as the main engine." Furthermore, the Zircon has already been slated for installation onboard the heavy nuclear missile cruisers — the Peter the Great and the Admiral Nakhimov. It is also expected that a new Russian nuclear submarine, codenamed Project-Husky, currently under development, will be equipped with the Zircon. "As for Project 4202, it appears that this system will be able to meet and surpass the speeds discussed by Tactical Missiles Corporation's director. This missile too is being developed by the NPO Machine Building plant. To be more precise – this is not an independent missile, but rather a warhead onboard an intercontinental ballistic missile, which, after separation from the launch vehicle, acts like a hypersonic cruise missile would, maneuvering freely to determine direction and pitch." According to informed estimates, Project 4202 is capable of speeds between Mach 7 and Mach 12. For this reason, Tuchkov noted, the system can overcome "not only modern means of US missile defense, but even those systems which American engineers have not even begun to develop yet." © AP Photo/ U.S. Air Force via AP US Missile Designed to Challenge Russia's Sarmat ICBM a Decade Behind ScheduleThe testing of Russia's hypersonic gliders is taking place using the tried and true RS-18B 'Stiletto' silo-based ICBMs, used to accelerate them up to the appropriate speed. "After being adopted by the military, Project 4202 will be installed aboard the new RS-28 Sarmat, and on future Russian ICBM designs. This is expected to take place between 2020 and 2025. When the expected first batch of 20 supersonic warheads is rolled out, it will effectively make the US missile defense system pointless. Every Sarmat will feature three hypersonic combat gliders." Foreign Analogues: USA Of course Russia is not the only country engaged in the creation of prospective hypersonic weaponry. The X-51, being developed by the Boeing Corporation under the aegis of the Pentagon's 'prompt global strike' concept, is expected to reach speeds of Mach 6-7. Testing began in 2010, but, as Tuchkov pointed out, none of them have been deemed successful so far. Brought into the air aboard a B-52 strategic bomber, the X-51, with a range of 500 km, has clocked a maximum speed of Mach 5.1. "However, all flights ended in the destruction of the test missile before the end of its planned flight." US Air Force The US experimental X-51A Waverider aircraft tucked under the wing of a B52 bomber. "Setting out on this costly project, the US positioned it as a tool for effective and lighting-speed strikes against terrorist groups. However, there is no doubt that the Pentagon also had in mind the traditional confrontation with Russia, and against a rapidly developing China. Yet the X-51, even if it is brought into mass production, will not solve the problems it was designed to handle, since the prospective Russian S-500 anti-aircraft missile system is expected to be capable of destroying hypersonic missiles." © Photo: Rex Features DARPA Sets Sights on Robotic Space Plane for Next Generation WarfareIn this sense, Tuchkov noted, the DARPA program's Falcon HTV-2 has better characteristics in terms of its speed, having been successfully clocked at Mach 20. But the vehicle was launched from near space, first carried up by rocket booster, from where it hurled back down to earth.  "In other words, there's nothing new here; the US Space Shuttles and our Buran flew in similar fashion. Following the second test, which took place in 2011, the missile was recognized as unpromising, since it was almost uncontrollable, and impossible to establish communications with." Foreign Analogues: China China too is actively involved in the development of hypersonic technology, beginning with its WU-14 rocket, which began testing in 2013. An average of three tests per year has taken place since then. The system's declared speed is Mach 10, although as Tuchkov pointed out, a variety of contradictory information has been circulating, estimating speeds from Mach 1.5 to Mach 7. © Wikipedia The WU-14 hypersonic glide vehicle. Artist's rendering. "Series production of the WU-14 is expected to begin in the second half of the 2020s, and it is expected to be mounted on ballistic missiles, which for the Chinese is very important. Today, only a small number of Chinese ICBMs is capable of reaching the US, giving the Pentagon the hypothetical ability to fight off a Chinese nuclear attack. For Beijing, this is not only insulting, but disadvantageous in the diplomatic competition between the powers. With the arrival of hypersonic warheads, the US is expected to 'behave' more prudently." "Another task entrusted to the new weapon is the destruction of aircraft carriers; their defenses would be powerless against maneuverable warheads traveling at speeds of Mach 10." ...

West was showing ex NAZI'S using lasers on balloons. Blowing up the internal balloons. This is early 50's . Soviets were also at it way before. AA defenses were part of Soviet scratch programs, meaning starting from scratch, way before. MANY believe as soon as BALLOONS were used to watch and drop things. But the evidence may been lost. What is known on Soviet is just SALVAGE. Must was destroyed, to keep west away from it. Like the RD 170 rocket engines. They were ordered destroyed, because the world had nothing even close. They instead hid them. And many things will be un earthed eventually. Reason west is DESPERATE to break up Russia continent in small parts. Japan will get all Kuril and parts of far east.. they have it all divided. Russia MUST get strong and find spies etc FAST. Tomorrow? That was yesterday.

Image via NASA NASA has always said the International Space Station (ISS) would not be a permanent project in Earth’s orbit, but now it has revealed that, within a decade, it hopes to sell off the station to a private company. As the largest human-constructed object in space, costing more than €100bn, the ISS remains one of humankind’s greatest engineering achievements. However, in the years that have passed since the first modules were launched into orbit in 2000, it has become clear that international space agencies like NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and Roscosmos are not going to fund it forever. While new modules are currently being installed on the ISS for scientific-testing purposes, NASA has now revealed during a panel discussion on its future mission to land humans on Mars that the ISS will be sold off to private space company within the next decade. Its aim, according to NASA’s deputy associate administrator for exploration systems development, Bill Hill, is to work with private space companies to help us get to Mars faster than NASA could achieve on its own. During the discussion, Hill said: “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-earth orbit, we figure that will be in the mid-20s.” This would follow the intentions of the current US presidency under Barack Obama, which had penned 2024 as the final year it would directly fund the ISS, despite Boeing’s efforts to conduct a feasibility study to see if it could last until 2028. In fact, Boeing has already contributed to the space station’s commercial future with the installation of a new docking bay. Capable of hosting two astronauts, the docking bay will act as the commercial hub for the ISS and is designed to be compatible with Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon craft.

TrendsViral The Outer Space Treaty is the product of mankind’s bid to reach the stars. Enacted in 1967, the UN resolution set the standard for conduct in space, essentially warning nations to never claim sovereignty over the Moon or stockpile nuclear weapons on future space stations. “States Parties to the Treaty undertake not to place in orbit around the earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in any other manner,” Article IV of the treaty reads. 49 years ago today the Outer Space Treaty was signed banning orbital WMDs and military actions on the moon. pic.twitter.com/BhbnscqaFd— Chester Fritz Lib. (@UND_CFLibrary) January 27, 2016 First signed by the USSR, the United Kingdom and the US, the treaty has since grown to include 104 countries, such as China, Iran, North Korea and India. Smaller nations such as Haiti, San Marino and Nepal have also promised to keep the peace and pay for any damage they might cause while shuttling astronauts or equipment around the universe. Intergalactic space race? It is of course unlikely that planet-sized death rays will pop up around the universe anytime soon. But inch by inch, step by step, some of the world’s superpowers are preparing to defend themselves way beyond their borders, thus heightening the chances of deadly force being used in space. Weapons of mass destruction are in theory forbidden from entering orbit. But hardware - some carrying real arms, others only displaying potential - have already reached beyond the atmosphere, in the guise of secretive, or at least hush-hush, tests. In fact, the existence of intergalactic weaponry goes back as far as the 1970s. US On Friday, the US Air Force fired two new satellites into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch is part of the obtusely-titled Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP), designed to track “man-made orbiting objects” floating around the major satellite channels above earth. There are now four operational GSSAP satellites in total. The US Air Force remain coy about their purpose, saying they will perform “rendezvous and proximity operations”, collect data and help prevent satellite collisions. However, it is thought their development is also part of efforts to pre-empt space weapons the US government believes its rivals are developing, such as satellite-destroying ‘space mines’. A statement released to USA Today suggests as much. “The space domain has increasingly become congested, contested, and competitive,” Air Force Space Command spokesperson Lt Sarah Burnett is quoted as saying. “Some countries have clearly signaled their intent and ability to conduct hostile operations in space as an extension of the terrestrial battlefield.” A 2008 operation provides some evidence that the US has what it takes to militarise space. Back then a SM-3 missile fired from the naval cruiser USS Lake Erie blew up a US spy satellite about 250km (155 miles) above earth.   The use of Boeing’s X-37B OTV by the US Air Force has also raised concerns that the ‘space plane’ could one day be deployed as a weapon. A fact sheet drawn up by the Secure World Foundation, which advocates “peaceful” operations in space, states the vehicle has a “near zero” chance of being an “orbital weapons system.” The group do, however, suggest it could be used to “rendezvous and inspect satellites, either friendly or adversary, and potentially grab and de-orbit” them. China In 2007, the nation fired a missile from its Xichang Space Center which destroyed defunct weather satellite, Fengyun 1. Since then the lack of information surrounding Chinese space launches has aroused suspicion. A 2015 US Congress report on China’s military capabilities highlighted a number of suspect tests carried out by the nation, including a case in 2013 where an unidentified object reached an altitude of 30,000km before re-entering the earth's atmosphere 9.5 hours later. In that time no satellites were released, with US surveillance suggesting the incident was “not consistent with traditional space-launch vehicles, ballistic missiles or sounding rocket launches used for scientific research.” READ MORE: China missile test reignites ‘satellite killer’ fears Further images from a test last year did little to quell rumors the Chinese government was ramping up its space capabilities.

After all, the Soviet Union was regarded as one of the first governments to develop ASAT (anti-satellite) technology. A top secret experiment on board the Soviet Almaz space stations resulted in a cannon being fired remotely in space back in 1975.

Since then Russia has mostly focused on building up its satellite surveillance, but has also moved to prevent armaments reaching space. In 2015, Russian delegates presented a “No First Placement of Arms in Outer Space”resolution to the UN General Assembly.

Preferred Hotels & Resorts' properties ideally situated for short breaks with a collection of world-class hospitality experiences available in under four hours' flight time from Dubai 22 August 2016 According to Preferred Hotels & Resorts, with the Eid holidays on the horizon UAE residents are gearing up for a short getaway with easily accessible destinations the top choice as summer winds down. A recent survey of over 1,500 people in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, conducted by YouGov revealed that 43% of Emirates' residents are planning to travel during the Eid holiday. "The economic slowdown hasn't seemingly deterred UAE residents from their annual travel plans and with a wealth of cultural, relaxing and city destinations reachable from Dubai in under four hours by air, we are seeing a surge of interest for stays at our member properties in destinations ranging from legendary India and the natural beauty of Georgia to pure relaxation in the Maldives," said Saurabh Rai, Executive Vice President of Preferred Hotels & Resorts, the world's largest independent hotel brand. According to YouGov four and five-star hotels are the top choice for families with 32% of accommodation requests by UAE residents for four-star options and 48% choosing to go the full luxury route. Popular destinations winning the public vote include India, just 3.5 hours away which, with the recent introduction of the e-Tourist Visa has seen rising numbers of UAE visitors since 2015. In India, the growing line-up of Preferred hotels include Chennai's stunning The Leela Palace Chennai. This five-star hotel combines Indian tradition and contemporary comfort. Guests can enjoy the Spectra restaurant which boasts seven interactive kitchens and views overlooking the Adyar River and Bay of Bengal. Advertisement The Greater Caucasus, with its dramatic mountains and abundance of outdoor activity options is becoming increasingly popular with regional travellers. Just a three hour's flight from the UAE is Georgia, which attracted over 17,000 UAE visitors in 2015, up 687% year-on-year according to Georgian National Tourism Administration. Home to Georgia's historic viticulture community, the five-star Hotel Kabadoni, located in the picturesque cobbled street town of Sighnaghi is one of Georgia's most exclusive country hotels. Overlooking a vista of terracotta roofs and colourful balconies, guests can relax in the traditional Georgian interiors style in any of the 21 guestrooms or enjoy a local glass of grape at the rooftop restaurant. Egypt is another perennial favourite in the under four-hour bracket, and the country's tourism ministry figures revealed 180,000 MENA region tourists in the first quarter of 2016. UAE visitors topped demand, with 100,000 visitors, boosting the Egyptian economy to the tune of an average US$140 per night. The ultimate R&R destination, the Maldives may be at the high end of the affordable short break spectrum, but is also a preferred destination for UAE travellers, just 4.25 hours away. Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu in the Maldives is another Preferred hotel that defines luxury escapism in every sense of the word. "The availability of low cost carriers is also helping boost demand, with Air Arabia and FlyDubai's route networks adding new destinations all the time, and opening up a number of new and exciting destinations to intrepid travellers," said Rai. Data released by global aviation leader Boeing, revealed that in 2015 Asian low cost carriers recorded average annual growth of 24.5% over the previous decade against just 13.4% by European carriers. "Staycations are also a popular alternative, and with 23% of local residents unable to travel due to work commitments, a stay at our partner property Palazzo Versace, could be just the answer for 72 hours of upscale downtime," said Rai. Newly added to the Preferred portfolio, Palazzo Versace Dubai enjoys a prime waterfront location on the Dubai Creek in the heart of the upcoming Culture Village development. With its architecturally noteworthy exteriors and interiors already attracting a host of local VIPs and international celebrities, guests enter an all-Versace environment complemented by an Olympic-sized pool and collection of on-trend restaurants.

Speaking to Flightglobal at the World Routes conference in Durban, the airline boss says the Harare-based carrier will “continue to make efforts to engage the necessary stakeholders so that it comes to fruition by the end of the year”. Makona says the Zimbabwean flag carrier is in the midst of its “relaunch phase” and says that “at the heart of that strategy is growth so we really intend to grow our route network and very soon we will also be implementing our long-haul routes, London Beijing very soon”. The airline chief says Air Zimbabwe is currently operating from Harare to Johannesburg, Lusaka, Victoria Falls and Bulawayo. Makona says the the Harare-Joahnnesburg route is the most lucrative in the network. The African airline currently has eight aircraft of which six are operational says Makona. This includes three Boeing 767s, two 737s and an Airbus A320. Makona says the carrier is currently evaluating its fleet expansion options, with both Airbus A320s and A330s or alternatively the Boeing 787 under consideration. The airline executive says the carrier is currently in a “transformative process of transforming the airline from non-profit to profitability” adding that since relaunching operations in 2013 Air Zimbabwe has managed to reduce its losses. Air Zimbabwe is targeting break even this year with Makona adding: “This is our intention we believe we can achieve that”.

CHRIS J. KRISINGER Just when U.S. airlines are experiencing an active summer travel season, with four percent more passengers expected than last summer’s banner year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) weighs in on the industry. Their recent verdict: “planet-warming pollution produced by airplanes endangers human health by contributing to climate change.” Such is the basis for their “endangerment finding” under the Clean Air Act, which now triggers the legal requirement to impose the first-ever government regulations of aircraft emissions and extend the EPA’s reach into yet another segment of the U.S. economy. The announced plan to reduce aircraft emissions takes place as President Obama seeks to bolster his climate change legacy with new policies in the last months of his administration. Airline regulation would be among the final pieces of his contentious and sweeping second-term climate agenda, which included his role in last year’s Paris agreement to commit some 200 countries to act to reduce carbon emissions. The EPA takes its lead to restrict and regulate in the name of climate change from those broad administration themes. President Obama declaring the debate settled, “climate change is a fact” -- with that statement’s embedded presumptions of human-caused global warming and necessary exigent actions to avert catastrophic climate disruption -- has already provided the EPA with justification for carte blanche regulatory action in several key sectors of the U.S. economy such as power plants and autos. Similarly, any coming regulation of airline emissions will then adhere to the administration’s Climate Action Plan to reduce carbon pollution and be justified with climate change rationale, but — importantly — imposed without regard for the collective impact of the industry’s operational realities and overall sizable contribution to the nation’s economy. Airlines have long expected such regulatory treatment. “The airline industry is not dragging its feet,” said one industry spokesperson, and to fly more efficiently and reduce emissions, the industry is “already at the edge of feasibility,” said another. Exhaust emissions are but one of many concerns. A modern airliner must also be able to operate safely, make less noise, withstand tremendous weather and aerodynamic forces, have sufficient size to carry many passengers over long distances at high speeds, and dependably fly often with reasonable operating costs -- among other factors. Within those parameters, domestic airlines will carry over 700 million passengers annually, generate revenues near $160 billion, employ nearly 545,000 people, and account for approximately eight percent of annual U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Airlines already understand it is in their own best interests to limit and reduce exhaust emissions irrespective of any government intervention. Quite simply, fuel is expensive to carry and burn. Fuel vies with labor as an airline’s biggest expense and companies work hard to find ways to reduce consumption and improve overall fuel efficiency. Nowadays, airlines are more intent than ever to improve fuel efficiency just to reduce costs imposed by fuel prices that have risen over time. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), new aircraft are 70 percent more fuel efficient than 40 years ago and 20 percent better than 10 years ago. Internationally, airlines have adopted a voluntary fuel efficiency goal to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by at least 25 percent by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, while the U.S. airline industry has set a target of an average annual improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5 percent (and has so far been successful in meeting that goal.) The world’s two largest aircraft makers -- Boeing and Airbus -- recently put into service more fuel-efficient planes -- the B787 and A380 -- designed for long-distance international routes that seek fuel efficiencies rivaling a compact car for moving each passenger a comparable distance. Engine manufacturers, in turn, fairly recently solved reliability issues so airliners can now safely fly long oceanic routes with two engines versus the previous standard of three or four. Fuel efficient high bypass “turbofan” engines are now the norm, replacing earlier less efficient “turbojet” engines. Airlines are also working in other areas to improve fuel efficiency and halt emissions growth. Among them are developing alternative fuels; refining both airport ground and flight operations; better managing air traffic; and grounding and retiring older, less fuel efficient aircraft. Pilots are also trained and directed to fly flight profiles that maximize fuel efficiency. Fuel loads for each route are precisely calculated because of costs to carry unneeded fuel, while airlines carefully monitor excess seat capacity so as to load more people on fewer flights. Why then should the EPA, with its regulatory mindset locked on climate change and egged on by hard-core environmentalists, potentially impose costly and crippling regulations without objective consideration of airlines’ operational realities and efforts?  That question is even more compelling for an industry that has proven capable of acting responsibly without unwarranted government intervention and holds ample monetary incentives to cut fuel consumption -- and thus emissions -- on its own. Government regulation of any industry, like what the EPA has in mind for the airlines, should not -- pun intended -- “fly” in Washington. Col.

The Pentagon is looking to lasers as a cheaper, more effective way to shoot down long-range missiles fired at the United States by North Korea and Iran. After experimenting with the technology for more than a decade, U.S. military officials said “directed energy” is near the point where they could use it on the battlefield. “It’s not a hope. This is what we’re doing,” Vice Adm. James Syring, director of the Missile Defense Agency, said Wednesday. “I view this [as] highly important for the future.” Syring and other military officials struck a common theme at this week’s annual Space and Missile Defense Symposium, arguing that lasers could ultimately augment existing missile interceptors. They want lasers for two main reasons: they could shoot down missiles earlier than today’s interceptors and they’re much cheaper to fire. “We have to deal with the fact that our interceptors are more costly,” said Katrina McFarland, the Army’s acting acquisition executive. “The cost dimension of warfare must be switched from our side to the adversary side.” Army leaders are concerned that they might have to fire expensive interceptors against far cheaper rockets or small drones packed with explosives. “The problem we have now is the worldwide demand for missile defense is greater than the capacity,” James Johnson, director of the Future Warfare Center of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command, said Monday at a Defense One Cocktails and Conversation in Huntsville. Congress has appropriated $119 billion for U.S. missile defense projects, including ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California, deployable THAAD interceptors, and radars, according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. The Pentagon has asked Congress for $34.87 billion for these projects between fiscal 2017 and 2021. “Spending will likely continue at roughly the current rate for the foreseeable future,” the think tank said in a recent report. The Navy recently deployed a prototype 30-kilowatt laser on the USS Ponce. The laser, it says, can shoot down small drones and disable speedboats. And it only costs less than $1 to fire compared to missiles, which usually cost millions of dollars a piece. But shooting down a missile would take far more power and hundreds of kilowatts. The technology has to shrink before a fighter jet or drone could carry a laser powerful enough to shoot down a missile. “That’s why we’re pursuing the technology in terms of trying to mature, not just the technology, but drive the size and weight down and we can start to think operationally about what that means,” Syring said. The goal is to reduce the size and weight of existing lasers, something the Pentagon has been trying to do for the past decade. Unlike existing missile interceptors, which collide with enemy rockets in the middle or latter phases of a launch, an anti-ballistic missile laser would attempt to shoot down missiles as they are being boosted toward outer space. The Pentagon tried to do this with the Airborne Laser project last decade, an expensive project in which a laser on an aircraft ultimately shot down a missile in the boost phase during a test. A major issue with the test was that the plane carrying the laser, a Boeing 747, had to get close to the site where missile launched. The massive plane had to carry chemicals needed to power the laser. The aircraft’s size made it a sitting duck to enemy aircraft and missile systems. The Missile Defense Agency plans to conduct “a lot of” testing with lasers mounted on Reaper drones “over the next few years” culminating with a “low-power laser demonstrator” project in 2021, Syring said. Pentagon officials hope to decide what that demonstrator might look like “in a few years.” The goal of that project is to fly a powerful laser at a high altitude that can track possibly kill a missile soon after it is launched, during its boost phase. In addition to lasers on drones, the Army is eying lasers on the ground to shoot down missiles. Lt. Gen. David Mann, the head of U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and Army Forces Strategic Command, who briefly spoke at this week’s conference, referenced improvements to the Army’s Avenger, a Humvee-mounted system that fires Stinger missiles at cruise missiles, with lasers or other forms of directed energy. “That’s something that’s getting a lot of interest,” he said. Tom Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said lasers might be sooner used for tactical missile defense, currently done by systems like Avenger or Israel’s Iron Dome, but in time could be mounted on drones that would attempt to shoot down the missiles soon after they blast off. The maturation of laser technology in recent years is helping to drive interest, said Doug Graham, vice president of missile systems and advanced programs for Lockheed Martin. “We’ve been putting a fair amount of efforts ourselves into maturing some of the few technologies, building on the capabilities that we have,” he said. Lockheed acquired Aculight, a Bothell, Washington-based company that builds lasers, in 2008 to better position itself to win Pentagon work. The company has also been self-funding laser development work and Lockheed is working on a 60-kilowatt laser for the Army. “We expect to see the power levels continue to increase,” Graham said. “The beauty of this is it’s still remaining pretty nice and compact.” Shooting down a missile requires more than the laser itself, it involves steering mirrors, adaptive optics and software that can track a target. Both Lockheed and Boeing – which has built a high-power laser for the Army Stryker vehicles – showed off small drones with holes burned through them by low-power lasers. To destroy a missile screaming toward outer space, a much more powerful, “couple hundred kilowatts” laser is needed, Graham said. “We’re not there yet, but I think our view is within five years, we’re going to be there,” he said. “We’ll be able to demonstrate … a lethality of the boost phase.” —Courtesy: DO [Marcus Weisgerber is the global business editor for Defense One, where he writes about the intersection of business and national security.

That doesn’t mean the $509 million project would be dead this year — there’s a workaround involving South Carolina funds that could kickstart dredging while waiting on federal lawmakers to act. But Barbara Melvin, the State Ports Authority executive who’s led efforts to get dredging authorized, said state legislators will push to get some floor time for the Water Resources Development Act during the busy post-Labor Day calendar. Without authorization, the federal government can’t devote money to the project. “It’s critical that they don’t adjourn without a WRDA bill,” said Melvin, the SPA’s senior vice president of operations and terminals. Both the House and Senate versions of the WRDA include Charleston Harbor deepening on their lists of approved Army Corps of Engineers projects. Both versions have made it past the committee level and, while Melvin said that’s helpful, “we have to pull this across the finish line.” South Carolina Senators Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham, both Republicans, have requested time to debate the bill in September. U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican whose district includes Charleston, is expected to do the same in the House. Graham, during last month’s groundbreaking for a new Mercedes-Benz Vans manufacturing site in North Charleston, reiterated his determination to find federal dollars for the harbor dredging. “We’re going to do everything we can to get it to 52 feet,” he said, “if I have to get a shovel myself.” Melvin said the House version might be the easiest to push through because “it’s a cleaner bill,” without any of the Senate provisions that might raise objections. For example, the Senate version includes revolving loan funds for drinking water and wastewater systems and financial assistance for localities with polluted drinking water, such as Flint, Mich. Even if one of the versions makes it to the floor for debate, time constraints will make passage difficult. The House will be in session from Sept. 6 to Sept. 30 before taking another recess until after the election. Senators will be in session until Oct. 7, when they will break for the election. Both chambers plan to close out the legislative session on Dec. 16. If a water bill doesn’t pass by then, the SPA could seek a permit from the Army Corps to begin dredging by using some of the roughly $300 million the state has already set aside as its share of funding for the project. The federal portion would then be used at some future date, after a water bill is approved. That’s a last-resort measure that Melvin said the SPA would rather not pursue. If nothing else, she said, Congress should at least approve the list of projects included for authorization in the current water bill. In addition to the Charleston deepening, both versions of the WRDA include authorization for more than $1 billion in navigation projects at places such as Port Everglades in Florida and Portsmouth Harbor in New Hampshire. There have been roughly 450 deliveries of Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner since production of the plane started in North Charleston and Everett, Wash. Japan’s All Nippon Airways accounts for about one out of every nine of those deliveries. ANA last week took delivery of its 50th Dreamliner — a 787-9 model built in Everett — to complete an order placed in 2004. ANA was the first airline to bring the Dreamliner into service in 2011 and the carrier has notched more than 125,000 flights with the fuel-efficient wide-body since then. “The 787 Dreamliner has played a significant role in opening up new routes into new markets, while also forming the backbone of our long-haul fleet,” Osamu Shinobe, ANA’s president and CEO, said in a statement. As part of its global expansion efforts, ANA said it plans to launch new Dreamliner routes from Tokyo to Phnom Penh, Cambodia in September and from Tokyo to Mexico City in February. Already the world’s largest Dreamliner operator, ANA has an additional 33 787s on order, including the longest and newest 787-10, which will be built exclusively at Boeing’s North Charleston campus.

NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the space station for commercial purposes.  (HO / AFP/Getty Images)   By Justin BachmanBloomberg Sun., Aug. 21, 2016 After 15 years as a pure research lab, the International Space Station might be ready for business. NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in U.S. efforts to create a marketplace in space. NASA posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it’s become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues.” “Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability.” NASA also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavours 250 miles (403 kilometres) above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an email. In its RFI, NASA stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. NASA received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, said in an email. Orbital ATK Inc., which has a NASA contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. Article Continued Below The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr., president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former NASA astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a test bed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support NASA’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion (U.S.) deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since NASA agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020.  During an almost six-hour spacewalk Friday, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, U.S.-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of deep interest to NASA might be how to minimize the harmful effects of space on the human body — from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure — as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin LLC and Virgin Galactic Ltd. are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation venue, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-earth, President Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science ... of trying things out in microgravity.” One analog to this type of exercise is the “CubeSat” initiative, in which NASA allows schools and non-profit organizations to conduct research in space. These nanosatellites, about four inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving NASA access to the research. To date, the agency has chosen 119 CubeSat missions, with 46 already launched and 29 scheduled within 12 months. NASA opened its latest round of submissions earlier this month.

"NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit" During a panel discussion on NASA’s plans for a mission to Mars, Hill discussed some of the agency’s long-term plans for reaching the red planet. These plans include close collaboration with commercial spaceflight companies such as SpaceX. "NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit," Hill said, "Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-earth orbit, we figure that will be in the mid-20s." The statement came just before astronauts aboard the station were preparing to install a new docking adaptor to the station. Hill’s timeline coincides with the Obama administration’s plans to wind down the United States' commitment to the station as it ages. The station’s operational life has been extended until 2024. The station was originally designed to last through 2015 Since construction began on the station in 2000, the International Space Station exists in a harsh environment in the 16 years that its orbited the Earth. Originally designed to last through 2015, the station’s primary contractor, Boeing, is studying whether or not it will be feasible to operate the station beyond 2028, almost twice the amount of time it was designed for. With the rise of a private space industry, and a decline in governmental commitments to the station, commercial partners will be essential in maintaining the station. However, because of the station’s cost, it’s not clear exactly what this arrangement will look like, or if any of the commercial space companies out there will be interested. As NASA sets its sights on Mars, the fate of the station will likely depend on its role in future interplanetary missions.

My brother graduated from CHS in 1962. His sons and my sons all graduated from Cathedral. Cathedral taught me what moral values and spiritual commitment means. That school made me and my sons who they are today, successful and honorable. Sadly, I cannot in good conscience support a gala that is being headlined by a racist, albeit a famous coach. Is my school that desperate for funds that we must listen to someone who supports Donald Trump’s divisive racism and cultural bias? I thought Pope Francis said this was the Year of Mercy. I will not in any way support an event that features a speaker who insults my culture, my family, my community, my school, my city and my beliefs. Do the right thing. Cancel his appearance and I will be there to applaud your courage and commitment to the history and beliefs Cathedral is so proud of. Luis Villalobos East Side Taxes and utility rates are crushing El Paso The headlines tell us that our local politicians have the audacity to give themselves a raise that exceeds my entire annual income! For what? Increased productivity? We are being overwhelmed. The El Paso Independent School District wants to spend billions in order to save money. The El Paso Electric Co. needs more profits, and not just a little increase. The police and the fire departments need a higher quality of life. We must save all the abandoned dogs and feral cats. We must feed the refugees. This nation was born of a tax revolt and surely the founders must be rolling over in their graves. Gary Gossett West Side Temporary bus stop unsafe, unclean The trolley construction on Oregon forced Sun Metro in June to relocate and consolidate several bus stops between University Avenue and Las Palmas Hospital into a single stop on Mesa alongside University Towers’ parking lot. All the previous stops had shade, benches and trash cans. The new “temporary” stop has no such amenities. I’m aged and disabled. On one particularly hot afternoon, I nearly passed out at that stop waiting for a late bus. Meanwhile, the lack of even one trash receptacle often leaves that stop an eyesore, litter covering the ground. Sun Metro’s rule of no eating or drinking on buses (which some drivers enforce, others don’t) forces riders to drop their containers on the ground before boarding, thus breaking the state’s anti-littering law. "Don't mess with Texas" indeed! If Sun Metro cannot provide shelter or benches at that stop for whatever reason, could it at least move one or more trash cans from the out-of-service stops to this one so people will stop littering? Leo Miletich Sunset Heights Don’t forget cost of moving EPISD HQ With all the attention on the $669 million bond issue for EPISD, one thing has been dropped out of the equation, the need for a new central office complex to replace the Boeing site. The district is several years behind in building on land they already own in the Northeast, or acquiring a new property, such as the Downtown site they are looking at. The Northeast site would be the best choice as it is already owned by the district, has room for any size complex they wish to build, room for parking, and more importantly, room for the planetarium, which is a great teaching tool. The Downtown site is too small for district needs, and no room for the planetarium. But, with either choice, or another, certificates of obligation, separate from any bond election would have to be used. These do not have to have voter approval and would further impact any future tax rate. Why has the board been very quiet about this ongoing problem? Robert Word West Side Angry at taxes? Then vote in November EPISD is requesting a bond issue that would increase taxes. The county commissioners just voted themselves a hefty raise. El Paso Electric is increasing our rates, and now, University Medical Center is requesting a tax increase. How is anyone going to improve their quality of life with these constant tax increases? Go to the polls in November El Paso and vote. Vote for the people that are going to stop taxing us into the poor house.
