 A pilot describes what it was like to fly Hong Kong's flag airline's last Boeing 747 flight Simon Parry, South China Morning Post Oct. 9, 2016, 12:38 PM 22,010 facebook linkedin twitter email print A 747. Cathay Pacific Captain John Graham has good reason to feel a rush of nostalgia as he takes his seat in the cockpit for the last Cathay Pacific Boeing 747 passenger flight. He has flown this iconic aircraft for more than 30 years and this very machine was the setting for a meeting that turned his life upside down. "This is a bittersweet moment for me. I love this aircraft," he tells passengers as he prepares to take off from a rain-swept Haneda Airport, in Tokyo, Japan. "On a personal note, this is the aircraft I met my wife on. She is here with me on the flight deck so we're having quite an emotional time up here." Graham and his wife met 12 years ago, he explains, after we touchdown in Hong Kong. "One day on a flight to LA, the cockpit door opened and this beautiful face said, 'Captain, would you like a cup of tea?'" he recalls. Standing coyly beside him, Patsy seems embarrassed and flattered in equal measure. "I was really quite touched," she smiles. "I didn't think he'd make that announcement on the plane." This love story seems a fitting send-off for the 747 — an aircraft that captured people's hearts and imaginations in a way no other has before or since, with the possible exception of Concorde. The jumbo jet began life in an age when people wore suits to fly, air travel was exclusive and mysterious, half of the passengers lit up cigarettes as soon as the seat belt sign went out and the lives of captains and flight attendants seemed impossibly glamorous. Today, of course, the many of us who regularly take to the skies plop ourselves grumpily into cramped seats beneath overstuffed overhead lockers, yank down the window blind to sleep or endure mediocre service and bad food from harassed flight attendants until it's time to fight our way out of the air­craft to join another tedious immigration queue in another indistinguishable grey airport. Cathay Pacific is under pressure from budget airlines and falling profits, under prolonged assault from its pilots' union over pay and conditions, and under fire from many customers for what they see as falling standards of service in return for premium prices. But although the fanfare surrounding the 747's retirement may invite unfavourable comparison, the sight of the distinctive, magisterial double-decker hump rolls back time to when flying was an adventure to be savoured. An in-flight meal. Cathay Pacific A different era Back then, so it seemed, love was always in the air, at least for the aircrew. The jumbo's arrival meant long-haul flights — which meant long stopovers in exotic faraway destinations. "For the first time, we would spend time together and go out to dinner and sightseeing," says one former 747 flight atten­dant. "The pilots and the cabin crew had time to socialise together. It led to a lot of romance and a lot of marriages — and a lot of divorces, too." Cathay Pacific took delivery of its first 747 — a 200 model — in August 1979, nine years after American airline Pan Am had become the first to use the aircraft, and its first ultra-long-haul 747-400 in 1989. In 1998, the first plane to land at Chek Lap Kok was a Cathay Pacific 747-400 operating the first ever non-stop passenger flight from New York to Hong Kong: an epic 15-hour, 35-minute journey over the North Pole officially called Polar One. Fittingly, the same plane was chosen for the final Boeing 747 passenger flight last weekend (Cathay will continue to use 747s for cargo flights). The 747, of which 1,523 have been built since 1968, was more than just an upgrade. It was transformative and revolution­ary, helping generate a boom in international travel and playing a role in turning Cathay Pacific from a regional to a global airline. It put Hong Kong within easier grasp of millions of tourists and other visitors. At their 1990s peak, there were more than 30 Boeing 747s in the Cathay passenger fleet and it was the workhorse for every major long-haul carrier. For those aged 30 or above, the chances are the plane that carried us on our first flight between Asia and Europe would have been a 747 and for most of us, the closest we got to the top deck was to gaze fleetingly up the stairs as we turned right on entry. Now the plane called the "queen of the skies", although it is more commonly referred to simply as the jumbo jet, is being phased out by major airlines in favour of smaller, quieter and more economic twin-engine planes. Air France has retired its 747 fleet and British Airways is expected to phase out its remaining 747s by 2020. Nevertheless, its place in modern history is such that it wasn't just plane spotters who bought tickets months in advance and headed to Tokyo for Cathay's 747 send-off, on October 1. Everyone wanted to be on board, it seemed. Cathay Pacific Memories "I have so many memories tied to this plane," says man­age­ment consultant Boris Van, who bought a business-class seat for the final flight. "When I was a kid, whenever we went on a holiday we would always go on this plane, whether it was short haul or long haul. So there was always a sense of excitement. "It's not just another plane. The [Airbus] A380 doesn't come close. The new planes don't have the sense of grandeur and majesty. It is the design and the history of it. It was always such an experience being on this plane." Polish-Australian twins Paul and Bogdan Wlodek, 49 — who both work as ground staff for Qantas in Canberra — flew up specially to join the flight. "Our very first flight was on a 747, from Sydney to Bahrain," says Paul. "This aircraft is an icon and it's getting harder and harder to fly on it." One 14-year-old expatriate boy, who studies at an inter­national school in Hong Kong and who I agree not to name, is playing truant to be on board the 747's last passenger flight to Tokyo and back. "I just wanted to be on this flight because it's the last one," he says, as he prepares to board with his flight-attendant father, who helped him skip a day of school. The teenager says his ambition is to work as a flight engineer. When I ask him what makes the 747 so special, he replies instantly, "The hump." "The shape is very distinctive," agrees Tony Britton, a senior Cathay Pacific engineer and aircraft project manager. "The only airplane I see people taking an interest in when it comes into the terminal is the jumbo. It has this presence about it and people are drawn to it like magnets. "Everyone gets out their phones and cameras and suddenly 10 people will be videoing it as it comes in. A [Airbus] 330 or a 777 doesn't quite have the same impact." Britton, who has worked on 747s since he was an apprentice engineer in Britain more than 30 years ago and helped see off the last 747 flight out of Hong Kong's old Kai Tak Airport, in 1998, took his own two sons, aged 13 and 16, on one of the aircraft's last flights to Tokyo and back. "My youngest son got the biggest kick out of it," he says. "We were very lucky and managed to get on the upper deck. He put his bed down flat and he was lying on his tummy up against the window just looking out and he thought it was so cool." Britton would be back at work on the ramp as the last flight took off from Hong Kong. Hong Kong. Shutterstock/cozyta "It's the end of an era," he says. "The 747 opened up a world of travel for so many people. It turned an exclusive club into something accessible to the general public. Suddenly you had 330 seats in one plane and it can go so much further." In the 1980 spoof disaster movie Airplane! — a huge hit in the year Cathay Pacific took delivery of its second Boeing 747 — a kindly old lady sees the passenger beside her gripping the sides of his seat before take-off. "Nervous?" she asks. "Yes," he replies. "First time?" she continues, patting his hand reassuringly. "No," he says. "I've been nervous lots of times." That scene captures one of the essential differences between air travel in the early 747 era and now. "When I was trained, one of the topics we had to cover was to be observant and look out for 'first flighters' because, in the 1980s, a lot of people hadn't had the experience of flying," says Le Le Ng, Cathay Pacific's manager of inflight service standards and safety. "We had to observe and take extra care of them because they might be nervous about flying. They might not know the features of the plane. They might not even know how to press a button to call the flight attendant. "Now, nearly everyone who walks in has flown more than we do. Before, when people walked into a 747, it was a huge plane and flying was rare so everyone was excited and happy and the atmosphere was very different. Now, it's just another flight. It's nothing special." Mark Hoey, Cathay Pacific's general manager operations and a former 747 chief pilot, says, "There's never been this fanfare when we've retired other aircraft but the 747 has touched so many people, so many passengers. "People have come up to us in the past couple of weeks, when they've heard about it. I've heard of it happening at other airlines but I didn't think it would happen here. They come up to you in the terminal and say, 'Is it true; Cathay is getting rid of the 747? Who made this decision? Why are you doing that?' "I don't think anyone involved with the 747 hasn't shed a tear over this, and the passengers feel that, too. From a pilot's perspective, it's just an amazing aircraft and flying it is a little boy's dream. When the weather gets a little bit rough it rides like nothing else." Cathay Pacific had to fight a prolonged and very public campaign to get permission to use its 747s on the London route, long monopolised by British Airways. When in 1979, British Caledonian, Laker Airways and Cathay applied for traffic rights on the route, to the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), only Caledonian was successful. Cathay finally succeeded in June 1980, when the British government over­turned a CAA decision to deny the airline access to the route. "Hong Kong was trying to emerge outside being a colony and here was a regional airline whose mother country at that stage didn't want to let it happen," Hoey says. "It's a fascinating period of time and it was a triumph of the ingenuity of Hong Kong." The plane had to be modified to carry more fuel to fly to London at a time when the airline was unable to cross Chinese or Russian air space. "It was our die-hard spirit that made it possible," Hoey says. "We got the airways and the altitude because no one else was doing it." By a poignant coincidence, the retirement of the Cathay Pacific 747 passenger fleet came just weeks after Joe Sutter — the man who designed the 747 and its distinctive hump — died, at the age of 95. "I was privileged to attend his memorial service in Seattle — there were people there from all around the world," says Hoey. "He was one of the engineering masters of the 20th century and he did it all with a slide rule. When they updated the 747, they couldn't improve the fuselage. The core shape hasn't changed over all these years. There are few other things man has made that have stood the test of time so well." That is a sentiment Graham would agree with as, with his wife at his side, he bids the 747 an emotional farewell at Chek Lap Kok. "Thank you for all the memories," he says. "It's a wonderful aircraft. I've flown through typhoons, storms, dust storms, war zones even, across the highest mountains, and I've never once felt this aircraft would fail me. I'll miss it like hell." Taking off. BY/JIR/FMS/REUTERS 747 pilot Nigel Demery recalls the good old days "The 747-400 and I joined Cathay Pacific at about the same time, in 1988. The jumbo could easily take 363 passengers to London non-stop instead of having to refuel and change crews in Bahrain. Then, Cathay flew three times a week to London. Now it's six times a day. "When you sit in the cockpit you just feel at home. It's a pilot's aircraft: responsive, powerful, slick and solid. If you had to land in typhoon conditions at an airport like Kai Tak, turning low at night over Kowloon City's rooftops with Lion Rock whistling past your side and perhaps a 55km/h bumpy, gusty crosswind, then the 400 was the plane to be in. "It was Cathay's first aircraft with the now-standard six digital TV-style glass displays. All of us were more used to the old dials and round indicators that even the Wright brothers would have had. It was also Cathay's first aircraft that could land automatically in fog — a common occurrence in London in winter. "The cabin crew managed the first proper inflight entertainment system that was a stack of VHS cassette players about two metres high. We used to kid them that they hadn't turned on the correct switch to put the movie on in the cockpit. Another novelty was the crew had proper bunks — two in the front for the pilots [two working, two resting] and eight in the tail for the 18-strong cabin crew. My longest flight was back from Los Angeles in the winter with a block time of 15 hours and 25 minutes; it used to be the longest scheduled sector in the world. Bunks were an absolute necessity to remain fresh and sharp for the landing. "The 400 has a few tales to its name. Colin 'Burner' Baldwin had an engine fire on take-off at Kai Tak one night and magnificently managed to dump fuel, turn the aircraft around and land safely within 11 minutes. Mike Lowes flew the world's first non-stop transpolar flight in July 1998, from New York to Hong Kong's brand new Chek Lap Kok airport, taking over 16 hours. "Ken Carver's 45-minute flight from Xiamen to Hong Kong in January 2000 should have been a non-event. However, they suffered total instrument failure on take-off and only superb airmanship and skill recovered the aircraft safely through cloud for a successful landing. The 400 — regis­tration B-HOX — had just been painted in the 'Spirit of Hong Kong' livery, adapted from the idea of an SAR teenager, Ho Sin-yee. The Boeing 747-400: 'Spirit of Hong Kong' — apposite indeed." As told to Simon Parry Nigel Demery is a former Boeing 747-400 captain and president of the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association. He retired in 2009 after 20 years with Cathay Pacific. Read the original article on South China Morning Post. Copyright 2016. Follow South China Morning Post on Twitter.

It’s all about “carrying out what the client envisions,” says Deryl McKissack, who was in Chicago last week for meetings around town. McKissack & McKissack is based in D.C. and has had a Chicago office for nearly 20 years. Chicago Public Schools has been a longtime client. More recently, the firm helped oversee construction of the $251 million new Malcolm X College and is managing some of the $500 million McCormick Place expansion, including for the new event center and the Marriott Marquis hotel. The firm also oversaw the Ferris Wheel re-do at Navy Pier. McKissack has a home in Chicago. She is friends with health care executive Eric Whitaker, a golfing buddy of President Barack Obama, and she counts Whitaker’s wife, Cheryl Whitaker, CEO NextLevel Health Partners, as a close friend along with Seaway Bank Chairman Veranda Dickens and Midway Broadcasting Chairman Melody Spann-Cooper. In Washington, McKissack’s firm worked on the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial and on upgrades for the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials. McKissack is a descendant of slaves, so work on the African-American history museum was especially personal. “I saw the museum in several different stages of construction, but it didn’t come to life for me until I saw the exhibits,” she says. “You start out with this lonely feeling and when you leave, you feel inspired.” Boeing hopes to beat Elon Musk to be first on Mars Dennis Muilenburg | AP file photo Move over Elon Musk. Boeing plans to be the first to land on Mars. CEO Dennis Muilenburg revealed plans for a mission to the red planet last week during the “What’s Next” conference in Chicago. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at the event sponsored by The Atlantic and underwritten by Boeing. His comments came on the heels of Musk laying out his own plans to ferry passengers to Mars. Musk is the billionaire co-founder of PayPal and SpaceX, a private space cargo company. Muilenburg’s vision also includes hyper-sonic aircraft shuttling travelers and cargo to different continents in two hours or less, he says. He even foresees space hotels. Muilenburg recalled as a child building planes out of Legos and idolizing the late Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon. He went on to study aerospace engineering in college and his first job was interning at Boeing. Now in his 31st year at the company, Muilenburg sees the future in space. Boeing certainly has the track record to accomplish a Mars landing. The rocketmaker helped send U.S. astronauts to the moon in 1969. It built the first stage for Saturn V, which took astronauts to the moon and back. And Boeing has worked with NASA to develop a rocket for deep space exploration. According to the tech blog Engadget, Musks’ SpaceX is aiming for a 2024 manned mission to Mars, while NASA and Boeing hope to launch in the 2030s. Given likely delays and other factors, the blog says, it’s going to be a close fight to be first. Valerie Jarrett’s hipster mom Barbara T. Bowman, co-founder of the Erikson Institute | Courtesy of Robert Knapp Photography Barbara T. Bowman headlined The Moth, the very hip storytelling program that airs on WBEZ. The Chicago educator co-founded the Erikson Institute graduate school in child development and is mom to White House aide Valerie Jarrett. Bowman’s talk won’t be featured on the air, as she took the stage at a private event in front of 140 education wonks and Erikson supporters. Her story focused on growing up in a conservative Christian family and how she came to appreciate religious differences. It began when she ended up in the infirmary one day at boarding school. Her roommate was Jewish. “Why we began to talk about religion instead of boys, I can’t tell you,” she said, prompting a roar from the crowd. “She had beliefs that I thought were strange, and I had beliefs that she didn’t understand at all.” Bowman, 87, said she joked about the pain of eating fish on Fridays and her friend talked about her own Friday traditions. The two became “lifelong friends.” She then deftly transitioned to talking about education, a move that would have boosted her rating had she been judged in a regular Moth performance. “To be effective while working with young children and families, you must have self-awareness and pay deep attention to relationships,” she said. “That’s why we ask our students at Erikson to do what we did tonight — think about their past experiences and try to understand them from different perspectives.” The event at Architectural Artifacts was part of Erikson’s 50th anniversary celebration. Cubs Corner: Keeping mom’s passion alive Vincent Anzalone and his 18-month-old son, Luca. | Provided photo Brothers Vincent Anzalone and Dan Stelzer are among the throngs who scored post-season tickets to Cubs games. It’s thanks to their late mom. Patricia Stelzer, a lifelong Cubs fan who died of cancer in 2006 and left jewelry to her sons. After a long time on the waiting list for Cubs season tickets, Dan Stelzer, a mortgage broker, had a chance to buy. He and Anzalone decided they’d sell mom’s jewelry to purchase the season tickets knowing she’d be thrilled at their being able to fulfill a Cubs dream. Last year, Anzalone took his 18-month-old son, Luca, to his first Cubs game. “It was with tickets essentially paid for by my mother,” said the real estate broker, who also appeared on Bravo’s “100 Days of Summer.” “I don’t know if that’s a full circle moment but it’s pretty close.” Read more Taking Names at shiakapos.com.

The low-cost airline is locked in talks with major stakeholder Greybull Capital and Boeing, and expects to unveil a massive funding overhaul to satisfy the Civil Aviation Authority’s financial health check-list and clinch a new Air Travel Operators’ Licence (Atol). Monarch was granted a stay of execution by the aviation authority just four hours before its Atol was due to expire at the end of last month, and now faces another looming deadline on Wednesday when the twelve day extension expires. Monarch boss Andrew Swaffield has assured staff that the deal will go through but warned that it will not conclude before the day of the crunch deadline. In a letter sent to Monarch Airlines staff on Friday, Mr Swaffield said that the legal and finance teams are still working to “dot the i’s and cross the t’s on the largest investment in our history”. “As soon as we are able to give details of our investment and confirm the renewal I will. But to manage your expectations, this will be on the 12th (Wednesday),” he said. Credit: Oramstock / Alamy The aviation authority was initially reluctant to renew Monarch’s licence due to concerns over its available cash, but the airline is preparing to bounce back with a major new financing deal with Boeing and a fresh cash injection from Greybull Capital which owns a 90pc stake in the company. Monarch is expected to adapt an existing order with Boeing for as many as 45 new aircraft to release significant cashflow back into the business. The deal will enable the airline to enter into a “sale-and-leaseback agreement” which could see Boeing buy Monarch's order on the condition that the airline agrees to lease the planes for a set period. It is not known whether the deal spans the entire order, which includes 30 aircraft and the potential for 15 more, but the total deal for 45 Boeing 737 airliners is understood to be worth around $2bn (£1.54bn) with each plane costing about $50m. Monarch is hoping that this week’s financial injection will draw a line under a difficult two year overhaul for the airline under new owners Greybull. The fund snapped up a majority share after agreeing to pump £125m of capital into Monarch in 2014 in the airline’s third bailout in as many years. Earlier this summer Monarch warned that more funding would be needed, sounding a warning in its annual report that it was looking to secure facilities totalling £35m either from owner Greybull Capital or an outside lender. At the same time Monarch has attracted the interest of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group, which also owns ground-handling services business Swissport, reigniting speculation that a stake in the privately-held carrier may be up for sale.

Qatar has not ordered 737s previously.   Airline Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker took the opportunity of the announcement in Washington to further press Boeing to build a new jet slightly larger than the 737 to fill a gap in Boeing’s product line.   Asked in an interview when he expected to hear more about that proposed plane, Al Baker said: “Yesterday!”   Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the same interview, said Boeing continues to evaluate such a plane and talk with customers.   “I think we have a pretty good idea today as to what our customers would like to see with respect to seat count, range capabilities,” Conner said, adding that Boeing understands how quickly customers want the plane.   “Now it’s a matter of us going back and doing our homework and figuring out how do we put all of that together,” he said. “I can’t give you a real time frame on that, but we’re certainly working the heck out of it right now.”   BIG ORDER The deal for 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft is significantly larger than an order for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain’s Farnborough Airshow in July.   That announcement was postponed by Qatar in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said.   The orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional list value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX jets are purchased. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders.   Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   Qatar Airways’ order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive.   Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the United States at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer.   The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but “they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined,” Bastian said at an event in New York.   “That doesn’t sound fair, that doesn’t sound free,” he said.   The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.

The airline also signed a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices. Today’s announcement builds on Qatar Airways’ current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With this new order, Qatar Airways increases its firm order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. The announcement was attended by the State of Qatar’s Minister of Finance, His Excellency Ali Shareef Al Emadi, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and the Ambassador of Qatar, His Excellency Mohammed Jaham Al-Kuwari. "Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead,” said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker. “Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today's announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service." Qatar Airways’ relationship with Boeing was renewed in 2006. Since then, there have been many milestones in the partnership. The airline was the first to operate the 787 in the Middle East and is a launch customer for the 777X. With the commitment for the 737 MAX 8, it would be the first Boeing single-aisle airplane model to join Qatar Airways’ fleet in more than 15 years. "Congratulations to The Boeing Company and Qatar Airways on the remarkable milestone they’ve reached, which will significantly grow the number of Boeing aircraft in the Qatar Airways fleet,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. “Beyond its importance for these two companies, this agreement demonstrates the importance of global commercial partnerships in strengthening our bilateral ties. This deal will strengthen economic opportunity and job creation, and highlights the importance of strong global trading relationships." “We are so very proud that a discerning and market-leading customer like Qatar Airways not only continues to endorse our current products, but  also has confidence in Boeing’s new technology that will soon be evident on the 777X and 737 MAX,” said  Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes.” The 777-300ER is the most reliable twin aisle airplane flying today and is considered to be the flagship of the world’s elite airlines. It has the highest schedule reliability of any twin-aisle airplane at 99.5 per cent – the airplane is on time, nearly all the time. The 787-9 Dreamliner is the second member of the super-efficient, passenger-pleasing 787 family. The 787-9, a stretch of the 787-8, can fly 290 passengers 7,635 nautical miles (14,140 km) in addition to more cargo, allowing airlines the ability to grow routes first opened by the 787-8. Boeing’s newest family of single-aisle airplanes – 737 MAX 7, 737 MAX 8, 737 MAX 9 and 737 MAX 200 – builds on the Next-Generation 737’s popularity and reliability while delivering customers unsurpassed fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2017. -Ends- © Press Release 2016 © Copyright Zawya.

The order for up to 100 jetliners helps fill out Boeing’s order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus. The deal includes 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliners, 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft plus the 737 MAX 8 options. It is significantly larger than a deal for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain’s Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up US approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The firm orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX options are exercised. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Qatari order is likely to further intensify concern among US airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive. Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the US at fares substantially below what US airlines can offer. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the US state of Ohio, but “they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and US airlines combined,” Bastian said at an event in New York. “That doesn’t sound fair, that doesn’t sound free,” he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful US businesses, including FedEx Corp and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.—Agencies Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articlePeace vital to prosperity of Pakistan: APBF Next articleUNISAME urges to strengthen micro, medium sized sector Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Economy Watch Bahria Town, Hyatt Hotels sign agreement for 4 signature resort properties in Pakistan Economy Watch Dar urges SECP to create cell of experts to provide guidance on Companies Ordinance Economy Watch Dream of game-changer CPEC materialised Digital Newspaper Social Diary Oil & Gas Leap Forward Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: .....

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 8, 2016 at 12:13PM Boeing's KC-46 leads the way -- all the way to Japan. Image source: Boeing. America's defense contractors have a lot of customers, and in a lot of different countries. One of the most important of these is Japan. I know that in theory, Japan's "military" is "only" a self-defense force, but it's a big one. With an annual defense budget measured in the tens of billions, Japan has ranked as the world's 16th-largest weapons importer over the past 15 years. What's more, last year, Japan "reinterpreted" Article 9 of its Constitution to permit various forms of cooperation with military allies -- and in ways formerly verboten to the Self-Defense Forces. Already, the effects of that reinterpretation are making themselves felt. And pretty soon, they should become visible on Boeing's (NYSE:BA) bottom line. Extending Japan's wings Last month, in one of its regular "notifications" to Congress, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced that the Government of Japan has requested permission to buy four KC-46A "Pegasus" aerial refueling aircraft from Boeing. According to DSCA, selling these tankers to Japan will not "affect the basic military balance in the region." It will, however, improve "Japan's capability to participate in Pacific region security operations," improve "Japan's national security posture," and "provide Japan a needed capability to a close ally and support U.S. security interests in the region" -- as is now permitted by the reinterpretation of Japan's Constitution Article 9. Including electronics equipment from Raytheon, missile defense accoutrements from Northrop Grumman, and engines from United Technologies, the total value of the contract is expected to be $1.9 billion -- with Boeing acting as prime contractor. Boeing Stock Market capitalization $82.5 billion Revenue $96.8 billion Net profit $3.7 billion DATA SOURCE: S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE. So what does this mean for Boeing and its shareholders? The size of the proposed Japan contract is impressive in and of itself. But perhaps even more important than the dollar value is the vote of confidence Japan has given Boeing. Remember, the U.S. Air Force itself only OK'd the KC-46 for low-rate initial production (LRIP) a couple of months ago. And just weeks after that happened, Japan placed an order to buy some. Clearly, Japan is champing at the bit to buy this plane -- and where Japan leads, the hope is that other buyers will follow. This is a rare bit of good news for Boeing's KC-46A program, which has been kind of a disaster up until now. Boeing bid low to win a contract to build it for the Air Force, then was forced to eat more than $1 billion in cost overruns on the airplane's development. At this point, for Boeing to have even a chance of breaking even, it needs to sell more Pegasi than the Air Force is prepared to buy -- so as to spread out development costs among as many plane sales as possible. Japan's purchase suggests this may be a viable path forward for Boeing. Should you buy Boeing stock? It's not, however, a good reason to buy Boeing stock in and of itself. Remember, Boeing's entire military aircraft business accounts for just 14% of the company's total sales -- the company's civilian operations are much more significant -- and KC-46 is just one small sliver of Boeing's total military aircraft business. Before buying Boeing stock, you'll want to take a closer look at the company as a whole. So let's do that: Boeing Stock Price-to-earnings ratio 23.8 Price-to-free cash flow 10.6 Price-to-sales 0.85 Projected 5-year growth rate 12.5% Dividend yield 3.3% DATA SOURCES: YAHOO! FINANCE, S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE. How does a value investor use numbers like these to determine if a stock like Boeing is worth buying? Start by adding the company's projected growth rate to its dividend yield. These two numbers combined give you the "total return" you're expecting on an investment in Boeing: 15.8%. Ideally, you want to buy the stock when its price-to-earnings or its price-to-free cash flow ratio (or even better, both) are equal to or less than that total return number. Currently, Boeing's P/E ratio fails this test. But its price-to-free cash flow ratio -- actually, the valuation metric that I prefer -- passes with flying colors. Moreover, I can't help noticing that Boeing's price-to-sales ratio, which I've found especially useful for finding bargain stocks in the aerospace and defense industry, is currently clocking in well below the 1.0-times-sales rule of thumb for fair value. The upshot for investors In my book, I'm scoring Boeing at "two out of three ain't bad" on these valuation metrics. Boeing's GAAP-derived P/E ratio looks a bit high -- due, in part, to all the writedowns that Boeing has been forced to take on the KC-46 project. But its low P/FCF and P/S ratios, combined with a respectable growth rate and strong dividend yield, tell me that investors are underestimating the value in Boeing stock today. I think the stock's a buy. In fact, after crunching all these numbers, I think I just might pick up a few shares myself. Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

By Samantha Payne October 8, 2016 17:53 BST Reuters Boeing has reportedly come to the financial rescue of Monarch Airlines. Forty five new planes will be added to its fleet from 2018. The £165m (£205m) deal, the largest in Monarch's history, will secure the future of the low-budget airline. Monarch has endured a turbulent time recently, partly caused by declining demand for package holidays after terrorist attacks in Egypt and Turkey. It has also been affected by the emergence of new players such as WOW Air and Whizz Air onto the low-cost airline market. Greybull Capital, Monarch's majority shareholder, said Boeing's investment will now help the airline renew its Air Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL), which expired on 30 September. In an email seen by Sky News this week (7 October), the airline's chief executive, Andrew Swaffield, wrote:"I was at the CAA on Monday and have been spending a lot of time over the last two days with our legal and finance teams, as we dot the i's and cross the t's on the largest investment in our history - on the back of which we expect the CAA to renew our licences and which will help us move into the next stage of our growth and development. "It's been another busy week for all of us following the events of last Friday and the extension to our ATOL licences. All parts of the business are working hard, both to keep things 'business as usual' and maintain consumer and customer confidence, in the face of continued media and social media commentary and speculation. "As soon as we are able to give details of our investment and confirm the renewal I will. But to manage your expectations, this will be on the 12th (Wednesday). As said before, there is a process the business must follow and this takes time."

Ideally, you want to buy the stock when its price-to-earnings or its price-to-free cash flow ratio (or even better, both) are equal to or less than that total return number. Currently, Boeing’s P/E ratio fails this test. But its price-to-free cash flow ratio — actually, the valuation metric that I prefer — passes with flying colors. Moreover, I can’t help noticing that Boeing’s price-to-sales ratio, which I’ve found especially useful for finding bargain stocks in the aerospace and defense industry, is currently clocking in well below the 1.0-times-sales rule of thumbfor fair value. The upshot for investors In my book, I’m scoring Boeing at “two out of three ain’t bad” on these valuation metrics. Boeing’s GAAP-derived P/E ratio looks a bit high — due, in part, to all the writedowns that Boeing has been forced to take on the KC-46 project. But its low P/FCF and P/S ratios, combined with a respectable growth rate and strong dividend yield, tell me that investors are underestimating the value in Boeing stock today. I think the stock’s a buy. In fact, after crunching all these numbers, I think I just might pick up a few shares myself.

The armed forces will modify one of its $204 million KC-30A air-to-air refuelling aircraft into a VIP jet that can carry up to 270 passengers. It's not clear how much the plane, which is essentially the same as an Airbus A330 commercial jet, will cost to refit with Defence telling The Age it will come out of $190 million already set aside to alter air force aircraft. Australia is getting a 'budget' Air Force One - modifing a $204 million KC-30A air-to-air refuelling aircraft (pictured) into a VIP jet carrying up to 270 passengers It's not clear how much the plane, which is essentially an Airbus A330, will cost to refit with Defence saying it will come out of $190 million already set aside to alter air force aircraft The plan was the cheapest on the table and the result will be similar to the A330 former British PM David Cameron had modified for £10 million (A$16.5 million). Defence said modifications to the KC-30A would be 'modest' but accommodate 'the continuance of government business whilst in transit' and let the PM stay in contact at all times. It will also still be able to refuel in mid-air should this be necessary. It is basically an Airbus A330 (pictured) that has been modified The plan was the cheapest on the table and the result will be similar to the A330 former British PM David Cameron had modified (pictured) for £10 million (A$16.5 million) Defence said modifications to the KC-30A would be 'modest' but accomodate 'the continuance of Government business whilst in transit' (pictured inside of UK plane) The plane will still be far smaller and lower-tech than the American Air Force One which is a modified Boeing 747 that cost $429million.

Share this article Share Australia's Air Force One will replace two Boeing 737s that only seat 40 people each that were leased in 2002 under John Howard. Along with three smaller planes they are shared with ministers, the governor-general, dignitaries, and visiting royal family members. Australia's Air Force One will replace two Boeing 737s (pictured) that only seat 40 people each that were leased in 2002 under John Howard Their small size means business delegations and the media can't travel on the same plane as the PM and their range is limited (PM Malcolm Turnbull with Philippine ambassador) The plane will still be far smaller and lower-tech than the American Air Force One (pictured) which is a modified Boeing 747 that cost $429 million Their small size means business delegations and the media can't travel on the same plane as the PM and their range is frustratingly limited - needing two fuel stops to reach Washington. PLANES OTHER WORLD LEADERS USE USA - Boeing VC-25 (modified 747) costing $479 Million Britain - Airbus A330 converted fuel tanker costing $245 million  Indonesia - Boeing 737-800 costing $120 million Japan - Boeing 747-400 costing $300 million Mexico - Boeing 787-8 costing $287 million Russia - Russian Ilyushin 96 costing $72 million  A former adviser who often travelled on the current planes told The Age the jets were 'very small' and 'not great for the role' and needed upgrading. 'It's understandable that there has been political angst over the purchase – as there is for any large expensive that seems extravagant, but a plane like this is something every government in the world has and we are a serious middle power and it is entirely appropriate we have the same,' he said. Sean Kelly, a former adviser to prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, said the current aircraft were not so bad but agreed bigger ones were needed. 'Right now you have this crazy situation, where journalists who are conducting exactly the same trip as the Prime Minister... around the world, jumping from country to country, sometimes for weeks at a time, have to make their own arrangements entirely separately,' he said.  AUSTRALIA'S AIR FORCE ONE UPGRADE BY THE NUMBERS  Spec Old planes New plane  Model Boeing 737 KC-30A (Airbus 330)  Passengers  40  270  Length 33.6 metres 59 metres Height 12.5 metres 17.4 metres Wingspan 35.8 metres 60.3 metres Speed 850km/h 860km/h  Range  11,390 kilometres  14,800 kilometres    Read more: Come fly with me - Australia gets its Air Force One Share or comment on this article e-mail 430 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Search Watch Live Home UK World Business Politics Technology Entertainment Strange News Weather Boeing flies to Monarch's rescue with restructured fleet deal Boeing is to support the budget carrier Monarch by restructuring a fleet purchase deal announced in 2014, Sky News learns. 06:59, UK, Sunday 09 October 2016 Image Caption: Monarch airlines employs about 2,800 people Twitter Share on Twitter Facebook Share on Facebook Google+ Share on Google+ Whats App Share on Whatsapp Mail Share by email By Mark Kleinman, City Editor The low-cost airline Monarch is close to finalising a multimillion pound financing package with Boeing, paving the way for its operating licence to be extended by aviation regulators ahead of a crunch deadline next week. Sky News has learnt that Monarch, which has been the subject of intense speculation about its financial health, is putting the finishing touches to a revised fleet purchasing deal with the giant aircraft manufacturer which should safeguard its medium-term future. City sources said this weekend that Monarch's deal with Boeing was focused on an order for 45 new planes announced in 2014, and which the US-based group had agreed in principle to restructure. Under the restructured purchase agreement, Monarch will be able to enter into sale-and-leaseback arrangements for the aircraft, which sources said would free up "significant" cashflow for the carrier.  The terms with Boeing, which are not expected to be publicly disclosed, will form part of an overall £165m investment package that will see Greybull Capital, Monarch's controlling shareholder, inject new funds into the company alongside the renewal of its Air Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL). Firm orders have been placed for 30 of the new aircraft for delivery from 2018, with the remaining 15 subject to a future option to proceed. An insider said this weekend that the revised deal with Boeing could generate hundreds of millions of pounds for Monarch given the scale of demand in the market for aircraft financing.  That, in turn, would allow Greybull to provide more equity to Monarch, enabling it to cope more easily with a downturn in trade similar to that seen in recent months. Boeing is not expected to become a shareholder in, or lender to, Monarch under the revised deal - which is not without risk given general economic uncertainty and political instability in some of the markets served by the airline. The bulk of the £160m is in the form of new equity, according to one source, and would comprise what the airline has previously said would be the biggest investment in its 48-year history. Like competitors, Monarch has struggled with declining demand for package holidays to Egypt and Turkey in the wake of terrorist attacks, as well as protracted air traffic disruption in France.  It employs about 2,800 people and is based at Luton Airport. One insider described the relationship between Boeing and Monarch as "strong and constructive". In an email to Monarch staff sent on Friday and seen by Sky News, the airline's chief executive, Andrew Swaffield, said he had met with officials at the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) this week to discuss the renewal of its licence.  Monarch's previous licence, which expired on 30 September, was extended for 12 days to give the company sufficient time to finalise its new funding arrangements. "I was at the CAA on Monday and have been spending a lot of time over the last two days with our legal and finance teams, as we dot the i's and cross the t's on the largest investment in our history - on the back of which we expect the CAA to renew our licences and which will help us move into the next stage of our growth and development," Mr Swaffield wrote. "It's been another busy week for all of us following the events of last Friday and the extension to our ATOL licences.   "All parts of the business are working hard, both to keep things 'business as usual' and maintain consumer and customer confidence, in the face of continued media and social media commentary and speculation.   "As soon as we are able to give details of our investment and confirm the renewal I will.   "But to manage your expectations, this will be on the 12th (Wednesday).   "As said before, there is a process the business must follow and this takes time." In a statement issued on 30 September, the CAA said it had granted the licence extension on the basis that "the shareholder (would) provide additional funding and because customers' money will be protected".  The regulator added: "Monarch now has 12 days to satisfy the CAA that the group is able to meet the requirements for a full ATOL licence.  "Monarch will remain ATOL-licensed until this extension expires.  "The CAA always advises consumers to ensure they book ATOL-protected air holidays and consumers who choose to book an ATOL-protected flight or holiday with the company during this time will continue to be protected by the ATOL scheme.  "During this period of extension, the CAA will continue to monitor the company." Greybull, which bought Tata Steel's Scunthorpe steelworks earlier this year and renamed the business British Steel, rescued Monarch in 2014, refocusing its network on short-haul destinations in Europe and the Mediterranean. Monarch, Boeing and Greybull all declined to comment on Saturday.

No, really, it isn't. Big powerful rockets may get us to Mars, but our trips to the Red Planet won't succeed without biological tools. Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Oct 8, 2016 at 8:23AM Image source: Getty Images. Elon Musk has captured our imaginations by releasing plans to put humans on Mars by 2022 and establish a colony of 1 million individuals as soon as the 2060's. SpaceX seems to have worked out a lot of the logistics: fleets of up to one thousand spacecraft in Earth orbit, windows of opportunity for departing toward Mars, and even plans for establishing fuel and supply depots before humans arrive. What's not to get excited about? Not to be outdone, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg vowed to beat SpaceX to the Red Planet, saying, "I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket." While in the long run it doesn't really matter whose logo arrives first, competition will be key to establishing ourselves as a multi-planetary species. It got us to the moon, after all. But egos aside, rockets aren't the most important technology -- or largest obstacle -- to our success. It's easy to obsess and focus on the visible tools a trip to Mars requires, such as rockets the length of a football field, but we won't be going anywhere without the comparatively invisible tools of biotechnology.  Trek to the Red Planet What makes biotech essential to a successful trip and stay, however brief, on Mars? Quite a lot, actually. Let's consider the trip itself. On a 200-day journey to the Red Planet, a human would be exposed to the radiation equivalent of 24 CAT scans, according to Space.com. That's more than 15 times the annual radiation limit for nuclear power plant employees. While spacecraft will need to be equipped with radiation shielding to protect colonists and electronic systems, the materials are expensive and heavy -- limiting factors for interplanetary travel. We may be able to greatly reduce the need for radiation shielding by engineering ourselves to withstand higher doses of radiation, which overloads our natural ability to repair DNA. Researchers recently found that human cells engineered to produce a protein found in the microscopic tardigrade, or water bear, could reduce X-ray-induced DNA damage by 40%. It's far from reality at this point, but one genetic edit could slash hundreds of billions of dollars in expenses from regularly scheduled treks to Mars. SpaceX and Boeing (and their investors) would probably be interested in that. Radiation is far from the only threat to our health during interplanetary travel. Eighty percent of astronauts who participate on long-duration missions in space return to Earth with permanently altered vision. The condition was first recognized in astronaut John Phillips, who left Earth with 20/20 vision and returned with 20/100 vision after a six-month stay on the International Space Station. Doctors discovered that the shape of his eyes changed during his mission, which was shorter than a trip to Mars, because of pressure imbalances in the skull. The only known treatment involves spinal taps or drilling holes into a patient's skull and must be conducted at the onset, meaning in the zero-gravity environment of space. Aside from the logistical hurdles of performing invasive procedures in space, astronauts and future colonists -- SpaceX and Boeing customers -- would probably prefer a biological solution. Sustaining a colony Getting to Mars isn't the only part of Elon Musk's plan that could be greatly aided by biology. As history has shown numerous times, sustaining a colony is more difficult than establishing one. For instance, the English colony of Roanoke was established in 1585 in what is now North Carolina. Despite multiple resupply trips, the colony was abandoned five years later, without any trace of the colonists.  Because of differences in orbit, the shortest trip to Mars can be made once every 26 months. That means colonists will need to fend for themselves for roughly two years. It will be awfully expensive to launch, transport, and deposit enough food, fuel, medicine, and building materials to support even 100 colonists for two years. While some colony-building and supply missions will need to be completed ahead of the first human arrivals, Boeing and SpaceX will find their efforts much less difficult if colonists leverage biology as a manufacturing paradigm. Borrowing from industrial biotech platforms here on Earth today, it's possible to send test tubes of microbes capable of producing supplies ranging from rocket fuel to polymers for 3-D printers to the metal electrodes in lithium-ion batteries. The building blocks required for these products are already in the crust and atmosphere of the Red Planet. Better yet, test tubes are cheaper to transport than are many metric tons of raw materials. We need green tech to get to the Red Planet When discussing his plans for SpaceX to get to Mars, Musk made it clear that survival and colony-building aren't his problem, instead likening the company to the Union Pacific Railroad's role in developing the West Coast of the United States. I would argue that it is his problem. People won't be going to Mars if they won't survive the trip or stay, which makes biology, not the size of the rocket, the limiting factor. Humans made it to California without railroads, after all. The good news is that engineered biology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, especially in the past several years. We really do need bigger, cheaper, and safer rockets to get to Mars. And it will take many companies and governments to fill in all of the missing pieces. But while rockets and spacecraft are cool, know this: Boeing and SpaceX aren't going anywhere without biotechnology. Maxx Chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The airline also signed a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices, said a statement from Boeing. One of largest fleet announcements in Qatar Airways' history validates the value, reliability and performance of Boeing's twin-aisle airplanes. Today's announcement builds on Qatar Airways' current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With this new order, Qatari national carrier boosts its firm order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. The announcement was made in the presence of Qatar's Minister of Finance Ali Shareef Al Emadi, US Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and the Ambassador of Qatar Mohammed Jaham Al Kuwari. On the new deal, Qatar Airways Group chief executive Akbar Al Baker, said: "Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead." "Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today's announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service," he stated. Qatar Airways' relationship with Boeing was renewed in 2006. Since then, there have been many milestones in the partnership. The airline was the first to operate the 787 in the Middle East and is a launch customer for the 777X, said Al Baker. With the commitment for the 737 MAX 8, it would be the first Boeing single-aisle airplane model to join Qatar Airways' fleet in more than 15 years. "Congratulations to The Boeing Company and Qatar Airways on the remarkable milestone they've reached, which will significantly grow the number of Boeing aircraft in the Qatar Airways fleet," said US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. "Beyond its importance for these two companies, this agreement demonstrates the importance of global commercial partnerships in strengthening our bilateral ties. This deal will strengthen economic opportunity and job creation, and highlights the importance of strong global trading relationships," he added. Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and chief executive Ray Conner said: "We are so very proud that a discerning and market-leading customer like Qatar Airways not only continues to endorse our current products, but also has confidence in Boeing's new technology that will soon be evident on the 777X and 737 MAX." The 777-300ER is the most reliable twin-aisle airplane flying today and is considered to be the flagship of the world's elite airlines. It has the highest schedule reliability of any twin-aisle airplane at 99.5 percent - the airplane is on time, nearly all the time. The 787-9 Dreamliner is the second member of the super-efficient, passenger-pleasing 787 family. The 787-9, a stretch of the 787-8, can fly 290 passengers 7,635 nautical miles (14,140 km) in addition to more cargo, allowing airlines the ability to grow routes first opened by the 787-8. Boeing's newest family of single-aisle airplanes - 737 MAX 7, 737 MAX 8, 737 MAX 9 and 737 MAX 200 - builds on the Next-Generation 737's popularity and reliability while delivering customers unsurpassed fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2017. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," remarked Conner.-TradeArabia News Service Tags: Qatar Airways | Boeing | planes | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Qatar Airways fined by US for flying over 'prohibited airspace' VR, robots to become the future of theme parks Gulf Air adds Colombo to destination network Air Arabia Q3 net profit up 26pc Trump effect dampens ME tourism to the US Al Futtaim, InterCon ink deal for UAE's largest Holiday Inn Family-friendly staycation at Emirates Park Zoo and Resort Mövenpick Hotel West Bay Doha wins two top honours Emirates Skywards adds The Wall Street Journal to partner list Sharjah Museums takes centre stage at WTM London Jannah Hotels to open first RAK property in December Honda targets 80 business jets annually Modul Dubai starts hospitality management course Abu Dhabi airport interchange project on track New Doha 5-star hotel names resident manager Saudi Arabian Airlines names new CEO Jet Airways flies high with $850m revenue in Q2 Dubai hotels see occupancy, rates decline in October Bahrain Tourism Authority to take part in Jewellery Arabia Travco Group sells stakes in Air Arabia Egypt Fairmont The Palm appoints two new culinary talents WTM London closes on a high $24bn hotel projects under construction in Saudi, UAE Dubai South appoints TMIL for VIP Terminal branding Anniversary celebrations at Ramada Downtown Dubai Emirates moves to an all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleet VFS Global launches France visa service in Oman Exclusive Staycation packages at Al Raha Beach Hotel Emirates Skywards eases ground travel with Careem partnership Fairmont Hotel creates first tea etiquette guide Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

No, really, it isn't. Big powerful rockets may get us to Mars, but our trips to the Red Planet won't succeed without biological tools. Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Oct 8, 2016 at 8:23AM Image source: Getty Images. Elon Musk has captured our imaginations by releasing plans to put humans on Mars by 2022 and establish a colony of 1 million individuals as soon as the 2060's. SpaceX seems to have worked out a lot of the logistics: fleets of up to one thousand spacecraft in Earth orbit, windows of opportunity for departing toward Mars, and even plans for establishing fuel and supply depots before humans arrive. What's not to get excited about? Not to be outdone, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg vowed to beat SpaceX to the Red Planet, saying, "I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket." While in the long run it doesn't really matter whose logo arrives first, competition will be key to establishing ourselves as a multi-planetary species. It got us to the moon, after all. But egos aside, rockets aren't the most important technology -- or largest obstacle -- to our success. It's easy to obsess and focus on the visible tools a trip to Mars requires, such as rockets the length of a football field, but we won't be going anywhere without the comparatively invisible tools of biotechnology.  Trek to the Red Planet What makes biotech essential to a successful trip and stay, however brief, on Mars? Quite a lot, actually. Let's consider the trip itself. On a 200-day journey to the Red Planet, a human would be exposed to the radiation equivalent of 24 CAT scans, according to Space.com. That's more than 15 times the annual radiation limit for nuclear power plant employees. While spacecraft will need to be equipped with radiation shielding to protect colonists and electronic systems, the materials are expensive and heavy -- limiting factors for interplanetary travel. We may be able to greatly reduce the need for radiation shielding by engineering ourselves to withstand higher doses of radiation, which overloads our natural ability to repair DNA. Researchers recently found that human cells engineered to produce a protein found in the microscopic tardigrade, or water bear, could reduce X-ray-induced DNA damage by 40%. It's far from reality at this point, but one genetic edit could slash hundreds of billions of dollars in expenses from regularly scheduled treks to Mars. SpaceX and Boeing (and their investors) would probably be interested in that. Radiation is far from the only threat to our health during interplanetary travel. Eighty percent of astronauts who participate on long-duration missions in space return to Earth with permanently altered vision. The condition was first recognized in astronaut John Phillips, who left Earth with 20/20 vision and returned with 20/100 vision after a six-month stay on the International Space Station. Doctors discovered that the shape of his eyes changed during his mission, which was shorter than a trip to Mars, because of pressure imbalances in the skull. The only known treatment involves spinal taps or drilling holes into a patient's skull and must be conducted at the onset, meaning in the zero-gravity environment of space. Aside from the logistical hurdles of performing invasive procedures in space, astronauts and future colonists -- SpaceX and Boeing customers -- would probably prefer a biological solution.

Saul Loeb / AFP Boeing wins $18.6 billion deal as Qatar Airways takes first 737 Max jetliner Bloomberg October 8, 2016 Updated: October 8, 2016 02:12 PM Related Airbus and Boeing jet engine maker forecasts higher profit for the year Jet-engine maker Pratt the butt of $10bn dollar jokes Dozens of Boeing and Airbus deliveries put back by Turkish Airlines Qatar Airways to place a large aircraft order soon, says chief executive Qatar Airways business class review: Boston to Abu Dhabi is a smooth ride Topics: Qatar Airways Airbus Boeing Boeing landed an US$18.6 billion deal with Qatar Airways for as many as 100 aircraft, providing a sales boost to the US company’s upgraded 737 jetliner with one of the year’s largest commercial airplane deals. The Doha-based carrier pledged to buy as many as 60 of the 737 Max 8 jet, valued at $6.9bn at list prices, marking its first narrow-body order with Boeing since 1979. Qatar Airways also ordered 40 total 777 and 787 Dreamliner twin-aisle aircraft, Akbar Al Baker, the airline’s chief executive officer, and Boeing commercial airplane chief executive Ray Conner said Friday in Washington. With the commitment, Mr Al Baker made good on earlier threats to buy Boeing’s 737 Max after rejecting initial A320neo deliveries from Airbus Group because of engine issues. The transaction also provided a vote of confidence in the Boeing jet, which is on pace to begin commercial service months ahead of schedule in the second quarter next year. Qatar Airways will take its first Max in 2018, Mr Al Baker said in an interview. He insisted the decision to pivot to the rival Boeing model wasn’t intended as retaliation against the European planemaker. "There is no message to Airbus," he said. "We don’t send messages by aircraft purchases to each other." The order gives a boost to Chicago-based Boeing, which, like Airbus, has been contending with sales slowed by economic uncertainty in Europe and Asia and a commodities downturn in Russia and Brazil. Meanwhile, relatively low fuel prices have damped demand for new, fuel-efficient wide-body jets such as the 777 and 787 and contributed to a glut of second-hand models. Qatar Airways still intends to follow through on a 2011 order for 50 Airbus A320neo and A321neo planes, which have a combined value of $6.4bn at list prices, Mr Al Baker said. But he also took a swipe over issues with the aircraft’s geared turbofan engine, which is made by United Technologies’ Pratt & Whitney unit, saying the delays left him with "no alternative" but to order the "reliable" Boeing narrow-body planes. "We never renege on contracts that we sign," Mr Al Baker said. "The aircraft that we are ordering today will serve this ever-expanding network." Qatar is also ordering 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 model and 10 777-300ER jets, valued at a combined $11.7bn at list prices before discounts that are customary for large aircraft purchases. It is Boeing’s largest twin-aisle sale this year, providing a little more visibility into plans for the 777, the planemaker’s largest twin-engine aircraft, as well as for the Dreamliner, the company’s marquee carbon-fibre jet. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Airbus and Boeing jet engine maker forecasts higher profit for the year Jet-engine maker Pratt the butt of $10bn dollar jokes Dozens of Boeing and Airbus deliveries put back by Turkish Airlines Qatar Airways to place a large aircraft order soon, says chief executive More Aviation Air Arabia third-quarter profit lifted by passenger gains Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Honda plans to increase business jet production Jet Airways income edges up MOST VIEWED Business | All Abu Dhabi’s Royal Jet offers VIP alternative to travelling first class Renault faces criminal inquiry over emissions cheating suspicions Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Dubai Parks operator aims to lift revenue as costs rise A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first Head of GE Oil & Gas says oil industry cuts not done yet Trump looms large over World Economic Forum event in Dubai India’s currency move will hit property and gold Chinese interest in Dubai Green Fund More Most Viewed American-Iranian political tensions will only escalate UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi Girl, 16, trafficked to Dubai and forced into prostitution, court hears Louvre Abu Dhabi announces first contemporary art installations Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Having trouble saving money in the UAE?

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Qatar Airways has agreed to purchase as many as 100 Boeing airplanes for up to USD 18.6 billion, the companies jointly announced today. Qatar will buy 30 of the new-generation Boeing 787 and 10 Boeing 777, both widebody aircraft, for USD 11.7 billion. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 of the narrow-body Boeing 737 valued at about USD 6.9 billion. Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker said that the order was one of the largest in the country's history and would help meet growing demand for air travel. Al-Baker acknowledged the decision to go with Boeing also was due to "ongoing issues" with Boeing rival Airbus. Al-Baker in April publicly blasted Airbus over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. In June, Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the planes. "Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else," Al-Baker told a news conference in Washington attended by government officials from the US and Qatar. "They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this." The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a time-frame for deliveries. Tags  Qatar Airways Boeing order Buy, Hold, Sell ?

Mobile version Sign Up Login Home Lebanon Middle East World Business Sports Climate Change & Environment Entertainment Offbeat Culture Science Obituaries Technology Health Entrepreneurship Roundup En ع Qatar Airways Orders 100 Boeing Planes for Up to $18.6 Billion إقرأ هذا الخبر بالعربية by Naharnet Newsdesk 07 October 2016, 16:53 Comment 2 Tweet Qatar Airways announced a large airplane order with Boeing Friday that includes up to $6.9 billion in single-aisle planes following delays in a rival Airbus offering. Under the agreement, Qatar will buy 30 new-generation Boeing 787s and 10 Boeing 777s, both widebody aircraft, for $11.7 billion, the companies announced.  Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 narrow-body Boeing 737 aircraft. The deal is worth as much as $18.6 billion all together. The order for the 737s follows unusual public criticism of Airbus earlier this year by Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar al-Baker over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. The order would help meet growing demand for air travel, al-Baker said Friday. But the decision to go with Boeing was also prompted by "ongoing issues" with Boeing rival Airbus, Al-Baker acknowledged, appearing with Boeing executives and U.S. and Qatar government officials at a news conference in Washington. "Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else," he said. "They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this." Al-Baker later emphasized that his company would continue to work with Airbus and take delivery of the A320 planes when they are ready. We are not "pointing fingers or trying to embarrass Airbus," he told AFP. "We have close relations with Airbus and we are continuing to receive aircraft orders." "The decision for us to buy Boeing airplanes is to get them for certain missions which today Airbus aircraft are not able to do," he added. "We will maintain all of our commitments to Airbus." The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. Al-Baker threatened to cancel the Airbus order in April due to problems with the engine and other difficulties, resulting in an "unacceptable" delay in delivering six planes. "We always in Qatar Airways have a plan B," he said at the time. Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the Airbus planes in June. The Qatar contract gives Boeing a boost. The U.S. company had net orders of 380 through the end of the third quarter, suggesting its full-year tally for 2016 will come in below last year's 868. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a timeframe for deliveries. Shares of Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $133.53 in afternoon trade.

The agreement for up to 100 jetliners potentially worth $18.6 billion helps fill out Boeing's order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus. The deal marked a key commitment by Qatar Airways to Boeing's new 737 MAX jetliner, after it refused to accept three of Airbus' competing A320 aircraft earlier this year. Qatar has not ordered 737s previously. Airline Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker took the opportunity of the announcement in Washington to further press Boeing to build a new jet slightly larger than the 737 to fill a gap in Boeing's product line. Asked in an interview when he expected to hear more about that proposed plane, Al Baker said: "Yesterday!" Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the same interview, said Boeing continues to evaluate such a plane and talk with customers. "I think we have a pretty good idea today as to what our customers would like to see with respect to seat count, range capabilities," Conner said, adding that Boeing understands how quickly customers want the plane. "Now it's a matter of us going back and doing our homework and figuring out how do we put all of that together," he said. "I can't give you a real time frame on that, but we're certainly working the heck out of it right now." BIG ORDER The deal for 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft is significantly larger than an order for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain's Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by Qatar in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional list value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX jets are purchased. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Qatar Airways' order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive. Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the United States at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but "they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined," Bastian said at an event in New York. "That doesn't sound fair, that doesn't sound free," he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations. - Reuters - News National News International News Business News Sports News Documentary Links CNN News BBC News AseanMedia Channel News Asia Others About Us Contact Us Feedback Copyright © 2016 RTB News Website.

The Easton Sports Development Foundation recently won the North American bid to play host to the third leg of the Archery World Cup in 2017, '18 and '19. Next year, it will take place June 21-25. In the Archery World Cup, the top eight archers in several categories compete in four events in four different countries. More than 300 athletes from 40 countries are expected to attend, said Jeff Robbins, president and CEO of the Utah Sports Commission, which teamed with Easton and Visit Salt Lake on the bid. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Hosting these three Archery World Cup events is a key part of our Olympic legacy efforts," he added. Easton Foundations President Greg Easton said he was excited to show off the new Easton Salt Lake Archery Center, 575 John Glenn Road, in western Salt Lake City. USA Archery CEO Denise Parker credited that center, "one of the finest archery training facilities in the world," to the World Cup circuit returning to the United States. She's hoping having events in the U.S. will accelerate the "tremendous growth our sport has experienced in the last several years." In $11.7B deal, Qatar Airways will buy 40 planes from Boeing Doha-based Qatar Airways said it will purchase 40 new long-range aircraft from Boeing Co. for $11.7 billion. The quick-growing Middle East airline is ordering 30 of Boeing's new 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 widebody 777-300ERs. Boeing has a sizable presence in Utah, with large plants in Salt Lake City and South Jordan. Qatar also signed a letter of intent to buy up to 60 of Boeing's 737 MAX 8s, the new version of its best-selling short- and mid-range jet. The list price is $6.9 billion.

The carrier is delaying deliveries of 39 of the upgraded single-aisle planes originally scheduled for 2018 to 2020, the company said in a filing at the weekend to Borsa Istanbul. Turkish is raising its 2022 deliveries for the workhorse jets to 30 from the six it had previously planned. The company did not elaborate on the models that will be deferred, but it has ordered 92 Airbus A321neo, 65 of Boeing’s 737 Max 8 and 10 of the US plane maker’s Max 9 models. Turkish, based in Istanbul, said it was reducing flight frequencies and shifting to smaller planes on "demand-challenged routes" after posting a second-quarter loss of US$215 million in August. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related New A320s for biggest Thai budget airline as profits go stratospheric Airbus hits downdraught with passenger jet profits nosediving by a quarter Etihad service to Texas to go daily in February Boeing wins $18.6 billion deal as Qatar Airways takes first 737 Max jetliner More Aviation Air Arabia third-quarter profit lifted by passenger gains Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Honda plans to increase business jet production Jet Airways income edges up MOST VIEWED Business | All Abu Dhabi’s Royal Jet offers VIP alternative to travelling first class Renault faces criminal inquiry over emissions cheating suspicions Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Dubai Parks operator aims to lift revenue as costs rise A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first Head of GE Oil & Gas says oil industry cuts not done yet Trump looms large over World Economic Forum event in Dubai India’s currency move will hit property and gold Chinese interest in Dubai Green Fund More Most Viewed American-Iranian political tensions will only escalate UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi Girl, 16, trafficked to Dubai and forced into prostitution, court hears Louvre Abu Dhabi announces first contemporary art installations Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Having trouble saving money in the UAE?

Business Standard has learned that Indian embassies in Washington, Moscow and Stockholm wrote on Friday to fighter jet manufacturers in these countries to confirm whether they would partner an Indian company in building a medium, single-engine fighter, with significant transfer of technology to the Indian entity. The confidential document sent by the embassies is not technically a “Request for Information” (RFI), which is a precursor to a “Request for Proposals” (also known as a tender). However, it serves the same purpose, which is to determine which vendors are interested and what they are willing to offer. By specifying that the IAF requires a single-engine fighter, the latest letter differs from an earlier tender, issued in 2007, for 126 medium, multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA). The MMRCA tender, which had no such stipulation, saw six vendors fielding four twin-engine and two single-engine fighters. The twin-engine offerings included Dassault’s Rafale, Eurofighter GmbH’s Typhoon, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and RAC MiG’s MiG-35. The single-engine fighters offered were Lockheed Martin’s F-16IN Super Viper and Saab’s Gripen D. The much-hyped MMRCA tender eventually collapsed, with the IAF last month buying a token 36 Rafale fighters. Now, the IAF has kicked off a more focused contest that will feature only single-engine fighters. Numerous airpower experts have pointed out that the IAF needs single-engine fighters to replace the single-engine MiG-21 and MiG-27 fighters that must be retired in the near future. The Rafale, a medium-heavy, twin-engine fighter, is too expensive for operational tasks that a single-engine fighter can easily manage. While Boeing, Eurofighter, RAC MiG, Sukhoi and Dassault would technically be able to respond to the latest RFI, none of them can offer a state-of-the-art, medium, single-engine fighter. Therefore, it seems likely that New Delhi would have to choose between Saab’s Gripen E and Lockheed Martin’s latest F-16 Block 70. As Business Standard reported earlier, both Saab and Lockheed Martin have kicked off high-stakes, high-voltage campaigns to meet the IAF’s needs. Both have already submitted what the IAF chief, Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha described on Thursday as “unsolicited bids” for building their fighters in India. Saab has linked its offer with assistance to the indigenous Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) development programme, which is being spearheaded by Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA), a unit of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Saab has offered to help ADA in quickly developing the Tejas Mark IA, which the IAF chief said required four improvements — a better combat radar, more lethal weapons, dedicated electronic warfare capability and better maintainability. He said the upgraded Tejas should fly within three-four years. Saab has also offered to help ADA develop the planned next-generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is pushing an offer, made through the Indo-US Defence Trade and Technology Initiative (DTTI), to shift its F-16 production line from Fort Worth, Texas to India. A new, more advanced version of the F-16, designated the Block 70, has been offered to entice India. Air Headquarters insiders say there is little chance of India buying the F-16, a significantly advanced version of the Block 50/52 that the Pakistan Air Force operates. Since Washington is aware of this important bias, it remains to be seen whether the US seizes this opportunity to offer India the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a state-of-the-art fifth-generation fighter. The IAF is keeping an open mind. On Thursday, Raha stated: “I’m sure whoever gives the best deal [will win]. All the aircraft are very capable, so it will depend upon who provides the best transfer of technology; and, of course, the price tag. It’s on the table; nothing is decided as yet.” SKY WARS Indian Air Force (IAF) invites international players to make medium, multi-role, single-engine fighter jets in India   IAF also wants significant transfer of technology to the Indian entity   India needs single-engine fighters to replace the single-engine MiG-21 and MiG-27   Boeing, Eurofighter, RAC MiG, Sukhoi and Dassault may respond but none of them can offer a state-of-the-art, medium, single-engine fighter   Contest likely between Saab’s Gripen E and Lockheed Martin’s latest F-16 Block 70 Last month, IAF bought 36 medium-heavy, twin-engine Rafale fighters Ajai Shukla Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Bengaluru citizens against tech hub's 6.2-km steel flyover project Business Standard IAF kicks off contest to make single-engine fighters Competition likely between American F-16 Block 70 and Swedish Gripen E Ajai Shukla  |  New Delhi  October 8, 2016 Last Updated at 22:50 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image.

Since the Gwadar international airport is an important segment of the multi billion dollar game changer China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project, therefore early implementation of this project is vital to accrue full benefit from the corridor project. To make the Gwadar port fully operational and hub of regional trade, it is important that the port city’s air, rail and road links are developed in a satisfactory manner as per the international standards. According to the Chinese and our government officials, the Gwadar port will be made fully operational by the end of this year, therefore, it has become all the more necessary that Gwadar airport project, which is being dubbed as the country’s biggest and most modern landing field be implemented at the earliest in order to facilitate the visiting businessmen who are showing great interest for investment in the Gwadar special economic zone. The airport project will indeed serve as a catalyst for enhancing investment and development in Gwadar and catering to the requirements of a bustling industrial commercial city. We have no doubt in mind that the facility, because of its geo strategic location, will serve as a major hub for international flights operating in the region. Additionally, emphasis should also be laid on the skill development of the local population so that they could get jobs and fully exploit the economic activities to be generated by the execution of mega projects under the CPEC. While we appreciate the government for planning to establish Gwadar University for the promotion of higher education in the so far neglected area, it is also heartening to note that Chinese government has also given a grant of ten million dollars for building the Pakistan-China Vocational and Technical Institute. We expect that the government will not waste any time in the implementation of this important project, as it will make the local youth ready to take up technical jobs at the port and make it a success story.

By Jon C. Ogg October 6, 2016 6:09 pm EST Print Email Tweet Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) is one of the largest conglomerates out there, but it is often overlooked as a broad economic indicator like some of the companies. Maybe its $88 billion market cap just isn’t big enough these days in the world where companies need to have $100 billion market capitalization rates to be megacaps. 24/7 Wall St. cannot help but wonder if Honeywell may have just inadvertently wrecked the story for many industrial and conglomerate outfits after lowering guidance. The good news here is that Honeywell’s guidance looks limited to Honeywell, but we took a look at General Electric, Boeing and United Tech just to be sure. Honeywell has now lowered 2016 sales and earnings forecast for 2016, in part due to the aerospace and Space & Defense divisions seeing lower shipments. The separation of automation and control solutions into two new segments and the overall impact of acquisitions and divestitures was also cited — the acquisition of Intelligrated, sale of the Honeywell Technology Solutions, and the spin-off of Resins and Chemicals as AdvanSix. Earnings per share (EPS) for 2016 was lowered to a range of $6.60 to $6.64 (a gain of 8% to 9%) versus a prior range of $6.60 to $6.70. That doesn’t look too bad, but what hurts here is that Honeywell now sees its organic revenues dropping from 1% to 2% in 2016. Its prior estimate was a 1% drop. Investors might feel as though they were caught off guard here. It was a month ago when the AdvanSix spin-off was set. Things seemed normal then. After closing up 0.3% at $115.61 on Thursday, Honeywell shares were last seen trading down 3.9% at $111.05 — but only 30,000 shares or so had traded at 5:50 p.m. Eastern time. On October 4, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) announced that its 2016 gross orders were now 460, showing a change of −80 units, for some 380 net orders. Boeing has exposure for both defense and aerospace. Its shares closed down 0.18% at $134.42, but they were not seen moving in the after-hours. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) closed down almost 0.8% at $29.27 on Thursday, after an analyst lowered its price target by $1.00. Its after-hours range was not lower either, with a 52-week range of $27.10 to $33.00. GE has exposure to aerospace and as a conglomerate. United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX), which was not that long ago considered a Honeywell merger partner, closed down 0.17% at $102.08. Its market cap is $85 billion, and its shares have a 52-week range of $83.39 to $109.83. Earlier Thursday, UTX said that it was reducing its pension obligations, but it will take a charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million. If you saw the headlines on Honeywell, then you might be more worried. After looking at the fallout and looking at the statements, the spillover and fallout doesn’t look too extreme. Stay tuned as Friday’s unemployment and payrolls report could skew how this guidance fallout impacts other companies. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Blue/Bloomberg Norwegian Air Aims to Extend Long-Haul Model to Buenos Aires Pablo Rosendo Gonzalez Pablo_Rosendo Richard Weiss @rweiss5 October 9, 2016 — 5:00 PM EDT Updated on October 10, 2016 — 6:38 AM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp CEO Kjos also weighing Cordoba as a domestic Argentinian hub Chilean flights also under evaluation; Brazil less likely Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA is evaluating plans for a base in Buenos Aires with flights from cities including Oslo, London, Paris, Madrid and Barcelona as the next phase of its long-haul, low-cost expansion strategy. Services to the Argentinian capital could start in 12 months if government permissions are granted, Bjorn Kjos, the airline’s chief executive officer, said in an interview in Cordoba, adding that the Latin American country’s second-biggest city also has the potential to become a domestic hub. Norwegian Air has ambitious plans for extending the low-cost travel model to inter-continental flights using a fleet of Boeing Co. 787s that will swell to 42 by 2020. It’s also adding 30 extended-range Airbus Group SE A321neo aircraft that could be used on shorter long-haul routes by 2022, and has even said that smaller 737 Max jets, of which it has 100 on order, might operate some trans-Atlantic services. South American flights would begin with two 787s and create at least 200 jobs, Kjos said. That would be welcome in Argentina, where a recession deepened in the second quarter as President Mauricio Macri’s efforts to implement free-market reform acted as a brake on an already flagging economy and foreign direct investment has been scarce in recent years. Argentina is “a hidden jewel,” Kjos said, with “the largest potential I have ever seen” for increasing visits. “But to attract tourists you need to have cheaper flights.” Fares could fall to one-quarter of what airlines now charge, selling from about $300 for a round-trip to Europe, he reckoned. For domestic services a Cordoba-Buenos Aires return would need to be priced at about $50. Kjos said he’s also speaking with authorities in Chilean capital Santiago about possible routes there, though is less keen on entering the Brazilian market. Low-cost operations on short-haul routes, in which Norwegian specializes, require intensive timetables to make money and the CEO said planes would need to be in the air 18 or 19 hours a day for the long-haul model to work. That might mean the introduction of connecting or multi-leg fights such as India and South Africa to the Americas via Europe. Qatar, HNA Moves South America is attracting outside operators as an economic downturn, weaker local currencies and increased dollar-linked costs squeeze local players. Qatar Airways said in July it would pay $613 million for up to 10 percent of Latam Airlines Group SA, the region’s biggest carrier, while China’s HNA Group Co. last year acquired a 24 percent stake in Azul Linhas Aereas Brasileiras SA for $450 million. Colombia’s Avianca Holdings SA and Avianca Brasil are seeking separate partners while planning to merge in the longer term. Norwegian Air is still awaiting permission from the U.S. Department of Transportation to use its Irish subsidiary for trans-Atlantic U.S. flights and has also applied for such rights for its U.K. unit. Connecting cities on Europe’s Atlantic coast, including Edinburgh, with smaller airports in the eastern U.S., such as New York’s White Plains airfield or Stewart airport, will mean customers paying less than $150 for a round trip starting next year, Kjos said. The Fornebu, Norway-based carrier also plans to establish a base of American pilots in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, initially hiring as many as 100 cockpit crew if it can expand U.S. operations as planned.

At more than US$5 billion (Bt174 billion), Kuka represents the largest Chinese takeover of a German company and highlights the direction China is taking.  Kuka developed one of the world’s first industrial robots and continues to be a global leader in the industry, with shares of 35 per cent in the North American robotics and automation market, 46 per cent in Europe and 19 per cent in Asia.  Kuka robots are used by leading global manufacturers in high-end industries such  as Audi and BMW cars,  Boeing aircraft and  Northrop Grumman  military equipment.  Kuka is also the inventor of the Iiwa, or intelligent industrial work assistant, which can pour a beer or brew a cup of coffee, among other tasks. Midea, Kuka’s new parent, is one of China’s largest home-appliance makers with a sizeable global presence, as it exports around one-third of its production.  Like many other Chinese companies, Midea faces rising labour costs and needs to manage this through increasing automation.  Already Midea employs around 100 Kuka robots in its factories. As well as automating its plants, the acquisition of Kuka will help Midea improve its facilities and produce its own robots, automation equipment and smart-home devices. This strategy fits well with China’s goal of becoming a more advanced industrial society using innovation and smart technology.  China is the largest and fastest-growing market for industrial robotics, accounting for around 30 per cent of the global market for industrial robots.  And by 2020, it plans to reach 150 robot units per 10,000 workers.  Midea is not the only Chinese company investing in innovative German companies.  In the first half of this year, Chinese investors acquired 37 German companies worth $10.8 billion.  Indeed, nearly 40 per cent of all inbound investment in Germany in that period came from China.  Other top investments were in EEW Energy from Waste; Hanwha Q Cells, a technology company; KrausMaffei, a machinery group; and Putzmeister Holding, a construction company. At the recent G20 meeting in Hangzhou, German leader Angela Merkel stood next to Chinese President Xi Jinping in the official photo.  Although this was due to protocol, it nicely seemed to symbolise the importance of this close relationship.  Germany will host the next summit in Hamburg in 2017. We look forward to seeing how things will have developed by then. Tags China Germany made in China Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Trump must not be allowed to trample on climate deal...

The national airline of the UAE has entered a three year deal with ADSC to support sports activities and major sporting events in Abu Dhabi. The strategic initiative replaces an event- by-event approach and contributes to a longer term vision for sports in line with Abu Dhabi Vision 2030.  Hareb Almuhairy, Senior Vice President, Corporate and International Affairs, Etihad Airways, said: “This agreement cements our work together to promote Abu Dhabi as an outstanding destination for major international sporting events. These events bring considerable economic benefits, provide excellent opportunities for resident and visiting sports fans and encourage a healthy and active lifestyle.” At least 15 events will be covered under the new partnership, including headliners such as January’s annual Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and this month’s professional cycling race, the Abu Dhabi Tour. It is expected that eventually, dozens of events will be jointly supported as new sports initiatives are attracted to the emirate. Advertisement “This deal represents a more structured and long-term approach to delivering on our vision of evolving Abu Dhabi into an international destination for sport, competitiveness and international events. Etihad Airways will bring to the table considerable marketing clout which will further build local, regional and global awareness of our headline events,” explained His Excellency Aref Al Awani, General Secretary, ADSC. The new partnership will see Etihad Airways leverage all of its marketing channels to promote major sporting events in the emirate. The agreement also opens the way for special athlete appearances, guest experiences and community engagement activities.  Etihad Cargo will provide support for sports equipment, contributing to what is effectively a bridge to bring the world’s best athletes and action to Abu Dhabi.    An Oxford Business Group study, entitled The Report Abu Dhabi 2016, notes that while Abu Dhabi was largely unknown in the international sporting world just 10 years ago, it has since sprinted onto the global stage by hosting high profile sporting events, such as the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Other events have included the ITU World Triathlon Series, the Volvo Ocean Race and the Fatima Bint Mubarak Ladies Open (Ladies European Tour).     “The positive impact of major sports events on tourism is well documented, with benefits such as airline passenger traffic, hotel stays and visitor spend,” added Mr Almuhairy. “At the same time, we are always looking for ways to connect and inspire our guests. Sport provides a wonderful platform to do this.” Among the other events covered under the new partnership are the FINA 10k Open Water World Championship, the FINA High-Dive World Cup, Emirates Football Forum and the FIBA Basketball 3 x 3 World Championship. -Ends-  About Etihad Aviation Group Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) is a diversified global aviation and travel group comprising four business divisions – Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, Etihad Engineering, Hala Group and Airline Equity Partners.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 9, 2016 at 10:13AM Much about the Navy's new carrier-based stealth drone project still remains shrouded in darkness. Image source: Getty Images. At long last, it's official. The U.S. Navy is building a new war drone for its aircraft carriers -- and in fact, it may be building two of them. Either this, or that Officially named the "MQ-25A Stingray" when announced back in July, the new drone is expected to be a stealthy "flying wing," capable of penetrating enemy air defenses to launch devastating attacks with cruise missiles. Either that...or it will be a bumbling, oblong-shaped fuel tanker, capable of flying in flow circles over its mother ship, and pumping gas into real fighter jets. That's where the debate was left last July, with the Navy unable to decide precisely what it wants from a carrier-launched drone. At the time, I opined that Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) were likely to offer prototypes specializing in stealth. Lockheed Martin is well known as the maker of F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets. Northrop Grumman built the Navy's first carrier-capable jet drone, the batwinged X-47B. Both companies were likely to play to their strengths, and advocate for the Navy choosing a stealthy design that -- even if initially assigned only tanker roles -- could "evolve" over time into a true carrier-capable combat jet. At the same time, rival drone operators Boeing (NYSE:BA), which builds the Navy's popular ScanEagle, and General Atomics, most famous for its Air Force Predators, would probably bid to build an MQ-25A that looked more like a "traditional" aircraft, eschewing stealth in favor of cheapness and fuel-tank capacity. That's where we left the debate four months ago. And that's precisely where we remain stuck today. When in doubt, hedge your bets Late last month, buried in the flurry of end-of-fiscal-year contract awards, the Pentagon announced that it is funding two carrier-based drone concepts -- one each from the two competing camps. On the "stealthy" side, Lockheed Martin was awarded $43.6 million "to conduct risk reduction activities in support of the MQ-25 unmanned carrier aviation air system, including refinement of concepts and development of trade space for requirements generation in advance of the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the program." Simultaneously, the Pentagon hired Boeing to do exactly the same work on a (presumably non-stealthy) Stingray design for $43.4 million. What it means to investors The U.S. Pentagon shoveled $14.5 billion in new contracts out the door in the final week of fiscal year 2016, so it's possible I have missed mention of similar development contracts to General Atomics and/or Northrop Grumman. In fact, given Northrop's successful experience building and flying the X-47B, I admit to some shock at not finding Northrop at the top of the Pentagon's MQ-25 short list. But I've read through the contract announcements twice, and don't think I've missed any official announcements. Even so, if you're an investor in Northrop Grumman stock, don't panic! Just because your company didn't receive money for "risk reduction activities" doesn't mean Northrop Grumman has no chance of winning the MQ-25 contract. Nor do the two awards announced last month guarantee that Boeing or Lockheed Martin will have a "lock" on building the MQ-25 Stingray. To the contrary, no official Navy "Request for Proposals" to build the MQ-25 is even expected before next year, and no production models are expected before 2021. At the same time, investors in Boeing and Lockheed Martin may take some comfort in the fact that they were the Navy's first choices to get the ball rolling on the MQ-25A Stingray. For better or worse, I'd have to say that right now, Boeing and Lockheed occupy the pole positions in this race.

The Electronic Flying Control System gives it exceptional handling characteristics. It has a glass cockpit built around the principal of data fusion and a central computer intelligently prioritise info to display to the pilots simpler command and control. Considering that Rafale is a multirole aircraft, the pilot’s work load has been reduced considerably through most functional switches being located on the throttle and stick. The state of the art avionics consist of the RBEZ-AA AESA Radar. This is an electronically scanned phased array radar which is far superior to a mechanical scan radar. The aircraft carries a multitude of weaponry. The Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) has an effective range of approx 150 km. There is no comparable missile in its class. Scalp air-to-surface long-range general purpose stand-off cruise missile, which has a range of 300 km, is the most sophisticated available at this time. The deal includes a five-year Performance Based Logistics (PBL) plan which Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer, would ensure 75% serviceability. This also includes spares, components, rotables etc. Weapons are also included in the costing. The basic cost of each aircraft is approximately Rs 700 crore. However, it climbs to Rs 1,640 crore per aircraft if the PBL, weapons, training etc, are included. The cost increased due to certain India-specific requirements like helmet-mounted sight, radar warning receiver, low-band jammers etc. The Indian Air Force (IAF) went through a very rigid selection process based on specific Operational Requirements (ORs). Apart from Rafale, the other contenders were the Boeing F/A–18, Eurofighter, Lockheed Martin F-16, MiG-35 and Gripen. The process included technical evaluation and flight trials. The participant aircraft were flown in different parts of India through extreme hot and cold weather. Finally, Eurofighter and Rafale were shortlisted, and the “L1” – based on life cycle cost – prevailed. Around 50% of the cost would be ploughed back into India through the offset clause. Liability for the offset clause would be handled by Dassault, Thales, Airbus and other Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The principle manufacturer, Dassault Aviation, will have only 25% liability as per reports. Deliveries would begin after 36 months (2019) and will be completed after 67 months (2022). The IAF has projected a requirement of 44 fighter squadrons to face a two front threat. At present, the strength is down to 33 Squadrons. From 2016 to 2022, there will be a drawdown (reduction) of 11 squadrons of MiG-21s and MiG-27s. This would amount to a reduction of 220 aircraft. Without replacements, the IAF strength would deplete to 22 squadrons of fighter aircraft. Hence, the urgency to purchase Rafale. Albeit, the projected requirement was for 126 jets, the reduced number of 36 would still be a significant increase in capability. To make the required numbers, it is imperative that the Tejas (LCA MK1A) remains on schedule. Electronic warfare The programme is behind schedule and has already been pushed back to 2019. Issues pertaining to AESA radar and weapons are yet to be addressed. Interim discussion regarding Fifth Gen Fighter Aircraft (FGFA) with Russian collaboration is continuing. Increase in the numbers of SU-30 and Make in India programme for F-16, F-18 and Gripen are being considered. But the AESA radar combined with state of the art electronic warfare systems and avionics built around data fusion, gives Rafale a lethal capability. The combat potential ratio with our western neighbour, in terms of air assets, is 2:1 at this time. This would certainly increase substantially with Rafale. With our northern neighbour, it would give the IAF a discernible technological advantage. The IAF has different fighter aircraft in its inventory. The MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-27, MiG-29, Jaguar, Mirage 2000, SU-30MK1 and Tejas (LCA) are presently flying. Rafale would be the ninth variety. This is undoubtedly a nightmare for maintenance, logistics activity and operational planning, and training of both ground crew and aircrew also becomes difficult. Eight types of transporters and six different helicopters only add to the magnitude of the difficulty. In the 1950s and 1960s, the IAF consisted of Canberras, Hunters, Gnats and Avros from Britain. At that time, the inventory also had the French Mysteres and Toofani (Ouragan) Fighter. Strategic bilateral relations with the erstwhile Soviet Union was in the upswing during the 1960s and 1970s. At this time, the US had offered the F-86 (Sabre) and F-104 fighters to Pakistan. India sought Soviet support for defence equipment and the flow of MiG-21 series started, during the late 1960s. The MiG-21s were followed by MiG-23, MiG-25, MiG-27, MiG-29 and SU-30. Transporters and helicopters included IL-14, IL-76, AN-32, MI-4/8/17. These were provided at rock bottom prices and on favourable terms. In 1978 came the Anglo-British Jaguar, and in 1985 the French Mirage 2000. The assortment of different aircraft, radars, weaponry and communications systems were procured due to strategic compulsions and limited choices. The constraints of procurement from different international original equipment manufacturers were not dictated by the IAF’s requirements alone but also by the politico-strategic considerations. Needless to state that this mix of such platforms, from so many different sources, could well have been avoided, if our indigenous development had achieved the desired success. The IAF will have to face the challenge of multiple platforms in the medium term.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 8, 2016 at 10:13AM Textron's new V-247 Vigilant drone takes aim at NORTHROP GRUMMAN'S TERN contract. Image source: Textron. For four months we've known the results of the DARPA drone competition: AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) will not build the Navy's new "TERN" vertical-landing-and-take-off drone. Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) will -- and will potentially turn every U.S. warship into an aircraft carrier in the process. But now comes the second question: Yes, Northrop has won the rights to build TERN. But how long can they hold onto it? A competitor on Northrop Grumman's "six" Late last month, one company that wasn't even in the running to win DARPA's drone competition unveiled a new product that has the potential to upset the race, and displace Northrop's prototype. The company is Textron (NYSE:TXT), and its drone is the Bell V-247 Vigilant. Described as a "Group 5 UAS" (the military's largest) Textron's Vigilant is derived from the company's groundbreaking V-22 Osprey piloted aircraft, which Textron builds in conjunction with Boeing (NYSE:BA). The U.S. Marine Corps loves the tiltrotor Osprey, which combines aspects of helicopter and airplane design into a single platform, one Marine Corps Maj. Paul Greenberg says "far outstrips" competing platforms. According to Maj. Greenberg, Osprey can already "carry a significantly greater payload than the aircraft it is replacing, the CH-46, at twice the speed and range -- over 60% greater range than any other rotorcraft, and more with aerial refueling." And now, the Marines are looking to capitalize on those advantages in the form of an unmanned tiltrotor, Vigilant. What the V-247 Vigilant is Like Osprey, Textron says Vigilant "will combine the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft," providing "unmatched long-endurance persistent expeditionary and surveillance capability and lethal reach." (And that tells you Textron is designing Vigilant to serve as an offensive, weaponized drone.) Weighing eight tons empty, and able to carry up to 13,000 pounds of munitions and fuel, Vigilant will sport a 65-foot wing span and 30-foot rotor diameter, permitting it to land on warships the size of an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and larger. Vigilant is being designed to carry MK-50 torpedoes for anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare, as well as Hellfire and JAGM missiles. Vigilant will run on a single tiltrotor engine, be capable of flying at speeds up to 300 knots for as long as 11 hours at a time, and boasts a combat range of 450 nautical miles. The drone will also be capable of mid-air refueling to extend range and endurance. What it means for Textron investors -- and for Northrop Grumman Here's what we know about the potential market value of Textron's new drone offering: According to the latest numbers on the United States' Navy's "battle fleet," there are currently 178 aircraft carriers, other surface warships, and logistics and fleet support vessels with deck space equal to or larger than a destroyer, and thus theoretically capable of launching and landing a Group 5 drone of Vigilant's size. We don't know a specific price that Textron is quoting on Vigilant, but we can make a very rough guess. Based on wingspan, Vigilant appears to be about 50% larger than the TERN drone that Northrop is building for DARPA, and we estimate the price on that one to be about $18 million. Ballpark Textron's Vigilant at $27 million, therefore, and the total potential market size of putting one Vigilant drone on every naval vessel capable of carrying it, would appear to be similar to the size of the market opportunity TERN offers for Northrop Grumman: about $4.8 billion. It's not known if Textron will partner with Boeing to build Vigilant, as it did with the V-22 Osprey. But even if it must split the business with Boeing, Textron only does $13.8 billion in annual revenues. The multi-billion-dollar opportunity to build a new military drone for the Marines makes this a market well worth going after. At the same time, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Northrop Grumman only does about $23.6 billion in annual business. With nearly $5 billion in new revenues at stake, this is a contract that Northrop, too, would therefore very much like to keep to itself. It's a pity Textron doesn't seem to have any intention of permitting that.   Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Aiming to be the Canadian equivalent of Code.org, which featured famous supporters such as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the project was launched by the team at Ladies Learning Code, with support from major Canadian tech figures like Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke and venture capitalist Boris Wertz. Other big name partners putting weight behind the project are international corporations Microsoft, Google and Boeing, and coding education organizations hackerYou, Kidscode Jeunesse and CoderDojo. To fulfill its aim of reaching 10 million Canadians, Canada Learning Code states on its website that it will design and deliver programming, create strategic industry and public partnerships, train educators, complete research and advocate for the cause. One key element of the project will be unifying the various initiatives that have cropped across Canada. “There are a lot of people trying to tackle coding … [but] no cohesion” said Ladies Learning Code CEO Melissa Sarriffodeen in an interview with The Globe and Mail. The organization is now applying for charitable status, and hoping to raise $50 million CAD to complete its goals. Currently, it has raised one-quarter of its $2 million goal for 2017.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 8, 2016 at 8:13AM DARPA wants to build A SPACE "PLANE." Vector Space volunteers to help it traverse the last mile into orbit. IMAGE SOURCE: DARPA. DARPA wants a new space shuttle. It's getting close to building one. And in fact, it just got a little bit closer. Last month, in a little-noticed press release, privately held Vector Space Systems confirmed that it has won $2.5 million worth of contracts from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Through these contracts, Vector -- which hasn't even begun operations yet, although it has begun collecting clients -- aims to play a major part in the designing of DARPA's XS-1 Experimental Spaceplane -- and potentially, in new NASA projects as well. As Vector explains, the contracts break down as follows: First, Vector will tweak its first-stage "Vector-R" rocket for use as a second-stage rocket on DARPA's spaceplane. Second, Vector will develop a smaller "advanced prototype" Vector-R upper stage -- this time for NASA. Success in both efforts should accelerate Vector's progress toward building "a fully functional two-stage flight test vehicle" for itself, as well as advancing DARPA's and NASA's respective objectives. Flight testing to prove is slated to begin late next year. Back up a second. Remind me: What is a "spaceplane"? NASA, as you'll recall, retired the space shuttle in 2011 -- partially because of concerns over the vessel's safety, but also over concerns for its cost. DARPA's XS-1 Spaceplane project aims to address both of these concerns by developing a new "drone" spacecraft that will fly to the verge of space under its own power and there launch a smaller onboard rocket to boost satellite payloads the last few miles into actual orbit. That accomplished, XS-1 will land back on Earth like an airplane (or space shuttle), refuel, reload, and be ready to launch a new payload within 24 hours. In fact, DARPA is targeting turnaround times and consistency of operation that would permit XS-1 to launch "10 times in 10 days." As an unmanned drone, XS-1 would allay concerns about the safety of live cargo. And with launches taking place daily, rather than just a few times a year, the cost of building XS-1 would be spread out among so many deliveries as to dramatically decrease the cost of space launch -- perhaps to as little as $5 million for a two-ton cargo. So far, three industry teams have been hired to work on prototyping a spaceplane for DARPA: Boeing (NYSE:BA), working in collaboration with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin; Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), working with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic; and privately held Masten Space Systems, working with also-private XCOR Aerospace. (XCOR, however, appears to be in the process of shuttering its Lynx spaceplane project, and may be on its way out.) And Vector-R? What's that? Vector describes its new Vector-R launch vehicle as "the world's only launch vehicle dedicated to servicing the micro satellite market by providing a dedicated 50kg launch mass to orbit." Comprising a "carbon fiber airframe, lightweight pressurized propulsion systems and an agile modern avionics system," Vector-R targets the fast-growing market for launching very small satellites, rapidly and at low cost -- and leaves Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus, and SpaceX to duke it out over the market for launching larger satellites. In its final form as a "fully functional two-stage" rocket, Vector-R will be the vehicle Vector uses to launch microsatellites into space. In the meantime, in between time, Jim Cantrell, CEO of Vector Space, says Vector-R's first-stage engine will be designed "platform agnostic" for its role as the spaceplane's delivery rocket. That is to say, regardless of whether DARPA ultimately chooses a prototype spaceplane from the Boeing team, from Northrop, or from Masten, Vector's rocket will launch equally well from any of them. What does it mean for investors? Experts estimate that by 2020, companies could be launching as many as 500 such "microsatellites" annually. At launch prices ranging from $250,000 per launch (CubeCab) to $1.5 million (Vector) to $10 million (Virgin Galactic), that implies an annual market size of up to $5 billion -- a market in which Vector is targeting a 12% share. Vector clearly has its eye on becoming a key player in this emerging market. At the same time, through its contract with DARPA, it's demonstrating a willingness to cooperate with (and profit from) many of the larger companies working on DARPA's new spaceplane -- and through its contract with NASA, an interest in working for the government directly as well. When you get right down to it, it doesn't really matter where the money is coming from. As long as the checks clear, Vector will take it.

Kaiketsu / Wikimedia Commons / http://j.mp/1SPGCl0 Listen Listening... / 3:15 Daniel Howes, October 8, 2016 Bill Ford Jr.’s used to taking shots. He got whacked repeatedly for touting environmentalism in the global auto industry long before going green was cool. That prompted rivals, even his own employees, to wonder if the son of America’s preeminent industrial dynasty was becoming unmoored from the realities of the family business. He got criticized for his tenure as CEO. He and Ford Motor’s directors addressed that a decade ago by naming Alan Mulally as his replacement. The new guy from Boeing led a remarkable turnaround financed by private capital — not the taxpayer money of bailouts and bankruptcy. And Republican Donald Trump rarely misses an opportunity to trash Ford Motor’s decision to move small-car production to Mexico – no matter how many times Bill Ford tells him why the automaker’s doing it and how many jobs it supports in the United States. Now Ford’s executive chairman is taking a shot of his own on the emerging mobility space. He says the multi trillion-dollar global business promises to transform personal transportation and the auto industry as surely as his great-grandfather’s Model T changed the way people live, work and play. To hear Bill Ford tell it, the Blue Oval wants nothing more than to revolutionize the business Henry Ford built. The company wants to listen to the transportation needs of everyday customers and to offer customized solutions. It wants to demonstrate the values of humility and collaboration in an industry seldom associated with either. That oughta’ be a challenge. He says Ford wants to work with municipal governments. It wants to show that what works in New York or Paris may not in Mumbai or Shanghai. It wants to prove to skeptical investors that an Old Economy player can tend to the core car and truck business, expand into mobility, and grow its profit margins. The goal, Bill Ford says, is to be “less capital-intensive … and less revenue-dependent on fixed-cost investment.” And if they fail to exploit huge opportunities in ride-sharing, self-driving cars and transportation services, he admits Ford risks being relegated to assembling other people’s technology. That’s a place it does not want to be because of the negative long-term implications for growth, value creation and its future. Michigan shouldn’t want Ford to head there, either. Done wrong or incompletely, the net effect would be lower profit margins, lower share prices, lower market capitalization and irrelevance. That’s why the mobility mobilization transfixing Detroit and the industry comes down to two words: build value. They need to understand that the recent and not-so-recent past of mediocre products, operating losses and capital destruction remain bitter lessons for investors of every size. They need to understand that hugely profitable years selling cars and trucks in North America are no guarantee of future success in the tech-driven world of mobility. There, barriers to entry are as small as a single idea executed and properly scaled. That’s not an area Ford and its largest rivals are accustomed to, but it’s fast becoming the brave new auto industry – whether they like it or not.   Daniel Howes is a columnist at The Detroit News.

Success in both efforts should accelerate Vector's progress toward building "a fully functional two-stage flight test vehicle" for itself, as well as advancing DARPA's and NASA's respective objectives. Flight testing to prove is slated to begin late next year. Back up a second. Remind me: What is a "spaceplane"? NASA, as you'll recall, retired the space shuttle in 2011 -- partially because of concerns over the vessel's safety, but also over concerns for its cost. DARPA's XS-1 Spaceplane project aims to address both of these concerns by developing a new "drone" spacecraft that will fly to the verge of space under its own power and there launch a smaller onboard rocket to boost satellite payloads the last few miles into actual orbit. That accomplished, XS-1 will land back on Earth like an airplane (or space shuttle), refuel, reload, and be ready to launch a new payload within 24 hours. In fact, DARPA is targeting turnaround times and consistency of operation that would permit XS-1 to launch "10 times in 10 days." As an unmanned drone, XS-1 would allay concerns about the safety of live cargo. And with launches taking place daily, rather than just a few times a year, the cost of building XS-1 would be spread out among so many deliveries as to dramatically decrease the cost of space launch -- perhaps to as little as $5 million for a two-ton cargo. So far, three industry teams have been hired to work on prototyping a spaceplane for DARPA: Boeing (NYSE:BA), working in collaboration with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin; Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), working with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic; and privately held Masten Space Systems, working with also-private XCOR Aerospace. (XCOR, however, appears to be in the process of shuttering its Lynx spaceplane project, and may be on its way out.) And Vector-R? What's that? Vector describes its new Vector-R launch vehicle as "the world's only launch vehicle dedicated to servicing the micro satellite market by providing a dedicated 50kg launch mass to orbit." Comprising a "carbon fiber airframe, lightweight pressurized propulsion systems and an agile modern avionics system," Vector-R targets the fast-growing market for launching very small satellites, rapidly and at low cost -- and leaves Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus, and SpaceX to duke it out over the market for launching larger satellites. In its final form as a "fully functional two-stage" rocket, Vector-R will be the vehicle Vector uses to launch microsatellites into space. In the meantime, in between time, Jim Cantrell, CEO of Vector Space, says Vector-R's first-stage engine will be designed "platform agnostic" for its role as the spaceplane's delivery rocket. That is to say, regardless of whether DARPA ultimately chooses a prototype spaceplane from the Boeing team, from Northrop, or from Masten, Vector's rocket will launch equally well from any of them. What does it mean for investors? Experts estimate that by 2020, companies could be launching as many as 500 such "microsatellites" annually. At launch prices ranging from $250,000 per launch (CubeCab) to $1.5 million (Vector) to $10 million (Virgin Galactic), that implies an annual market size of up to $5 billion -- a market in which Vector is targeting a 12% share. Vector clearly has its eye on becoming a key player in this emerging market. At the same time, through its contract with DARPA, it's demonstrating a willingness to cooperate with (and profit from) many of the larger companies working on DARPA's new spaceplane -- and through its contract with NASA, an interest in working for the government directly as well. When you get right down to it, it doesn't really matter where the money is coming from. As long as the checks clear, Vector will take it.

IMAGE SOURCE:DARPA. Continue Reading Below DARPA wantsa new space shuttle.It’sgetting close to building one. And in fact, it just got a little bit closer. Last month, in a little-noticed press release, privately held Vector Space Systems confirmed that it has won $2.5 million worth of contracts from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration (NASA). Through these contracts, Vector — which hasn’t even begun operations yet, although it has begun collecting clients — aims to play a major part in the designing of DARPA’s XS-1 Experimental Spaceplane — and potentially, in new NASA projects as well. As Vector explains, the contracts break down as follows: First, Vector will tweak its first-stage “Vector-R” rocket for use as a second-stage rocket on DARPA’s spaceplane.

"Our test crew conducts flight trials of the various aircraft and tests their armaments here (ASTE) before inducting them into our fleet for operations and endurance in peace and war times," said the Commandant, Air Vice Marshal Sandeep Singh on Saturday, the IAF's 84th anniversary. As one of the six of its kind the world over, the 44-year-old ASTE is the IAF's only test centre in the country for field trials of its fighters, transport aircraft and helicopters that are indigenous or imported from global aerospace majors. The other five such test centres for military aircraft and weapon systems are in Britain, France, Russia and the US (two) worldwide. "In the recent times, Rafale and Typhoon multi-role medium combat aircraft (MMRCA) were short listed after their field evaluations and flight tests on 750 quantitative and quality requirements by our test pilots and engineers in all-weather conditions and situations," said Group Captain and Chief Test Pilot S. Chaki on the occasion. The other four fighters in contention were F-16 Falcon of Lockheed Martin, F-18 Hornet of Boeing, Gripen of Swedish Saab and Russian MiG-35. Though Rafale of Dassault Aviation was selected over Eurofighter Typhoon as the lowest bidder, India and France on September 23 signed a Euro 7.87-billion deal to buy 36 of them (fighter jets) equipped with latest missiles and weapon systems. As the world's fourth largest air force, the IAF operates various lean and mean flying machines, including Sukhoi-30, Mirage 2000, Jaguar, MiG-21, MiG-29, Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas, Advance Light Helicopter Dhruv, Mi-17, C-130 and C-17 aircraft, keeping pace with time and technological advancements. "Flight tests and field trials of 16 platforms, including 11 fixed and five rotary wings are conducted here for selection, shortlisting and induction into the fleet and deployment at our air bases across the country and on frontline," Singh said. The ASTE is also used by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) for evaluating indigenous aircraft, choppers, weapons, sub-systems and other aerospace equipment used in aerial warfare. "Our test pilots and engineers also fly prototypes of HAL, DRDO and NAL for their indigenous development and integration of weapons and avionics systems. Aircraft upgrades also go through stringent tests and trials before induction," Chaki asserted. "Flight test of a prototype carries risk and a number of test crew sacrificed their life while undertaking hazardous flight test operations," recalled Singh. The centre's test crew also evaluated the Pilatus PC-7 basic trainer, AH-64D Apache attack helicopter and the CH-47 Chinook Heavy lift helicopter for selection. As the nodal centre for avionics systems upgrades for various fleets of the air force, the ASTE ensures that potent and operationally lethal platforms are provided to the air warriors "Core of operational capabilities of these upgraded platforms resides in their weapon systems, targeting accuracies and avionics system functionalities," Singh added. The legacy of evaluation of aircrafts and systems dates back to 1957 when the Gnat aircraft was tested for the first time. Thereafter, Vampire, Mystere, Hunter, HF-24 Marut, HPT-32, HJT-16, Avro and Embraer Air Warning and Control System (AWACS) platform and Saras transport aircraft were tested over the years. Besides flight tests, the centre also trains the air force test crew and engineers at its pilots' school for 46 weeks with specialist course every year. "The flight test course is one of the toughest, as the pilots are mentored to imbibe high degree of engineering acumen and the engineers are taught to almost become pilots," reiterated Chaki. The school is also recognised by the international Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) and the Society of Flight Test Engineers (SFTE). The school trained about 500 flight test crew over the years, while the centre conducted over 1,500 trials of various platforms and weapons, including missiles, laser guided bombs and other ammunition. Incidentally, the first and only Indian cosmonaut Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma was trained and served at the ASTE. --IANS fb/rn/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Terrifying footage recorded by aviation enthusiast Radko Našinec shows the Boeing jet in difficulty as it attempts to come down in strong winds. YouTube/ Radko Našinec via Storyful 4 The plane can be seen coming into land at Václav Havel Airport in Prague YouTube/ Radko Našinec via Storyful 4 The right wing dips as the plane lands forcing the pilot to rebalance in strong winds The heart-stopping clip, from Václav Havel Airport in Prague, Czech Republic, shows the passenger jet wobbling as it comes into land. The right wing of the plane can be seen dipping down as the wheels hit the tarmac before the pilot rebalances the aircraft and pulls up so they can have another attempt. However, as the pilot does this, the left wing appears to scrape along the ground before they can get the jet back into the air.

The delegation is visiting several sites in the United States to choose for flight crew training. Pictured from left, Staff Colonel Al Hazeem, Major General Al Fourdari, Dennis Kintigh, and Major General Al Mazidi (Bethany Freudenthal Photo) Several high ranking Kuwaiti military officials visited Roswell Friday for a tour of the Roswell International Air Center and Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell, as part of a delegation inspecting potential locations in the United States to provide flight training to Kuwait Air Force cadets. “All of us here, we don’t want your business, we want your friendship,” said Brig. Gen. Andrew Salas. “All of us here are a team that have laid out the red carpet for you to come. As the National Guard we will do everything within our power to help the mayor and others help your training here be successful.” The project that has been in the discussion phase for three years will partner the city of Roswell and ENMU-R to provide instruction in English as a second language, contract lodging, and meal service in the university’s cafeteria for the 18- and 19-year-old cadets who will become military officers once they complete the program. If Roswell is selected, Mayor Dennis Kintigh said the program will add both economic and cultural diversity to the city, and send a message that all are welcome here. “It will strengthen our relationship with Kuwait, who is a strong ally in the war on terrorism,” Kintigh said. The consortium seeking the contract with the nation of Kuwait is comprised of RS Warbirds based in Phoenix, which will be providing the aircraft; i3 of Huntsville, Alabama, which will provide instructors and coordination of support and curriculum; and Boeing Training Services of St. Louis, which will provide air traffic control training and safety training. The contract could last up to 10 years, bringing in about 200 cadets for 30 months each, as well as many instructors who would either be located in Roswell or come for temporary duty assignments. “Roswell and New Mexico are really great hosts to foreign nations, and it’ll be good for our economy, and superb for their air force training. You just can’t get any better weather, or any better airspace than right here,” said U.S. Representative Steve Pearce, R-Hobbs. Cadets will be trained on Cessna 172s, Tucanos, a two-seat turbo prop trainer similar to a TG, and the Czech Aero L-39 Albatros, a high performance jet trainer similar to a T-38. i3 has experience training flight personnel in the Middle East, and was involved in “standing up,” the new Iraq and new Afghanistan air forces doing training in country. They are currently under a contract with the State Department and U.S. Army to provide helicopter training to the Tunisian Air Force. Roswell is one of four sites being considered for this project. Because of the small size of their country, there is limited flight training in Kuwaiti for flight crew. “We’re very excited because of the commitment these leaders from Kuwait have in training their soldiers and their airmen, and this is the perfect place for them to do it because of the perfect weather, the ranges, the airspace, the safety and security they have here, the welcoming nature, everybody here wants them to be here, and so we don’t want their business, we want their friendship,” Salas said. If Roswell wins the contract, Kintigh said it will expand the city’s air services from just maintenance to air training that could lead to contracts with other countries. In January, Roswell was visited by a high ranking member of the Royal Saudi Arabian Air Force. Since August, Tunisian Air Force cadets have been receiving helicopter training at the air center, and are expected to be here until the beginning of next year.

(Rebecca F. Miller/The Gazette) The Gazette Oct 3, 2016 at 6:00 am | Print View CEDAR RAPIDS — Perhaps the sandbags and other barriers blocked your view, but as the Cedar River rose, crested and receded, there was a world of news outside the Cedar Rapids flood evacuation zone. Bullets flew in war zones, a shopping mall and in confrontations between police and civilians. The slings and arrows of political campaigns continued and, perhaps, like the river itself, surged. Baseball pennant races were decided and homecoming parades were marched. So as the tide goes out, here’s what you need to know: Sept. 22 ▪ Even though fewer than 10 percent of a potential 28,787 University of Iowa students completed a survey on sexual violence on campus, 20 percent of female undergraduates reported being raped since enrolling at the Iowa City university. ▪ Retired Prairie Home Companion host Garrison Keillor, who has made his share of Iowa jokes, was in Des Moines mixing homespun humor with political commentary to urge Iowans to support Democrat Patty Judge for U.S. Senate and reject GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Hitting the campaign trail is rare for him, Keillor said, but he likes to “speak up for Democrats in endangered places ... and I like underdogs.” ▪ In Charlotte, North Carolina, a man was shot and critically injured during a second violent night of protests, after two sharply divergent accounts emerged of the death of a black man at the hands of police. ▪ A march of a few hundred people turned chaotic after protesters attempted to follow police in riot gear into the lobby of an uptown hotel. Officers used tear gas, and then a reporter heard one shot and saw a man lying in the street near the hotel entrance. Sept. 23 ▪ Fundraisers based on setting new Guinness World Records were planned by Friends of Cedar Lake, which needed at least 408 people to set a record for the largest, five-minute Hula-Hoop workout. Iowa Valley Habitat for Humanity needed at least 1,821 people to set the record for fist-bumping. ▪ Warplanes mounted the heaviest airstrikes in months against rebel-held districts in the city of Aleppo as Russia and the Syrian government spurned a U.S. plea to halt flights, burying hope for the revival of a doomed cease fire. A hospital director told Reuters the death toll was 45. Sept. 24 ▪ Iowa State University President Steven Leath, a licensed pilot, reimbursed the university $4,637 for flying one of its planes on four occasions involving a combination of university and personal business. ▪ Later, he wrote a check for $15,000 to cover damages sustained after he encountered a downward draft while landing in Bloomington, Illinois. Leath clipped a runway light in the hard landing. ▪ Two months after refusing to endorse Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said in a Facebook message that although he had “‘areas of significant disagreement” with his party’s nominee, he would vote for Trump because he doesn’t want Hillary Clinton to become president. Sept. 25 ▪ Steve Martin and Martin Short headlined the opening of the University of Iowa’s glittering $176 million performing arts center just uphill from the original Hancher, lost to floods in 2008. More than 20,000 visited the new building this month, from 9,000 who attended two public open houses to 8,000 who came the following weekend for a free outdoor concert, followed by donors and guests who came to a gala dinner and show. ▪ President Barack Obama expressed hope that a new national museum showcasing the triumphs and tragedies of the African American experience helps bring people together. The museum, located on the National Mall, officially opened its doors Sept. 24. It contains 36,000 items that trace the journey of African Americans from slavery in the 1800s to the fight for civil rights in the 20th century. ▪ The Iowa Hawkeyes escaped from New Jersey with a 14-7 win over unranked Rutgers after making a fourth-down stand late in the game to preserve the lead. Sept. 26 ▪ United Nations officials suggested an air raid on a humanitarian convoy outside Aleppo, Syria, that killed 20 could be considered a war crime. However, the incident became a contest of international finger pointing with Russians and Syrians denying involvement and suggesting it might have been the work of a U.S. drone. ▪ The motive for a shooting in a Washington state mall that killed five was unknown, investigators said after arresting a suspect who was described as “zombielike” during the attack. FBI officials said while they had no indication the attack was a “terrorism act,” they could not rule out that possibility. Sept. 27 ▪ Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump launched into a spirited brawl as they met onstage for the first time, each jockeying for a breakout moment in their tightening race during the first debate of the general election campaign. The candidates repeatedly shouted over each other as they argued about their histories, plans and the comments each of them has made during the presidential race. “I have a feeling by the end of this debate I am going to be blamed for everything that ever happened,” Democrat Hillary Clinton said. “Why not?” Trump responded. “Join the debate by saying more crazy things,” Clinton shot back. ▪ Rockwell Collins won a contract to provide touch-screen flight displays on the new Boeing 777X jetliner, the first commercial air transport aircraft to be equipped with that type of flight displays. The displays are expected to make the flight deck more intuitive for pilots and more efficient for flight operations. Boeing has 300 orders and commitments for the 777X, with first deliveries planned for 2020. Sept. 28 ▪ More than 100 people gathered near the 1500 block of Eighth Avenue SE where police said a 13-year-old girl died from a gunshot to the head hours earlier while riding in a car with five others. Family, friends and community members held candles and balloons in remembrance of Ireshia Parks and pleaded with the young people present to stand against gun violence. Police said a 13-year-old male suspect now faces a charge of involuntary manslaughter. ▪ Midwest business conditions improved — slightly — despite weakness among manufacturers linked to agriculture and energy, according to the Creighton University Mid-America Business Conditions Index. The regional index, much as with the national reading, has indicated the manufacturing sector is experiencing anemic to negative business conditions. ▪ A key Iowa lawmaker suggested the state promote health care occupations for young people similar to a focus on STEM — science, technology, engineering and math — to meet the challenges of aging Iowans and the shortfall of trained professionals to take care of them. “Without reaching out to the next generation and showing them that they could have a fulfilling career in providing care, we will face a significant difficulty in meeting the needs of our growing senior population in this state,” Rep. Dave Heaton, R-Mount Pleasant, 75, co-leader of the Legislature’s health and human services budget subcommittee, told delegates to the Older Iowans Legislature. Sept. 29 ▪ A state audit found that a program that paid out $310 million to nearly 1,000 economic development projects from 2003 to 2014, plus an additional $1.4 billion in tax relief, created only 64 percent of the jobs promised. Of the 18,503 projected new jobs at those projects, 11,840 have been realized, according to the report. An additional 396 projects, with 24,757 projected jobs, are still in progress and do not have an accounting of jobs created. ▪ In Council Bluffs, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump accused Democrat Hillary Clinton of being corrupt and attacked her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. He also told about 1,200 people that he rejected the idea that he lost Monday’s debate, saying he won in a ‘landslide.’ About 1,200 people attended the rally. “How many more Clinton scandals can this country take?” he asked about her use of a private email server. Trump said he would lower taxes, reduce regulations, help family farms thrive, negotiate great trade agreements and repeal Obamacare while offering more choice among schools and improving national security and the nation’s borders. ▪ Congress voted Sept. 28 to override President Barack Obama’s veto of legislation that allows relatives of 9/11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for their deaths. However, family members said they knew that even with the enactment of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, their day in court is distant. Congress is expected to revisit the legislation after the Nov. 8 general election. ▪ Based on thousands of wiretaps, photographs, witness statements and forensic tests during more than two years of inquiries, international prosecutors said Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down in July 2014 by a missile fired from a launcher brought into Ukraine from Russia and located in a village held by pro-Russian rebels. The findings counter Moscow’s suggestion that the passenger plane, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in July 2014, was brought down by Ukraine’s military rather than the separatists. Sept. 30 ▪ Campaigning in Des Moines on the first day of early voting, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton predicted she will carry the state. Calling GOP nominee Donald Trump’s approach negative, she told about 2,000 people the nation has to “heal these divides.” “The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot,” Clinton said. “The election will be close. But we can win Iowa.” ▪ Federal investigators assessed whether equipment failure, an incapacitated operator or other factors could have caused a packed commuter-rail train to crash at Hoboken (New Jersey) Terminal, killing one person and injuring 100 others. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said the crash appeared to be accidental. Officials declined to speculate on a cause, but one thing is clear: The train was traveling far too fast as it entered one of the busiest transportation terminals in the New York area, crashed onto the concrete platform, destroyed the metal canopy over the platform and finally came to a rest when it crashed into the station building. ▪ Congress avoided a government shutdown by approving a continuing resolution to fund the federal government for 10 weeks beyond the end of the federal fiscal year Sept. 30. To make that happen, the House of Representatives and the Senate voted to allocate $1.1 billion in funding to address the Zika crisis, aid those affected by floods in Louisiana and give support to residents of Flint, Michigan, who have struggled with water contamination from lead pipes. ▪ Congress won’t be back in session until Nov. 14, leaving members a month to campaign for their re-elections. Oct. 1 ▪ After leading the $1.9 billion University of Iowa Health Care enterprise through a decade of historic prosperity that included world-renowned medical breakthroughs, soaring patient totals, record revenue and expansion — including a new children’s hospital and biomedical research facility — Jean Robilliard announced he’s stepping down. At almost 73 years old, Robillard, a pediatric nephrologist by training, said he intends to remain on faculty in the UI Stead Family Department of Pediatrics after his successor arrives. ▪ For now, a Decorah couple has the OK to build a home that looks like Kinnick Stadium in an Iowa City neighborhood, though their neighbors indicated they’ll likely take the issue to court. The Iowa City Board of Adjustment, which heard the neighbors’ appeal of the city’s granting the structure a building permit, split 2-2 on the issue Friday night, with one member recusing herself. That means the plan can proceed since three votes were required to overturn the city’s decision. City staff classified the house as a single-family dwelling and issued the building permit. ▪ Police say Christopher Arteberry Jr. is dead following a stabbing incident Sept. 30 in Cedar Rapids about one mile from the campus of Kirkwood Community College. Cedar Rapids Public Safety spokesman Greg Buelow said officers responded to an apartment complex at 6725 College Park Court SW at 2:09 a.m. Emergency medical care was initiated at the scene and Arteberry was taken to Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later, Buelow said. ▪ Former Israeli President Shimon Peres is laid to rest in Israel’s Mount Herzl national cemetery, eulogized by Israeli leaders, family and two American presidents as a founding father who first built up Israel’s military industrial complex and then sought peace with the Palestinians. Peres died Sept. 28 from complications of a stroke. He was 93. Oct. 2 ▪ Russian warplanes and their Syrian government allies battered rebel-held areas in and around Aleppo and rebels and aid workers accused them of destroying one of the city’s main hospitals and killing at least two patients. ▪ Iowa State University President Steven Leath has announced a historic campaign to raise $1.1 billion by June 30, 2020 — the most ambitious fundraising goal in the university’s history. ISU’s campaign, called “Forever True, For Iowa State,” comes just as the University of Iowa’s $1.7 billion capital campaign, called “For Iowa. Forever more,” nears its end. ▪ The Iowa Hawkeyes dropped their homecoming game to Northwestern with the Wildcats prevailing 38-31 at Kinnick Stadium.

Apple Pay is easy to set up and users will continue to receive all of the rewards and beneﬁts offered by credit and debit cards. Online shopping in apps and on websites accepting Apple Pay is as simple as the touch of a finger with Touch ID, so theres no need to manually fill out lengthy account forms or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information. When paying for goods and services on the go in apps or Safari, Apple Pay works with iPhone 6 and later, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 and later. You can also use Apple Pay in Safari on any Mac introduced in or after 2012 running macOS Sierra and confirm the payment with iPhone 6 or later or Apple Watch.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 9, 2016 at 12:13PM Artist's depiction of China's future "Heavenly Palace" national space station. Image source: Penyulap, via Wikimedia Commons. "Beijing, we have a problem." Since it first went up in 1998, the International Space Station has played host to astronauts from more than a dozen countries -- but not one of them was from China. In fact, in 2011, the U.S. Congress passed a law specifically prohibiting Chinese access to the ISS over concerns about "national security." This, of course, has the Chinese a bit miffed. And as we mentioned last year, China has been planning to build its own, all-made-in-China space station instead. Slated for completion by 2022, the Tiangong 3, or "Heavenly Palace," space station will probably comprise three separate-but-linked modules, with a pair of laboratories flanking a central living habitat. Heavenly Palace is expected to go into service just as America and Russia are preparing to disassemble their International Space Station for obsolescence. Halt and catch fire While preparing to build its station, China sent up an orbital test bed (also, confusingly, called "Tiangong") in 2011. Initially designed for a two-year mission, Tiangong 1 was kept in service up until this year, although uninhabited, for research purposes. It's unclear precisely how long China was hoping to stretch out Tiangong 1's life span. But events have forced its hand: Last month, China confirmed that it has lost all control over Tiangong 1. Various observers say the station is now in a "slow roll," with its solar panels no longer angled to collect sunlight, "drifting out of control," and now on course to enter Earth's atmosphere in an "uncontrolled re-entry." Upon entering the atmosphere, Tiangong 1 will promptly catch fire. That's actually a good thing, though: The hope is that much of the space station's mass will burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere. The station's denser parts, however, will probably crash to Earth, and right now, no one's quite sure where. Beijing, we need a (couple of) new space station(s) Lucky for China, then, that as Tiangong 1 crashes to Earth, it has a replacement ready. Last month, the Tiangong 2 space lab was launched into orbit, awaiting the arrival of two Chinese astronauts later this month. When that one, too, is all used up, China's space program will culminate in the launch of the ultimate "Heavenly Palace": Tiangong 3. It's this version that will comprise a core module (Tianhe 1) and two labs (Wengtian and Mengtian), massing about 72 tons when all put together. With launches of the various modules slated to take place between 2020 and 2022, it's likely that China will try to keep Tiangong 2 going for somewhere between four and six years before sending it, too, to burn up in the atmosphere. What it means to investors Now what import does all of this have for investors? After all, it's not as if China is a publicly traded company that we can invest in. Furthermore, in all three versions, Tiangong is a project run by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, which, as S&P Global Market Intelligence confirms, is a privately held company. The answer is that we need to keep an eye on Tiangong not as an investment idea itself, but as a competitor to other potential investments. Recall that the International Space Station -- largely financed by America, built by American companies such as Boeing (NYSE:BA), managed by companies like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and serviced by companies including SpaceX and Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA) -- is nearing the end of its life span. Currently, NASA has no firm plans to build a new space station. But Russia might, and China definitely will. Almost certainly, these new space stations will neither be built by U.S. companies nor provide U.S. companies with lucrative service contracts. Granted, NASA has floated plans to sell the International Space Station to private investors after 2024. But these plans, too, are far from certain. For one thing, there's no guarantee that America's partners in running ISS will agree to sell it to private interests. For another, we've heard not a peep out of Boeing, Lockheed, or Orbital yet about their interest in paying for ISS, after years of getting paid by ISS. For that matter, there's also a very real question: Will companies that might otherwise like the idea of running experiments in space choose to pay to run them on an antiquated ISS? If China and/or Russia were to build brand-spanking-new space stations, it might be more cost-effective to hire these countries to perform research on contract rather than take responsibility for ISS and run them "in-house." The upshot is this: Five years ago, America lost its space shuttle, and was forced to begin paying Russia for rocket rides. And just a little more than five years from now, we may lose our only space station as well -- and begin paying China to use theirs.

But if we are to sustain growth in air travel without aggravating global warming, we must quickly reduce aviation-related CO2 emissions, which are substantial and not covered by the Paris climate agreement that more than 190 countries agreed to last December. Fortunately, now is the perfect time to decouple aviation emissions from air-travel growth. Representatives from 191 countries convened in Montreal this week for the 39th Session of the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization; after decades of wrangling, they have agreed to an aviation-specific climate agreement. The new ICAO framework aims for "carbon-neutral growth" in international aviation from 2020 onward, and has as its centerpiece a global market-based measure (GMBM) to help airlines affordably cap their net emissions at 2020 levels. When implemented, it will be the first carbon-emissions cap on a global industry that does not noticeably increase costs for consumers. And airlines will purchase emissions reductions from other economic sectors, thus funneling billions of dollars into low-carbon development around the world. For the first six years, the new framework will apply only to flights between countries that have voluntarily adopted it, which means that the ICAO will have to encourage adequate participation for the program to be effective. This opt-in approach has some critics, but whether a program is categorized as "voluntary" or "mandatory" is beside the point, because international accords generally apply only to the sovereign countries that have decided to join them. Some 64 countries have already signaled their willingness to sign on to the ICAO agreement, and together they account for nearly 80% of expected growth in CO2 emissions above 2020 levels. That isn't 100%, but it's a great start, and we can expect more countries to join when they see others reaping the benefits of low-carbon development. The airlines themselves will welcome a coherent global framework that establishes clear and predictable compliance metrics, rather than a regulatory patchwork that differs from country to country and complicates international operations. To minimize compliance costs - and because environmental sustainability is now a key competitive marker for customers and investors alike - airlines will likely encourage the countries where they do business to participate in the ICAO program. The new agreement provides an enormous opportunity to prevent the emission of 2.5 billion tons of CO2 in the first 15 years - the equivalent of taking roughly 35 million cars off the road every year the program is in force. The agreement will also spur major manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, and Embraer - which are already investing in quieter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and efficiency improvements for existing models - to develop cleaner technologies that will allow them to purchase fewer emissions offsets. However, the framework decided in Montreal is not complete, and crucial details need to be worked out quickly so that airlines can begin to plan how they will meet the new environmental targets. Developed countries have already offered to help implement the GMBM, which, it is hoped, will pave the way for investments in emerging economies that are becoming new aviation powerhouses. If the countries can leapfrog over old technologies, they can become new leaders in carbon-smart flying. They should seize the opportunity before them and join the ICAO framework so that their manufacturers have a clear and predictable path forward. At the Paris climate talks last year, we witnessed the power of global collective action to address climate change. No fewer than 187 countries - large and small, developed and developing - announced emissions-reduction targets in the months before the conference, which created the momentum to reach a landmark accord. With the Paris climate agreement on track to enter into force in the coming months - more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible - we still have that momentum. The ICAO agreement is the next wave in the international battle against climate change. Together, the two agreements will boost our chances of delivering environmentally sustainable economic growth. By cleaning up our carbon footprint now, future generations of air travelers from all countries will be able to look out their window onto a healthy planet. - Christiana Figueres was Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) from 2010 to 2016.

Teri Lynn Cantlay will be featured in an upcoming edition of the Women of Distinction Magazine in 2016/2017. Better known in her professional life as "TeriLynn CanSee", Teri Lynn Cantlay established her business, TLC and Associates/Enterprises in June 2012 with the understanding that she would help clients make positive life choices by giving them that added insight that only she can provide. As a Psychic, Tarot Reader/Astrologer, and Metaphysical Holistic Healing Practitioner, Cantlay focuses her energy on helping clients find their own self-empowerment so that they can lead fuller, happier lives. "Guiding clients so that they can explore their options by reading happenings to them from their past, present, and future, I am very straightforward. I will not participate in negative energy readings, spells, or anything that will put them in a dark place. Instead, my job is to bring my client and their soul into the light of their own best being."

Seattle in 1969 is swarming with Japanese businessmen here to do deals—shipping, lumber, imports, Boeing. And they want to seal those deals the best way they know how: at a sushi bar. But first, the liquor board needs convincing that a sushi bar is merely a counter where the chef stands, making food and presenting it directly to diners. posted by CrystalDave (12 comments total) 25 users marked this as a favorite   That was a welcome respite from the news of the day. posted by kiltedtaco at 7:20 PM on October 8 Any story about Shiro that includes Maneki is a delight and a treasure. posted by mwhybark at 7:24 PM on October 8 [1 favorite] Delightful, thank you! posted by nfalkner at 7:49 PM on October 8 Really enjoyed this and now have a reason to ride the train north to eat dinner, I mean see my sister... posted by sourbrew at 11:40 PM on October 8 [1 favorite] "fried prawn spot head" Sadly I will never ever be able to eat solely based on the sushi chef's discretion. I'll stick to my spicy tuna and salmon. posted by sio42 at 4:44 AM on October 9 I'm not a particularly adventurous sushi eater: I generally like most fish, not a fan of octopus or urchin. I got one of the sushi set dinners at Kashiba. I think they change what's in the sets based what's in season, but when I was there it was "safe" options + sea urchin. So I figured might as well give urchin another try.The urchin was heavenly. I promptly ate everybody else's. I still think longingly of it: I'm in the Midwest now, so back to the basics when it I get sushi. I think I need to book a flight to Seattle soon.... posted by ghost phoneme at 9:59 AM on October 9 I had omakase at Shiro's once. The best sushi I have ever had in my life. I nearly refused to eat other sushi for another year or two afterwards. posted by grouse at 11:29 AM on October 9 [1 favorite] As a lifelong vegetarian, upon reading this story, I wanted to eat his sushi. I know that I wouldn't appreciate it, and don't have the taste for meat (although I enjoy vegetarian sushi), and the experience would probably be wasted on me... But I still wanted it. posted by el io at 4:46 PM on October 9 What does an evening of Omakase cost at a good sushi place? Is it priced per dish and you don't have control over what you get or because the chef can use different things is it priced per diner? I like sushi (except for the egg one) so would easily try an Omakase evening, except for the open ended pricing (and lack of a good place to get it here) posted by koolkat at 1:32 AM on October 10 In my experience they'll offer price bands. $60, $80, $100; for example. You can also say to just go until the end (don't discount the tamago). I've been lucky enough eat at Shiro's Belltown location twice. (not with him himself, but still excellent) The last time was for a rare occasion, and it came out to $150/person. I still remember details from it, they had just bought an entire tuna half the night before and were showing photos before serving 4 different cuts from the same fish. I hardly would've believed that they were the same species if I hadn't known. Absolutely magnificent. posted by CrystalDave at 5:34 AM on October 10 At Kashiba, Shiro's current place, reviews put his omakase at $95 and up, presumably before drinks. I have had the omakase at the Belltown restaurant, also after his tenure, and second the $150. I would probably expect to pay more than that for omakase with Shiro himself at Kashiba, and there would be drinks on top of that. posted by mwhybark at 7:40 AM on October 10 Mmm.

Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- As tensions between Washington and Moscow flare, the Russian military is warning the United States that it has the ability to target stealth aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit that might be operating over Syria with the Almaz-Antey S-400 (NATO: SA-21 Growler) and the recently arrived S-300V4 (NATO: SA-23 Gladiator) air and missile defense systems. However, Western defense officials and analysts are skeptical and note that both the F-22 and the F-35 were specifically designed to counter those Russian-developed weapons, the National Interest reported. "Russian S-300, S-400 air defense systems deployed in Syria's Hmeymim and Tartus have combat ranges that may surprise any unidentified airborne targets,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told the Russian state media outlet Sputnik. “Operators of Russian air defense systems won't have time to identify the origin of airstrikes, and the response will be immediate. Any illusions about ‘invisible’ jets will inevitably be crushed by disappointing reality.” However, while Moscow makes bold claims about the counter-stealth capabilities of their S-400 and S-300V4 air defense systems, the fact remains that even if Russian low-frequency search and acquisitions radars can detect and track tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft such as the F-22 or F-35, fire control radars operating in C, X and Ku bands cannot paint low observable (LO) jets except at very close ranges. Stealth is not—and never has been—invisibility, but it does offer greatly delayed detection so that a fighter or bomber can engage a target and leave before the enemy has time to react. Tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft must be optimized to defeat higher-frequency bands such the C, X and Ku bands—that’s just a simple matter of physics. There is a ‘step change’ in an LO aircraft’s signature once the frequency wavelength exceeds a certain threshold and causes a resonant effect. Typically, that resonance occurs when a feature on an aircraft—such as a tail-fin or similar— is less than eight times the size of a particular frequency wavelength. Fighter-sized stealth aircraft that do not have the size or weight allowances for two feet or more of radar absorbent material coatings on every surface are forced to make trades as to which frequency bands they are optimized for. That means that radars operating at a lower frequency band such as parts of the S or L band are able to detect and track certain stealth aircraft. But ultimately, to counter lower frequency radars, a larger flying-wing stealth aircraft design like the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit or the B-21 Raider—which lacks many of the features that cause a resonance effect—is a necessity. But at the UHF and VHF band wavelengths, designers are not trying to make the aircraft invisible—rather engineers hope to create a radar cross-section that will blend in with the background noise that is inherent to low-frequency radars. Low frequency radars can be used to cue fire control radars however. Additionally, some U.S. adversaries have started to make an effort to develop targeting radars that operate at lower frequencies. However, those lower frequency fire-control radars exist only in theory—and are a long way off from being fielded. “Stealth is ‘delayed detection’ and that delay is getting shorter. SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) radars are shifting their frequencies into lower frequency bands where U.S. stealth is less effective,” said Mark Gammon, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F and EA-18G program manager for advanced capabilities, had told me some time ago. “Early warning radars are in the VHF spectrum where stealth has limited if any capability. These radars are networked into the SAM radars giving the SAM radars cued search.” But low-frequency radars do not themselves provide a “weapons quality” track that is needed to guide a missile onto a target. There are various techniques that have been proposed to use low frequency radars for such purposes, but none of those are likely to prove viable. U.S. Air Force Col. Michael Pietrucha had described one possible approach to me to accomplish such a feat in an article I wrote for Aviation Week & Space Technology a few years ago. However, U.S. Air Force officials were dismissive of the technique. “Just because something is technically possible doesn't make it tactically feasible,” one Air Force official with extensive stealth aircraft experience explained. Meanwhile, operational Raptor pilots tell me “it would be really classified to discuss specific SAM counter tactics,” however, the F-22 is more than capable of defeating any of the current Russian surface-to-air missile systems that are currently or projected to be fielded. Hopefully, we will not have to find out the how effective the Raptor truly is during a shooting war over Syria—since conflicts can rapidly escalate out of control, as history loves to teach us over and over again . Despite the theoritical bases put forward by the the National Interest report, the Russian air defense unit deployed in Hmeymim and Tartus have managed to identify several radar avading aircraft of the US army from a long range in practice. Last week, a US spy plane was spotted flying off the coasts of Syria near the Russian base in Tartus while another one was picked up by radars as it was conducting reconnaissance operations over the Russian fleet near Crimea in the black sea, western websites said. The western websites that monitor military movements across the globe reported that a US spy plane of RC135W with tail number 62-4138 left Souda Bai Airbase in the Greek Crete Island and launched reconnaissance operation over the Russian navy fleet Southwest of Crimea's coast. The website added that another US P-8A spy plane with tail number 169958 also left Sigonella Airbase in Sicily on a reconnaissance mission over the Russian warships and base in Eastern Mediterranean Sea and Southern Cyprus. The US plane's spy operation near Syria's waters lasted for around half an hour before it moved towards Lebanon. Also last month, a US P-8A Poseidon spy plane was spotted again flying off the coast of Lebanon and Syria, near Tartus. The US Navy reconnaissance plane was spotted at the time flying a few kilometers away from Russia’s Humeimim airbase in Syria. The P-8A Poseidon aircraft flew close to Syria’s Mediterranean coast where Russia’s naval task force operates. It was the fourth time that a US spy plane was spotted near the Russian base in Humeimim. Humeimim military airport, Southeast of the city of Lattakia, is Russia’s strategic center of operations against the ISIL and other terrorist groups. According to reports, the P-8A Poseidon aircraft, designed and built for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, took off from the Mediterranean island of Sigonella in Sicily. The aircraft, with tail number 168761 then flew over Syria’s coast for one and a half hours in close proximity to the Russian airbase and logistics facility located at Tartus port, South of Lattakia. Observers believe that the US spy planes have recently increased their flights over Syria to gather intelligence on the Syrian army and the Russian forces' moves in the region. According to reports, on August 30, September 2 and September 17, the P-8A Poseidon spy plane was also spotted flying toward the vicinity of the Russian airbase.         Related News More US Spy Planes Spotted Flying over Russian Bases in Black, Mediterranean Seas  US Reconnaissance Plane Spotted again Near Hmeimim Airbase  US Spy Plane Spotted Flying over Russian-Controlled Hmeimim Airbase  LATEST STORIES (9) Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US TEHRAN (FNA)- Chanting “Not my president” and “love trumps hate,” hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in cities across the United States to protest against President-elect Donald Trump, who they say threatens their civil and human rights.

The transaction is expected to close by the first quarter of 2017 after regulatory and shareholder approval. Chen Feng, chairman of Hainan Airlines, will control the largest Chinese-owned fleet of leasable aircraft. HNA's Avolon Holdings Ltd will expand its fleet to 910 aircraft valued at more than billion, according to a statement issued on Thursday by Ireland-headquartered Avolon Holding Ltd, an international aircraft-leasing company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen-listed Bohai Capital Holding Co Ltd, a subsidiary of HNA Group. Li Xiaojin, a professor at Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, said: "As a diversified enterprise, acquiring an aircraft-leasing and lease management services company will help HNA Group expand its global aircraft leasing business coverage." China has become the most dynamic market for international air travel, due to strong domestic and overseas travel demand, and a rising middle class. In the next two decades, China is likely to become the first country with an aviation market exceeding trillion, according to a recent report by Boeing Co. By the end of June, CIT Group held total assets of .1 billion and liabilities of .7 billion. "The sale of CIT Commercial Air represents an important milestone for CIT. This transaction will strengthen our balance sheet, simplify our business and enable us to return significant capital to our shareholders," said Ellen R. Alemany, chairwoman and CEO of CIT Group. The move is part of the ongoing trend of HNA Group acquiring overseas assets to recombine and step up its domestic and global expansion. The deal would add to a string of overseas acquisitions of HNA Group, whose assets are now valued at more than 600 billion yuan ( billion).
