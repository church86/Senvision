ANA was the jet’s launch customer in 2011. (Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times) All Nippon Airways, the world’s biggest operator of Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets, announced it is canceling nine domestic flights on Friday — and possibly 300 in the next month — because of a corrosion problem with the plane’s engines. Share story By Chris Cooperand Kiyotaka Matsuda Bloomberg News All Nippon Airways (ANA), the world’s biggest operator of Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets, announced Thursday in Tokyo it is canceling nine domestic flights Friday because of a corrosion problem with the plane’s engines. The airline may have to scrap more than 300 Dreamliner flights through the end of September as it moves to replace parts inside the engines on a portion of its 787 fleet, Takeo Kikuchi, a deputy senior vice president of engineering and maintenance at ANA, told reporters Thursday in Tokyo. The airline’s fleet of 50 787s are all powered by Rolls-Royce engines. About 38 percent of all the 787s in service are powered by those engines, while the rest are outfitted with General Electric engines.

The U.S. regulator “has reviewed the problem and determined it is not a safety concern.” There are no U.S.-registered Boeing 787 aircraft with Rolls-Royce engines. ANA will replace medium-pressure turbine blades in the engines where cracking has been detected, Kikuchi said. Engine failures Earlier Thursday, before the airline announced the flight cancellations, air traffic control authorities instructed ANA Flight 241, in flight from Tokyo to Fukuoka, to return to Tokyo after one of its 787 engines failed. ANA previously had an engine problem on a Boeing 787 in February, when the plane returned to Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia after receiving a warning that the temperature of the exhaust gas from its right engine was very high, forcing the engine to be shut down. ANA encountered the issue of corrosion in turbine blades three times since February, most recently Aug. 20, and has been in talks with Rolls-Royce on the issue since March, Kikuchi said. Rolls-Royce said it is working to minimize the impact on flights. “This issue is limited to a small proportion of the ANA fleet,” a Rolls-Royce spokesman said in response to questions about whether other airlines’ fleets may be affected. The British company “will update the market if we believe any further action is required,” the spokesman said. Short-haul flights and corrosion The European Aviation Safety Agency is “considering” releasing a service bulletin recommending action by carriers in Europe, a spokeswoman said by email. Unlike most 787 operators, ANA uses the jet for short flights on Japanese domestic routes. Flying shorter flights would produce more wear and tear on an engine designed to spend 10 or more hours cruising between continents, said Robert Mann, an aviation consultant. Corrosion caused by sulfides could be caused by the “combination of higher temperature stresses in the climb portion” of flight, followed by shorter than typical periods at cruising altitude, he said. Mann likened the situation to the pressure on the exhaust system of a car driven only short distances. “The engine never heats up fully to drive the moisture out the exhaust system. Then it shuts down, and condensation causes the rust to gather,” he said. Financial impact ANA, which was the launch customer for the 787 in 2011, operates almost a third of Dreamliners globally that fly with the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, according to a Morgan Stanley research report. This isn’t the first time corrosion has been found in the Rolls-Royce power plants. The issue cropped up in the Trent 1000 gearboxes in 2012 and was quickly resolved, Jaime Rowbotham, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients Thursday. Rolls-Royce announced at the Farnborough Air Show last month that European safety regulators had certified an updated version of the Trent 1000 that borrows technology developed for a newer engine powering Airbus Group’s A350 jetliners. “We expect the new derivative will have been designed to avoid the issues of its predecessor,” Rowbotham wrote. Kikuchi said ANA expects to lose 55 million yen ($548,000) from Friday’s cancellations. The company doesn’t know the total financial impact at this time, he said. Despite its early, headline-grabbing struggles, when all 787s were grounded for more than three months in 2013, the 787 has evolved into one of the most dependable planes in service, with a dispatch reliability of more than 99 percent, according to Boeing. Just last week, at a celebration in Everett of ANA’s 50th Dreamliner delivery from Boeing, Hideki Kunugi, senior vice president of ANA Americas, praised the reliability of the airplane.   Seattle Times aerospace reporter Dominic Gates contributed to this story.

(ANA) Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner takes off at Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg ANA Holdings Inc. is canceling flights as the world’s biggest operator of Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner checks for corrosion in the jet’s Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc engines. The Japanese airline canceled nine flights scheduled for its 50-jet Dreamliner fleet for Friday and may scrub more than 300 trips through the end of September as it deals with cracking in the medium-pressure turbines of the Trent 1000 engines, Takeo Kikuchi, a deputy senior vice president of engineering and maintenance, told reporters Thursday in Tokyo. The disruption is the largest 787-related miscue for ANA since 2013, when Boeing and regulators grounded the global Dreamliner fleet after lithium-ion batteries caught fire on two jets. About 38 percent of the 787s in service are powered by the Trent 1000, while the rest are outfitted with General Electric Co. engines. The latest problem came to the fore as ANA investigated why a 787 engine overheated during a February flight. That jet returned to Kuala Lumpur airport after receiving a  warning that the temperature of the exhaust gas from its right engine had spiked. ANA has encountered corrosion in turbines since then, most recently on Aug. 20. ANA-Specific The difficulty appeared to be specific to ANA, which frequently uses the wide-body, carbon-composite aircraft for short flights. Rolls-Royce and Boeing said they were working with the Japanese carrier to lessen the impact. “This issue is limited to a small proportion of the ANA fleet,” a spokesman for London-based Rolls-Royce said, adding that no other airlines were affected. The European Aviation Safety Agency is considering releasing a service bulletin recommending action from the continent’s carriers, a spokeswoman said by e-mail. There are no U.S.-registered Boeing 787 aircraft with Rolls-Royce engines. The issue stems from sulfidation-corrosion cracking and is “not a fan blade problem,” the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement by e-mail. The U.S. regulator “has reviewed the problem and determined it is not a safety concern.” Wear and Tear Start your day with what’s moving markets. Get our markets daily newsletter.

This wasn’t the first time corrosion has been found in the Rolls-Royce power plants. The problem cropped up in Trent 1000 gearboxes in 2012 and was quickly resolved, Jaime Rowbotham, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients. New Model Rolls-Royce announced at the Farnborough Air Show last month that European safety regulators had certified an upgraded version of the Trent 1000 that borrows technology developed for a newer engine powering Airbus Group SE’s A350 jetliners. “We expect the new derivative will have been designed to avoid the issues of its predecessor,” Rowbotham wrote. Rolls-Royce fell 1.8 percent to 774 pence at the close in London. ANA gained 1.6 percent to close at 279.5 yen in Tokyo. Boeing was little changed at $132.89 at 3:57 p.m. in New York. Financial Impact Engine problems have affected flights three times, Kikuchi said. ANA expects to lose 55 million yen ($548,000) from Friday’s cancellations and doesn’t yet know the total financial impact, he said. Since Rolls gets most of its profit from hourly maintenance contracts that charge airlines for the time an engine spends in the sky, the company’s revenue could fall if ANA cancels hundreds of flights. Rolls maintains “a conservative provisioning policy” and “will update the market if we believe any further action is required,” the spokesman said. (An earlier version of this story corrected the percentage of 787s in service that are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 turbines.) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Korolev Rocket and Space Corp (RSC Energia) and the US aerospace giant Boeing reached an agreement to solve their dispute over the Sea Launch rocket project, Energia’s General Director Vladimir Solntsev has said. The Izvestia report on the settlement has not yet been confirmed by US sources. The dispute goes back many years and in September 2015 the US District Court for the Central District of California awarded Boeing a multimillion dollar compensation from its former partners in the Sea Launch project, including Energia, following the bankruptcy procedure. Energia and its Ukrainian counterpart Yuzhnoe claimed that Boeing had given unwritten assurances to its Sea Launch partners that it would not seek reimbursements. “We have signed a preliminary agreement with Boeing to settle a dispute on Sea Launch in that context a court in the United States suspended all the activities to collect debts. Before the end of the year we are planning to sign a final agreement with Boeing, which should stipulate conditions of the [dispute’s] settlement,” Solntsev said, as quoted by the Russian Izvestia newspaper. He added that Energia and Boeing had already evolved a programme of long-term cooperation, which included projects covering space exploration. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by US aerospace giant Boeing. The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator – the best possible location for launch – which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth’s rotation. Sea Launch resumed operations in 2011 after a 30-month hiatus that saw passage through US Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now the company is 95-per cent owned by Energia Overseas Limited, a subsidiary of Energia. Despite the re-started operation, orders for Sea Launch satellite work has dried up. There are ‘orders’ for new rockets to be built, but as yet no customers. Its last launch was for Eutelsat back in May 2014.

(AP) — For a change, Fred Couples won't be receiving the most attention and the largest galleries when the Boeing Classic tees off Friday at TPC Snoqualmie Ridge. The Seattle native is missing his hometown tournament for the second time since he joined the senior tour six years ago. Couples had to withdraw during the 2012 tournament, but didn't enter this year because of back problems that have sidelined him since February. With Couples' bid to finally win a tournament in his hometown put on hold, most of the focus will fall on tour newcomer John Daly. "Everywhere he goes, there's a buzz. Everyone just loves John, they love to watch him hit the ball a long way, but just his personality and the way he conducts himself on the golf course, everybody has fun," said Billy Mayfair, who in his first start on the senior tour finished second behind Gene Sauers in the U.S. Senior Open. "He brings a lot of people out to watch and I think it's great. Listen, everyone here in this field would love to see John play well. We've always been that way." Daly has three top-20 finishes in 10 PGA Tour Champions starts since turning 50, with the best a tie for 11th last month in the Dick's Sporting Goods Open in New York. "Right now, for me, my game is not where I want it, so it's more of a grind and it's very hard to enjoy it as much as guys that are playing really good out here," Daly said. "They come in, they're playing really good, they've got confidence. I'm just coming in trying to find it." Last week, he tied for 51st in the regular European Tour's Czech Masters. "A little jet-lagged today, but it wasn't too bad," Daly said. "It was nice. We went Prague, Amsterdam, straight here." He visited the NFL's Seattle Seahawks on Wednesday "I didn't get a chance to kick any. We did the chip off," Daly said. "It was a beautiful facility. I got to talk to Coach (Pete) Carroll. I haven't seen him in a while since USC kicked the living you-know-what out of the Razorbacks. Beat us like 70-3 or 70-7 or something." He found Snoqualmie Ridge's greens demanding. "The greens are tough," Daly said. "The greens are hard to hit right now. For me, I'm hitting it so bad that the fairways are very generous, but I'm really struggling getting the ball close, and of course I'm putting like a blind man so that's not helping either. The tour was off last week, giving Sauers an opportunity to relish his first senior victory. Sauers took advantage of a late collapse by Miguel Angel Jimenez to beat Jimenez and Mayfair by a stroke. "I was almost kind of beginning to doubt myself whether I can win again," Sauers said. "This is my fourth year out here and I haven't won. I've won on the PGA Tour, I've won on that Nike Tour, and that was one of my goals, to win out here on the Champions Tour, and I got me a good one. " The victory capped an amazing comeback for Sauers 10 years removed from nearly dying. He was incorrectly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, spent seven weeks in the hospital and was given a 25 percent chance of survival. Eventually he was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare disorder of the skin and mucous membranes that causes the skin on the extremities to burn from the inside out. "I didn't touch a club for seven years. You got to relearn everything," Sauers said. "Hitting the ball wasn't so bad, but just around the greens, chipping and putting, the bunker shots and all that, that kind of took a little extra time to try to master. Still haven't mastered it, still working on it, but had me a good week. But just coming back from all that stuff is extra special." The tournament is in its 12th year and is the only regular stop of any of the major golf tours in the state of Washington. The tour announced on Thursday that Boeing would remain the title sponsor of the tournament through 2021.

Boeing patented a jet engine powered by lasers and nuclear explosions Benjamin Zhang Aug. 25, 2016, 4:08 PM 16,449 facebook linkedin twitter email print Here's an illustration of the engine courtesy of PatentYogi.YouTube/PatentYogi US Patent and Trademark Office approved an application last June from Boeing's Robert Budica, James Herzberg, and Frank Chandler for a laser- and nuclear-driven airplane engine. With airplane makers constantly on the lookout for new and more efficient ways to power their products, this laser engine is the latest idea cooked up by the engineers at Boeing. Modern airliners such as the Boeing Dreamliner are powered by multiple turbofan engines. These engines deploy a series of fans and turbines to compress air and ignite fuel to produce thrust. Boeing's patented engine provides thrust in a very different and rather novel manner. According to the patent filing, the laser engine may also be used to power rockets, missiles, and even spacecraft. As of now, the engine lives only in patent documents. The technology is so out-there that it is unclear whether anyone will ever build it. Here's a look at the inner workings of Boeing's futuristic engine with the help of some illustrations from PatentYogi.  View As: One Page Slides Boeing's new jet engine works by firing high-power lasers at radioactive material, such as deuterium and tritium. YouTube/PatentYogi The lasers vaporize the radioactive material and cause a fusion reaction — in effect a small thermonuclear explosion. YouTube/PatentYogi Hydrogen or helium are the exhaust byproducts, which exit the back of the engine under high pressure. Thrust is produced. YouTube/PatentYogi At the same time, the inside wall of the engine's thruster chamber — coated in uranium 238 — reacts with the high-energy neutrons produced by the nuclear reaction and generates immense heat. YouTube/PatentYogi The engine harnesses the heat by running coolant along the other side of the the uranium-coated combustion chamber. YouTube/PatentYogi This heat-energized coolant is sent through a turbine and generator that produces electricity to power the engine's lasers. Yes, lasers! YouTube/PatentYogi Other than the radioactive material, the engine requires very little in terms of external energy. YouTube/PatentYogi Here's Boeing's patent.

Giovanni Capriglione secured near-unanimous passage of a new law that has enabled the public to see who benefits financially from dealings with the government. His victory in pushing through House Bill 1295, requiring the disclosure of interested parties in state and local government contracts, cemented Capriglione’s stature as one of the state capitol’s leading advocates of government accountability. Now, with the approach of the 2017 Legislature, Capriglione hopes to build on his success by seeking to blunt the impact of state court decisions that rolled back access to public records. The 43-year-old Southlake Republican has made transparency a key ingredient in his legislative agenda since winning election to the House in 2012. He sums up his outlook by recycling a quote from U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis more than 100 years ago: “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.” “Transparency is one of those principles that you can never have enough of,” Capriglione said. “Accountability in government is of fundamental importance. And that accountability starts with the ability to see how the government spends your money.” Capriglione, who is seeking re-election to a third term over a Democratic challenger in his heavily Republican northeast Tarrant County district, is targeting two Texas Supreme Court rulings as he looks toward the 85th Legislature that starts on Jan. 10.  Both rulings, made in 2015, have tightened access to public records held by private and non-profit entities. The court ruled that the non-profit Greater Houston Partnership was not required to disclose its financial records even though it performed economic development duties for the city of Houston and was partly supported by public funds. Public access watchdogs have also deplored the court’s ruling in favor of a Boeing Aerospace company operating in San Antonio. The 7-1 court majority ruled that Boeing and other private entities doing business with the government can block the release of information that the companies contend would give an advantage to competitors.  Capriglione said he plans to introduce legislation to effectively undo the court rulings through changes in the Texas Public Information Act, thus restoring access to documents that previously were considered public. The two bills would be the first measures he introduces for the 2017 session, he said.  Describing what he called the “chilling” decision in the Boeing case, Capriglione said it allows private entities that don’t want information disclosed “to basically shut down that access.” “We’ve got to get back to where I think people want to be. If you’re going to have access to public dollars, you should have to disclose that information,” he said. Capriglione’s success with House Bill 1295 contrasted with the collapse of nearly two dozen other accountability and transparency measures, many of them contained in a polarizing omnibus bill, despite Gov. Greg Abbott’s pledge to dedicate the 2015 session to ethics reform. Described by the Texas Tribune as “a leading advocate of ethics reform in the notoriously unrestrained Texas Legislature,” Capriglione secured passage with a unanimous vote in the House and only one dissenting vote in the Senate. Signed into law in June 2015, the measure requires the disclosure of “interested parties,” those with a financial benefit, in government contracts of $1 million or more.  So far, more than 5,200 certificates with the required information have been posted on the Texas Ethics Commission website, which offers customized searches to look for interested parties, government entities and businesses.  Next session, Capriglione said, he hopes to expand on information available to the public under the new law, including identifying which interested parties are elected officials. As a freshman lawmaker, Capriglione pushed unsuccessful legislation that would have required state elected officials to disclose government contracts in which they had a financial interest. Capriglione, a private equity manager and father of three, said he recognized the need for expanded public access before he became a House member when he personally experienced challenges in unearthing information. “I was trying to find information about local budgets, and I just found it to be very difficult,” he said. “The more information I tried to find, the more I felt it should be easier to get.” As a candidate in 2012, Capriglione said, he discovered plenty of sympathizers while block-walking throughout House District 28, telling potential constituents of his goal to shed more sunlight on state and local government.  “After talking to a few thousand of them, it became clear that is what the average person wants,” he said.  Dave Montgomery is a Texas freelance journalist.

The carrier said that under certain flying conditions the compressor blades in the engine's interior showed corrosion. It said it will cancel nine domestic 787 flights on Friday, with other cancellations likely in the coming weeks. ANA's Dreamliners are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines. The Japanese airline is the biggest operator of the Boeing model with some 49 aircraft, or around a tenth of the global fleet. Of the 445 Dreamliners in operation worldwide, 168 use the Rolls-Royce engines, according to Boeing's website. "We are aware of the situation and are working with Rolls-Royce and ANA to resolve any issues impacting the airplanes in service," a spokesman for Boeing in Tokyo said. Rolls-Royce Holdings said in an e-mailed statement it was "working closely with ANA to minimise the effect on aircraft service disruption". It did not say whether the problem had been found in 787 engines on aircraft operated by other airlines, but when asked about any requirement to take additional action a spokesman said the issue was limited to a small proportion of the ANA fleet. Shares in Rolls-Royce traded down 2.2 percent at 771 pence at 1505 GMT, making the company one of the biggest losers on Britain's bluechip index. Airlines that order the Dreamliner can choose either the Rolls-Royce engines or General Electric Co's GEnx engines for their aircraft. ANA said vibrations resulting from the problem with the compressor blades had occurred on a flight from Japan to Malaysia in February and on one to Vietnam in March. A 787 travelling on a domestic route on Aug. 20 had also experienced trouble, it said. Rolls-Royce is in turnaround mode after a tough 18 months after being hit by a low oil price and lower demand for servicing of some of its older engines. It has a plan to cut costs by 150 million to 200 million pounds by the end of 2017. In a note, Morgan Stanley analysts pointed out that a previous corrosion issue on the Trent 1000 gearbox in 2012 was quickly resolved and the then chief executive said the financial consequences were not material.

ESA/CNES/Arianespace – Photo Optique Video du CSG Two U.S.-built Intelsat communications satellites destined for different missions fired into space from French Guiana just after sunset Wednesday, vaulting due east over the Atlantic Ocean before separating from their Ariane 5 launcher right on target in geostationary transfer orbit. Running 21 minutes late after a boat ventured into restricted waters in the Atlantic Ocean, the dual-payload mission took off at 2216:08 GMT (6:16 p.m. EDT; 7:16 p.m. French Guiana time) from the ELA-3 launch pad at the French-run Guiana Space Center. quickly climbed into the sky atop 2.9 million pounds of thrust, then steered eastward and picked up speed. The 180-foot-tall (55-meter) broke the sound barrier in about 48 seconds, then ascended through a thin transparent cloud layer as sound from the rocket rumbled across the jungle spaceport on the northern coast of South America. Two 103-foot-tall (31.6-meter) solid rocket boosters split away from the sides of the Ariane 5 rocket’s hydrogen-fueled core stage at T+plus 2 minutes, 22 seconds. About one minute later, after the rocket’s passage through the perilous dense lower atmosphere, the Ariane 5’s Swiss-made nose fairing jettisoned in two halves like a clamshell to reveal the tandem Intelsat spacecraft. The main stage’s Vulcain 2 engine turned off about nine minutes into the mission, and the Ariane 5’s upper stage HM7B powerplant took over for the next phase of the flight. The HM7B engine shut down around T+plus 25 minutes, then the Ariane 5’s flight computers pointed the rocket for deployment of the two payloads. Intelsat 33e, made by Boeing, separated first from the upper segment of the dual-satellite stack. A few minutes later, a Sylda adapter jettisoned to reveal the smaller Intelsat 36 platform, which sprung away from the rocket at T+plus 41 minutes, 50 seconds. Both satellites radioed ground controllers soon after separation, and Intelsat officials said the new spacecraft are in good health. “Arianespace is delighted to announce that Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 have been separated as planned in the targeted standard geostationary transfer orbit,” said Stephane Israel, chairman and CEO of Arianespace, the Ariane 5’s commercial operator headquartered near Paris. Credit: Stephen Clark/Spaceflight Now Intelsat, one of the world’s largest commercial satellite operators, booked the whole capacity of Wednesday’s Ariane 5 launch. Ken Lee, Intelsat’s senior vice president of space systems, was sure of the decision before the launch. “If you look at their history, Ariane 5 has more than 70 successes in a row, and we felt confident enough to put two of our spacecraft on one rocket,” Lee said in an interview with Spaceflight Now. “If you look at the probability, you actually lower the probability (of a failure) as a system by launching two-in-one on a highly reliable rocket, instead of having two different discrete events that have to occur.” The gamble paid off, and the Ariane 5 rocket put both satellites in a good orbit, with parameters near the preflight target altitude between 155 miles (250 kilometers) and 35,879 kilometers (22,294 miles) above Earth. The satellites are circling Earth on a path tilted 5.9 degrees to the equator, slightly better than the predicted inclination, according to tracking data released by the U.S. military. “For the fourth time this year, we have had a flawless mission for Ariane 5, and it is the 73rd success in a row of this rocket,” Israel said. “Ariane has a reputation for delivering, and today they delivered not one, but two of our satellites successfully into orbit,” Lee said in remarks after the launch. “These two satellites will bring important services to customers and their end users across Africa, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific.” Both spacecraft will fire on-board thrusters in the coming weeks to reach their final operating positions in geostationary orbit. At an altitude of nearly 22,300 miles (35,800 kilometers), the satellites will fly around Earth’s equator at the same speed the planet rotates, allowing the platforms to see the same part of the world at all times. Artist’s concept of the Intelsat 33e satellite. Credit: Boeing The 14,550-pound (6.6-metric ton) Intelsat 33e satellite, based on Boeing’s 702MP platform, will conduct its orbit-raising maneuvers between Aug. 27 and Sept. 4, then extend its power-generating solar arrays and enter service around Nov. 1 after checkouts of its sophisticated Ku-band and C-band communications payload. Fitted with more than 70 beams and the equivalent of 269 Ku-band and C-band transponders, Intelsat 33e is the second of seven new-generation “Epic” satellites ordered by Intelsat. It will replace the Intelsat 904 spacecraft — launched by an Ariane 4 in 2002 — at 60 degrees east. “This addition to our high throughput fleet will extend the benefits of high performance, greater efficiencies and simplified access to customers in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific,” said Stephen Spengler, Intelsat’s chief executive. “It features a digital payload connecting 100 percent of the frequency on the satellite. The higher performance and greater flexibility of Intelsat 33e will better serve our enterprise, telecom, mobility and government customers with custom-built satellite solutions to take their applications to the next level.” Intelsat 33e’s launch Wednesday came about seven months after Intelsat 29e, the first Epic satellite, blasted off on another Ariane 5 mission. “This one is significantly more capable,” Lee said. “I would say it has more capacity. We design ‘Epic’ satellites to serve different functions and different missions, so there are different frequencies, but in terms of the underlying flexibility, the capability is the same. “We have five more ‘Epic’ spacecraft in the factory, and they have enhanced capabilities,” Lee said. “So we’re adding more features on top of what we have.” Intelsat officials say the “Epic” satellites will allow the company to tap into the growing mobile communications market, reaching customers on the road, airplanes and ships. That is a market currently dominated by other satellite operators, such as Inmarsat. The all-digital payload aboard Intelsat 33e — and other “Epic” platforms — give Intelsat the ability to quickly adapt the satellite’s bandwidth between different locations. For example, with a simple command from the ground, operators can reduce bandwidth in the middle of the night in one area and focus capacity in regions hosting special events, such as the Olympics. “What the digital payloads allow is in a matter of seconds and minutes, to provide that re-allocation and flexibility in bandwidth,” said Mark Spiwak, president of Boeing’s commercial satellite business. “The power it gives the operators to meet the market demands is the real advantage of this digital payload.” The digital payload will be introduced on the next set of U.S. Air Force’s Wideband Global SATCOM satellites set for launches beginning later this year.

Credit: Space Systems/Loral The 7,171-pound Intelsat 36 satellite launched in the lower position on Wednesday’s Ariane 5 flight is kicking off a 15-year mission to distribute video programming across sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Built on a short 24-month schedule by Space Systems/Loral, Intelsat 36 will boost its orbit to geostationary altitude between Aug. 25 and Aug. 30, then start commercial service in October, Lee said. Carrying 34 Ku-band and 10 C-band transponders, Intelsat 36 will maneuver to a post at 68.5 degrees east longitude, where it will join the Intelsat 20 satellite relaying television broadcasts. “Intelsat 36 will enhance our video neighborhood at 68.5 degrees east, strengthening our media distribution for our customers in South Asia cable community, and in particular in sub-Saharan Africa with our long-standing customer MultiChoice,” Lee said. The launch of Intelsat 36 will help accelerate the transition from analog to digital television in South Africa, Lee said. Wednesday’s double launch for Intelsat, a first for the historic operator, was dedicated to Brian Sing, a respected Intelsat program manager who died suddenly in early August. “Brian was the expert on Intelsat’s launch vehicles,” Spengler said. “He was a dedicated engineer whose tireless work ensured that our launch vehicles are of the highest quality. He made significant contributions to the launcher sector that resulted in improved quality of launch vehicles, benefiting not only Intelsat but also other satellite operators.” Sing passed away shortly before traveling to French Guiana to help prepare for Wednesday’s launch. “Brian was highly respected and appreciated by everybody who had the good fortune to work with him,” Israel said. “His absence will be deeply felt.” The next Arianespace launch is scheduled for Sept. 15, when a solid-fueled Vega booster will loft the PeruSat Earth observation satellite for the Peruvian government and four commercial imaging craft for Google’s Terra Bella subsidiary. The next Ariane 5 mission is set for Oct. 4 with Australia’s Sky Muster 2 and India’s GSAT 18 communications satellites. Email the author. Follow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.

Atherton posted Aug 25th, 2016 at 10:12am United States Patent And Trademark Office Artillery Shell Delivering Flame Retardant No, no, the thing is we fire the guns at the fire, and then it stops. Artillery is a tool of destruction. Howitzers, in particularly, are a kind of weapon great for lobbing explosions up through the air and over objects to crash down on foes. So why is defense and aviation giant Boeing looking to howitzers as a way to fight forest fires? Because artillery, as it turns out, doesn’t have to just deliver explosives. The guns themselves don’t care too much about what the shell fired does when it lands; the guns are just there to put the payload where it goes. A new patent from Boeing for a “Fire-retarding artillery shell” wants to swap out the death-dealing explosives in howitzer shells and replace them with life-saving fire retardant. A patent summary describes how the artillery works: In one embodiment, an artillery shell is disclosed. The artillery shell includes an external surface, a cavity, a fire-retarding material, and a trigger. The cavity is disposed within the external surface. The fire-retarding material is disposed within the cavity. The trigger is configured to release the fire-retarding material. So why artillery? Specifically: what advantage does a howitzer have that a helicopter or a converted bomber doesn’t, when fighting a fire? Aircraft are excellent at delivering a single large load to a target (in war, an enemy position; in forest firefighting, a section of the fire), but once they’ve dropped their payload, they have to go back and refill before they can attack again. In battle, this gives enemies time to regroup. In forest firefighting, it gives the fire time to grow. Boeing’s patent was filed in 2014 and made public last month, according to DefenseOne. Boeing’s patent notes: For instance, Applicant has determined (based on the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) Incident Response Pocket Guide), that in order to establish an aircraft-delivered firebreak for a relatively small 28 ace fire, it would take approximately 7.6 hours to deliver a required 6,469 gallons of fire-retarding material During the 7.6 hour time period, the relatively small 28 acre fire has the potential to grow and burn an estimated 100 acres of land. Compare with the M198 Howitzer, which the United States phased out of active use in the last decade. There are hundreds still made, so it’s not a bad guess for the kind of hand-me-down weapon the Forest Service could get. The M198 can be carried into position by truck or military helicopter, set up within six minutes, and then fire at least two shells every minute. Here’s some rough math. The M107 projectile fired by M198 howitzers has about 14 pounds of explosive payload. (It’s likely that a specially made fire-fighting projectile would have more volume for fire retardant). The fire retardants used by the Forest Service are mostly water, with special powders or chemicals mixed in. A gallon of fire retardant weighs about nine pounds, so an existing shell could fit, roughly, 1.5 gallons of fire retardant. At two rounds per minute, it would take a single howitzer 36 hours to deliver the same 6,469 gallon payload as the bomber. That’s not great at all! Fortunately for Boeing’s patent, and the field of artillery writ large, howitzers are best paired with friends. A howitzer battery is typically six guns, so instead of the 36 hours it would take one howitzer to deliver 6,469 gallons, or the 7.6 hours it would take one plane, six howitzers could fire enough to make a firebreak in just under six hours. With 12 guns, that firebreak is set up in just three hours. Artillery scales really well. Wildfires burned over 2.6 million acres in the United States in mid-July. If Boeing can turn its patent into concept and then a useful tool, it may just be the tool needed to fight forest fires with firepower (or, in this case anti-firepower).

The airline, with a fleet of 50 Dreamliners, canceled nine flights using the aircraft Friday and may have to scrap more than 300 through the end of September, Takeo Kikuchi, a deputy senior vice president of engineering and maintenance, told reporters Thursday in Tokyo. ANA is replacing medium pressure turbine blades on the planes, Kikuchi said. The 787-related flight cancellations are the largest for ANA since 2013, when Boeing and regulators grounded the global Dreamliner fleet while fixing a fire issue with the plane’s lithium-ion battery. About 38 percent of the 787s in service are powered by Rolls-Royce’s Trent 1000 turbines, while the rest are outfitted with General Electric Co. engines. The latest issue came to the fore as ANA investigated why a 787 engine overheated during a February flight. That jet returned to Kuala Lumpur airport after receiving a warning that the temperature of the exhaust gas from its right engine was very high. ANA has encountered the issue of corrosion in turbine blades three times since February, Kikuchi said. Rolls-Royce and Boeing said they are working with the airline to minimize the impact on flights. “In terms of any requirement to take additional action, this issue is limited to a small proportion of the ANA fleet,” a Rolls-Royce spokesman said in response to questions about whether other airlines’ fleets may be affected. “We are aware of the situation and are working closely with ANA to minimize the effect of aircraft service disruption.” The European Aviation Safety Agency is “considering” releasing a service bulletin recommending action from carriers in Europe, a spokeswoman said by email, adding that “there are discussions going on.” ANA has been in talks with Rolls-Royce on issues with the engines since March, Kikuchi said Thursday. The airline, which was the initial customer for the 787 in 2011, operates almost a third of the Dreamliners globally that fly with Trent 1000 engines, according to a Morgan Stanley research report. This is not the first time corrosion has been found in the Rolls-Royce power plants. The issue cropped up in the Trent 1000 gearboxes in 2012 and was quickly resolved, Jaime Rowbotham, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a note to clients Thursday. ANA has had three issues with the engines that have affected flights, Kikuchi said, adding that it expects to lose ¥55 million from tomorrow’s cancellations. The company does not know the total financial impact at this time, he said. Despite its early, headline-grabbing struggles, the 787 has evolved into one of the most dependable planes in service, with a dispatch reliability of more than 99 percent, according to Boeing.

ANA, the largest operator of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, said it was cancelling services to replace compressor blades in the aircraft’s Trent 1000 engines produced by FTSE 100 listed Rolls-Royce. Shares in the Derby-based engineer fell almost 2pc on the news that the Japanese carrier had found corrosion on  blades inside the engines. rolls royce shares ANA has 49 Dreamliners in services - more than 10pc of the 445 Seattle-built 787s that have been delivered so far by Boeing. So far nine flights using the jet have been cancelled and ANA has indicated that more changes to its flight schedule are likely to follow because of the problem. Rolls competes with US rival General Electric to supply engines for the 787, one of the newest most advanced airliners in the world, and the British company has almost 40pc of the market. A spokesman for Rolls said: “We are aware of the situation and are working closely with ANA to minimise the effect on aircraft service disruption.” The problems are understood to relate to the way ANA uses the aircraft, with their airline using its 787s for shorter routes. This means that the engines go through more "cycles" than other operators, so the engines effectively age faster than if they were used on longer routes. This accelerates the amount of servicing they need.   It is understood to be too early to tell whether the increased maintenance will have a financial impact on Rolls under its "aftercare" agreement with ANA, but the company generally makes conservative assumptions on these pckages meaning it is unlikely to have much of an impact on the company's finances.  Rolls-Royce makes the Trent 1000 for the Dreamliner Credit: Kurush Pawar The Dreamliner had a difficult introduction into airline service. It’s first flight was pushed back several times as a host of problems surfaced in the production process, delaying its maiden flight by several years. ANA took delivery of the first 787 in September 2011, but once the jet began commercial flights further troubles emerged as a result of its advanced technology, which includes the use of composites in the fuselage and lithium batteries. In January 2013, a fire broke out in an empty Japan 787 parked at Boston airport, caused by the battery. Days later an ANA 787 made an emergency landing after the flight crew received a computer warning of smoke inside an electrical compartment, and warnings about a battery malfunction. Firefighters tackled a fire aboard an Ethiopian Airlines 787 at Heathrow after a problem with its batteries Three months later a fire broke out in an empty Ethiopian Airlines 787 at Heathrow, which investigators said was started by problems with batteries powering an emergency beacon. Boeing has rectified problems with the batteries, but the 787 suffered another hitch in April this year when US regulators ordered airlines to carry out an urgent fix to 176 Dreamliners fitted with FGE engines because of an engine icing problem. The instruction came from the Federal Aviation Administration after an incident in Janaury when one of the two engines on a Japan Airlines 787 shut down in mid-flight and could not be restarted. The pilot was able to land the plane safely using one engine, and the problem was caused by ice coming off the engine's fan blades, causing them to rub against another part of the engine, causing vibrations.

Byron Connolly (CIO) 25 August, 2016 14:53 - - - - print email Comments As a young lad, Ted Colbert played with chemistry sets and taught himself how to program on a Commodore 64, an entry-level computer that was hugely popular in the 1980s. A few decades later, with a love for engineering and IT and a stack of experience under his belt at AT&T Bell Labs, Ford and Citi, the American landed the plum yet highly challenging role of CIO at $96 billion aerospace and defence giant, Boeing. Today, Colbert is responsible for IT strategy, operations and processes at the world’s largest aerospace company, and one of the top manufacturers of commercial aircraft and defence, space and security systems. There are more than 6,000 IT staff in his team. Colbert is leading technology transformation initiatives at Boeing which will play a big part in preparing the 100-year-old global organisation for its second century of operation. Last week, Colbert was visiting IT teams in Australia, which is the organisation’s largest footprint outside the United States. “There are some amazing products that we deliver in the locations here in Australia,” Colbert tells CIO. Australia provides a small yet very agile environment to test out and implement solutions that are used by the global organisation, he says. “This group [in Australia] is able to accelerate the application of many of the things we are trying to do across the enterprise. We do research work here, we do fabrication and manufacturing and sell services – we do all sorts of things.” Colbert describes being at the helm of a big piece of an organisation that has been around for 100 years as an ‘awesome’ responsibility. “You have to put in place things that maybe 20 years from now, people will look back and think, ‘how in the world did these guys think about this?’” he says. “We look back 20 years and we see people doing punch cards and other interesting stuff and they would have never imagined we would be where we are today,” he says. “We are looking at where we need to evolve the business, how we look at the next generation of design and manufacturing, what role does automation and robotics play, and how do we look at digitisation in general?” Boeing is leveraging what Colbert describes as “the digital thread of data” that flows through the lifecycle of the aviation company’s products at each stage. A key part of this is providing a feedback loop throughout the system to make its products better, deliver them faster and ensure manufacturing is easier and safer for its many thousands of employees. “And we need to be supporting our customers with insights to help them run their businesses more efficiently. That big area of design manufacturing is very significant. “In our services business, [we need to ask] how do we take more market share? What are the future solutions that our customers will need? Safety, productivity and quality are all inextricably linked – how do we take the company a step function forward there?” he says. “So I have an effort that supports all of those big objectives around second century enterprise systems and that takes a look at – in the industry we would say it’s a digitisation strategy – but it’s more than that. It’s saying, ‘what does the digital core of the company look like when we talk about traditional ERP, manufacturing, execution, operations management, and product lifecycle systems?” Colbert says. Colbert says work is being done to drive commonality and simplification and remove some of the fragmentation in the digital core of its commercial and defence operations to drive innovation across the business. “Around that you have to put a very strong strategy around information management and data so that you have a common view and a way to serve up data across the enterprise.” Information an important asset Read more ​Inside Hudson’s Asia-Pacific tech transformation Information management and data analytics is indeed a big part of Boeing’s transformation strategy. So much so that Colbert became senior VP of information and analytics earlier this year in addition to his CIO role. To put things into perspective, there were around 100 sensors in the nose cone of a Boeing aircraft built in the 1960s. Today, there are many thousands of sensors spread across the planes that create a vast amount of data that can be used back in the design/manufacturing lifecycle, and with its customers. “There’s data in the design and engineering process, there’s data in the manufacturing process that comes out of machines and out of execution, quality and certification systems,” says Colbert. This information is being used to predict part failure, and when maintenance needs to be scheduled as well as help with crew scheduling and aircraft health management. Colbert says there are many applications of data analytics that represent opportunities to drive productivity from within the company and support the efficiency and safety of its customers. “We believe that data is an important asset – I couldn’t tell you what it's worth but it’s priceless at this point,” Colbert says. “But both in commercial and defence businesses, we have seen applications on our platforms that leverage data and analytics and, in the end, software and solutions to support our customers. It’s a big opportunity.” Boeing is making a move towards rolling out cloud architectures, says Colbert. Globally accessible and scalable cloud platforms are being used when required by its development, production and operations teams. “We have partnerships with folks who have platforms around the world that we plan to leverage that will look like hybrid cloud architectures – very secure capabilities with our customers,” he says. Boeing’s services business, which delivers parts, maintenance and engineering and flight operations solutions, lends itself to a software-as-service model, he says. “We will look to refactor applications in that space to leverage cloud-like architectures. Again it will be more of a hybrid environment and we will leverage a secure environment outside the company when necessary.” Read more Exclusive: Claudine Ogilvie new Jetstar CIO Currently, more than half of Boeing’s order backlog for commercial and defence products is coming from outside the United States. “What that means is if we are delivering solutions and trying to leverage data coming off our platforms to help our customers, we’ve got to have global access from a compute perspective and I will not build datacentres all over the world to support things that we do.” A unique CIO role Colbert started doing engineering work in his first summer out of high school when he landed an internship with a local utility in Baltimore, north of Washington D.C. He spent his university years working at an AT&T Bell Laboratories’ factory that manufactured glass for fibre optic cable. At the time, the Internet was booming and the factory couldn’t make enough glass to support the demand for the cable. Using his engineering background, Colbert built simulations and models of the factory and made some recommendations on how to improve efficiency. He was also asked to create a tool that enabled the organisation to view what was being produced on the factory floor. “An engineer gave me a book of Visual Basic manuals and said … ‘see what you can build,’” Colbert says. “Over the next four to six weeks, I built a production control system for the AT&T factory. I launched it on the factory floor and it unlocked all kinds of value for the workforce and management.” After completing a Bachelor of Industrial Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology in 1996, Colbert had job offers from companies in the traditional industrial engineering sector but also in IT. “IT was relevant then, but nowhere near what it is now,” he says. “That experience [at AT&T] said to me that software is the future; IT is the future, leveraging data to provide insights and drive process is the future.” Read more IT workers say their companies are failing to innovate Colbert then took his background in industrial engineering to Ford where he was part of the automotive giant’s ‘employee rotational program.’ He spent nine years between 1998 and 2007 at the company in various roles. Colbert then moved into financial services at Citi as senior VP of strategy and planning, and as senior architect. “The core of financial services companies is IT and this gave me the opportunity to experience that. Citi offered enterprise architecture, strategy and planning [experience], a series of ‘individual contributor’ kind of roles.” Colbert arrived at Boeing in October 2009 to undertake more operational roles starting as director, enterprise network services, before moving into the roles of VP, IT business systems in 2010 , VP, information technology infrastructure in 2011 and CIO in November 2013. He describes his current role as unique yet quite tough. “Being in the middle of an evolving 100-year-old company and continuing to demonstrate our place as an innovative leader in the world – a global industrial enduring champion, is a tough role. “When I talk to my peers in the industry, they are always interested in the broad set of challenges that I have as a CIO. I am very fortunate to have the role. I have learned over the years that there are definitely patterns in the way technology is implemented and how we look at organisations and standards and drive innovation,” he says. Colbert says an exciting part of his career has been his ability to solve big problems by leveraging improved processes and technology. “Things have evolved over time and fundamentally, what I have seen even back to my first internship where I was doing manual, intern type of work, technology has become more efficient, gotten better and faster and the ability to apply it to problems follows suit with that largely,” he says.

He is the executive sponsor for Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, a small, historically black college for women. “At Spelman, one of the programs we sponsor is around robotics. That’s for college students but there is also reach back in to the grade schools to help with the STEM pipeline,” he says. “There are other examples across our company. We invest millions and millions of dollars into the community, a lot of it going towards STEM and disadvantaged communities but I think there’s more work to do.” Colbert admits that women and minority groups are poorly represented in positions of leadership across many organisations. But he says in the US, there are many initiatives at corporate and government levels that are helping to stimulate the pipeline. “You have to do this because the demographics of the world are changing to be more diverse. Fundamentally, a diverse workforce is a force multiplier in performance.” “There’s more to be done, we [Boeing] do a lot and our parent companies do a lot but there’s a lot of reach into disadvantaged communities to really stimulate the curiosity of children in the STEM fields,” he says. Ebony power In 2015, Colbert was named as a member of the Ebony Power 100, a list that includes not only business leaders but entertainers who are famous the world over, the likes of Prince, Janet Jackson and Regina King. “I am super humbled to be part of the list,” he says. “I just consider myself a person who just wants to do a good job, work in a great place and make a difference. If that helps to influence and encourage a young person or someone who is pursuing this field and is having a hard time sticking to it, then that’s all that matters to me. “It’s not about me, it’s about recognising that there is a path, and that the company I work for is innovative, smart and we make amazing things,” he says.

Beca, Marops and Safe Air will support the upgraded Underwater, Intelligence, Surveillance …Local companies to partner Boeing in Orion upgrade New Zealand defence industry suppliers will support international contractor Boeing to upgrade systems on the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s six Orion aircraft. Beca, Marops and Safe Air will support the upgraded Underwater, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance capability through its lifetime, with contracts worth $9 million. The Chair of the New Zealand Defence Industry Association (NZDIA) Bernie Diver says the partnership is a win for all involved. “By appointing New Zealand companies to support international contractors, the Government has achieved value for money and created sound partner relationships. It’s also generated additional revenue for New Zealand defence suppliers, which secures jobs and is a boost for the regional economies.” Mr Diver says NZDIA has been working with both the Ministry of Defence and the New Zealand Defence Force to support this partnership approach. “In doing so, we’ve been able to increase the contribution the defence industry makes back to our economy. These contracts are in addition to the existing $125 million in wages paid to around 2500 people employed in the defence sector.” The $36 million Orion aircraft upgrade improves on their current underwater surveillance ability, and is important to New Zealand and its trading partners because the ability to detect and monitor submarines protects New Zealand’s maritime economic zone. The contracts were announced yesterday by Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee, and are the most recent investment signalled in the 2016 Defence White paper. The paper outlined the Government’s plans to upgrade the capability of the New Zealand Defence Force to enable future operations. Earlier this month a spend of $1.7 billion was confirmed to upgrade Defence buildings, infrastructure and facilities across New Zealand over the next 15 years. NZDIA is now working with members and the construction industry to support bids for the work.

There are more than 6,000 IT staff in his team. Colbert is leading technology transformation initiatives at Boeing which will play a big part in preparing the 100-year-old global organisation for its second century of operation. Last week, Colbert was visiting IT teams in Australia, which is the organisation’s largest footprint outside the United States. “There are some amazing products that we deliver in the locations here in Australia,” Colbert tells CIO.

That’s for college students but there is also reach back in to the grade schools to help with the STEM pipeline,” he says. “There are other examples across our company. We invest millions and millions of dollars into the community, a lot of it going towards STEM and disadvantaged communities but I think there’s more work to do.” Colbert admits that women and minority groups are poorly represented in positions of leadership across many organisations. But he says in the US, there are many initiatives at corporate and government levels that are helping to stimulate the pipeline. “You have to do this because the demographics of the world are changing to be more diverse. Fundamentally, a diverse workforce is a force multiplier in performance.” “There’s more to be done, we [Boeing] do a lot and our parent companies do a lot but there’s a lot of reach into disadvantaged communities to really stimulate the curiosity of children in the STEM fields,” he says. Ebony power In 2015, Colbert was named as a member of the Ebony Power 100, a list that includes not only business leaders but entertainers who are famous the world over, the likes of Prince, Janet Jackson and Regina King. “I am super humbled to be part of the list,” he says. “I just consider myself a person who just wants to do a good job, work in a great place and make a difference. If that helps to influence and encourage a young person or someone who is pursuing this field and is having a hard time sticking to it, then that’s all that matters to me. “It’s not about me, it’s about recognising that there is a path, and that the company I work for is innovative, smart and we make amazing things,” he says.

Delta will begin offering service Oct. 4 between Cedar Rapids and Atlanta on the 110-seat aircraft. George C. Ford The Gazette More stories from George Aug 22, 2016 at 2:44 pm | Print View CEDAR RAPIDS — Delta Air Lines will operate a 110-seat Boeing 717 airliner between Cedar Rapids and Atlanta on daily flights beginning Oct. 4. The service will bring “mainline” service operated by a major airline back to The Eastern Iowa Airport. “It will be morning-originating flight and then come back in the evening for the aircraft to spend the night in Cedar Rapids,” Airport Director Marty Lenss said. “That two-a-day pattern will continue through the fall and winter. We are optimistic that we will get back to our seasonal three-a-day service during the summer.” The Delta flights will be the first mainline service to the Cedar Rapids airport since 2005 when United Airlines transitioned to regional partners providing air service. The Cedar Rapids Airport Commission on Monday ratified an agreement with the Iowa Department of Transportation that will provide up to $25,000 to market the new Delta flights. The airport will be required to match the IDOT Air Service Development Program funding. Delta Connections carriers primarily have been using 65-seat regional jets for flights between Cedar Rapids and Atlanta. Lenss said the larger Boeing 717s will increase the number of available seats by 480 each week, offer more first-class seating and larger overhead bins for carry-on luggage. “It’s a great investment by Delta in the Corridor,” Lenss said. “We will need to fill those seats, but the market has been performing well for Delta. That’s why they are making this additional investment.” The Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport competes with Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, N.C., Lenss said. American Airlines announced plans in July to offer two daily, nonstop flights from Cedar Rapids to Charlotte beginning Nov. 4. Both airports offer hundreds of connecting flights to North American and international destinations. “I haven’t had any conversations with American or Delta, but it certainly looks like a competitive response,” Lenss said.

Beca, Marops and Safe Air will support the upgraded Underwater, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance capability through its lifetime, with contracts worth $9 million. The Chair of the New Zealand Defence Industry Association (NZDIA) Bernie Diver says the partnership is a win for all involved. “By appointing New Zealand companies to support international contractors, the Government has achieved value for money and created sound partner relationships. It’s also generated additional revenue for New Zealand defence suppliers, which secures jobs and is a boost for the regional economies.” Mr Diver says NZDIA has been working with both the Ministry of Defence and the New Zealand Defence Force to support this partnership approach. “In doing so, we’ve been able to increase the contribution the defence industry makes back to our economy. These contracts are in addition to the existing $125 million in wages paid to around 2500 people employed in the defence sector.” The $36 million Orion aircraft upgrade improves on their current underwater surveillance ability, and is important to New Zealand and its trading partners because the ability to detect and monitor submarines protects New Zealand’s maritime economic zone. The contracts were announced yesterday by Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee, and are the most recent investment signalled in the 2016 Defence White paper. The paper outlined the Government’s plans to upgrade the capability of the New Zealand Defence Force to enable future operations. Earlier this month a spend of $1.7 billion was confirmed to upgrade Defence buildings, infrastructure and facilities across New Zealand over the next 15 years. NZDIA is now working with members and the construction industry to support bids for the work. © Scoop Media   Tweet         Business Headlines | Sci-Tech Headlines BUSINESS, SCIENCE & TECH > >   Gordon Campbell: On The Government’s Tax Cuts Fixation Long before the earthquake hit, the dodginess of the government tax cuts programnme was evident in the language of its packaging.

The deal includes options which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of the contract to $723 million. A 2015 US Naval Institute report stated that EASR will be deployed on the future USS John F. Kennedy, the second Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier that is set to debut in 2020. The US Army awarded a series of contracts as part of the preliminary design review for the replacement of General Electric’s T700 engine. General Electric and Advanced Turbine Engine were awarded $102 million and $154 million contracts respectively, with the winner getting to provide engines for a wide variety of military helicopters including the UH-60 Blackhawk and AH-64E Apache. The Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) plans to deliver an engine early in the next decade that will replace the T700 with a new design that delivers more power and consumes less fuel, yet fits into the same space reserved for current engines. Following the Twitter reveal of the Northrop Grumman & BAE offering to the USAF’s T-X trainer competition, Boeing and Saab’s clean sheet design was revealed on Boeing’s website. With two engine inlets, a high mounted wing and a conventional, vertical tail, the design is a step away from its T-45 Goshawk used by the US Navy. Things are hotting up. After much waiting, trial and error, the F-35’s Block 3F software upgrade has speeded up testing of the new fighter’s weapons systems. Since it’s completion, Lockheed Martin has completed 30 weapons delivery accuracy tests in one month, compared to just three accomplished with the Block 2 software. These include Boeing’s Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and GPS-guided Small Diameter Bomb, and Raytheon’s AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-9X Sidewinder. Middle East & North Africa The US State Department has approved the sale of Mark V fast patrol boats, weapons, ammunition and training to Qatar in a $124 million defense package. Used by US Special Operations Forces for insertion and extraction of SEAL combat swimmers, the vessels will be equipped with .50-caliber machine guns, MLG 27mm naval gun systems and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) Systems. An inquiry into a leak of sensitive technical information of France’s Scorpene attack submarine is being planned by the French government. The leak surfaced in a report by an Australian newspaper who received 22,400 pages of ship builder DCNS’s company data on the six Scorpene boats it’s constructing for the Indian Navy. The company fears that such a leak may harm the company’s deal with Australia to design and build the Shortfin Barracuda A1 diesel-electric submarine. Europe Russia’s latest armored tank, the T-14 Armata, is to be equipped with additional protective armor in order to better defend it in urban operations. Developed by the Russian Research Institute, “plate shields,” which are similar in appearance to the bars on metal bunk beds, will be installed along the perimeter of the machines giving additional protection to the platform’s wheels and tracks. The Russian Army plans to acquire 2,300 of the tanks by 2020. Asia Pacific The annual US-South Korean war games kicked off this week in what has been a year of growing diplomatic tension on the peninsula. The Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise will run until September 2 and involves some 50,000 US troops stationed in South Korea. In response, the The North called the exercises preparations for invasion, and early on Monday threatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike that did not occur. The last number of months has seen increased North Korean missile testing, the deployment of THAAD systems in the South and most recently, the defection of the North Korean ambassador to the UK.

Boeing Employee Credit Union moving into Spokane market By John Stucke johnst@spokesman.com(509) 459-5419 Twitter Facebook Email Reddit SNAP Money BECU has donated $62,000 to keep SNAP’s financial counseling program afloat. Each year about 800 people enroll in the program to help them qualify for home loans, start businesses or better manage money, said SNAP spokesman Craig Howard. The largest credit union in Washington state is moving into the Spokane market next month. Boeing Employees Credit Union is a million-member heavyweight with $15 billion in assets. It began in 1935 when a group of Boeing employees pooled money with the aim of making loans in the thick of the Great Depression to new workers who needed to buy tools for the job. In Spokane, the credit union has about 5,000 members – many who worked at the former Boeing factory in Airway Heights along with retirees and people who moved from the Seattle area. Its entry into Spokane arrives amid big changes in local banking. Several local banks have been sold to larger regional lenders, including Umpqua and Columbia banks. And the region’s leading credit union, Spokane Teachers Credit Union, has grown in size and scope of services. Those changes, along with Spokane’s steady economic growth, better employment outlook and need for personal financial education, made the move a logical step, said Tom Berquist, BECU senior vice president. BECU is now a leading car lender in the state and is positioned in Spokane to offer both consumer loans and focus on commercial loans in the $3 million to $5 million range. Its local branches will be in the Cataldo Square shopping center at 916 N. Division St. in Spokane, and at 615 N. Sullivan Road in Spokane Valley. And the credit union is hunting for a third location, said Steve Hauschild, a local banking veteran and BECU’s point person in Spokane. BECU also runs an incoming call center in Spokane Valley that employs about 125 people.

The printers were designed to address the requirements of aerospace, automotive and other industries by being able to build completed parts with repeatable mechanical properties. The 3D printers are not yet commercially available, but Stratasys is working with Ford Motor Company and Boeing to develop new applications for them. The two new machines include the Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator and the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator. Stratasys Stratasys' new Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator and Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator allow manufacturers to build parts of near limitless sizes with greater detail, strength and ligher weight than before. Because both printers use a "screw" or "worm" drive filament extruder, they're able to print with composite materials, such as carbon fiber, which don't shrink or warp as much as traditional thermoplastics. Typically, fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers press a polymer filament through a pair of wheels or gears and out of a heated extruder head, layer by layer. A screw extruder winds the filament through the head, which increases the flow pressure needed tor extruding composite materials. Stratays' Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator uses a horizontal build platform versus a traditional vertical platform to create printed objects. By turning the platform horizontally, the machine can build parts sideways, which translates into a build area that's only limited by the space a manufacturer has. "This gives us the capacity for making much larger parts and to gain much lighter assembly," said Ellen Lee, technical leader at Ford's additive manufacturing research facility. 3D printing allows the Ford design freedom it cannot get from traditional manufacturing methods, such as injection molding, Lee said. With injection molding, one automobile or truck part often consists of many smaller pieces that must be joined together, creating less strength and greater weight. "With the increased print size, we could consolidate many large parts into one," Lee said. "We're producing parts that are now measured in feet rather than inches," said Richard Garrity, president of Stratasys Americas. Aerospace giant Boeing also played an influential role in defining the requirements and specifications for the demonstrator 3D printers, Stratasys said. Boeing is currently testing an Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator to explore the production of low volume, lightweight parts. "Additive manufacturing represents a great opportunity for Boeing and our customers, so we made a strategic decision more than a decade ago to work closely with Stratasys on this technology," Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said. "We are always looking for ways to reduce the cost and weight of aircraft structures, or reduce the time it takes to prototype and test new tools and products so we can provide them to customers in a more affordable and rapid manner." By flipping an FDM 3D printer on its side, Stratasys was not only able to increase the size of parts, but also achieve speeds 10 times or more greater than traditional FDM technology, according to Garrity. Stratasys' other new machine, the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator, utilizes a material extruder at the end of a robotic arm that can maneuver along a 5-point axis. The printer also has a robotically-controlled print platform that can move along three axes. Combined, the 8-axis robotic printer enables extremely precise builds from virtually any angle, reducing the need for typical support materials, which has dramatically slowed 3D parts production. Ford, Stratasys The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator adds detail to an automotive parts prototype. Just as with a desktop 3D printer, the new Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator is an FDM model and uses a heated extruder head to melt and deposit multiple layers of polymers to create an object. Once the basic part is constructed, a second smaller extruder head on the robotic arm can be used to create fine details. A major advantage to the Robotic 3D printer is the ability to print across fused layers, adding strength to a part. For example, traditional vertical FDM 3D printers construct an object using a process that creates ribbing that is more easily broken. Multi-axis printing allows the composite materials to move right to left, up and down or diagonally, adding strength. "Unfortunately, composites production is constrained by labor-intensive processes and geometric limitations," Stsratasys said in a statement. "The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator...redefines how future lightweight parts will be built, and provides a glimpse into how this technology could be used to accelerate the production of parts made from a wide variety of materials."

The company has been around since the early days of 3D printing, and has been responsible for some of the industry’s biggest breakthroughs and milestones. They’ve grown into a huge multinational corporation with influence in nearly every major industry, and they’re responsible for one of the most popular methods of 3D printing: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Today Stratasys announced that they will be demonstrating some of their latest, most cutting-edge technology at the upcoming International Manufacturing Technology Show (IMTS) 2016. As part of their “SHAPING WHAT’S NEXT” vision, Stratasys will be debuting two “3D Demonstrators,” essentially previews of what’s coming next from the company – and for the 3D printing industry. And what’s coming next is pretty exciting. The Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator quite literally turns 3D printing on its side with a technology that prints on a vertical plane, allowing for virtually unlimited part size. The Infinite Build technology was developed in response to needs from the aerospace and automotive industries in particular, and Boeing and Ford are working closely with Stratasys on the development of the system. The Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator “Additive manufacturing represents a great opportunity for Boeing and our customers, so we made a strategic decision more than a decade ago to work closely with Stratasys on this technology,” said Darryl Davis, President of Boeing Phantom Works. “We are always looking for ways to reduce the cost and weight of aircraft structures, or reduce the time it takes to prototype and test new tools and products so we can provide them to customers in a more affordable and rapid manner. The Stratasys Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator enables products to be made at a much larger and potentially unlimited length, offering us a breakthrough tool to add to our robust additive manufacturing processes.” An aircraft panel 3D printed with the Infinite Build 3D Demonstrator. Boeing is currently experimenting with an Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator to produce lightweight, low-volume parts. Ford is also exploring the demonstrator for automotive manufacturing purposes, and will be working with Stratasys to develop applications for automotive-grade 3D printed materials that thus far have been impossible due to size constraints. “3D printing holds the promise of changing automotive design and manufacturing because it opens up new ways to innovate and create efficiencies in production,” said Mike Whitens, director, Vehicle Enterprise Sciences, Ford Research & Advanced Engineering. “Our vision at Ford is to make high-speed, high-quality printing of automotive-grade parts a reality. We are excited about the future opportunities that the scalable and versatile Infinite-Build concept can unlock, and look forward to collaborating with Stratasys to help achieve our goals,” The other new system Stratasys is unveiling is the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator. Working with Siemens, Stratasys developed the technology by combining their own additive manufacturing processes with Siemens’ industrial motion control hardware and design-to-3D printing software. Composite materials, which are ideal for producing strong, lightweight structures, are an integral part of manufacturing in the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as the oil and gas and medical sectors. Unfortunately, the production of composites is highly labor intensive and limited in terms of geometry. The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator uses an 8-axis motion system for precise, directional material placement, enabling the production of strong parts without the need for supports, which slow down production. The system demonstrates a new way to build lightweight parts, faster than ever and with a wider variety of materials. Part produced with the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator “Siemens is pleased to support Stratasys in their innovative additive manufacturing initiatives, of which the Stratasys Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator is one of the most promising,” said Arun Jain, VP, Motion Control, Digital Factory US, Siemens. “By working closely with Stratasys on motion control and CNC automation, Siemens is helping to create a flexible, multi-function manufacturing workflow that puts 3D printing firmly in the factory. We look forward to continuing to work with Stratasys to build manufacturing solutions that transform industries.” IMTS 2016 will be taking place in Chicago September 12-17. In addition to their two new major developments, Stratasys will also be showing off several examples of their current technology as it’s being used by customers in tooling and manufacturing applications, such as 3D printed jigs and fixtures, composite tooling, mold tooling, and production parts. “Stratasys is building on our success in manufacturing with applications such as manufacturing aids, injection molds and composite tooling, and leveraging our relationships with innovative industry leaders to further extend the applicability of additive manufacturing in demanding production environments,” said Ilan Levin, CEO of Stratasys. ”We view the level of factory integration, automation, and performance monitoring potentially offered by these new demonstrators as catalysts for the transformation to Industry 4.0. Stratasys invites all visitors to IMTS to see these new technologies, as well as our field-proven industrial additive manufacturing solutions, in action.” Will you be attending IMTS this year?

The company is already due to receive eight 787 jets by the end of FY17, aiming to replace the deteriorating aircraft fleet of 747-400 wide-body jets. As a part of the existing contract with Boeing, Qantas has an option to acquire15 more 787 Dreamliner along with purchase rights to buy 30 additional 787 jets after the successful delivery of the aforementioned eight jets. Currently, the airline operates a fleet of total 118 commercial jets. Of this, the airline plans to refurbish its operational Boeing’s 737-800 and Airbus Group SE (OTCMKTS:EADSY) A330-200 in order to improve the flight experience. “Our first aircraft is still about 15 months away, but I’m delighted to say that Dreamliner flights on our existing network will be on sale before Christmas.” Qantas Airways CEO Alan Joyce commented in the earnings release. “The aircraft is full of inbuilt features to keep you comfortable on a long flight – like better air quality, less noise, and more natural light.” The announcement may appear as a good news for Boeing, as the company is not receiving a considerable demand from the market. Qantas Airways itself deferred the delivery of eight Airbus’ A380-800 jumbo jets to strengthen its cash flows, while operating the pre-delivered 12 A380-800 jets. Aimed at meeting the current trend, earlier this month Boeing announced that it might not increase monthly production capacity of its 787 Dreamliner and plans to maintain it at 12 jets per month. With this decision, the aircraft manufacturer would be able to extend the lifespan of the 787 Dreamliner production line. At present, Boeing has a total backlog of 716 787 Dreamliner, based on which it can continue operating for approximately five more years. Since the launch of the 787 Dreamliner, the company received total 1,161 orders and delivered 445 jets till now. On the contrary to wide-body jets, Boeing is receiving healthy demand of its single-aisle commercial jets, as airlines around the world are focused to reduce their operational expenses by adding smaller fuel-efficient jets. Simultaneously, the company expects a steady aircraft demand from China due to increase in traveling, despite the economic slump. Boeing has also been facing slow demand in its military commercial jets, which led to poor revenue from Defense, Space & Security segment in last few quarters. The company is trying to offset the decline in Defense segment revenues by expanding its commercial jets fleet that contributes around 70% to its consolidated revenues. Industry experts predict the reduced wide-body commercial jets demand to continue in next few years, as competition amongst airlines increases. Since last year, the oscillation in crude oil prices has also intensified competition and increased passenger flight capacity. This increase in flight capacity also resulted in reduced fares, which is likely to continue in coming months. Driven by lower fuel prices, airlines also started to defer delivery of new jets as they continue to operate older jets. Both Boeing and Airbus are under pressure from this downturn in the aerospace industry, as they booked less number of orders since the year began. Yesterday, Aviation week also disclosed Boeing’s internal aircraft forecast for the current year, based on which the company expects only 535 new orders, considerably lower from its official FY16 guideline for 740-745 commercial jets. However, the company’s spokesman turned down the internal forecast by saying that Boeing is committed to its target and it has a host of internal forecasts. However, based on the current scenario and increased competition from other aircraft manufacturers, it is still early to say whether the company will meet the target.

The scientists knew where to look because the ship was sunk intentionally.  'She was intentionally sunk by the Navy in 1951, and her location was known by the Navy,' Susan Poulton from OET told MailOnline. 'She was surveyed by sonar in 2009 and again in more detail in 2015, but this was the first visual survey done of the wreck.'  The science team on board also noticed that the bow had struck the seabed first, despite sinking stern-first, burying itself in the sediment. The team also found two aircraft. Grumman Hellcat fighter aircraft seen in aircraft elevator hatch pictured This year, the wreckage was found in 2,600 feet (792 metres) underwater off the coast of California's Farallon Islands and is said to be 'amazingly intact,' with its hull and flight deck clearly visible, and what appears to be a plane in the carrier's hangar bay To study the wreckage, the team of scientists and technicians on board the sanctuary vessel R/V Fulmar, used an 18.5-foot-long (5.6 metres) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) called Echo Ranger from The Boeing Company.

The survey showed the Independence is 'amazingly intact,' with its hull and flight deck clearly visible.  It is upright, slightly listing to starboard, with much of its flight deck intact, and with holes leading to the hangar decks that once housed the carrier's aircraft.

'We did confirm the presence of a wrecked aircraft F6F-5N Hellcat still in one of the hangers and found the remains of a second aircraft late in the dive.' 'This ship fought a long, hard war in the Pacific and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship. It is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the 'greatest generation' that sent not only this ship, but their loved ones to war.'

The wreck of the USS Independence lies nearly 30 miles off the central California coast.  This is where the US Navy scuttled it to take it beyond the reach of potential Soviet espionage at the end of its usefulness as a nuclear test platform in 1951. The carrier is one of an estimated 300 wrecks in the waters off San Francisco, and the deepest known shipwreck in the sanctuary.   It is said to be 'amazingly intact,' with its hull and flight deck clearly visible and the survey showed that the Independence is upright, slightly listing to starboard, with much of its flight deck intact, and with holes leading to the hangar decks that once housed the carrier's aircraft. However, given its radioactive past, the marine archaeologists were concerned about how safe it would be to explore and contacted nuclear physicist Kai Vetter.  Professor Vetter is head of applied nuclear physics at Berkeley Lab, nuclear engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the co-founder of the Institute for Resilient Communities. 'They wanted to know if we could ensure the safety of their equipment,' said Professor Vetter. 'And to see if you'd pick up contamination if you went down there.' In short, the answer is no.  Professor Vetter said that neither the submersible nor the team was ever in danger of contamination because 'water is an excellent radiation shield'.  Underwater, radiation will only extend several inches from contaminated materials and the unmanned research submarine stayed at least 100ft (30 metres) away from the wreck.  Given its radioactive past, the marine archaeologists were concerned about how safe it would be to explore and contacted nuclear physicist Kai Vetter.

Contaminated rust particles from the ship are released and transported by water, the dilution factor of the ocean is enormous, essentially nullifying any radioactive effect Front-on (left) and starboard-side (right) views of USS Independence bow. While a relatively small number of organisms close to the wreck might take up some of these rust particles, the effects of radioactivity are diluted through the food chain While contaminated rust particles from the ship are released and transported by water, the dilution factor of the ocean is enormous, essentially nullifying any radioactive effect, Professor Vetter continued.  And while a relatively small number of organisms close to the wreck might take up some of these rust particles, the effects of radioactivity are diluted through the food chain because the number of organisms exposed is so small. In contrast, he added that mercury is much more prevalent and widely distributed in the ocean, and this is why its concentration builds up in the food chain.  Plus, Professor Vetter said that the isotopes of concern - in this case cesium 137 and strontium 90 - both have a half-life of about 30 years.  This means that after 30 years, half the isotopes responsible for the initial contamination transform into other non-radioactive isotopes.  'It has been more than 60 years since the USS Independence was scuttled, which means that less than a quarter of the initial radioactive isotopes remain,' Professor Vetter said.  The shipwreck site of the former aircraft carrier is located in the northern region of Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Professor Vetter said that neither the submersible nor the team was ever in danger of contamination because 'water is an excellent radiation shield'.

It was found in 2,600 feet (792 metres) underwater off the coast of California's Farallon Islands and is said to be 'amazingly intact,' with its hull and flight deck clearly visible, and what appears to be a plane in the carrier's hangar bay.  To study the wreckage, the team of scientists and technicians on board the sanctuary vessel R/V Fulmar, used an 18.5-foot-long (5.6 metres) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) called Echo Ranger from The Boeing Company.  This survey showed that the Independence is upright, slightly listing to starboard, with much of its flight deck intact, and with holes leading to the hangar decks that once housed the carrier's aircraft. USS Independence (CVL 22) operated in the central and western Pacific from November 1943 until August 1945.  It was part of the carrier group that took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and was assigned to strike duties against targets in the Philippines and Japan. It was later one of more than 90 vessels assembled as a target fleet for the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests in 1946.  During these tests it was damaged by shock waves, heat and radiation, but it survived and was returned to the United States.  After being transported back to Pearl Harbor and San Francisco for study, the vessel was later sunk near the Farallon Islands on 26 January 1951 loaded with 55-gallon drums of low-level radioactive waste. 'After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,' said Mr Delgado, chief scientist on the Independence mission and maritime heritage director for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries.

The newly-declassified images show the World War II veteran aircraft carrier USS Independence, which was one of nearly a hundred ships used as targets in the first tests of the atomic bomb at Bikini Atoll in the summer of 1946. The two Bikini tests known as Operation Crossroads were carried out in the immediate aftermath of the atomic end to World War II in Japan, and signaled a new era in world history, the historians involved in the new study say.  The images released in April show the World War II aircraft carrier which was one of nearly a hundred ships used as targets in the first tests of the atomic bomb at Bikini Atoll in 1946.

It was sunk near the Farallon Islands on 26 January 1951 loaded with 55-gallon drums of radioactive waste The 'Able Test' of July 1, 1946, dropped a plutonium core 'Fat Man' weapon on the target fleet moored at Bikini THE ABLE NUCLEAR TEST  On 1 July 1946, the United States conducted the first nuclear test after World War II.  The explosion took place at the Bikini Atoll lagoon, situated in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean.   The explosion of the fission bomb, largely identical to the weapon used in the attack on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, occurred 158 metres above sea level and had a yield of 23kilotons.  The bomb, named Gilda after Rita Hayworth's character in the 1946 eponymous film, was dropped from the B-29 Superfortress Dave's Dream of the 509th Bombardment Group. The main aim was to test the effects of nuclear weapons on ships.  78 vessels, many of which had been captured during World War II, was anchored in the lagoon.  The blast sunk only five of them, leaving another 14 seriously damaged. The Journal of Maritime Archaeology gave over an entire issue to the collection of documents and photographs from the tests.  This era was grimly summarized in a then-classified report on the Bikini tests which suggested that, with the coming of the 'Bomb,' it was possible to depopulate the earth, leaving only 'vestigial remnants of man's works.'  The explosion took place at the Bikini Atoll lagoon, situated in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean.  Test Able was to be the first of a series of 67 tests in the atoll and the second U.S. nuclear test of over a thousand to follow. The explosion of the fission bomb, largely identical to the weapon used in the attack on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, occurred 158 metres above sea level and had a yield of 23kilotons.  The main aim was to test the effects of nuclear weapons on ships.  To that end, a fleet of 78 vessels, many of which had been captured during World War II, was anchored in the lagoon.  The blast sunk only five of them, leaving another 14 seriously damaged. 'The Journal of Maritime Archaeology is honored to be able to present the case study of the USS Independence,' says JMA's co-editor-in-chief, Annalies Corbin.  'NOAA's achievements in contextualizing the work ahead for maritime archaeologists around the world as it relates to post-World War II and Cold War archaeology is critical to launching meaningful conversation and developing initial plans for underwater cultural heritage management of vessels like the USS Independence.'  The US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Office of Ocean Exploration and Research and the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries worked with the Boeing Company in 2015 to pinpoint the wreck.  The 'Baker test' of July 25, 1946 detonated a weapon suspended beneath the moored target fleet at Bikini. The resulting cloud of steam, water, and pulverized coral and sand irradiated the target fleet, including USS Independence The goal was to learn more about it in a deep water test that merged high-resolution sonar and a free swimming underwater robotic vehicle, 'Echo Ranger.' 'Historical and, by extension, maritime archaeology of the recent past can and should include merging documentary evidence with physical remains,' notes NOAA's James Delgado, Director of Maritime Heritage for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and lead scientist for the Independence mission.  The bombed-out World War II relic was deliberately sunk - or scuttled - in 1951, loaded with 55-gallon drums of radioactive waste, and was recently rediscovered using sonar equipment. And now a nuclear physicist has revealed how radioactive the abandoned aircraft carrier really is, and whether it poses a threat to humans and wildlife. The fourth USS Independence (CVL 22) operated in the central and western Pacific from November 1943 until August 1945.   It was later one of more than 90 vessels assembled as a target fleet for the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests in 1946.  The region, in the Marshall archipelago, was used to carry out 67 nuclear tests, including the explosion of the first H-bomb in 1952. After being transported back to San Francisco for study, the USS Independence was sunk near the Farallon Islands on 26 January 1951 loaded with drums of low-level radioactive waste. In April, a team of researchers used sonar from an autonomous submarine to find the wreckage buried 2,600 feet (792 metres) off the coast of California. It is said to be 'amazingly intact,' with its hull and flight deck clearly visible and the survey showed that the Independence is upright, slightly listing to starboard, with much of its flight deck intact, and with holes leading to the hangar decks that once housed the carrier's aircraft This wartime views of USS Independence (CVL 22) show the ship as it entered the final stages of the war in the Pacific.

Posted: Sept. 22, 2009 0 Comments SHARE By Wayne Risher Posted: Sept. 22, 2009 0 FedEx and Boeing on Tuesday introduced FedEx's first 777 Freighter, a game-changing cargo carrier that is key to the express delivery company's global growth strategy. FedEx officials said the plane, christened Saad (pronounced SAHD) after the son of a company auditor in New Jersey, should be making a 2,000-plus-mile flight from Washington state to Memphis shortly. The 2091/2 -foot-long plane, with a wingspan of 212 feet, 7 inches, is destined to become a fixture in the skies over FedEx hubs; the company ordered 30 with an option to buy another 15. A new hangar was built off Winchester at Memphis International Airport to house the 777 and other aircraft. It features longer range, better fuel economy and lower emissions than the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, a transcontinental freighter it is replacing. FedEx officials say it will carry the company's service to new heights, eliminating refueling stops and shaving one to three hours off transit times between Asia and North America. FedEx officials traveled to Boeing's factory in Everett, Wash., to celebrate completion of the plane, which is scheduled to begin flying between continents in April after several months of flight checks and shorter routes. Boeing said it is the ninth 777 Freighter delivery and the first to an American global freight carrier. "The 777 Freighter will allow FedEx Express to operate point-to-point routes that save valuable flying time, coupled with outstanding fuel efficiency and environmental responsibility," said Kevin Schemm, a Boeing vice president. "The 777F is a game-changer," added Michael L. Ducker, president, international, of FedEx Express. "Our customers around the world will benefit from more point-to-point routes and the shorter flight times, increasing their competitiveness in the global marketplace." FedEx officials said shorter transit time means later pickup deadlines in markets served by the 777s. "The Boeing 777 is an extraordinary testament to our dedication to fleet enhancement, allowing FedEx Express to provide unmatched services to our customers around the world," said David J. Bronczek, president and CEO of FedEx Express. FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said, "It's a technological masterpiece, and it's going to elevate us competitively in the global market that we're in." McCluskey said FedEx plans to have four 777s in service by April and 15 in the fleet by the end of fiscal 2014. The 777 orders also have played a role in FedEx's battle against a proposed change in the labor law covering FedEx Express workers. FedEx made the order for the second 15 planes and 15 options contingent on Express workers continuing to be covered under the Railway Labor Act. The 777F's price tag has been estimated at about $225 million apiece. A posting on FedEx's Citizenship Blog said the first 777 is named for the son of Kashif Zia, an input auditor who joined FedEx in 1998 at the Newark Airport. Zia said Saad means "good luck" and "lucky." All 650 planes in the FedEx fleet are named for children of team members. -- Wayne Risher: 529-2874 About the Boeing 777F World's largest twin-engine cargo aircraft Flight range equals about 6,675 land miles, or nearly three times approximate distance between the east and west coasts of the U.S. Payload capacity 215,000 pounds, or 98 metric tons Uses 18 percent less fuel than McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Engine technology reduces emissions 18 percent Advanced noise-reduction technology meets airport noise standards and makes takeoffs and landings quieter 0 Share Tweet Email Print Business Topics Jobs & Wages Real Estate Medical Industry Economic Development Tourism & Entertainment Entrepreneurs Non-Profits Public Corporations FedEx & Logistics National Business Trending Now Memphis Homicide Tracker The 100 Best Songs About Memphis: Counting Down Did Donald Trump donate $20 million to St. Jude?

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lights up the night sky as it streaks over the Cocoa Beach Pier during liftoff early on Aug. 14 from Space Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Aboard is a Japanese communications satellite. The men at top are billionaires Richard Braonson, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Paul Allen. (Craig Rubadoux/Florida Today/AP) Later this year, tech entrepreneur turned space pioneer Elon Musk is planning the blastoff of a new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, that would be twice as powerful as any other in use and one of the biggest since the Apollo era’s mighty Saturn V. The stage for the rocket’s debut: the Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took off for the moon in 1969. SpaceX’s use of 39A is the ultimate symbol that the government’s monopoly on space travel is over. To Musk, it also is proof of an additional triumph – over his fellow billionaire and rival Jeffrey P. Bezos, who had fought to secure the launch pad for himself. Nearly five decades after the United States beat the Soviet Union to the moon, another space race is emerging, this time among a class of hugely wealthy entrepreneurs who have grown frustrated that space travel is in many ways still as difficult, and as expensive, as ever. Driven by ego, outsize ambition and opportunity, they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in an attempt to open up space to the masses and push human space travel far past where governments have gone. Advertisement Continue reading Musk, who made his first fortune on Zip2 and PayPal, and Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, are the most prominent of a quartet of billionaires aspiring to open the frontier of space the way the public-private partnerships of the 19th century pushed west at the dawn of the railroad age. The two others are Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. All have upended industries, including retail, automobiles and credit cards, and are now embarking on the greatest disruption of all – making space travel routine – in a business long dominated by commercial-space contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. While their efforts have reignited interest in space, they also have raised moral complexities and regulatory challenges in pursuing an endeavor that is inherently dangerous. Congress has opted to regulate the industry only loosely, granting it an extended “learning period” that would allow companies to grow and to practice space travel. Already, one pilot has died in the quest to make commercial space travel a reality. But his sacrifice came in the service of a company, Scaled Composites that was operating a spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, not a government acting in the national interest. Some critics, such as Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, said that safeguards should not be overlooked. “When the inevitable accident with significant loss of life occurs – whether it’s a year from now or five years from now,” she said, “the American public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how we could be so short-sighted?” Since late last year, when Musk and Bezos traded what were interpreted as barbs on Twitter over who pulled off the most daring feat in space, they’ve apparently entered a detente, with peace offerings, even words of encouragement. But there’s something about the exchanges that still bothers Musk, who in a recent interview wanted to make it clear: Space is not orbit. That’s what he meant when he lit up Twitter after Bezos’s Blue Origin flew a rocket to the edge of space and landed it at its West Texas test range, a feat that NASA has never achieved. Bezos declared the reusable rocket “the rarest of beasts.” Advertisement Continue reading “Not quite ‘rarest,’ ” Musk shot back, pointing out that SpaceX has previously launched rockets in test flights and landed them after relatively short trips. In a series of tweets, he vowed something even more spectacular, and difficult – landing a much larger and more powerful rocket capable of traveling many times the speed of sound, which is required for going into orbit. Later, after SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 rocket, Bezos tweeted what many considered a backhanded compliment: “Welcome to the club!” NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, second right, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, right, look at the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft at the SpaceX Rocket Development Facility in McGregor, Texas, in 2012. (Duane A. Laverty/Waco Tribune-Herald) Months later, Musk still was fixated on it. Bezos’s Blue Origin may have crossed the boundary into “space,” a somewhat arbitrary barrier generally agreed as starting at 62 miles above Earth’s surface. But Musk’s SpaceX spacecraft don’t just go up; they go up and out, following an arc and moving so fast – about five miles per second – that they stay aloft and can circle the Earth in less time than it takes to watch “Star Wars.” Reaching the threshold of space is a somewhat simple up and down endeavor – “like shooting a cannon ball up and then the cannon ball falls down for four minutes of free fall,” Musk said. Orbit and space “are different leagues,” Musk said. The tension began appearing in legal briefs in 2014. SpaceX challenged a patent held by Blue Origin that gave it the right to land rockets on floating barges at sea – a feat SpaceX has now pulled off multiple times. The point of landing the rockets, though is to reuse them, which then would dramatically lower the cost of space flight. SpaceX has yet to refly any of its rockets, however. Blue Origin, by contrast, has flown the same booster four times in test flights, showing that recovering the rocket is not the same as reusing it. And there was Launch Complex 39A. Musk won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed a legal protest, arguing that the criteria NASA used to come to its decision were flawed. Musk derided the protest as a “phony blocking tactic and an obvious one at that.” Advertisement Continue reading Blue Origin had not yet sent a rocket to space, which Musk eagerly pointed out, and didn’t have one qualified to carry people. “If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote in an email published at SpaceNews.com. Then in a taunt that shot across the Internet, he added, “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.” At the time, Blue Origin was tight lipped about the remarks. But years later, it responded by announcing that Bezos had secured a spot of his own at Cape Canaveral: Launch Complex 36, just down the road from 39A, so he and Musk will be neighbors. It was supposed to have happened by now: Space tourism. Bases on the moon. Humans to Mars and beyond. The next giant leap. And the next. Bezos was 5 years old during the Apollo 11 moon landing and remembers watching it on his living room television with his parents and grandparents. “It was a seminal moment for me,” he has said. Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos says commercial space exploration can advance at the fast pace of Internet commerce only if the cost is reduced through advances in reusable rockets. (Matthew Staver/Bloomberg) In 2013, he embarked on a three-week quest to recover from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean the F-1 engines used in the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets. Using deep-water rovers, his team found its quarry: castaway engine parts, more than three miles down, deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. Where others might have seen piles of rusted debris fit for a junkyard, Bezos saw art. “A magic sculpture garden,” he called it. After Musk sold his first company, Zip2, to Compaq, for more than $300 million, he started thinking more seriously about space exploration and wondered when NASA was planning on getting to Mars. He searched the space agency’s website for its Mars plan but could not find one. “Because, of course, there had to be a schedule,” he said in a 2012 speech. “And I couldn’t find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well-hidden. And it turned out it wasn’t on the website at all. Which was shocking.” Advertisement Continue reading Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors, plans to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. While that seemingly impossible goal remains aspirational, SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Last year, however, a unmanned Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station blew up, forcing the company to delay all launches for six months. But it now has a backlog of more than 70 missions representing more than $10 billion in revenue. “We’re sort of checking the various boxes that are needed to do this,” Musk said, “while providing useful services to NASA and commercial companies.” As a child, Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, knew the names of the Mercury 7 astronauts, as if they were the star players of his favorite baseball team. “Like countless other boys, I planned to become an astronaut when I grew up,” he wrote in his memoir. “For sheer adventure, you couldn’t beat outer space.” Paul G. Allen teamed with aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which was the first commercial vehicle to reach space in 2004. Now he’s building Stratolaunch, the world’s largest airplane. (Source: Vulcan) In 2004, Allen teamed up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million contest, and became the first commercial vehicle to reach space. Allen licensed the rights to the technology behind the spacecraft to Branson and concentrated on other interests. But now he’s back. He’s building Stratolaunch, that would become the world’s largest airplane with a wingspan wider than a football field, end zones included. It is designed to carry a rocket tethered to its belly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The rocket would drop away from the plane, fire its engines and “air-launch” into orbit. Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline, with the craft taking off from Spaceport America in New Mexico. And he’s proud that more than 700 people – more than the approximately 550 people who have actually been to space – have bought tickets to ride on his spacecraft, some paying as much as $250,000. “Perhaps it is in our culture, perhaps it is in our DNA, or perhaps it is a bit of each of those, but we humans seem hard-wired to explore,” Branson’s Virgin Galactic says on its website. “But because government space agencies are not asked to help ordinary citizens to become astronauts, most of our planet’s seven billion people have had no opportunity to experience space and all of its possibilities for themselves.” Advertisement Continue reading The last time the United States was not able to launch its own astronauts to space, the hiatus lasted 2,098 days, from the last of the Apollo-era missions in 1975 to the first space shuttle flight in 1981. Today, NASA is again in a hiatus, this one beginning when the shuttles were retired in 2011. But now there is a painful twist: The United States has to rely on Russia, the country it bested in the Cold War race to the moon, to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. That is expected to end by late 2017, or early 2018, when a cadre of carefully chosen NASA astronauts would board a spacecraft on the Florida Space Coast and launch from U.S. soil. That historic moment would feature a rocket that for the first time would be owned and operated by a commercial company, not NASA. Today, SpaceX and Boeing, the companies that NASA is entrusting with the lives of its astronauts, are vying to see which will fly first. The victor would become the company that restores U.S. human spaceflight in what would be one of the most tense and dramatic launches in decades. Then could come the birth of regular commercial space-tourism trips. Wealthy ticketed passengers, fresh off days of space training camp, could board a private spacecraft, buckle into luxurious window seats and shoot just past the edge of space, where they would float weightless, joining the ranks of the world’s first space tourists in a flight that would last several minutes. Virgin Galactic had said its first flight would be as early as 2009, but that has been delayed again and again, most recently when an aircraft came apart during a test flight, killing the co-pilot. Since then, the company has rebounded, unveiling its new spacecraft earlier this year. While Virgin Galactic no longer gives a timeline, Bezos has said he believes Blue Origin could start taking tourists by 2018. Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. More than 700 people have bought tickets. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) Branson and Bezos, both known to prize customer service, are honing their sales pitches, one promising a concierge to the cosmos and the other promoting windows the size of doors for a better view. Advertisement Continue reading But while the companies say they are not in a race to see who flies customers first, some corporate jockeying is underway. Branson has said he thinks people would prefer the comforts of SpaceShipTwo, a space plane that would land on a runway, over a rocket launch that would propel a thimble-like capsule into space and then land under parachutes. “We believe going into space in a spaceship and coming back in that spaceship, on wheels, will be a customer experience that people would prefer than perhaps one or two other options that are being considered,” he said in an interview late last year. “And we’d love to see whether we’re correct about that.” To these space barons, the dawn of this new Space Age is similar to the advent of the personal computer and the Internet. Regular access to space is a new catalyst for innovation, one that as Allen recently said, “holds similar revolutionary potential.” He, Musk and Branson have plans to launch constellations of small satellites. These satellites could more affordably beam the Internet to the billions who are not now connected, provide better communication and allow companies and governments to continuously monitor events on the ground – including phenomena as diverse as wars and agriculture. “When such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine,” Allen said. “That’s the thing about new platforms: When they become easily available, convenient and affordable, they attract and enable other visionaries and entrepreneurs to realize more new concepts.” For years, many have been waiting for the commercial space industry to become a real market, one where companies actually make money and prosper. William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA’s human spaceflight division, said he thinks that the industry “is on the crest of another wave.” “There’s a lot of hype,” he said at a Federal Aviation Administration space conference this year, citing other times when industry felt it was on the cusp of revolutionary change. “But will we be able to generate enough demand?” he said. “It can’t just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector. . . . Will that be enough to push us over or to reach that tipping point that actually enables this industry to become more self-sufficient than it was in the past?” Advertisement Continue reading Bezos, Branson and others are betting that there will be enough demand – especially if they’re successful in getting to space quickly and easily, like flying a plane. Bezos has talked about building “the highway to lower orbit” so that the next generation “will be able to use that heavy infrastructure that I put in place so there can be a huge dynamic entrepreneurial explosion in space.” His goal is eventually to establish such a transportation link that all heavy industry could be moved off Earth into space, where companies could mine asteroids for their precious metals. Earth, then, could be preserved as if it were exclusively zoned “residential and light industrial,” he said. Musk is focused on Mars. “It’s fundamentally about transport. Without transport you can’t get there. You need to build the Union Pacific,” he said. “Once there’s a transportation link established to Mars, it’ll open up incredible entrepreneurial opportunities for anyone that wants to go there and establish everything from the first iron foundry to the first pizza joint to things we don’t even conceive of on Earth that are just new on Mars.” That effort will be exceedingly difficult, and likely even fatal, he said. The timeline Musk has laid out is incredibly ambitious, with the first unmanned flight coming as soon as 2018. Of the 43 robotic missions to Mars, including fly-bys, attempted by four countries, only 18 have been total successes. No private company has ever dared try it before, and SpaceX has yet to fly the Falcon Heavy, which has been delayed repeatedly because of technical challenges. In the past, such bold, “because it is hard” pronouncements were made by presidents, not billionaires. But Musk and Bezos are now cast in a sort of Cold War reenactment, performing the roles once held exclusively by nations and their heroes. Bezos’s rocket is named after the first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, who reached the edge of space in a 15-minute ride in 1961. But unlike his Soviet counterpart, Yuri Gagarin, Shepard did not reach orbit. That would not happen for the Americans until the next year, when John Glenn rode a more powerful rocket. Bezos, too, is preparing his next giant leap: producing by the end of the decade a rocket that can reach orbit. By then, though, Musk could be shooting for Mars. space_____Keywords: business&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe From the newspaper Front Page More News Nation New Mexico News Science Suggested Stories: Entrepreneurs fight to win lease of iconic NASA launchpad – Aug 24, 2013 Tourism's race to space slowed down by latest test flight setbacks – Nov 3, 2014 Web billionaires face off in renewed Texas space race – Apr 27, 2015 Bezos' new rocket built for space tourism – Sep 12, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE The prototype of the 3D printed THOR aircraft is pictured at the International Aerospace Exhibition (ILA) in Schoenefeld. New 3D printing technology unveiled this week sharply increases the size of objects that can be produced, offering new possibilities to remake manufacturing in the auto, aerospace and other major industries. One application demonstrated by 3-D printing machinery maker Stratasys would allow airlines to pick made-to-order airplane interiors that could be tweaked with the click of a mouse. By turning the manufacturing plane vertical from the standard horizontal, the "printer" has the potential to create components of unlimited size. "We're now talking about parts in feet and meters versus centimeters and inches," said Rich Garrity, Americas president for Stratasys. "It's not just a concept." The advances, by Stratasys, Siemens and others, are beginning to push 3-D printing well into the center of manufacturing from around the edges. 3-D printing employs sophisticated computer simulations and software to direct "print" objects from powdered, molten and filament materials like nylon, resins, clays, thermoplastics and metals. The technology has not always lived up to sky-high hype, but leading manufacturers remain bullish over its potential to shake up the factory floor. "It is something that is going to be a game-changer," said Teresa Finchamp, director of operations and quality in Boeing's department for new technologies. Benefits include the ability to reduce weight by substituting plastic compounds for metals. And by making use of a "digital toolbox" and made-to- order technology, it can also can reduce the need for warehouse space and many conventional manufacturing tools. The ultimate prize is finished items equal in quality to today's goods, but which are cheaper and faster to make. Siemens argues that 3D printing, along with an increased role of robotics, greater automation and other innovations are creating a "digital factory" that will force a day of reckoning among manufacturers. "These technologies all evolve so fast," said Andreas Saar, a vice president for additive manufacturing at Siemens. "We believe if people don't connect, they're going to have a huge problem," he told AFP. Boeing, Siemens and Ford are all corporate partners of Stratasys that joined a press tour of its factory in Eden Prairie near Minneapolis. Stratasys on Wednesday showcased an "infinite build" printer that turns the plane of production on its side, allowing the printing of items of "practically unlimited part size," according to the company. Also on display was a 3D robotic demonstrator utilizing Siemens software that positions and rotates an item as it is printed. The process, allowing for precise movements on an eight-axis motion system, is suited to produce lightweight components that must also be very strong. During the visit, the device was building a black ribbed dome that could be used on a rocket. Stratasys says the applications of the robotic technology are broad and could also be utilized in the oil and medical equipment industries. Stratasys executives described the innovations as "step" changes but would not comment on a timeframe for commercializing the technology. Even if the Stratasys innovations can be made commercial quickly, there are other barriers to more extensive use of 3-D printing. A key challenge for the auto industry, a relatively high-volume sector, will be matching the efficiency of conventional manufacturing, experts say. Ellen Lee, who is in charge of bringing 3D printing into the manufacturing process at Ford, also said the technology does not yet make use of materials robust and durable enough for the most important car parts. Boeing's Finchamp said the aerospace giant planned to use larger 3D parts on commercial airplane interiors as soon as this year. But questions about material strength clouds the outlook for use on larger parts. "We have to be very cautious," she told AFP. "We're very very conservative with how to get things onto planes."

Stratasys' new Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator gives manufacturers greater ability to make high-value composite production parts. (via Stratasys) August 25, 2016 KEYWORDS 3D printing / boeing / Ford / Siemens Corporation / Stratasys Reprints No Comments EDEN PRAIRIE, MN — Stratasys is unveiling new technologies in 3D printing, along with a series of major partnerships, all with the aim of advancing additive manufacturing for end-use parts. The new 3D demonstrators that Stratasys is rolling out were co-developed with Boeing and Siemens, and have clear applications in the automotive and airplane industries. Ford is also partnering with Stratasys to explore applications for the new technologies. "We're very excited to be building on decades of knowledge," said Rich Garrity, president of Stratasys Americas. "We understand the pain points that manufacturers are struggling with, whether that's trying to get better products to market faster, trying to differentiate the experience, or being able to improve performance." Both new demonstrators expand Stratasys' Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology across manufacturing, allowing for the production of bigger, stronger and higher quality parts: The Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator focuses on producing large thermoplastic parts and tools, while the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator incorporates Siemens technology for the automated production of composite structures. The Infinite-Build demonstrator is called that because, by flipping the vertical FDM process on its side, "we're able to to print parts in that vertical plane direction essentially as large as we want," Garrity explained. It would effectively allow a manufacturer to build, for instance, an interior part of an aircraft all at once. It also allows for customization, such as personalizing those interiors for a specific airline. The Infinite-Build allows for speedier production of tools and parts -- at least 10 times faster than current production speeds, Garrity said. It also ensures accuracy and repeatability, giving manufacturers confidence they're building the products they designed. Its tool-changing capability gives manufacterers the ability to change materials on the fly. Boeing, one of Stratasys' leading customers for several years, played a key role in defining the specifications for this demonstrator so it would meet their needs for the production of low-volume, customized, lightweight flight parts. Applying additive manufacturing to end-use parts isn't totally new. Last year, Stratasys announced that Airbus was producing more than 1,000 flight parts using its high-end additive manufacturing 3D printers. However, the Infinite-Build is "is taking that to a whole new level," Garrity said. While the potential applications obviously go beyond aerospace, the market there is significant: The aircraft interiors market is estimated to be worth $13.5 billion. Meanwhile, Ford Motor Company is exploring automotive manufacturing applications for the Infinite-Build. After using additive manufacturing technology for nearly 30 years for prototyping, the automotive company is now exploring its more functional applications. Using the Infinite-Build for larger products should eventually help in the production of durable, end-use products, according to Ellen Lee, Ford's technical Leader of additive manufacturing. Already it "is essential in the short-term," she said, for the production of tools and fixtures. Ford is also interested in working with Stratasys in driving the materials space more toward automotive industry needs, Lee said. Meanwhile, Stratasys' new Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator should give manufacturers greater ability to make high-value composite production parts. Making composite parts is currently a labor-intensive process, but the Robotic Demonstrator uses an eight-axis motion system to precisely place materials in any number of directions. Andreas Saar, vice president of manufacturing engineering solutions for Siemens PLM Software, said the demonstrator will "change the landscape of what's on the market today." Siemens has been investing intensively for more than a year in additive manufacturing as both a consumer and supplier of technology, Saar said. Several companies have expressed interest to Siemens in bringing this equipment to the factory floor, he said. "With our experience from Siemens' side in terms of driving robotics... and Stratasys' vast experience in materials and FDM, we believe this is a perfect combination to advance additive into a production environment," Saar said.  For more information, please visit www.stratasys.com.

Faces Engine Issues in Boeing Co 787 Dreamliners ANA has canceled nice flights due to a problem in the Rolls Royce-manufactured engines in 787 Dreamliners By Staff Writer on Aug 25, 2016 at 9:01 am EST Troubles around Boeing Co.’s (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner planes are not over yet, as All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd. (ANA) has decided to cancel some flights based on some aircraft engine issues. The airline reportedly faced problems in the engine’s turbine blades due to corrosion, which led it to stop nine flights scheduled for Friday. This is not the first time that ANA faced such a hindrance, as similar issues were reported in February and March on its Malaysia and Vietnam routes, respectively. Moreover, another 787 Dreamliner flight, scheduled for August 20, was said to be affected due to this problem. Trent 1000—Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s troubled engine—is manufactured by Rolls-Royce Holding. The aircraft manufacturer already faces a decline in the 787 Dreamliner’s demand amid the changing market conditions; the current technical issue in the engine may add further weigh to it. ANA is one of the largest operators of 787 Dreamliner, with around 50 jets in its fleet, all equipped with the Rolls Royce engine. Boeing primarily offers the jet with two engine options: one with Trent 1000, and the other with General Electric’s GEnx engine. Since its inception, 787 Dreamliner has experienced various issues; it was grounded around the world after a lithium-ion battery meltdown was identified around three years ago. While the problems were resolved, the three-month ban seriously impacted the airline’s business. While a detailed update on the actual issue is still to be disclosed by ANA, the airline is unable to replace 787 Dreamliners with other aircraft, since it is used on the long-haul flights. Neither Rolls Royce nor Boeing has officially commented on the matter yet. However, both are expected to look into the issue thoroughly to defend the plane’s image. Industry experts have already started to criticize the engine’s performance, and opined that the aircraft’s demand will face a significantly-adverse effect. On the other hand, numerous airlines have shifted their focus toward smaller single-aisle commercial jets, with the aim to reduce operational costs and to become more competitive. Among such companies, Indian Jet Airways has deferred the 787 Dreamliner deliveries, due by 2017 end to 2019 in order to limit the wide-body capacity, and consolidate its businesses.

(AP) -- For a change, Fred Couples won't be receiving the most attention and the largest galleries when the Boeing Classic tees off Friday at TPC Snoqualmie Ridge. The Seattle native is missing his hometown tournament for the second time since he joined the senior tour six years ago. Couples had to withdraw during the 2012 tournament, but didn't enter this year because of back problems that have sidelined him since February. With Couples' bid to finally win a tournament in his hometown put on hold, most of the focus will fall on tour newcomer John Daly. "Everywhere he goes, there's a buzz. Everyone just loves John, they love to watch him hit the ball a long way, but just his personality and the way he conducts himself on the golf course, everybody has fun," said Billy Mayfair, who in his first start on the senior tour finished second behind Gene Sauers in the U.S. Senior Open. "He brings a lot of people out to watch and I think it's great. Listen, everyone here in this field would love to see John play well. We've always been that way." Daly has three top-20 finishes in 10 PGA Tour Champions starts since turning 50, with the best a tie for 11th last month in the Dick's Sporting Goods Open in New York. "Right now, for me, my game is not where I want it, so it's more of a grind and it's very hard to enjoy it as much as guys that are playing really good out here," Daly said. "They come in, they're playing really good, they've got confidence. I'm just coming in trying to find it." Last week, he tied for 51st in the regular European Tour's Czech Masters. "A little jet-lagged today, but it wasn't too bad," Daly said. "It was nice. We went Prague, Amsterdam, straight here." He visited the NFL's Seattle Seahawks on Wednesday "I didn't get a chance to kick any. We did the chip off," Daly said. "It was a beautiful facility. I got to talk to Coach (Pete) Carroll. I haven't seen him in a while since USC kicked the living you-know-what out of the Razorbacks. Beat us like 70-3 or 70-7 or something." He found Snoqualmie Ridge's greens demanding. "The greens are tough," Daly said. "The greens are hard to hit right now. For me, I'm hitting it so bad that the fairways are very generous, but I'm really struggling getting the ball close, and of course I'm putting like a blind man so that's not helping either. The tour was off last week, giving Sauers an opportunity to relish his first senior victory. Sauers took advantage of a late collapse by Miguel Angel Jimenez to beat Jimenez and Mayfair by a stroke. "I was almost kind of beginning to doubt myself whether I can win again," Sauers said. "This is my fourth year out here and I haven't won. I've won on the PGA Tour, I've won on that Nike Tour, and that was one of my goals, to win out here on the Champions Tour, and I got me a good one. " The victory capped an amazing comeback for Sauers 10 years removed from nearly dying. He was incorrectly diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, spent seven weeks in the hospital and was given a 25 percent chance of survival. Eventually he was diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare disorder of the skin and mucous membranes that causes the skin on the extremities to burn from the inside out. "I didn't touch a club for seven years. You got to relearn everything," Sauers said. "Hitting the ball wasn't so bad, but just around the greens, chipping and putting, the bunker shots and all that, that kind of took a little extra time to try to master. Still haven't mastered it, still working on it, but had me a good week. But just coming back from all that stuff is extra special." The tournament is in its 12th year and is the only regular stop of any of the major golf tours in the state of Washington. The tour announced on Thursday that Boeing would remain the title sponsor of the tournament through 2021. ←Older Newer→ Updated : 2016-11-24 03:45 GMT+08:00 MOST POPULAR Strasbourg's Christmas market at Taipei 101 20 Thanksgiving dining options in Taipei Thailand waives visa fee for Taiwan, 18 nations Taipei high school opens first gender-neutral restrooms in Taiwan Canadian man savagely beats Taiwanese girlfriend on Taipei street Meet Hualien's Famous British Barber Google Map of Taiwan's Demolished and Burned Cultural Assets Taiwanese woman opts for 'Stateless' over being branded 'Chinese' on Iceland ID Torrential rain warnings issued for northern Taiwan Current foreign workers program outdated and unreasonable: KMT lawmaker About Us Contact Us Taiwan News © 2016 All Rights Reserved.

Forty-nine passengers and crew were killed; one crew member survived. Ten years later, this video from that week still pays powerful tribute to the victims. David Stephenson Herald-Leader Staff Comair Flight 5191 crashed Aug. 27, 2006, at Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, Ky. The plane had taken off from a runway that was too short. Among the 49 who died were two passengers from Leawood. Two days after the crash, the wreckage was still being inspected. But a decade later, pilots complain that the FAA has been slow to require cockpit “synthetic vision systems” that could avert such tragedies. File photo The Associated Press Paige Winters File photo File image Thomas Fahey File photo 1 of 4 i By Curtis Tate ctate@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON A decade after the deadly crash of Comair Flight 5191 at Kentucky’s Blue Grass Airport, federal regulators have been slow to approve new technology that could help avoid similar crashes. Although many general aviation and business aircraft are now equipped with advanced GPS-based navigation aids, such devices are relatively uncommon in large commercial airliners. The devices range from movable maps overlaid with airport diagrams that can be installed on an iPad to 3-D “synthetic vision systems” built into the flight deck that can help pilots see exactly where they are in darkness, poor weather or other disorienting situations. The investigation of the Comair crash concluded that the pilots had lined up in the dark on the wrong runway for their takeoff — something that modern GPS technology could have avoided. “I don’t think there’s any question now that that technology is mature and available,” said Jim Hall, a former National Transportation Safety Board chairman who led numerous aviation accident investigations. But the Federal Aviation Administration must certify such devices for use in commercial aircraft, a process that moves at the speed of bureaucracy, according to pilots and aviation safety experts. The agency declined to follow a key recommendation made by safety investigators after the Aug. 27, 2006, Comair crash in Lexington, Ky., that called for requiring movable map technology in airplane cockpits. With the exception of iPads or other tablets replacing pilots’ paper charts in the cockpit, little has changed. “The technology is outpacing the FAA’s ability to get something approved quickly,” said Joe Weaver, a Texas-based commercial pilot who’s been flying for more than 40 years. “In today’s environment, there are more aids available than we’re allowed to use.” ‘Unacceptable action’ In the predawn darkness of that Sunday morning 10 years ago, the Comair flight crew had what should have been a relatively simple task: guide their Atlanta-bound Bombardier regional jet to the 7,000-foot runway 22. Instead, the crew lined up the plane on the 3,500-foot runway 26, which was too short for the aircraft to safely take off. Neither the pilot nor co-pilot, nor the sole air-traffic controller on duty that morning, noticed the mistake. The plane ran off the end of the runway, became briefly airborne, then crashed and burst into flames. Of the 50 passengers and crew members aboard, 49 died. Only the co-pilot survived. Among the dead: Paige Winters, a 16-year-old junior at Shawnee Mission East High School, and Thomas Fahey, a horse trainer and Winters’ riding teacher. Both were from Leawood. Fahey was on the trip to help the Winters family purchase a new horse for Paige. Fahey, 26, had built a riding and training business in partnership with the Winsrun Equestrian Center in Bucyrus, Kan. Paige’s mother, Joan Winters, had planned to be on the plane but was bumped at the last minute because the flight was overbooked. In its 2007 accident report, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the probable cause of the crash was the flight crew’s failure to use available visual cues to determine they were not taking off on the correct runway. The board also determined that a conversation unrelated to their task of getting the plane safely in the air was a contributing factor in the accident. Among its many recommendations: that the FAA require aircraft to be equipped with movable map technology on GPS devices, similar to navigation aids that give drivers turn-by-turn directions. Ultimately, the FAA decided to make the technology voluntary. It was the only recommendation the board made from the Kentucky crash that the FAA did not adopt. After several years of back-and-forth with regulators, the NTSB closed the recommendation in 2014 and classified it as an “unacceptable action.” “I don’t think you can say you are putting safety first when you’re putting it into a voluntary category,” said Hall, who led the board from 1994 to 2001. ‘A game changer’ The NTSB found that the Comair 5191 pilots lost “positional awareness” in part because runway construction had closed off the usual taxiway to the 7,000-foot runway they were supposed to use. Though their magnetic headings told them they were on the wrong runway, they made a false assumption that turned out to be catastrophic. “If they’d had a GPS-driven taxi chart in the cockpit,” Weaver said, “I don’t think they would have taken off on the wrong runway.” By 2014, many commercial carriers were using iPads in the cockpit. The devices replaced the 40-pound bags of paper navigation charts pilots had been required to carry. The iPads could also function as enhanced navigation aids, and many general aviation pilots used them for that purpose, saving them tens of thousands of dollars in upgrades. FedEx received the first FAA certification, in June 2014, to allow its pilots to use iPad moving maps. That’s more than a decade after the first airport moving map was installed in the flight deck of a Boeing 777 delivered to Dutch airline KLM in October 2003. An Airbus spokeswoman, Mary Anne Greczyn, said Airbus had begun installing moving map displays in its commercial aircraft in 1988, beginning with the A320. Jeppesen, a unit of Boeing that manufactures avionics, or aviation electronics, estimates that only 1,000 of the 22,000 commercial airplanes worldwide are equipped with moving map technology but that the number is growing. Rick Ellerbrock, Jeppesen’s director of customer and market insights, said retrofitting aircraft with built-in moving maps could be costly, so new planes were almost the only ones that had them. However, an iPad or Microsoft Surface is an attractive low-cost option. The FAA has certified at least eight airlines to use tablet moving maps, according to Jeppesen, with more carriers seeking certification. “It was truly a game changer,” Ellerbrock said. A 3-D picture When Weaver isn’t flying a Boeing 737, he’s piloting his own Beechcraft Bonanza. The small aircraft is equipped with a 3-D display that shows him the direction the plane is moving, which runway he’s on and what the surrounding terrain looks like. Since smaller planes fly at lower altitudes, the display also shows him the terrain below. “You have a 3-D picture of everything that’s out there,” he said. The software is made by Garmin, a familiar brand to drivers who use its products in their cars. It is programmed with airport diagrams from all over the world and overlays them on a moving map. It can be updated to reflect changes in airport layouts. Construction at Blue Grass Airport in August 2006 had changed the way Comair 5191 approached the runway. “It’s very easy for pilots to see exactly where they are at a given point,” said Jessica Koss, a spokeswoman for Garmin, based in Olathe. Though Garmin builds synthetic vision systems for general aviation and business aircraft, it does not have any equipment installed on aircraft built by Boeing or Airbus, the major manufacturers of large commercial airliners. Rockwell Collins and Honeywell Aerospace also build avionics for cockpits and offer synthetic vision technology for helicopters and small aircraft. Embraer and Bombardier, which manufactured the regional jet that crashed in Lexington, build business aircraft equipped with synthetic vision. But it may be years before synthetic vision systems become widespread in larger commercial aircraft. In December, the FAA issued guidance on what aircraft makers and suppliers would need to do to secure its approval to install synthetic vision. But the agency said it would not authorize the technology’s use in all circumstances. The agency did not respond to repeated questions about its time frame for approving new cockpit technologies. Help from NASA After a series of deadly crashes in the 1990s, the federal government launched a $500 million partnership of NASA, the FAA, the Defense Department and the aviation industry to improve safety. The program’s goal was to make travel safer on aircraft large and small. Among its key projects: developing a cockpit display system that would show pilots so-called clear-day conditions — whatever the actual conditions — day or night, rain or shine. NASA committed $5.2 million to synthetic vision and tested the prototype in 1999. “With Global Positioning System signals, pilots can now know exactly where they are,” said Michael Lewis, then director of the NASA Aviation Safety Program. “Add super-accurate terrain databases and graphical displays and we can now draw three-dimensional moving scenes that will show pilots exactly what’s outside.” The FAA first certified synthetic vision for improving situational awareness, though not for navigation, in 2006, the year of the Comair crash. Had it been widely available, synthetic vision is thought to have possibly prevented the July 1999 crash of John F. Kennedy Jr.’s Piper Saratoga off the Atlantic coast, in which he, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister were killed. It also might have made a difference in the February 2009 Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash in Buffalo, N.Y. All 49 people on board and one person on the ground were killed. Overall, aviation safety has vastly improved in the past two decades. According to the FAA, the fatality risk fell 83 percent from 1998 to 2008. The agency wants to reduce it another 50 percent by 2025. Hall attributes the improvements to changes implemented in the wake of crashes like the Comair disaster. The FAA isn’t bound by the recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board, but it follows the vast majority of them. “The only way we can be sure this does not occur again is to follow up on these recommendations,” Hall said.

(AP) — For a change, Fred Couples won't be receiving the most attention and the largest galleries when the Boeing Classic tees off Friday at TPC Snoqualmie Ridge. The Seattle native is missing his hometown tournament for the second time since he joined the senior tour six years ago. Couples had to withdraw during the 2012 tournament, but didn't enter this year because of back problems that have sidelined him since February. With Couples' bid to finally win a tournament in his hometown put on hold, most of the focus will fall on tour newcomer John Daly. "Everywhere he goes, there's a buzz.

"He brings a lot of people out to watch and I think it's great. Listen, everyone here in this field would love to see John play well. We've always been that way." Daly has three top-20 finishes in 10 PGA Tour Champions starts since turning 50, with the best a tie for 11th last month in the Dick's Sporting Goods Open in New York. "Right now, for me, my game is not where I want it, so it's more of a grind and it's very hard to enjoy it as much as guys that are playing really good out here," Daly said.

Rising Need to Identify Zero-day Vulnerabilities will Bolster Investments in Cyber Weapons, Reports TMR 2016-08-25 Print Tweet   Cyber Weapon Market is driven by rising demand for advanced cyber warfare techniques. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Several companies operate in the global cyber weapon market, among which The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, General Dynamics Corporation, Raytheon Company, BAE Systems plc, and Northrop Grumman Corporation are identified as the key players in a report by Transparency Market Research (TMR). Get the Full Report at: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/cyber-weapon-market.html The defensive cyber weapon segment in the market is highly fragmented due to the existence of numerous companies offering high-tech cyber-security services. Contrary to this, only a handful of companies such as Hacking Team and VUPEN Security offer offensive cyber weapons. This has in turn resulted into a consolidated vendor landscape in the offensive cyber weapon segment. According to TMR, the global cyber weapon market stood at US$390 bn in 2014. Rising at a CAGR of 4.4% CAGR, the market is expected to reach US$521.87 bn by the end of 2021. With a share of 73.8%, the defensive cyber weapon segment dominated the market by type in 2014. Regionally, North America accounted for the leading share of 36% in the global market in 2014. Besides exploring strategic collaborations and partnerships, the leading companies in the market are investing in the research and development of advanced solutions, said a lead TMR analyst. Many of these companies are planning to expand their geographical footprint by expanding their existing product portfolio. Cyber Weapons Sales Expected to Rise as Traditional Arms Manufacturers Venture in the Market The incidence of cybercrimes, security breaches, and data thefts has been rising at a significant pace. Compelled by this, organizations around the world have increased their investment to identify zero-day vulnerabilities. The existence of a hole in software that is not known to developer becomes an uncorrected software application vulnerability that could be exploited to affect consumer programs, data, and network. Identification of these vulnerabilities are important to prevent extremist groups from using them. Governments, intelligence agencies, and other organizations have spiked their investment to identify zero-day exploits and use them against enemy networks when necessary. With an aim of capitalizing on the prevalent trend, several traditional arms manufacturing companies are expanding their businesses in the cyber security segment. This will in turn fuel the development of cyber weapons. The market is also expected to gain from the increasing demand for security across critical infrastructure and utilities. Cyber weapons can launch attacks against critical infrastructure and disrupt vital services of an economy. Primary economic sectors therefore attach utmost importance to intellectual property and information and technology. This is a prime factor fuelling demand from the cyber weapon market. Get the Sample Report at: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=6194 Regulations Imposed to Prevent Unregulated Usage of Cyber Weapons May Hamper their Sales The results of unregulated usage of cyber weapons could prove fatal. Several international organizations have thus described cyber weapons as malicious codes, which were used for mass destruction, said a TMR analyst. Furthermore, they are also increasingly focusing on keeping these weapons out of reach of cyber-terrorists and extremist groups. Governments around the world are therefore compelled to implement stringent regulations to ensure non-proliferation of cyber weapons. Such regulations can impede the markets trajectory to an extent. Nevertheless, the emergence of cyberspace as a new domain will fuel the uptake of cyber weapons in the forthcoming years. The increasing demand for technologies to safeguard national critical infrastructure, which primarily includes the communication network, industrial control systems, defense, and banking and finance, will also boost the sales of cyber weapons in the near future.

The aerospace giant and the PGA Tour said the company will remain as the presenting sponsor of the annual RBC Heritage golf tournament on Hilton Head Island through 2021. The five-year extension was announced Thursday. Chicago-based Boeing has been the presenting sponsor since 2011. “Boeing is continuing to make a difference in the state of South Carolina and we are extremely proud that they have chosen once again to support the RBC Heritage,” said Steve Wilmot, president of tournament organizer Heritage Classic Foundation. “We are very excited about the next five years and the positive impact we will be able to make in the communities we serve.” Boeing and RBC, a bank based in Canada, stepped in at the last minute as the tournament’s major sponsors five years ago, after Verizon pulled out. The Heritage, which turns 50 in 2018, is the only regularly scheduled PGA tournament to be played in South Carolina. It is among the state’s top three sporting events, with the others being the Labor Day weekend Nascar Southern 500 race in Darlington and the Family Circle Cup women’s tennis championship held each spring on Daniel Island. Boeing’s decision to keep supporting the Heritage comes more than four months after RBC announced it would extend its sponsorship through 2023. Wilmot said he was not concerned about the two-year gap between the new financial commitments. “We’ll figure out 2022 and ’23,” he told the Island Packet newspaper Thursday. “Hopefully when we get into it a year or two, they’ll be excited about our 50th anniversary and we’ll be at a point where we can line those things up.” Boeing has made headlines at Harbour Town Golf Links with several 787 flyovers during tournament week. The next RBC Heritage will take place April 13-16 with a purse of $6.5 million, or 10 percent more than this year’s contest. Branden Grace is the defending champion. Boeing is one of the South Carolina’s largest employers, with more than 8,000 workers. It has a 787 Dreamliner assembly plant and other aerospace operations at several sites in North Charleston, about two hours north of Harbour Town. In a separate golf tie-in, the PGA Champions Tour for players over 50 announced Thursday that Boeing has extended its title sponsorship of the Boeing Classic through 2021. That tournament kicks off Friday east of Seattle at TPC Snoqualmie. Eighty-one players are competing for a $2 million purse.

Tom Berquist, BECU’s senior vice president of marketing and cooperative affairs, says BECU’s first Spokane-area branches will be located at 916 N. Division, in the Cataldo Square Shopping Center, and at 615 N. Sullivan, in Spokane Valley.  The Journal had reported in January that the credit union was researching three possible branch locations available for lease—one near Gonzaga University, one in Spokane Valley, and another in north Spokane. Berquist says the credit union continues to search for leasable space for the third Spokane-area branch. He says the credit union anticipates hiring up to 25 new employees across the three branches. Each location will have a manager and member consultants who can assist with financial decisions and services. The new BECU branches here will be what are called cashless branches, with members still using ATMs, online, or mobile banking to complete transactions rather than interacting with a teller. They’ll be able to use the new branches to establish accounts, apply for loans, and perform financial transactions, and each branch will provide free ATM, online, and telephone banking services. The credit union chose to expand into Spokane because of its potential for growth and reputation as a welcoming market for credit unions, Berquist says.  “We already had an established employee base here at our operations center in Spokane Valley,” he says. “The decision came from a combination of their feedback and that of our member base here.”  Berquist says BECU has about 5,000 members in the Spokane area, and its Spokane Valley operations center employs more than 100 people.  The operations center provides assistance services to BECU members, as well as hosting the credit union’s backup systems. It also could serve as additional location for employees in the event of a major disaster affecting the credit union’s Western Washington locations.  To help manage the new locations, BECU has hired long-time Spokane resident Steve Hauschild as market leader and director of business lending in Spokane and across Eastern Washington.  Hauschild says he sees the new branches as an opportunity to provide a bridge between the eastern and western sides of the state.  “We have a large member base here and felt familiar and confident enough with the market to make the move to this area,” he says. “These new locations will help us to better serve our members here as well as begin to positively impact the community they live in.”  One example of BECU’s community engagement is its recent partnership with Spokane Neighborhood Action Partners (SNAP), a nonprofit community action agency headquartered at 3102 W. Fort George Wright Drive.  Last month the credit union made a $62,000 donation to support SNAP’s financial stability counseling program, which was experiencing a funding shortfall.   Craig Howard, SNAP’s community relations manager, says, “We reached out to BECU, and they provided an enormous help.  It was wonderful to have the support of a fellow nonprofit that shares many of our values.” He says the credit union will announce another contribution this fall that will benefit SNAP’s business development micro-enterprise program. Berquist says the credit union continues to look for opportunities to support SNAP’s small business efforts, by providing the organization’s programs with additional financial tools and models to help their clients better manage financial goals.  “We’re happy to continue working with SNAP, as well as other organizations suggested by our area membership,” he says.  Based in Tukwila, BECU employs about 1,400 people throughout its 40 financial centers in the Puget Sound area. Membership in the credit union is open to all Washington state residents. The credit union saw a 4.9 percent increase in membership over the 12-month period ending June 30, adding almost 46,000 members for a total of 971,000 members. Meanwhile, its total loans grew by almost 13 percent over that period, coming in at $9.8 billion as of June 30, compared with $8.7 billion a year earlier.  The credit union also continued to experience growth in deposits and total assets, with deposits up 10.9 percent and assets growing by 11.4 percent, compared to June of last year. Last calendar year, BECU’s net income increased by a little over 8 percent, rising to $195 million from $180 million in 2014. In the second quarter of this year.

Copyright Stephen Brashear, Getty Images Advertisement ANA Holdings Inc., the world’s biggest operator of Boeing Co.’s (IW 500/9) Dreamliner jet, is checking the Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (IW 1000/193) engines on its fleet of 787s after investigating a February incident when an aircraft had to shut down a power plant and return to the airport. Japan’s largest airline, with a fleet of 50 Dreamliners, has canceled nine flights with the jets Friday and may have to scrap more than 300 more through the end of September, Takeo Kikuchi, a deputy senior vice president of engineering & maintenance, told reporters in Tokyo Thursday. ANA is changing medium pressure turbine blades on the planes, Kikuchi said. The issue, ANA’s biggest with the model since a 2013 global grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet, came to the fore after finding corrosion on the turbine blades that had led to an aircraft having to shut down a power plant. That jet had to return to Kuala Lumpur airport after receiving a warning that the temperature of the exhaust gas from its right engine was very high. Popular Now What the 2016 Elections Mean for Manufacturers Millennial Recruiting Magic: Solutions from Manufacturers Large and Small Top US Trading Partners ANA encountered the issue of corrosion in turbine blades thrice since February, Kikuchi said. Rolls-Royce will start supplying ANA with modified versions of the turbine blades from January and the carrier will replace the current blades in all its planes, Kikuchi said. Entire Fleet Powered by Rolls-Royce ANA, the launch customer for the 787, has been in talks with Rolls-Royce on problems with the engines since March, Kikuchi said late Thursday. ANA’s entire fleet of 787s are powered by Rolls-Royce engines. The only other engine option for customers are motors from General Electric Co. Rolls-Royce shares fell as much as 2.2%, and was trading down 1.9%, as of 12:30 p.m. in London. Rolls-Royce said it’s aware of the ANA situation and is working with the airline to minimize the effect on service disruption. Boeing didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. The carrier has had three problems with the engines that have affected flights, Kikuchi said, adding that it expects to lose 55 million yen (US$548,000) from tomorrow’s cancellations. The company doesn’t know the total financial impact of the problem at this time, he said. #DidYouKnow the answer? We have over 13,000 engines powering commercial airlines worldwide pic.twitter.com/NMR16u9POv — Rolls-Royce (@RollsRoyce) August 20, 2016 All 787s worldwide were grounded for three months by regulators in 2013 after lithium-ion battery meltdowns on the jets. Boeing came up with a fix for the problem, allowing the planes to resume flights. The global grounding marked the first time in more than three decades when an entire airplane model was pulled out of service. The same year, Japan Airlines Co., the nation’s second-largest airline, replaced 787s on two routes after Boeing ordered Dreamliner jets with GE engines to keep away from certain weather. Japan Airlines, also known as JAL, uses different engines and doesn’t have any problems with them at this time, said Jian Yang, a spokesman for the carrier. The icing issue with the GE engines was resolved earlier this year, he said.

Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:05 PM, August 25, 2016 TOKYO — Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA) said on Thursday (Aug 25) that it is cancelling some Boeing Dreamliner flights owing to a problem with the plane’s engine, and warned of more groundings. The carrier, the biggest worldwide Dreamliner operator with a fleet of 50 jets, said nine domestic flights scheduled for Friday would be halted so it could fix a problem with a Rolls Royce-produced engine. The move came after ANA grounded a domestic Dreamliner flight earlier Thursday, also citing an unspecified engine problem. “We will definitely cancel nine flights (on Friday) and more afterward but we don’t know the specifics yet,” an ANA spokeswoman said on Thursday. In February, a Tokyo-bound ANA Dreamliner flight was forced to return to Kuala Lumpur due to engine trouble, marking another hit for an aircraft plagued by setbacks. Rival Japan Airlines, also a major Dreamliner customer, has nearly 30 of the aircraft but the engines are produced by General Electric. The Dreamliner, also known as the Boeing 787, is built largely with lightweight composite materials that reduce fuel use. It has been hit by a series of problems during development and production as well as since its first commercial flight in late 2011. In 2013, the Dreamliner was grounded globally over an electrical problem. Early that year several planes experienced problems with batteries overheating that caused a fire on one aircraft. Changes were made to prevent recurrence.

Japan’s biggest airline will stop some services starting Friday, Wataru Yoshioka, a spokesman for the Tokyo-based company said Thursday. The airline’s fleet of 50 787s are all powered by Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc engines. ANA will elaborate on the issue, including the number of planes affected at a press briefing at 6 p.m. in Tokyo, Yoshioka said. The airline had an engine problem on a Boeing 787 in February, when the plane returned to Kuala Lumpur airport after receiving a warning that the temperature of the exhaust gas from its right engine was very high, forcing the engine to be shut down. The engine problem that prompted the airline to take the decision is similar to the one discovered in Kuala Lumpur, the spokesman said. Boeing and Rolls-Royce didn’t immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on ANA’s decision. All 787s worldwide were grounded for three months by regulators in 2013 after lithium-ion battery meltdowns on the jets. Boeing came up with a fix for the problem, allowing the planes to resume flights. The global grounding marked the first time in more than three decades when an entire airplane model was pulled out of service. The same year, Japan Airlines Co., the nation’s second-largest airline, replaced 787s on two routes after Boeing ordered Dreamliner jets with General Electric Co. engines to keep away from certain weather. Japan Airlines, also known as JAL, uses different engines and doesn’t have any problems with them at this time, said Jian Yang, a spokesman for the carrier.

Leisure Home LBoard Family cremates wrong body after hospital mix-up FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Auto, aerospace industries warm to 3D printing AFP | August 25, 2016 By turning the manufacturing plane vertical from the standard horizontal, the "printer" has the potential to create components of unlimited size. New 3D printing technology unveiled this week sharply increases the size of objects that can be produced, offering new possibilities to remake manufacturing in the auto, aerospace and other major industries. One application demonstrated by 3D printing machinery maker Stratasys would allow airlines to pick made-to-order airplane interiors that could be tweaked with the click of a mouse. By turning the manufacturing plane vertical from the standard horizontal, the “printer” has the potential to create components of unlimited size. “We’re now talking about parts in feet and meters versus centimeters and inches,” said Rich Garrity, Americas president for Stratasys. “It’s not just a concept.” The advances, by Stratasys, Siemens and others, are beginning to push 3D printing well into the center of manufacturing from around the edges. 3D printing employs sophisticated computer simulations and software to direct “print” objects from powdered, molten and filament materials like nylon, resins, clays, thermoplastics and metals. Manufacturing ‘game-changer’ The technology has not always lived up to sky-high hype, but leading manufacturers remain bullish over its potential to shake up the factory floor. “It is something that is going to be a game-changer,” said Teresa Finchamp, director of operations and quality in Boeing’s department for new technologies. Benefits include the ability to reduce weight by substituting plastic compounds for metals. And by making use of a “digital toolbox” and made-to-order technology, it can also can reduce the need for warehouse space and many conventional manufacturing tools. The ultimate prize is finished items equal in quality to today’s goods, but which are cheaper and faster to make. Siemens argues that 3D printing, along with an increased role of robotics, greater automation and other innovations are creating a “digital factory” that will force a day of reckoning among manufacturers. “These technologies all evolve so fast,” said Andreas Saar, a vice president for additive manufacturing at Siemens. “We believe if people don’t connect, they’re going to have a huge problem,” he told AFP. Boeing, Siemens and Ford are all corporate partners of Stratasys that joined a press tour of its factory in Eden Prairie near Minneapolis. Stratasys on Wednesday showcased an “infinite build” printer that turns the plane of production on its side, allowing the printing of items of “practically unlimited part size,” according to the company. Rocket parts Also on display was a 3D robotic demonstrator utilizing Siemens software that positions and rotates an item as it is printed. The process, allowing for precise movements on an eight-axis motion system, is suited to produce lightweight components that must also be very strong. During the visit, the device was building a black ribbed dome that could be used on a rocket. Stratasys says the applications of the robotic technology are broad and could also be utilized in the oil and medical equipment industries. Stratasys executives described the innovations as “step” changes but would not comment on a timeframe for commercializing the technology. “We are confident where we are in terms of development and we wanted to be able to demonstrate to the market our intent and where we’re heading,” Garrity said. Even if the Stratasys innovations can be made commercial quickly, there are other barriers to more extensive use of 3D printing. A key challenge for the auto industry, a relatively high-volume sector, will be matching the efficiency of conventional manufacturing, experts say. Ellen Lee, who is in charge of bringing 3D printing into the manufacturing process at Ford, also said the technology does not yet make use of materials robust and durable enough for the most important car parts. Boeing’s Finchamp said the aerospace giant planned to use larger 3D parts on commercial airplane interiors as soon as this year. But questions about material strength clouds the outlook for use on larger parts. “We have to be very cautious,” she told AFP. “We’re very very conservative with how to get things onto planes.” Pete Basiliere, an analyst at Gartner who specializes in imaging and print services, said greater consumer interest in 3D printing could help boost the technology. “As consumers start to realize that they can (customize) and not at tremendous cost, then you’re going to see the demand jump,” he said.

Two telecommunications relay satellites were orbited for Intelsat via an Ariane 5 launch. Photo is courtesy of Arianespace. Arianespace’s sixth launch of 2016, the fourth using an Ariane 5, occurred on Wednesday, August 24, 2016, at 07:16 p.m. (local time) from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana. This mission was the 73rd successful Ariane 5 launch in a row and also reflected the steadily increasing performance of the Ariane 5 rocket—back in June of this year, the Ariane 5 established a record launch of 10,730 kg. This launch was Arianespace’s second of the year for Intelsat. Arianespace has now launched 58 satellites for this operator, with their business relationship spanning mre than three decades. Intelsat operates a fleet of approximately 50 satellites and delivers high-performance distribution solutions for media applications and high data-rate connectivity for enterprise, fixed and mobile telecommunications and government applications. Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 are the company’s 57th and 58th satellites launched by Arianespace since the orbiting of Intelsat 507 in October 1983. Intelsat 29e, launched in January of 2016, covers the Americas and the North Atlantic. Intelsat 33e, the second satellite in this series, will provide broadband coverage of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific, as well as certain media solutions. The Intelsat 36 satellite will provide media distribution services for the south African and Indian Ocean regions. Artistic rendition of the Intelsat 33e satellite. Since the company's inception, Arianespace has launched half of all Intelsat satellites, including half of that firm's current on orbit fleet of operational satellites. In 2017, Arianespace will launch two additional Intelsat satellites: Intelsat 32e and Intelsat 37e. Arianespace and Boeing have been partners since 1987. Intelsat 33e is the 52nd Boeing satellite to be launched by Arianespace, which has four more Boeing satellites in its order book. Arianespace and SSL have been working together since 1983. With Intelsat 36, Arianespace has now launched 56 satellites based on SSL platforms and has nine more SSL satellites in their order book, including five to be deployed in GTO. Arianespace now has five geostationary (GEO) satellites in its order book for US-based operators, along with 12 geostationary satellites built by American manufacturers. The company also will deploy telecommunications and Earth Observation (EO) constellations built in the United States. Artistic rendition of the Intelsat 36 satellite. Arianespace will use an Ariane 5 in October of 2018 to launch the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), developed by NASA in conjunction with the Canadian Space Agency and European Space Agency (ESA). Shortly after the announcement of the orbital injection of the two satellites on today’s Flight VA232 with Ariane 5, Arianespace Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Israël extended his thanks to Intelsat for their loyalty over the last 30-plus years and for selecting Arianespace for today’s first-ever launch of two of their telecom satellites on the same Ariane 5. He also thanked Boeing and SSL who built the two Intelsat satellites launched on this mission as well as offered his congratulations to everyone who contributed to this 73rd successful launch in a row of Ariane 5: Airbus Safran Launchers and the entire European launcher industry for the reliability and availability of Ariane 5,; ESA, for their seamless support for the Ariane program; the CNES/CSG, and all companies and staff at the launch base and the teams at Arianespace, for their commitment and professionalism, as we the company marks the sixth successful launch in 2016 and gears up for five more launches during the year.

(NYSE: BA) has filed a patent application for an artillery shell that would deliver up to six gallons of fire retardant per round, day or night, 24 hours a day, in any weather, regardless of fire conditions. Some guns could deliver fire retardant within 15 feet of a target at a range of 15 miles, according to the application. Using a standard guide that estimates the speed at which a wildfire can spread, the patent application noted that on a large 883-acre fire it would take more than 34 hours to deliver 360,000 gallons of retardant by airplane or helicopter. Artillery shells with a three-gallon payload could deliver that much in about half the time, minimizing the area burned to a total of about 1,103 acres compared with a burned area of 3,130 acres when only a helicopter is used to dump retardant on the fire. The Boeing staff responsible for the application also took notice of the environmental impact of leaving a lot of shrapnel behind: In one embodiment, the external surface … of the artillery shell … may be made of any degrading metal which decomposes in nature in less than ten years or is inert and is not harmful to the environment without decomposition. In this embodiment, the external surface … is made of high carbon steel, structural glass, or ceramics having a tensile strength greater than about 200 MP such as Zirconia, Zirconia-toughened Alumina, or Alumina. The shell would explode in mid-air, above the fire, and retardant coverage would vary between one and six gallons per 100 square feet. There is even a proposed variation that does not use any explosive material or fuse. Seven Boeing employees are listed as the inventors and the patent has been assigned to the company.

With the November election looming, “it’s our job to really understand the impact” decisions on such issues as foreign trade, the nation’s defense budget, shifting global partnerships and the Export-Import bank will have on the future of aerospace,” Joan Robinson-Berry said during a keynote address at the annual S.C. Aerospace Conference and Expo. The election “is something we’re all thinking about probably more than we want to,” she said. Robinson-Berry did not openly endorse either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but described attributes of a candidate that will “ensure that we don’t step backwards in what we’ve accomplished over the last 100 years.” “More than ever, we need to have that leadership attribute I call emotional resilience — to be calm, to be focused and to have a clear heart in some of these decisions,” Robinson-Berry said at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center. “We have to be aware of the shifting global economy, including oil prices and the changes in airline policy and global trade and the Ex-Im Bank, how important that is to our industry and, of course, trade. “We need to think about these things that are very complicated, very politically charged, but that have a direct impact on our ability to grow our aerospace industry, not only in our state but in our country,” she said. After her remarks, Robinson-Berry said the next president “absolutely must support” the federal Ex-Im Bank, which provides financing to foreign companies looking to buy expensive U.S.-made goods, including commercial aircraft. “It’s important to support a global market to trade,” Robinson-Berry said of the lending agency. Boeing is one of the bank’s biggest beneficiaries, and many of its sales — including those of the 787 Dreamliners made in North Charleston — would face financial hurdles without the bank’s backing. Congress reauthorized the Ex-Im Bank in December following a lengthy bipartisan fight, but its board still does not have the quorum needed to make loans exceeding $10 million because of Senate inaction. Clinton has said she supports the bank because it keeps the United States competitive in the global economy. Trump opposes the bank, saying the companies that benefit from it “can do very well without it.” Trump also has said he wants to “rip up” many of the trade agreements the aerospace industry now supports. Robinson-Berry also discounted comments Trump made during the primaries in which he predicted Boeing will moves its production facilities to China. During a speech in Colleton County earlier this year, Trump said: “Everyone loves Boeing today, but talk to me about Boeing in five years — unless I’m elected president, then you’ll be OK.” Boeing’s businesses in North Charleston, aren’t going anywhere, Robinson-Berry said. They include the Dreamliner fabrication and assembly campus, a research center, a plant that designs and makes engine parts and a factory that makes 787 interior cabin parts. “I know we’re going to grow internationally, but we also have a strong presence here,” she said. “We made a huge investment in North Charleston. It’s hard for me to believe that we would take that huge investment and infrastructure and shut it down.” Robinson-Berry took over as vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina in June, when its former leader, Beverly Wyse, moved back to the Seattle region to become a division president. Robinson-Berry has been with Boeing for 30 years. The two-day aerospace conference has drawn more than 500 attendees to hear about industry trends, workforce and education initiatives and developments in new technology.

With the help of the international nonprofit organization Vital Voices, whose mission is to invest in and empower women leaders, the airline’s 22nd Next-Generation 737-800 will transport and deliver nearly 30 boxes full of relief items including clothes and school supplies. The items are headed to The Children’s Advocacy Center Thailand (ACT), a non-profit organization dedicated to better the lives of abused children and youth in Thailand. Representatives from ACT will deliver the aid to impacted children and youth throughoutThailand. “We are honored to play an important role for the well-being of our children and youth,” said Nok Air CEO Patee Sarasin. “Providing timely supplies to those in need will affect the lives of many in the region. Nok Air is proud to continue playing a vital role in cultivating the well-being of our community.” As part of the Global Corporate Citizenship program, Boeing is committed to building better communities worldwide. “We are honored that Nok Air partnered with The Boeing Company to deliver humanitarian aid to the many children in Thailand who are in need,” said Sam Whiting, Director, Global Corporate Citizenship, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We look forward to working closely with Nok Air and non-profit organizations like ACT in Thailand to identify future opportunities.” Based in Bangkok, Thailand, Nok Air is a low-cost carrier that operates an all-Boeing fleet. As part of a tradition in naming its new airplanes, Nok Air has designated this particular airplane ‘Fah Kram,’ which means blue skies. The airline currently has two additional Next-Generation 737s on order with Boeing after today’s delivery. Nok Air is also a 737 MAX customer with eight 737 MAX 8 airplanes on order.

A non-profit organization that strives to prevent and treat blindness worldwide, Orbis typically completes 10-12 aircraft missions per year, flying doctors, nurses and anesthesiologists – all volunteers – across  the globe to provide hands-on ophthalmology training to health workers onboard the MD-10, a fully accredited teaching hospital. A key purpose of the organization is to prevent “avoidable blindness”. Orbis estimates that there are 280 million visually impaired people in the world and 80% of them do not have to be: 240 million just need glasses, the other 40 million can be cured if they can afford or have access to eye care.  Jack McHale, director of the MD-10 program (as well as a former interim president and CEO of Orbis and the former managing director of aircraft acquisitions at FedEx), gave Aviation Week a tour of the MD-10 on a stopover at the Reagan Washington National Airport on June 30. FedEx donated the aircraft to Orbis and a host of other companies provided financial help for the modifications and outfitting. While the MD-10 performs the same mission as its predecessors – the DC-8 from 1982-1992 and a DC-10 from 1992-2016 – its internals are quite different, explains McHale. Both the DC-8 and DC-10 were passenger aircraft that had to be converted into mobile hospitals, meaning the operating rooms were certified as an integral part of the aircraft, an expensive proposition.  No so with the MD-10. Aside from the “theater” or teaching area at the front of the aircraft... ...and changing rooms and lavatories at the rear of the cabin, the remainder of the hospital is completely independent of hte airframe and housed in nine 125in. x 217in. x 96in. cargo containers stacked back to back. The containers were initially loaded through the front 102 in. x 140 in. cargo door, rolled into place, fastened in and hooked up, but there are no electrical or other connections to the aircraft itself, meaning the actual hospital did not have to be certified as part of the aircraft. From front to back, the cargo containers on the MD-10 hold an administrative office, audiovisual/IT room, laser treatment room, observation area, operating room, sterilization room and recovery area, none of which require input from the aircraft.   Above: Laser Treatment Room Below: Operating Room Below: McHale describes the Recovery Room This means that when the MD-10 lands at a destination, where it will usually stay for about three weeks, the 22 crew members have certain tasks to complete and a few items to obtain from the airport. "We need a set of stairs, a garden hose and a forklift," says McHale. Other than the water they take on, the hospital is self sufficient, thanks to two electrical generators and an air conditioning unit that are stored in belly cargo and taken out at the destination.   The unique cargo container hospital was built by MMIC, a maker of mobile surgery units (picture the trailer portion of a tractor trailer), based in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. "We went to them and said if we give you three trucks, cut in three, can you put them all together and make a hospital" says McHale, "and they said sure." Built in St. Johnsbury, the containers were then shipped to Victorville, California, where the other modifications were made and the aircraft flight tested by a FedEx crew.  Orbis holds the patents for the cargo pallet-mobile hospital conversion, and is optimistic the idea might resonate with militaries or government agencies that may be in need of a flying hospital.  The organization has 19 volunteer pilots, including the two below, all of whom are FedEx pilots offering the services on their own time. They will fly the dozen or so missions per year that Orbis strives to complete, and be flown home on commercial airlines after landing the MD-10 at a new location. When the aircraft is ready to leave again, Orbis flies another crew to the location.   While FedEx contributes to maintenance costs, Orbis pays the fuel bills, airplane tickets and hotel rooms for the two dozen or so doctors, nurses and anesthesiologists volunteering for a given mission. Orbis has 400 doctors, nurses and anesthesiologist volunteers. McHale too spends a good portion of his time volunteering, and remains passionate about the work.  “When you see somebody get a life back because they can see, whether it’s a child or an 80-year-old guy, you know that it’s worth it," he says.

Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement Rene Kunz on Aug 24, 2016 I have the same question about China-PRC being the No.1 destination. Is the Chinese government still unable to take care of of their population now, considering that they Chinese Government/Chinese corporations are investing in and buying up companies and landholdings all over the globe and expanding their military might at a rapid pace. Does not most of the population within the African Continent have a more serious and devastating problem with eye diseases and blindness that China? Log In or Register to post comments grantar2 on Aug 26, 2016 BlazonMc, re-read the article. They are going to China on a teaching mission. For all it's new found wealth China with the largest population on earth is very poor, with poor medical infrastructure across most of the country. The wealth as concentrated in the costal regions. That said their medical technology lags Europe and particularly the U.S. By training Chinese doctors a great amount of progress can be made. The China mission is akin to teaching the how to fish, rather than giving them a fish ( I am sure you know the proverb). As for Bangladesh, the answer is many times. You can google Orbis Bangladesh and see some of the work. Log In or Register to post comments msadesign on Aug 24, 2016 Don't tell me this isn't a great country.

For example, the all the crew members (18 from 12 nationalities, while I've worked there) have equal salary and contracts for maximum two years, regardless of the position. That is to allow more to go through the great opportunity to work on board and gather priceless experience, that to bring back to their home country clinics; The world renown eye surgeons come and operate absolutely pro bono!

Outside the big cities in rural areas, the peasants really are peasants despite what the communist government wants westerners to think.

There are many countries on the earth that do not have the financial resources to take care of their population with proper medical facilities. Why China??????

This time the problem is with the Rolls-Royce engines that are fitted to around a third of the planes. Japanese airline ANA says it is having to cancel over three hundred flights this month and next to replace compressor blades in Trent 1000 engines which can become corroded. Rolls Royce said it is “working closely with ANA to minimise the effect on aircraft service disruption”. It did not say whether the problem had been found in engines on aircraft operated by other airlines. Rolls Royce shares fell 1.75 percent on Thursday. ANA is the biggest operator of the 787, with 50 aircraft, or around a tenth of those that are in service. Three years ago the 787 fleet was grounded for three months due to battery fires and an Ethiopian Airlines plane suffered a small fire when a component on board short circuited.

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders surged up by 4.4 percent in July after tumbling by a revised 4.2 percent in June. Economists had expected orders to climb by about 3.7 percent compared to the 4.0 percent slump that had been reported for the previous month. The bigger than expected increase in durable goods orders was partly due to a substantial rebound in orders for transportation equipment, which shot up by 10.5 percent in July after tumbling by 11.4 percent in June. Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts soared by 89.9 percent, as aerospace giant Boeing (BA) received orders for 73 planes in July compared to only 12 in June Excluding the jump in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose by 1.5 percent in July after edging down by 0.3 percent in June. Ex-transportation orders had been expected to tick up by 0.5 percent. Orders for computers and electronic products and electrical equipment, appliances, and components showed significant increases during the month. The report also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched indicator of capital spending, jumped by 1.6 percent in July after rising by 0.5 percent in June. However, shipments in the same category, which are used to calculate GDP, fell by 0.4 percent in July following a 0.5 percent drop in June. Andrew Hunter, U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said, "Overall, the data suggest that, after contracting at a 3.5% annualized pace in the second quarter, business equipment investment may be set for a modest recovery in the third quarter." "Admittedly, the latest survey evidence suggests that the upturn in capital orders might not last for long," he added. "Nonetheless, now that the drags from mining-related investment and net trade are fading, we still expect GDP growth to pick up over the second half of the year." Next Friday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate report on July factory orders, which include orders for both durable and non-durable goods. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Forex News The Worst IPO flops of 2016 Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories Forex Top Story Fed Minutes Indicate Rate Hike "Relatively Soon" U.S. Consumer Sentiment Improves More The Previously Estimated In November U.S. New Home Sales Drop Much More Than Expected In October Hammond Cuts U.K. 2017 Growth Forecast, Abandons 2020 Budget Surplus Goal U.S. Durable Goods Orders Spike Amid Jump In Demand For Commercial Aircraft U.S. Weekly Jobless Claims Rebound From Four-Decade Low Eurozone Private Sector Growth Strongest Thus Far This Year Australia Construction Work Falls 4.9% In Q3 U.S. Existing Home Sales Unexpectedly Climb To Nearly 10-Year High U.K. Chancellor To Focus On Infrastructure Spending U.K. Budget Deficit Narrows On Tax Receipts Thailand GDP Growth Eases In Q3 Japan October Trade Surplus Y496.174 Billion U.S. Leading Economic Index Inches Higher For Second Straight Month Draghi Says ECB Cannot Yet Drop Guard On Eurozone Outlook <<Previous        26 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Offices Of Samsung, Pension Fund Raided Over Scandal Involving President Infineon Sees Higher FY17 Revenues, Raises Margin View, Despite Weak Q4 Profit Volkswagen Brand Focuses On Electric Cars, US In Transformation Plan Twitter Suspends CEO Jack Dorsey's Account Briefly HP Q4 Profit Meets View - Update What's In The Offing For These Biotech Stocks?

The Commerce Department said durable goods orders surged up by 4.4 percent in July after tumbling by a revised 4.2 percent in June. Economists had expected orders to climb by about 3.7 percent compared to the 4.0 percent slump that had been reported for the previous month. The bigger than expected increase in durable goods orders was partly due to a substantial rebound in orders for transportation equipment, which shot up by 10.5 percent in July after tumbling by 11.4 percent in June. Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts soared by 89.9 percent, as aerospace giant Boeing (BA) received orders for 73 planes in July compared to only 12 in June Excluding the jump in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose by 1.5 percent in July after edging down by 0.3 percent in June. Ex-transportation orders had been expected to tick up by 0.5 percent. Orders for computers and electronic products and electrical equipment, appliances, and components showed significant increases during the month. The report also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched indicator of capital spending, jumped by 1.6 percent in July after rising by 0.5 percent in June. However, shipments in the same category, which are used to calculate GDP, fell by 0.4 percent in July following a 0.5 percent drop in June. Andrew Hunter, U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said, 'Overall, the data suggest that, after contracting at a 3.5% annualized pace in the second quarter, business equipment investment may be set for a modest recovery in the third quarter.' 'Admittedly, the latest survey evidence suggests that the upturn in capital orders might not last for long,' he added. 'Nonetheless, now that the drags from mining-related investment and net trade are fading, we still expect GDP growth to pick up over the second half of the year.' Next Friday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release a separate report on July factory orders, which include orders for both durable and non-durable goods.

Through the first seven months of the year, durable goods orders were down 0.9%, compared to the same period in 2015.  The data suggest the manufacturing sector is firming in the second half of the year. The latest report reflects the first full month of data since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in late June. After the vote, the dollar strengthened further against the British pound and euro, but it has fallen again since the end of July.  July's rise was led by more robust demand for transportation equipment, orders of which rose 10.5%. That was driven by the volatile category of civilian aircraft and parts, which showed a 89.9% increase in orders over the month. Separate data from Boeing Co., the largest aerospace company in the U.S., showed 73 orders for large jets in July, up from 12 in June.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Orders for durable goods excluding the transportation category rose 1.5% from June, and orders excluding defense rose 3.8% last month.  Data on durable-goods orders can be uneven from month to month and are often revised.  A closely watched proxy for business investment, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, rose for the second straight month in July. They were up 1.6% from June, the largest gain since January.  But orders in the category were still down 4.3% in the first seven months of the year, compared with the same period in 2015.  Investment in capital goods, such as machine tools or robotics equipment, is a key ingredient in boosting workers' wages and productivity, as well as corporate profits. The lack of business investment is a factor in the economy's sluggish growth and weak productivity gains. Productivity, or output per hour worked, fell for the third time in the second quarter, the longest streak of falling productivity since 1979.  After steadily climbing in the first few years of the recovery, manufacturing output has mostly flattened in the past two years. A sharp drop in oil prices curbed new investment in the energy sector, and a strengthening dollar made U.S.-made goods more expensive for overseas buyers. Still, steady hiring and low interest rates have stoked domestic appetite for some durable items, such as cars, helping counter the lack of capital investment and foreign demand.  But consumer demand can only go so far in spurring economic growth. Federal Reserve officials, who gather with other central bankers this week for an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., face the possibility the U.S. economy is stuck in a "new normal" of low growth and productivity.  The durable orders report is sync with other recent reports suggesting the U.S. manufacturing sector stabilized in July. A Federal Reserve report showed manufacturing output posted its largest monthly advance in a year in July. And the Institute for Supply Management's gauge showed manufacturing activity expanding in July for the fifth straight month.  Wednesday's report showed orders for motor vehicles and parts were flat in July. Demand for machinery rose 1.6%. Orders for computers and electronic products posted their largest increase since March 2015, up 3.6%.  Shipments of durable goods rose 0.2% during the month, but are down 1.1% compared with shipments in the first seven months of last year.  Write to Anna Louie Sussman at anna.sussman@wsj.com and Josh Mitchell at Joshua.mitchell@wsj.com Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

ROS LBoard 1 Family cremates wrong body after hospital mix-up FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Japan’s ANA cancels Dreamliner flights over engine trouble AFP | August 25, 2016 The carrier, the biggest worldwide Dreamliner operator with a fleet of 50 jets, said nine domestic flights scheduled for Friday would be halted so it could fix a problem with a Rolls Royce-produced engine. TOKYO: Japan’s All Nippon Airways said Thursday it is cancelling some Boeing Dreamliner flights owing to a problem with the plane’s engine, and warned of more groundings. The carrier, the biggest worldwide Dreamliner operator with a fleet of 50 jets, said nine domestic flights scheduled for Friday would be halted so it could fix a problem with a Rolls Royce-produced engine. The move came after ANA grounded a domestic Dreamliner flight earlier Thursday, also citing an unspecified engine problems. “We will definitely cancel nine flights tomorrow and more afterward but we don’t know the specifics yet,” an ANA spokeswoman said. In February, a Tokyo-bound ANA Dreamliner flight was forced to return to Kuala Lumpur due to engine trouble, marking another hit for an aircraft plagued by setbacks. Rival Japan Airlines, also a major Dreamliner customer, has nearly 30 of the aircraft but the engines are produced by General Electric. The Dreamliner, built largely with lightweight composite materials that reduce fuel use, has been hit by a series of problems during development and production as well as since its first commercial flight in late 2011. In 2013, the Dreamliner was grounded globally over an electrical problem. Early that year several planes experienced problems with batteries overheating that caused a fire on one aircraft. Changes were made to prevent recurrence. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story. We welcome your opinions to allow a healthy debate.

First, it was not Obama's Iran nuclear deal. It was a United States, China, England, France, Germany and Spain deal. Iran turned over 90 percent of their plutonium to Russia. Without the deal, they'd have their first nuclear weapon by now. They were that close to having one. Secondly, the U.S. Navy did say they were in Iranian water. Also the $400 million was not ransom for the sailors, no money exchanged hands for their release. The money was frozen Iranian assets and that was the first payment. The deal was made last January. We and other countries agreed to release their frozen assets. They still have over a billion dollars coming. Also, what Mr. Pasternak doesn't mention is the deal Iran made with Boeing for passenger airliners. They could have gone with Airbus but chose Boeing. The nuclear deal made Israel more secure. For now, they don't have to worry about getting nuked. The Iranian youth like Western freedoms and our goods, like clothes and electronics. Remember, as the old vanguard fades out, the new one moves in. The government of Iran is not as hard lined as it was a few years ago. Remember, five other nations are in on this deal and so far, Iran has upheld its end of the deal. Until and I say again until they violate the deal it's a good one for the Mideast also.

Home Gaming Sci + Tech Gear Lifestyle Movies + TV Contact Sci + Tech Trending Jeff Williams is the New King of Space (for U.S. Astronauts) August 24, 2016 Share Tweet Pin Reddit Stumble 520 days. That record, previously held by Scott Kelly, fell today as Jeff Williams became the U.S. astronaut record holder for most cumulative days in space. Williams’ third long-duration stay aboard the International Space Station is coming to an end. On September 6th, Williams is expected to have both feet planted back on Earth. He will have lived and worked in space for 534 days. Did You Know: The record for most days spent in space belongs to Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka. He has spent 879 days in space. It’ll be a long time before anyone approaches that record. Scott Kelly, who recently spent a full year in space, was in mission control today and congratulated Williams on his accomplishment. He did have one question for Williams, though. “Do you have another 190 days in you?” Kelly jokingly asks referring to a full-year aboard the ISS. “That question is not for me, that’s for my wife,” Williams quips back. .@StationCDRKelly congratulates @Astro_Jeff on breaking his record of 520 total days in space by a U.S. astronaut! https://t.co/y9BxzUWtgH — Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 24, 2016 Kelly goes on to congratulate Williams and Kate Rubins for their successful spacewalk earlier this month to install the International Docking Adapter. This new docking port will make manned trips by SpaceX and Boeing a reality. Kelly signs off by saying he hopes to see Williams the moment he touches down back on land on September 6th. As for Williams last two weeks in space? He won’t be lounging around waiting for the time to pass by. Williams and Rubins will head back outside the ISS for another spacewalk on September 1st. Here’s what they will be doing. Related Stunning Video Shows Where ISS Crew Work, Sleep and Snap Incredible Pictures Working on the port side of the orbiting complex’s backbone, or truss, Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins of NASA will retract a thermal radiator that is part of the station’s cooling system. The radiator is a backup that had been deployed previously as part of an effort to fix an ammonia coolant leak. They’ll also tighten struts on a solar array joint, and install the first of several enhanced high-definition television cameras that will be used to monitor activities outside the station, including the comings and goings of visiting cargo and crew vehicles. Jeff Williams’ history in space The first of four trips to space began in 2000. Williams served as flight engineer and lead spacewalker for the STS-101 mission aboard the space shuttle Atlantis. That mission delivered more than a ton of supplies to the ISS and prepared the station for the arrival of the Zvezda Service Module. Williams and James Voss conducted one spacewalk to install several new batteries, smoke detectors and cooling fans in the Zarya Control Module. They also installed handrails on the Unity node to aid future spacewalks. In 2006, Williams began his first six-month stay aboard the ISS with two other crewmembers (Expedition 13). Back then, the ISS only had two modules and three crewmembers. Today, the space station houses six crewmembers most of the time. He then served as flight engineer on Expedition 21 and commanded Expedition 22. And now he’s wrapping up another lengthy stint as part of the Expedition 48 crew. Here he is back in June keeping tabs on a pair of satellites dubbed SPHERES. Related NASA Pencils In New InSight Mars Mission Launch Date Williams is expected to be back on Earth on September 6th.

C. Bipindra Narendra Modi’s modernization drive has met with mixed success. Among the few signed orders are deals for Boeing Co. naval patrol aircraft and military helicopters, as well as for a clutch of warships to be built domestically. Photo: HT New Delhi: A fizzling boom in the shares of Zen Technologies Ltd, a designer of military simulators, shows how expectations of a rapid improvement in the nation’s armed forces are ebbing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined a plan of spending $150 billion to modernize the military and spur local defence production after taking office two years ago, stoking a surge in contractors such as Zen Technologies. The stock has fallen in 2016 as the pace of orders fell short of the expectations of the company and investors, according to managing director Ashok Atluri. “We can’t blame the government, but our expectations weren’t realized,” Atluri said in an interview. “We were communicating to shareholders that we expect the orders to come through by this time, and that didn’t happen.” Modi’s modernization drive has met with mixed success. Among the few signed orders are deals for Boeing Co. naval patrol aircraft and military helicopters, as well as for a clutch of warships to be built domestically. But a scaled-back purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from Dassault Aviation SA to bolster India’s ageing squadrons has stalled over price. Zen Technologies climbed 1,172% from when Modi took office in May 2014 to a record in January this year, but has since dropped about 37%. An index of four defence-related companies, including the simulator maker as well as BEML Ltd, Bharat Electronics Ltd and Astra Microwave Products Ltd, is down about 12% in 2016, compared with the S&P BSE 500 index’s 105 rise. Atluri said he’s seeking $120 million of domestic revenue in the next three years and double that from exports. The company, based in Hyderabad in the southern Indian state of Telangana, has an order book of Rs.100 crore and is in talks with at least four other countries for exports, according to Atluri. Zen Technologies reported a loss for the past four quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A new Indian defence procurement policy implemented in April that seeks to encourage local design and production should help speed up purchases, Atluri said. “There has been a little delay,” he said. “We’re confident the orders will come.” N.

About 64 percent of drone crashes are caused by technical issues, a study released today by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) says. The study is the first to dive beyond general finger pointing when drone crashes cause a stir. After a drone hit a British Airways plane en route to Heathrow Airport in April, Graham Wild and Glenn Baxter, both from the RMIT engineering department, and John Murray from Edith Cowan University, decided to conduct a study on just what caused most drone accidents. Related: This catapult crashes drones into raw pork to simulate what drone crashes do to the human body The researchers looked at 150 reported drone crashes worldwide, occurring between 2006 and 2016. The study showed that technical glitches were the guilty party in more than half the cases. Dividing those causes down even further, the team said that the loss of communication between the drone and the operator was the most common error. “Large transport category aircraft, such as those from a Boeing or Airbus, are required to have triple redundant systems for their communications,” Wild said. “But drones don’t and some of the improvements that have reduced the risks in those aircraft could also be used to improve the safety of drones.” Many drones have fail-safes that will automatically land the aircraft when it looses communication with the pilot — while that prevents “runaway” drones in many cases, landing automatically means there’s nothing to tell the drone what’s below. Many fail-safes also have to be calibrated, something that many novice drone users fail to do. An online poll in 2014, for example, showed that out of 774 DJI Phantom owners, a third of them had lost control at some point and 122 of them never actually saw their unmanned aircraft again. The results from the RMIT study led Wild to conclude that the regulations aren’t quite keeping up with the growth of drone technology. Lightweight drones aren’t expected to meet the same standards as their larger counterparts, yet they can still cause damage if they fly in a built-up area, he said. Another issue is that drone crashes are seldom reported unless they cause damage. Being able to analyze more crash data would help drive additional research to support government regulations. “Drones are being used for a wide range of tasks now and there are a lot of day-to-day activities that people want to use them for — delivering pizzas and packages, taking photos, geosurveying, firefighting, and search and rescue,” Wild said. “It’s essential that our safety regulations keep up with this rapidly growing industry.” New AI program could help drones avoid flying over big crowds Inexpensive follow drone Up&Go will take flight thanks to crowdfunding 5 tips for getting the best video footage from your drone flight Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

The team members are Robbie van Zyl, Parker Korn, Marcus DiBattista, Ian Buckalew, Andrew Walter, and Matt Harmon.   “Congratulations to this team that lived up to the school’s pursuit of excellence,” said Stacey Smith, McIntosh High School assistant principal.   The McIntosh MultiRotor Team stepped onto the flight line amid worsening weather conditions which included 15 mph winds and gusts of up to 20 mph. Weighing heavily on their minds were that these same conditions had just taken its toll on two other teams resulting in one lost drone and one crash landing.   Earlier in the day, a team from an aviation high school in Seattle sponsored by Boeing had performed an almost perfect mission, as had a team from a STEM high school in Minnesota. The MHS team knew it would all come down to how well they handled the pressure and the weather conditions during the next 45 minutes of their mission attempt.   The prestigious UAS4STEM contest was designed by the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA) to introduce students to the positive impact that drone technology could have on our future and to provide a program for students to learn about the technical intricacies of autonomous drones. The contest requires teams to build and customize a drone and to learn how to configure and program the drone to perform autonomous missions.   The drone could be programmed to fly missions on its own from a ground station computer connected by a radio telemetry uplink while the team monitored a live video feed transmitted by the drone to a screen on the ground. The challenge was to search and locate and identify hidden objects in a designated search area. Teams are judged on their ability to find all the objects and accurately report the GPS coordinates of each object.   The mission this year was life-or-death challenged based on finding a lost group of hikers in a remote area before a major storm would consume the area. Little did the organizers realize how realistic the premise of the contest would turn out to be.   A frontal storm system was approaching, preceded by winds exceeding 15 mph. Halfway through the day, a series of violent storms hit the area, creating very difficult conditions for the teams. According to Marcus DiBattista, the mission telemetry specialist, “We were prepared for the worst, and this was pretty much it.”   Back on the flight line, the team, composed of Robbie van Zyl, Parker Korn, Marcus DiBattista, Ian Buckalew, Andrew Walter and Matt Harmon, realized that the months of preparation and practice would come down to the next 45 minutes.   What they did not know at that time was that they had scored highest of all the teams on the flight readiness briefing — a presentation to judges of how they have modified the drone for the challenge and how they plan to approach the mission.   As their drone took off on its mission, the next storm was rolling in and the wind speed progressively increased and became more gusty. In the words of Ian Buckalew, the mission controller, “the worsening conditions and high winds required us to rewrite and upload parts of the mission program mid-flight to compensate for the wind.”   However, the entire mission could not be autonomous. During the process of locating the objects using the precision onboard GPS, Matt Harmon, the team pilot, had to take manual control of the drone. “The stormy conditions we experienced were more challenging from a pilot’s perspective than any thing I’ve flown in before,” Matt said.   Less than two minutes before the end of the allotted time, the team was still searching for the last “missing hiker.” Despite being very low on battery, they decided to make one final search attempt in an area they had not previously searched. Their excitement as they spotted the last missing hiker was sobered as they realized that they were critically low on battery and had less than two minutes before returning to base.   After tagging the location they sent a “return to base” command. Less than 100 yards from the base the drone’s battery reached a critical voltage level and the team initiated a controlled emergency landing. Fortunately, the drone was close enough to base to be recovered, and Parker Korn and Andrew Walter had less than 60 seconds to run out to recover the distressed drone.   The team had just completed a perfect mission and the first place in the contest came down to the young McIntosh team and a team of upperclassmen from Minnesota. In the end, when the final position of the objects were compared, the Minnesota team’s superb mission narrowly edged out the McIntosh team. On two of the objects the McIntosh team had missed the actual location by less than three meters.   According to Robbie van Zyl, the mission commander, “Our understanding of the technology was among the best but in the end it was the ability to work well together as a team of Chiefs that gave us a shot at winning the national title.”   Robert Grgetic, the McIntosh coach, was delighted with the final result. “This was an incredible experience to see these Chiefs compete against the best in the nation and to take second place. The whole season was incredible. I have seen this team learn things related to physics and engineering that most people will only be exposed to at engineering school.”   The team was one of 11 from middle and high schools across the country that competed in the first National UAS4STEM competition sponsored by the Academy of Model Aeronautics. The program is designed to encourage students to learn about the sUAS (drone) phenomenon through teamwork, competition, and success through STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). The competition was held at the International Aeromodeling Center in Muncie, Indiana on Aug. 20.   The team qualified for the national competition after winning their regional competition earlier this year. A total of 75 teams took part in regional competitions across the nation, with only 11 of them advancing to the national event.   The UAS4STEM competition is a search and rescue challenge. This year’s mission was for each team to use a sUAS to support a search and rescue mission for a small group of hikers who went missing in a remote area. All competitors were required to complete the sUAS ground school curriculum and work together to build a Quadzilla quadcopter.

UNHEAVY METAL: Ozztosh Luma S By Richard Bienstock | Photography by Massimo Gammacurta Brian Ostosh is not your typical guitar builder. For one thing, he’s never played guitar, though he is well versed in piano, marimba, flute, and piccolo. Furthermore, he spent much of his adult life working not in the MI industry but in aeronautics. After retiring a few years ago, he switched his focus to guitar making, a move that, in his estimation, is not as radical a shift as it may seem. “I’ve always been fascinated with building things,” he says. “When I was young it was surfboards, because I’m from Southern California. Then it was canoes. After that, aircraft.” The connecting thread? “They’re all hollow, lightweight structures,” he continues. “So when it came to the guitar, I just used that same knowledge, even though I had never built a guitar in my life.” Given his unique background, it’s hardly surprising that Ostosh’s guitars, which he builds under the company name Ozztosh, are untraditional. Take the model shown here, the Luma S, which, at first glance, bears a resemblance in shape, pickguard style, and pickup configuration to a Fender Stratocaster (hence the S in its designation). But the instrument’s brilliant reflective surface is the first hint that this is not an ordinary electric guitar. Rather, every Ozztosh creation boasts a body crafted from 6061 aluminum alloy, the same material, Ostosh says, that is used in the construction of Boeing aircraft. Of course, Ostosh is hardly the first builder to employ metals in his creations. But one of the more appealing aspects of his metal bodies, he says, is how thin he is able to cut them. “In my years in aeronautics I did a lot of molds for wings and wing tips and things where lightness is important,” he says. “So I learned how to cut very, very light parts. I translated that machining knowledge to guitar bodies to keep the weight down. One thing I realized from looking at other aluminum guitars is that when you’re coming from the world of wood construction, you design heavier pieces because you don’t realize how strong aluminum is. But the strength of aluminum is phenomenal compared to, say, maple.” In Ostosh’s guitars, the tops and backs are carved and partially routed from two 35-pound solid blocks of aircraft-grade 6061 aluminum billet and then joined together with machine screws. Inside, Ostosh explains, “a vertical wall keeps the top and back from collapsing,” adding that he has received a U.S. Patent for the contiguous sound chambers resulting from the hollowed-out body cavity. As for what the chambered aluminum body offers in terms of tone? “I would say clarity, accuracy, distinctiveness,” Ostosh says. “There’s no absorption. I would compare it to a xylophone versus a marimba: wood key verses metal key. When I was younger I played in a marching band, and you could hear the guy with the glockenspiel over the other 120 instruments. That’s the sound of metal.” Continuing the non-wood theme, the Luma S boasts a Moses Graphite neck and fretboard, while the pickguard is CNC-machined aluminum-alloy finished on this example in a blue-tinted polyurethane clear coat. Other features include a trio of Nordstrand NVS pickups (“their most basic duplication of the Stratocaster single-coils,” Ostosh says), a Super-Vee BladeRunner bridge, Sperzel Trim-Lok tuners, a Graph Tech Tusq nut, one master volume and two tone knobs, and a three-way selector switch. The guitar shown here boasts a stunning basic polish finish, though, Ostosh says, “We can put any finish on the aluminum. We’re experimenting with direct-embed coating, automotive paint, and laser etching. We can do things that are impossible with wood.” That customization applies to every facet of an Ozztosh instrument, from pickup and pickguard options to guitar necks, which Ostosh recently began crafting from the same billet aluminum used for his bodies. As for whether he believes tonewood purists will find his aluminum instruments appealing, Ostosh acknowledges that he is fighting traditionalists. “But when people hear the guitar first, they don’t know it’s metal until they pick it up, because the tonality, richness, and clarity are so incredible.” And in some areas, he continues, aluminum is clearly superior to wood. “Sustain, for one—it’s just incredible,” Ostosh says. “And stability—we send these things cross-country by FedEx, and when they’re picked up on the other end they’re still in tune. They’re rigid and they’re not affected by humidity. They’re ready to go at all times.” Ostosh is just getting started in his new career—at present he has built roughly 15 Ozztosh guitars in three different models—the Luma S, the Luma T (similar in shape to a Telecaster), and the Luma P-Bass. But he believes his guitar-building days will be somewhat limited, due to a degenerative eye disease that will eventually compromise his vision. “My plan is to get these designs out of my head, onto the computer, and into reality,” he says. To that end, he’s currently working on a new design. “I’m developing an amp head chassis,” he announces. “It’ll be billet aluminum, shiny on the outside, and will absorb the heat from the tube. Hopefully we’ll have that for the NAMM show next year. That’s the next super-project to come.” LIST PRICE: $5,995 Ozztosh Luma Guitars, ozztosh.com Want to read more from this issue?

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Ariane 5 sets new record via the lofting of Intelsat pair August 24, 2016 by Chris Bergin Arianespace successfully launched its fourth Ariane 5 mission of the year with the deployment of two more telecommunication satellites from the European Spaceport in Kourou on Thursday. The launch of Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 marked the heaviest launch to date for the European workhorse, with liftoff in the middle of the launch window at 22:17 UTC. Ariane 5 Launch: The Ariane 5 ECA (Cryogenic Evolution type A) – the most powerful version in the Ariane 5 range of rockets – was employed once again for this flight, a vehicle that is an improved version of the generic Ariane 5 launcher. Those improvements relate mainly to the structure of the Ariane 5, allowing for an increased thrust and ability to carry heavier payloads into orbit. See Also UPDATES Ariane 5 Dual Launch 65 Launch Vehicle Manuals (L2) Click here to Join L2 Designed to place payloads weighing up to 9.6 tonnes into GTO, this increased capacity allows the Ariane 5 ECA to handle dual launches of very large satellites. Given Arianespace now enjoys a full family of launch vehicles. With the introduction of Soyuz at the Spaceport in 2011, Arianespace’s family was joined by the lightweight Vega vehicle, following her successful debut in 2012. Arianespace will also be at the center of a new launch vehicle, the Ariane 6, which has been approved by the ESA members. This latest mission was designated Flight VA232 in Arianespace’s launcher family numbering system and was the 231st Ariane mission since this series of vehicles entered operation in 1979. T-0 targetted the start of a 45-minute launch window at the Ariane Launch Complex No. 3 (ELA 3). However, a boat in the range delayed the T-0 to the middle of the window. The Ariane 5 mission had a total payload lift performance of 10,735 kg – which is a new record upmass number for an Ariane 5 mission to Geostationary Transfer orbit – by 5 kg. This total included the two Intelsat satellites, as well as the launcher’s SYLDA dual-payload deployment system and the protective payload fairing. The launch profile for the Ariane 5 began with lift off around seven seconds after the ignition of the main stage cryogenic engine at T-0, with the two solid-propellant boosters ignited, enabling liftoff. The launcher first climbed vertically for 6 seconds, then rotated towards the East. It maintained an attitude that ensured the axis of the launcher remained parallel to its velocity vector, in order to minimize aerodynamic loads throughout the entire atmospheric phase, until the solid boosters are jettisoned. The fairing protecting the payload was jettisoned at T+200 seconds. Once this first part of the flight was completed, the onboard computers optimized the trajectory in real time, minimizing propellant consumption to bring the launcher first to the intermediate orbit targeted at the end of the main stage propulsion phase, and then the final orbit at the end of the flight of the cryogenic upper stage. The main stage splashed down off the coast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean (in the Gulf of Guinea). At orbital injection, the launcher will have attained a velocity of approximately 9,365 meters/second, and was at an altitude of 640 kilometers. Riding as the upper passenger in Ariane 5’s payload arrangement was Intelsat 33e. It was released approximately 28 minutes into the mission. The spacecraft was built by Boeing using a 702MP platform, and will operate from an orbital position of 60 deg. With an estimated liftoff mass of 6,600 kg, this bird was the 52nd satellite built by Boeing (or its predecessors) to be launched by Arianespace. Intelsat 33e is the second satellite in Intelsat’s next-generation, high-throughput Intelsat EpicNG series, joining Intelsat 29e – which was successfully lofted on an Ariane 5 mission performed in January. Once in orbit, Intelsat 33e will meet the broadband demand for carrier-grade telecom services, enterprise networks, aeronautical connectivity and media services. Sporting 20 C-band and 249 Ku-band transponders (36 MHz equivalent) and a 450 MHz Ka-band, the satellite is expected to serve in orbit for 15 years. The second passenger was also an Intelsat bird, marking what is now a 30-year association between Arianespace and the satellite company. In total, Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 were the 57th and 58th Intelsat satellites to be lofted by Arianespace, continuing a relationship that started with Intelsat 507’s launch in October 1983. Deployed from Ariane 5’s lower passenger position, Intelsat 36 was built by SSL (Space Systems/Loral) on a 1300 platform in Palo Alto, California. It was the 56th satellite using an SSL platform (and 50th with the 1300 configuration) to be launched by Arianespace. Set to serve for 15 years, the satellite includes 34 Ku-band transponders and 10 C-band transponders. The Ku-band payload was built to support MultiChoice, the leading direct-to-home platform in South Africa. The C-band payload spot beams cover high traffic telecom centers in Europe, Central Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia; and a C-band wide beam provides coverage over sub-Saharan Africa for data and media services. With a liftoff mass of around 3,253 kg, Intelsat 36 has a role in enhancing Intelsat’s media neighborhoods serving the South African and Indian Ocean region when starting operations from its 68.5 deg. East orbital position – where the satellite will be co-located with Intelsat 20, which was launched by Arianespace in August 2012. The satellite’s separation occurred approximately 41 minutes after liftoff – completing the Ariane 5 mission. “I would like to thank and congratulate the teams at Intelsat, Arianespace, and SSL who contributed to the successful launch of Intelsat 36,” said John Celli, president of SSL. “We are pleased to hear that the satellite, which is the second that we have delivered for Intelsat this year, is functioning according to plan.” (Images via Arianespace and Intelsat).

While 3D printing can be an appropriate solution for some problems, it isn’t for all of them, since manufacturers who need large parts can’t always make them with current 3D printing methods. Stratasys is looking to change that, demonstrating a new “infinite-build” system that could change the way various industries use 3D printing. Stratasys announced today that it’s Infinite-Build 3D Simulator will be showing off next-generation 3D printing techniques. Not a whole lot has changed, save for one major detail: Stratasys says this system takes traditional 3D printing and flips its side, giving manufacturers a vertical plane with which to craft larger items. With that in mind, it isn’t much of a surprise that companies like Boeing and Ford have shown interest in testing the system. Boeing is exploring if this system would be a good fit for producing low volume, lightweight parts for its planes, while Ford says it’s interested in seeing if the Stratasys Infinite-Build system is capable of producing larger-scale, automotive-grade parts, which wasn’t possible before due to the size of the some of the parts Ford was looking to produce. Assuming Stratasys’ partners can benefit from the application of this Infinite-Build system, this has some pretty exciting implications for the future of additive manufacturing, as companies will be able to make lightweight parts on demand and drop the cost of production in the process. Stratasys says it will have more details on this system in the coming months, so stay tuned.

When Pope Francis visited the U.S. Congress in September 2015, he boldly posed a moral challenge to his American hosts, asking: "Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society?" "Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money," he solemnly concluded. "Money that is drenched in blood." In this case, it's innocent Yemeni blood. During his almost eight years in office, President Obama has approved a jaw-dropping, record-breaking $110 billion in weapons sales to the repressive Saudi regime, all with Congressional backing. "In the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and stop the arms trade," Pope Francis said. Our lawmakers have failed miserably at heeding the Pope's call. Manufacturers such as Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and McDonnell Douglas have been pushing these sales to offset military spending cuts in the United States and Europe. These weapons manufacturers spend millions on lobbying, filling the campaign coffers of both Republicans and Democrats. - Advertisement - In addition to that lobbying power, U.S. officials were pressured to placate Saudi Arabia after the Obama administration made a deal with its adversary, Iran. That appeasement came in the form of a level and quality of arms exports that should've never been approved for a repressive regime with an atrocious human rights record. Saudi Arabia is the number one exporter of radical Islamic extremism on the planet. Fifteen of the 19 Sep. 11 hijackers were radicalized Saudi citizens. The regime oppresses religious minorities, women, LGBT people, and dissidents, while dozens of non-violent participants in their own Arab Spring protests face execution, usually by beheading. The Pentagon says that providing the Saudis with F-15s bombers, Apache helicopters, armored vehicles, missiles, and bombs supports Saudi Arabian defense missions and helps promote stability in the region. But since March 2015, the Saudis have being using these weapons offensively to intervene in neighboring Yemen. Their relentless onslaught has killed thousands of innocent civilians, decimated Yemen's infrastructure, and left more than 21 million people -- that's four out of five Yemenis -- desperately in need of humanitarian assistance. The United Nations has said that Saudi air strikes on civilian targets likely constitute war crimes and calls the situation in Yemen a "catastrophe." Despite this carnage, the Obama administration just announced an additional $1.15 billion in Saudi weapons sales. - Advertisement - In the week following that announcement, the Saudis bombed a Yemeni potato chip factory, a school, a residential neighborhood, and a Doctors Without Borders-run hospital. Most of the dead and wounded were women and children. But it's not too late for Congress to stop this madness. By law, they have 30 days after arms sales are announced to stop or modify the deals. And despite the overall apathetic response to the crisis in Yemen, not all members of Congress are turning a blind eye to the violence.

The airline posted a record profit of $1.52 billion in the year ended June 2016, and now it may be looking to add to its current order for eight 787 Dreamliners from Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). Qantas is scheduled to take delivery of its first Dreamliner late next year. Airline CEO Alan Joyce told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that the company would like to exercise its options and purchase rights for an additional 45 of the planes, but it depends: I’d like to order all of them if I can make a good return out of them. This aircraft’s technology is going to change the game for Qantas. The change will come at the expense of Airbus. Qantas currently flies 12 of the company’s A380 superjumbo jets, but recently deferred an order for eight more. Joyce said that Qantas likes the 12 A380s it has, but the airline does not see a need for any more. While that is good news for Boeing, the company also took a bit of hit on Monday when India’s Jet Airways asked the company to delay delivery of 10 787s from 2017 to 2019. The airline placed the order for the new planes in 2006, according to a report at the Puget Sound Business Journal. Jet plans to replace the 787s with 10 Boeing 777s that it has leased to Turkish Airlines and Etihad that will be coming off lease in the same time frame. The leases were made when the price of jet fuel was much higher than it is today, and the Indian airline believes that it can operate the older planes profitably in the current fuel price environment. The deferral is not expected to affect Boeing’s 12-per-month production of the 787, but it may have some impact on the company’s wavering plan to jump that number to 14 per month next year. As of mid-August, the aircraft maker has booked just 20% of the wide-body orders it had forecast for 2016.

Here's what it means for manufacturing.

Image: Stratasys Two new 3D printers from Stratasys could revolutionize aerospace and automobile manufacturing, the company announced Wednesday. The machines represent the next step in large-scale 3D printing for manufacturing, which experts say will completely change the field in the next decade. More about Innovation Our autonomous future: How driverless cars will be the first robots we learn to trust Google Fiber pivots: What it means for the future of gigabit internet IBM Watson's latest gig: Improving cancer treatment with genomic sequencing Subscribe to TechRepublic's Next Big Thing newsletter. The Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator and the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator expand the company's Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology across manufacturing to more efficiently build bigger, stronger, higher-quality parts. Stratasys also partnered with Boeing to define the requirements and specifications for the Infinite-Build to meet their needs for customized flight parts. Ford Motor Company is also exploring the machine's abilities for car manufacturing, Stratasys announced. Both the aerospace and automobile industries face pressure to continue to innovate and evolve—not only in performance, but in time to market, said Scott Sevcik, director of manufacturing platform development at Stratasys. Industry leaders are considering how to gain a competitive edge by offering a more differentiated passenger experience, whether in flight or on the road. SEE: 3D printing: The smart person's guide "These industries are looking strongly toward 3D printing as a critical enabler to meet those needs going forward," Sevcik said. "It offers the freedom of design, to be able to create parts that you could not make before with traditional processes." The new machines further Stratasys' efforts in large-scale manufacturing with 3D printing. In June, the company announced a partnership with Toyota division Daihatsu, offering 10 different 3D printed designs and patterns that owners can customize for the Copen two-door convertible. While 3D printing has been used on a small scale for race car parts in the past, these projects represent the industry's first move into more mainstream auto manufacturing. Rise of 3D printing manufacturing The adoption of industrial 3D printing continues to grow, with global spending on printers reaching nearly $11 billion in 2015. Spending is predicted to rise to about $27 billion by 2019, according to International Data Corporation. About two-thirds of US manufacturers are currently adopting 3D printing in some way, an April PricewaterhouseCoopers report found—roughly the same number as did in 2014. However, 51% are using it for prototyping and final products, compared to 35% two years ago. And, 52% of manufacturers expect 3D printing to be used for high-volume production in the next 3-5 years, compared to 38% in 2014. "3D printing is going to lead to as much change in manufacturing as the Industrial Revolution did over the last 300 years," said Rick Smith, co-founder and CEO of Fast Radius, an on-demand manufacturing company backed by UPS. "For a larger and larger percentage of manufacturers, it makes sense to open up the full range of complexity, and to produce in smaller, customized batches." At the same time, cost will drop and quality will rise, making it even more appealing for mass market production, Smith added. 3D printing is starting to disrupt two main areas of manufacturing, Smith said. The first is complexity: These machines can design parts with any geometry that cannot be made in any other way. This allows for part consolidation, which reduces weight. The second disruption is in the supply chain: The ability to print customizable parts on demand enables zero inventory. "You can shift from mass production followed by mass warehousing to on demand production in smaller quantities with customization," Smith said. With more major companies investing in this technology, we can expect to see a dramatic acceleration of 3D printing adoption in industrial production in the next year, Smith said, and a complete change in production cycles in the next five to 10 years. Large, customizable parts Aerospace was one of the leading early adopters of 3D printing in manufacturing, due to the technology's ability to increase performance outcomes and reduce weight, Smith said. Now, many of the applications from the aerospace industry are bleeding into the automotive industry, where weight reduction and performance outcomes are also significant concerns. The new Stratasys Infinite-Build produces large, customizable tools and production parts designed for accuracy, repeatability, and speed. "We're really going after the ability to do large, lightweight, thermoplastic parts with better mechanical processes on a repeatable basis," Sevcik said. Applications include customized interior panels for aircrafts and dashboards for cars. The machine literally flips FDM on its side, allowing you to 3D print on a vertical plane instead of horizontally, without size limits. It also operates at a speed 10 times faster than previously possible, Sevcik said. It can change in and out different types of material, with process control embedded in the system. Meanwhile, the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator enables automation of high-value composite parts for the aerospace and automotive industries, but also for industries such as sporting goods. The machine includes an 8-axis motion system, which uses precise, directional material placement to build strength while reducing or eliminating support strategies—rare for this type of manufacturing, Sevcik said. This machine is aimed at increasing the growth of composite parts, making them lighter and more fuel efficient. Stratasys partnered with Siemens to integrate extrusion technology with Siemens Industry Motion Control and Siemens PLM Software, hoping to ease the labor-intensive processes and remove size limitations for composite part creation. "The ability to print on demand where you need it, when you need it, is a major driver for these industries and how they look at 3D printing," Sevcik said. Both printers and other tools will be on display at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago from September 12-14, 2016. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers On Wednesday, Stratasys announced two new 3D printers to be used for manufacturing in the aerospace and automotive industries, with Boeing and Ford testing applications for them. 3D printing's use in industrial manufacturing continues to grow, as about two-thirds of US manufacturers are currently adopting 3D printing in some way, with more than half using it for prototyping and final products this year. New 3D printing machines can reduce the weight and increase the performance of parts for planes and cars by consolidating composite parts. Stay up to date on all 3D printing news.

Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Jonathan Timm Aug 24, 2016 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Earlier this year, at the encouragement of President Obama, the Department of Labor finalized the most significant update to the federal rules on overtime in decades. The new rules will more than double the salary threshold for guaranteed overtime pay, from about $23,000 to $47,476. Once the rules go into effect this December, millions of employees who make less than that will be guaranteed overtime pay under the law when they work more than 40 hours a week. Unsurprisingly, some business lobbies and conservatives disparaged the rule as unduly burdensome. But pushback also came from what might have been an unexpected source: a progressive nonprofit called the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). “Doubling the minimum salary to $47,476 is especially unrealistic for non-profit, cause-oriented organizations,” U.S. PIRG said in a statement. “[T]o cover higher staffing costs forced upon us under the rule, we will be forced to hire fewer staff and limit the hours those staff can work—all while the well-funded special interests that we're up against will simply spend more.” Though many nonprofits supported the new overtime rules, PIRG was not alone. (U.S. PIRG declined multiple interview requests for this article.) Over 290,000 comments were posted to Regulations.gov, many of them from nonprofits taking issue with the rule, including Habitat for Humanity, the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, and the YMCA of the USA. These responses expose a gap between the values that many nonprofits hold and the way they treat their own staffs. There’s no doubt that nonprofits today face serious financial difficulties and constraints, but do they have no choice but to demand long, unpaid hours of their employees? Putting questions of fairness aside, is their treatment of their workers limiting their effectiveness? * * * The answers have a lot to do with how nonprofits survive in an economy that’s geared primarily toward profit. Many nonprofit organizations stare down a shared set of challenges: In a 2013 report, the Urban Institute surveyed over 4,000 nonprofits of a wide range of types and sizes across the continental U.S. It found that all kinds of nonprofits struggled with delays in payment for contracts, difficulty securing funding for the full cost of their services, and other financial issues. Recent years have been especially hard for many nonprofits. Most have annual budgets of less than $1 million, and those budgets took a big hit from the recession, when federal, municipal, and philanthropic funding dried up. On top of that, because so many nonprofits depend on government money, policy changes can cause funding priorities to change, which in turn can put nonprofits in a bind. Heather Iliff, the president and CEO of an association called Maryland Nonprofits, says that she has seen a number of funders suddenly shift the requirements of their funding in response to a new trend, leaving organizations scrambling to adapt. “On the one hand it’s positive that the government is trying to look at what works and fund what works, but they tend to be categorical and abrupt in their shifts, without providing the necessary transitional supports,” Iliff says. Iliff has seen that scramble to meet funding demands lead to bizarre and unproductive decisions. An employee of one agency that serves adults with significant developmental disabilities told her that its funders recently ordered it to provide clients with a number of hours “in the community,” as opposed to time spent on the in-house services it normally would have administered. But the funders did not provide guidance on how to do that, and the agency’s best option was to bus disabled adults to a mall’s food court just to satisfy the new requirement. All of this is particularly difficult for human-services nonprofits that survive mostly on Medicaid funding. Homeless shelters, for example, don’t charge for their services, and thus can’t raise prices when their funding is cut. (These types of agencies have a longer period to adjust to the new overtime rules.) And when faced with funding cuts, many nonprofits have no place to turn but their own payrolls. The pressure from funders to tighten budgets and cut costs can produce what researchers call the “nonprofit starvation cycle.” The cycle starts with funders’ unrealistic expectations about the costs of running a nonprofit. In response, nonprofits try to spend less on overhead (like salaries) and under-report expenses to try to meet those unrealistic expectations. That response then reinforces the unrealistic expectations that began the cycle. In this light, it’s no surprise that so many nonprofits have come to rely on unpaid work. Strangely, though nonprofits are increasingly expected to perform like businesses, they do not get the same leeway in funding that government-contracted businesses do. They don’t have nearly the bargaining power of big corporations, or the ability to raise costs for their products and services, because of tight controls on grant funding. “D.C. is full of millionaires who contract with government in the defense field, and they make a killing, and yet if you’re a nonprofit, chances are you aren’t getting the full amount of funding to cover the cost of the services required,” Iliff said. “Can you imagine Lockheed Martin or Boeing putting up with a government contract that didn’t allow for overhead?” * * * When faced with dwindling funding, one response would be to cut a program or reduce the number of people an organization serves. But nonprofit leaders have shown themselves very reluctant to do that. Instead, many meet financial challenges by squeezing more work out of their staffs without a proportional increase in their pay: The Urban Institute report found that most nonprofits choose to cut salaries, benefits, and other costs long before scaling back their operations. “There is this feeling that the mission is so important that nothing should get in the way of it,” Elizabeth Boris, one of the Urban Institute report’s authors, says. The nonprofits that opposed the new rules expressed as much in the comments they submitted on Regulations.gov. One nonprofit’s human-resources director said the rule would result in “fewer services being effectively delivered to the population we serve, not to mention the deep financial impact that it will have on our agency to try to fund overtime at that level.” Said another, “Any increase in funds that have to go to salaries will cause a decrease in funds available to assist the elderly, which will result in causing them additional hardships.” “As a manager of a non-profit organization, this proposed rule would make it very clear in deciding whether it would be financially possible to find a way to stay in business,” one comment on the rule read. “The answer is no.” These nonprofit employees are saying that their operations depend on large numbers of their lowest-paid staff working unpaid overtime hours. One way to get  to that point would be to face a series of choices between increased productivity on the one hand and reduced hours, increased pay, or more hiring on the other, and to choose more productivity every time. That some nonprofits have done this speaks to a culture that can put the needs of staff behind mission-driven ambitions. A number of forces much larger than any single nonprofit have allowed the present situation to take shape. In the 1970s, 62 percent of full-time, salaried workers qualified for mandatory overtime pay when they worked more than 40 hours in a week. Today, because the overtime rules have not had a major update since then (until this one), only 7 percent of workers are covered, whether they work in the nonprofit sector or elsewhere. In other words, U.S. organizations—nonprofit or otherwise—have been given the gift of a large pool of laborers who, as long as they clear a relatively low earnings threshold and do tasks that meet certain criteria, do not have to be paid overtime. Unsurprisingly, many nonprofits have taken advantage of that pool of free work. (For-profit companies have too, but they also have the benefit of being more in control of their revenue streams.) Boris says that nonprofits like PIRG, for example, have a tradition of forcing employees to work long, unpaid hours—especially their youngest staff. “There’s a culture that says, ‘Young people are paying their dues. It’s okay for them to be paid for fewer hours than they’re actually working because it’s in the effort of helping them grow up and contribute to something greater than they are,’” Boris says. Mary Beth Hastings, who has more than 20 years of experience working in the world of global-health organizations, has witnessed this in a variety of workplaces throughout her career. “Too often, I have seen the passion for social change turned into a weapon against the very people who do much—if not most—of the hard work, and put in most of the hours,” Hastings recently wrote on her blog. “Because they are highly motivated by passion, the reasoning goes, they don’t need to be motivated by decent salaries or sustainable work hours or overtime pay.” But they probably do. A 2011 survey of more than 2,000 nonprofit employees by Opportunity Knocks, a human-resources organization that specializes in nonprofits, in partnership with Jessica Word, an associate professor of public administration at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, found that half of employees in the nonprofit sector may be burned out or in danger of burnout. The survey had some methodological limitations—its sample wasn’t as representative as the researchers would’ve hoped—but Word told me that she believes employees at nonprofits are uniquely stretched. “These are highly emotional and difficult jobs,” she said, adding, “These organizations often have very high rates of employee turnover, which results from a combination of burnout and low compensation.” Despite the dearth of research, Word’s findings don’t appear to be unusual: A more recent study of nonprofits in the U.S. and Canada found that turnover, one possible indicator of burnout, is higher in nonprofits than in the overall labor market. Yet for all their hours and emotional labor, nonprofit employees generally don’t make much money. A 2014 study by Third Sector New England, a resource center for nonprofits, found that 43 percent of nonprofit employees in New England were making less than $28,000 per year—far less than a living wage for families with children in most cities in the United States, and well below the national median income of between $40,000 and $50,000 per year. (For comparison, about a quarter of American workers earn less than $28,000 per year.) Until the new overtime rules kick in, many of those workers could be working extra hours without any extra pay. Why would nonprofit workers be willing to stay in jobs where they are underpaid, or, in some cases, accept working conditions that violate the spirit of the labor laws that protect them? One plausible reason is that they are just as committed to the cause as their superiors, whose decision-making can prioritize an organization’s values above all else. Another possible explanation is that because the job market is so difficult, they have no better options. But it also might be that some nonprofits exploit gray areas in the law to cut costs. For instance, only workers who are labelled as managers are supposed to be exempt from overtime, but many employers stretch the definition of “manager” far beyond its original intent. Low-paid workers who do not have executive decision-making power and do not manage a staff, according to the Department of Labor’s criteria, shouldn’t be classified as exempt, but some employers put them in positions that are nominally managerial to escape overtime regulations. And even regardless of these designations, the emotionally demanding work at many nonprofits is sometimes difficult to shoehorn into a tidy 40-hours-a-week schedule. Consider Elle Roberts, who was considered exempt from overtime restrictions and was told not to work more than 40 hours a week when, as a young college grad, she worked at a domestic-violence shelter in northwest Indiana. Doing everything from home visits to intake at the shelter, Roberts still ignored her employer’s dictates and regularly worked well more than 40 hours a week providing relief for women in crisis. Yet she was not paid for that extra time. Roberts once responded to a call from a woman who needed help escaping her apartment while her attacker was out. When Roberts arrived, the battered woman clung to her and asked her to listen to a recording of the sounds of fighting and of the woman screaming and crying. Roberts joined her in prayer, helped her move her things to a new apartment, went back to the agency, locked herself in the bathroom, and sobbed. On days like that, Roberts wanted to get therapy, but knew that she couldn’t afford it. “If I had gotten paid for all the hours I was working, even at my base rate, I would have jumped at the opportunity to seek care to make sense of what I’ve experienced on the job,” Roberts says. “But I wasn’t making enough to pay for anything more than my basic needs.” When reached by phone, Roberts’s former employer said that staff are not allowed to work overtime, but that they do work extra hours voluntarily without recording the time, such as for self-directed study on how to better serve clients. When hours run long due to travel or other circumstances, the employer said, staff can adjust their hours for the rest of the week to make up the difference. But according to Roberts, this would have meant asking for schedule changes almost every week, which would not have been acceptable in the organization's culture. “The unspoken expectation is that you do whatever it takes to get whatever it is done for the people that you’re serving,” she says. “And anything less than that, you’re not quite doing enough.” It isn’t clear how common Roberts’s experience is. The Department of Labor bases its enforcement actions on complaints, which makes it hard to track violations, says Catherine Ruckelshaus, the general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy organization. With the difficulty of the job market, the decline of unions, and the culture of self-sacrifice in nonprofit work, very few employees are willing to come forward to file a complaint against their employer. This means that there’s no way to know how many nonprofit employees are working long, unpaid overtime hours when they shouldn’t be. Still, Ruckelshaus says, “Nonprofit workers have more protection than they think or than even perhaps their employers think. But because the law isn’t crystal clear … there’s a gray area and that’s been exploited by some of these nonprofits and that’s created a culture where workers don’t think they’re covered.” * * * It’s certainly the case that nonprofits face considerable challenges, but it doesn’t seem like every organization is making a good-faith effort to do right by their employees when they decide how to respond to those challenges. And, setting aside the issue of fair pay, many wonder whether getting the most work out of staff for the least possible cost is efficient or sustainable. Work-life balance is particularly relevant when employees’ work is emotionally taxing and poorly rewarded, and turnover for any organization is notoriously costly. Nonprofits that don’t take this seriously may be shooting themselves in the foot. Mary Beth Hastings suggests that if nonprofits truly care about the well-being of their staffs, one easy place to start is simply to write higher salaries into budget proposals. Likewise, government and philanthropic funders could be a lot wiser in how they dole out money: Scarce public-service dollars can impose a state of financial stress on the people who put them to use. Indeed, many nonprofits have come out in support of the new overtime rules, even while acknowledging the challenges of following them. Stuart Mitchell, the CEO of a human-services nonprofit called PathStone, wrote in an op-ed that “paying a livable wage is the right thing to do not only for our deeply committed employees, but also for the participants that rely on our services.” And representatives of 150 social-justice organizations signed a letter stating their support for the new rules, writing, “It is time to revisit the idea that working for the public good should somehow mean requiring the lowest-paid among us to support these efforts by working long hours, many of which are unpaid.” More broadly, the Human Services Council of New York argues that the sector should call on the government to expand funding for nonprofits to maintain their level of services with increased pay.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What's Really Going On in North Carolina's Gubernatorial Race? David A. Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

Toggle navigation    Home Pakistan Islamabad Punjab Sindh Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Balochistan Gilgit Bultistan Azad Jammu & Kashmir World Business Sport Life & Style Opinion Blogs Features Today's Paper E-PAPER Archives F-16’s manufacturing in India to affect Pakistan’s aerial defence By: agencies 24-Aug-16 Top News LPG distributors to protest against police today   23-Nov-16 205     LAHORE: Eminent speakers urge govt to invest on education, R&D 23-Nov-16 231 LAHORE: The 14th National Symp ... WASHINGTON: An American global security and aerospace company's offer to shift all of its F-16 manufacturing to India could give New Delhi partial control, along with the US, over which countries are able to purchase the jets and spare, according to a media report. The report by Bloomberg News comes as a Congressional report showed a 73 percent decline in US aid to Pakistan since 2011 due to deterioration of Pakistan-US ties following the killing of Osama bin Laden in a commando raid in Abbottabad. Bloomberg News said Lockheed Martin Corp’s proposal to make India hub for F-16s "comes with an added benefit for Prime Minister Narendra Modi: A strategic win against nuclear rival Pakistan."  Such a move may allow India to choke off key supplies to Pakistan, which has relied on F-16s as its main aerial defence for decades. “Some components may be produced only in India," Abhay Paranjape, Director of Business Development at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, was quoted as stating while talking about the company’s F-16 proposal. Asked whether Pakistan would still be able to source F-16 jets or parts elsewhere under the arrangement, Paranjape said questions about foreign military sales policies should be referred to the US government. Roger Cabiness, a spokesman for the US Department of Defense, in turn referred questions on the sale of F-16 spare parts to Lockheed, Bloomberg News said. The strategic element is a key selling point as Lockheed pushes to win an order that may exceed 100 fighter jets, part of Modi’s plan to spend $150 billion on the armed forces and create jobs under his “Make-in-India" policy, the report said. A deal would breathe new life into the F-16, an older model than the stealth F-35 warplane, and further boost US-India defense ties at the expense of Pakistan, it said. “What we are doing is putting India as the center of the supply base," Randall Howard, Lockheed Martin’s aeronautics business development director, said on Aug. 4 in New Delhi. “Today, there is no potential Pakistan sale." Amid deteriorating Islamabad-Washington ties in recent years, Congress in May refused to give subsidies for Pakistan to buy new F-16s, prompting it to consider buying used ones from Jordan instead. The US this month withheld another $300 million in military aid to Pakistan over its alleged failure to take action against terrorists carrying out attacks on American troops in neighboring Afghanistan. Nafees Zakaria, a spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Office, declined to answer questions about Lockheed Martin’s F-16 proposal, as did Nungsanglemba Ao, a spokesman for India’s Defence Ministry, according to the report. The company’s overtures to India will prompt Pakistan to look more to China and Russia for military hardware, Najam Rafique, Director at Islamabad’s Institute of Strategic Studies, was cited as stating by Bloomberg News. “Pakistan is diversifying its options," he said. Competition for the India jet order is fierce, the report noted.  Lockheed Martin’s rivals such as Boeing Co. and Saab AB are all offering to shift some production to India as part of their bids to replenish India’s aging fleet. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade, it said. Modi last year scaled back an earlier deal with Dassault Aviation SA, opting to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets off the shelf instead of building 126 in India after negotiations hit repeated delays. That effort has since stalled over price, providing an opportunity to other jet-makers to step in. It’s unclear when a decision will be made. Lockheed’s proposal attempts to turn its greatest weakness - the fact that Pakistan also flies F-16s - into a main reason for India to acquire the jet, according to the report. “Since India would house the only existing production line, it would be able to deny Pakistan any further platforms or also have influence on Pakistan Air Force logistics," Pushan Das, who follows military modernisation at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, was quoted as stating. Lockheed Martin, which is winding down F-16 production in the US, has successfully sold the jet for decades. The proposed facility in India would provide much-needed highly skilled jobs as Modi heads into several important State-level elections in 2017, Bloomberg News said. “We are not looking at just assembling India’s F-16 here," Lockheed Martin’s Paranjape said. “We are looking at establishing a complete manufacturing base ecosystem." The report said it was still unclear which firm will win India’s lucrative fighter jet contract, citing some analysts as dismissing the F-16 as a dated “fourth generation" platform opposed by the Indian Air Force because it won’t have major upgrades in the future. Others like Georgetown University associate professor C. Christine Fair have suggested New Delhi is unlikely to get a more advanced fighter jet made in India because of difficulties with transferring state-of-the-art technology. While many obstacles remain, an agreement with Lockheed Martin would cement closer ties between the nations if the US government doesn’t prevent the transfer of advanced radar or avionics technologies, according to Anit Mukherjee, an Assistant Professor at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If this deal was to happen - and that’s a big if - then it will be a big plus for US-India relations and a significant indicator of the transformation in the defence relationship," he said. “If this deal goes through, and the US is honest about tech transfer, then it has the potential to really build up India’s military-industrial base." Meanwhile, the report about heavy decline in US security assistance to Pakistan since 2011, was prepared for the US Congress by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). It covers both military and economic assistance given between 2002 and 2015 as well as those earmarked for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. It also shows a 53 percent decrease in economic assistance since 2011. Security aid fell 73 percent from nearly $1.3 billion in 2011 to $343 million in 2015. Economic aid declined from nearly $1.2 billion in 2011 to $ 561 million in 2015, the report said. The cancelled $ 300 million payments were in the form of Coalition Support Fund (CSF) under which Pakistan has received over $14 billion since 2002. The CSF accounted for “as much as one-fifth of Pakistan’s total military expenditures” from 2002 to 2014, said the CRS, a US government news and analysis service for Congress. The CSF is meant to reimburse US-allied nations “for their operational and logistical support of US-led counterterrorism operations”. The CRS data shows that CSF accounts for 43 per cent of $ 32.2 billion worth of US government financial transfers to Pakistan from 2002 to 2015. Economic aid comprises 33 per cent of transfers at $10.6 billion followed by 24 per cent in security aid at $ 7.6 billion. The CRS report, however, shows that Pakistan has or still is in the process of receiving nearly $1.2 billion worth of weapon systems from the US since 2001. This includes, eight P—3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft worth $ 474 million and 20 AH—1F Cobra attack helicopters at $48 million. Pakistan is also getting mid-life update kits for 60 F—16A/B fighter jets already in its inventory at a cost of $ 892 million, of which the US paid $ 477 million through FMF. Since 2001, Pakistan has paid or is still paying $2.5 billion for US arms. This includes big-ticket items such as $1.43 billion for 18 new F—16C/D Block 52 Fighting Falcon combat aircraft and additional armaments for the aircraft at a cost of $629 million.

A contract to this effect was signed between the government and Boeing. The investment comes after recently released 2016 Defence White Paper confirmed the importance of the New Zealand Defence Force having new capabilities. The latest investment in new defence capabilities will help the country to cope with the realities of a complex and changing strategic environment. With this investment, the New Zealand Defence Force will be able to operate across a broad spectrum of geographic and operating environments. New Zealand Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee said that underwater surveillance capability deters interference with the sea lines of communication that New Zealand and many of its friends rely on for trade purposes. Brownlee further added: “Knowing what is happening underwater is integral to monitoring submarine activity. “This is particularly important in the Asia-Pacific region which is home to two-thirds of the world’s submarines.” The Orion aircraft are expected to retire from service in the mid-2020s. "The Orion aircraft are expected to retire from service in the mid-2020s." A replacement for the old and less reliable Orion aircraft will be chosen as part of Defence on the Future Air Surveillance Capability project. Work under the project to select replacement for Orion has already commenced. Nearly 25% of the value of the contract is being spent with New Zealand businesses Safe Air, Beca and Marops.

Four-Month High Qantas shares jumped as much as 5.3 percent in Sydney to their highest intraday level in more than four months after the carrier reported an 84 percent jump in annual net income. Joyce has reversed losses after cutting thousands of jobs and dropping unprofitable routes as part of a A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) transformation program. The airline is working on the first destination for its 787 and will announce the route at the end of this year. Options include Melbourne-Dallas, Perth-London and Brisbane-Dallas, Joyce said in the interview. Qantas uses the A380 to fly to Dallas from Sydney, a 16-hour journey that is one of the world’s longest commercial flights. The Dreamliner will allow Qantas to bypass many of the traditional airline hubs, Joyce said. Joyce emphasized the importance of making money with the aircraft on an earlier call with reporters. "We have to demonstrate we can make money out of the eight we have,” he said. “Once we’ve done that, we’ll be comfortable in ordering more." With Joyce seeking more 787s, the airline’s fractured relationship with the A380 superjumbo doesn’t look like mending. Joyce reiterated in the interview that Qantas doesn’t need the remaining eight A380s on order. Qantas operates its 12 A380s on routes like Sydney or Melbourne to London via Dubai, and to Hong Kong, Dallas and Los Angeles. “The 12 we have today actually have a very good use," Joyce said. "They operate at big hub airports with slot restrictions. We see a use for 12. We don’t see a use for more than 12. We don’t see a need for those last eight aircraft."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE According to a new market report published by Transparency Market Research Directed Energy Weapons Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2014 - 2020, global directed energy weapons market was valued at USD 1.41 billion in 2013, growing at a CAGR of 20.8% from 2014 to 2020 to account for USD 5.25 billion in 2020. Browse the Full Report at: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/directed-energy-weapons-market.html The directed energy weapons market is primarily driven by the increasing requirements for high precision weapons during riot control, political disputes and various urban warfare applications globally. The directed energy weapons are demanded by various governments focusing on modernizing their military forces to assimilate them with changing urban warfare tactics. Moreover, directed energy weapons offer less expensive alternatives to ballistic and cruise missile threats as compared to their expensive and conventional counterparts. These factors boost the industry to focus on the development of these weapons. In terms of technology, the high energy lasers (HEL) segment held the highest revenue share in 2014. HEL is followed by high power microwaves (HPM) segment, which is also a observing significant growth globally. In terms of deployment, the naval based DEW systems are analyzed to witness fastest growth globally, registering a CAGR of 22% from 2014 to 2020. Furthermore, the non-lethal directed energy weapons are expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.4% over the forecast period from 2014 to 2020. Geographically, North America is estimated to be leading the global directed energy weapons market with more than 50% market revenue share in 2013 and is expected to continue its dominance throughout the forecast period. The factors responsible for the dominance of the North America are escalating demand for riot control weapons and rising demands from land, air and naval based advanced weapons systems. The U.S. held the largest market for directed energy weapons in the world and is expected to continue its leading position throughout the forecast period. Asia Pacific is estimated to be the fastest growing region in the directed energy weapons market growing with a CAGR of 25.8% from 2014 to 2020.

The former record holder, with 520 days, was Scott Kelly. As of this Wednesday, that record has been surpassed by current International Space Station occupant Jeffrey Williams. Williams will return to Earth on September 6th, leaving the record at 534 days. The record was passed on in a very civil manner. Kelly greeted Williams from NASA Mission Control. Apart from a joke about ‘how would you feel about staying in orbit 190 more days?’ the conversation was all congratulations. Kelly made headlines last year by becoming the NASA astronaut with the most days logged in space. A veteran of four space flights and three EVAs (totalling 18 hours and 20 minutes walking in space), Kelly concluded his career as an astronaut with an astonishing year-long period up at the ISS. An identical twin, Kelly’s time aboard the station was used in part to study the genetic effects of spaceflight on the human body. He and his brother Mark remain the only siblings to have travelled to space. Selected for NASA’s astronaut program in 1996, Jeffrey Williams has witnessed the rapidly changing face of spaceflight firsthand. During his six-month mission to the ISS in 2006, he took more photographs than any other astronaut. You can see him wielding his faithful camera yet again during his current mission in NASA’s celebration of U.S. National Parks. Williams has been a part of four EVAs, totalling 25 hours and seven minutes of space walks — including last week’s installation of the new dock to house Boeing and SpaceX flights to the ISS. He was also a part of the first live Twitter connection with the ISS; social media has become a huge part of how astronauts and cosmonauts communicate with people back home, and has spurred on massive interest about space among regular citizens, making Williams a witness to a truly formative moment in the history of the ISS. Of course, the record, however impressive must be taken with a grain of salt. The most time in space is held in the majority by cosmonauts who manned Space Station Mir for staggering periods of time. With his new record of 534 days, once he has returned to Earth, Williams will rank 14th on the list of people with the most time spent in space. Gennady Padalka holds humanity’s record, and has logged 879 days in space, between both Mir and the ISS. The U.S. record will also not be Williams’ for long. Astronaut Peggy Whitson is likely heading up to the ISS in November, and her six month mission would set her over Williams’ own record in turn. Whitson currently sits fourth in the NASA rankings for cumulative days in space, with 377 We at Digital Journal look forward to the Williams-Whitson exchange sure to follow.

Image credit: Shutterstock Don Reisinger From PCMag Contributing Writer Instagram Instagram Adds Live Video With a Twist Make More Happen Google Will Tell You How Crowded Places Are in Real Time Silicon Valley Trump Won't Destroy Silicon Valley August 25, 2016 This story originally appeared on PCMag Did you buzz your neighbor's shrubs or crash into your garage with a drone? Good news: it might not be your fault! Researchers at Australia's RMIT University's School of Engineering and Edith Cowan University found that many drone accidents are due to the gadgets themselves rather than human error. Dr. Graham Wild and Dr. Glenn Baxter from RMIT and John Murray of ECU studied 150 civil incidents involving drones and found that 64 percent occurred due to technical problems.   The study, published in the journal Aerospace, pointed to "broken communications links" between the operator and the drone. As a result, the researchers think commercial aircraft-type regulations should be applied to the communications systems of drones. "Large transport category aircraft, such as those from a Boeing or Airbus, are required to have triple redundant systems for their communications," Dr. Wild said in a statement. "But drones don't and some of the improvements that have reduced the risks in those aircraft could also be used to improve the safety of drones." Exceptions can be made for drones under 55 pounds, he said, though pilots should have licenses. "It's essential that our safety regulations keep up with this rapidly growing industry," Dr. Wild argued. The team started its research after reports of a drone collision at Heathrow Airport, though authorities later said it was "not a drone incident." Still, collisions do occur (see the video below), hitting everything from ferris wheels and the Empire State Building to the White House lawn (and there are certainly some dumbasses flying drones who should not be).

Advertisement Orders for business equipment climbed in July for a second month, advancing the most since January and indicating U.S. companies are becoming less reluctant to invest. Bookings for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft rose 1.6%, exceeding the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey, after a 0.5% June gain, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. Demand for all durable goods -- items meant to last at least three years -- rebounded 4.4%, the most since October. The back-to-back increases in capital goods bookings, the first since January 2015, signal sales of such equipment will pick up after shipments weakened for a third straight month in July. Steadier orders would mark an improvement in demand for equipment that Federal Reserve policy makers have described as “soft.” “As the decline in business investment slowly wanes, demand should accelerate and durable goods orders should resume their upward trend,” economists at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. wrote in an Aug. 22 note.

August 25, 2016 by PLANT STAFF Topics General Technology Industries Manufacturing Tags Ballard EAR99 export Fuel-cell manufacturing Protonex VANCOUVER — Ballard Power Systems’ Protonex subsidiary has been notified by the US Department of Commerce that its fuel cell propulsion systems are designated as EAR99 (Export Administration Regulations 99) compliant. The company, based in Southborough, Ma., said the designation creates a path for commercial export and deployment in a variety of civilian unmanned vehicle applications. Advantages over combustion engines include: • Greater reliability than small internal combustion engines (ICE); • Lower total cost of ownership than small ICE; • Lower noise signature than small ICE; • Lower heat signature than small ICE; • Longer operating range than batteries, greater than three times; and • Lower weight than batteries. Fuel cell-powered unmanned vehicles are used for surveying and monitoring power transmission lines, railroad facilities, mining operations, oil and gas pipelines and platforms along with other critical infrastructure. Protonex has worked with the US military on unmanned vehicle applications, and it provided Insitu – a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Co. – with a prototype fuel cell propulsion module for use in its ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle.

An Ariane 5 rocket blasted off from French Guiana at 6.16 pm (EDT) and both the Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 satellites were deployed within 42 minutes. The rocket carried a record payload of 10,735 kgs into orbit. Moments later Intelsat confirmed that they had received signals confirming a successful launch and deployment of the pair. Intelsat 33e, built by Boeing, will continue its geostationary transfer orbit and eventually be placed at 60 degrees East, and serve Africa, Europe, the Mid-East and Asia. Intelsat 36, built by Space Systems/Loral will eventually be located at 68.5 degrees East and serve its key client MultiChoice as well as continue to provide capacity over the Indian Ocean regions.

Tech issues cause most drone accidents by Staff Writers Melbourne, Australia (SPX) Aug 26, 2016 File image. World-first research has found technical problems rather than operator errors are behind the majority of drone accidents, leading to a call for further safeguards for the industry. Researchers Dr Graham Wild and Dr Glenn Baxter from RMIT University's School of Engineering, along with John Murray from Edith Cowan University, completed the first examination of more than 150 reported civil incidents around the world involving drones, or Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The study showed technical problems were the cause of 64 per cent of the incidents, which occurred between 2006 and 2016. Wild said their findings illustrated the need for further airworthiness requirements for RPAS vehicles, as well as the mandatory reporting of all accidents or incidents. "Understanding what happens to drones, even those that don't cause damage to people or property, is essential to improve safety," he said. The research came about after an incident earlier this year involving a drone and a British Airways Airbus A320 at Heathrow Airport. Recently published in the journal Aerospace, the study found that in most cases, broken communications links between the pilot and the RPAS were the cause of the incident, leading the researchers to call for the introduction of commercial aircraft-type regulations to govern the communications systems. "Large transport category aircraft, such as those from a Boeing or Airbus, are required to have triple redundant systems for their communications," Wild said. "But drones don't and some of the improvements that have reduced the risks in those aircraft could also be used to improve the safety of drones." Wild said more robust communications systems, even on cheaper RPAS, could help prevent accidents. Part of the problem with current regulations was related to the large difference in size between those drones that required licences and those that didn't, he said. Wild said drones weighing less than 25kg did not require any airworthiness certificate, just licences for the pilot, despite the potential damage that could be caused if they failed while flying in a built-up area. "Drones are being used for a wide range of tasks now and there are a lot of day-to-day activities that people want to use them for - delivering pizzas and packages, taking photos, geosurveying, firefighting, and search and rescue," he said. "It's essential that our safety regulations keep up with this rapidly-growing industry."

Click here to join our mailing list Yorkshire North West West Mids East Mids Restructure and loss of Boeing contract affect aircraft parts business25th August 2016  THE loss of a major contract has affected the bottom line at Cleckheaton aerospace distributor Wesco Aircraft Europe. The European division of Wesco, based in West Yorkshire, specialises in supply chain management for the aerospace industry. It lost a contract worth £32m during the year with Boeing as the manufacturer moved its operations in house. This, along with the transfer of its Canadian business to a new legal entity, which shaved £27m off the firm's turnover, meant that full year revenues fell from £179m last year to £115m. Pre-tax profits more than halved, coming in at £13.2m for the year to 30 September, down from £30.8m in 2014. It said that major airlines were ordering new aircraft "at a robust pace" and that volatile fuel prices were creating greater demand particularly for fuel-efficient models, but Wesco said that production levels in the aviation manufacturing industry are still well below pre-recession levels. Military build rates are also down and expected to continue to decline said the firm. Despite this, Wesco directors said they were confident of future prospects. The business has more than 2,600 employees, turned over $1.5bn last year and operates from more than 70 bases across the world. >> Next Article << Previous Article Latest News Big initiative to back infrastructure and growth Major fund to support spending in infrastructure and innovation David Paterson 5 networking cliches to avoid Leave dealing cards out to the magician Autumn Statement 2016 National Living Wage to rise to £7.50 an hour An estimated pay rise for over a million workers Autumn Statement commits £1.4bn to build 40,000 homes Also unveiled £2.3bn in infrastructure support for 100,000 homes Productivity gap "worrying" says Chancellor But £400m in venture capital funds to help keep fast growth startups independent and major R&D allocation set to help 8 ways to sidestep office dramas Is drama a daily occurrence in your office?

The company will now lease the currently vacant building that used to house Spacehab, in addition to constructing a new second building once a formal lease is signed. SpaceX’s contract to build should be approved as early as next month, Chief Executive Officer John Murray tells Florida Today. The locations will be used to refurbish and collect first-stage Falcon rockets that have been launched from Cape Canaveral. The company’s first Cape launch in 2015 was a complete disaster, but since then SpaceX has had eight successful missions in 2016 so far. It launched its first Falcon 9 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in June. In March, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said that recovering first-stage rocket boosters could reduce the cost of the Falcon 9 rocket up to 30 percent. SpaceX already has two launch pads in the area, one at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and one at the Kennedy Space Center. NASA recently invested $32 million in the company’s mission to send one of its capsules to Mars by 2018. However, Space News reported that would only be about 10 percent of the mission’s $320 million cost. Alongside Boeing, SpaceX has also received more than $3 billion from NASA to develop shuttle technology to transport astronauts to the U.S. Space Station. SpaceX isn’t just taking over NASA real estate, it’s increasingly replacing NASA as a leading researcher and producer of space technology.

Their booty ranged from $80 to $2,500. The Clintons have done better, much better. The Associated Press found that 85 of 154 private rich folks, more than half, who were granted a meeting with Hillary when she was secretary of state pumped a total of $156 million into the Clinton Foundation. “Reach for the sky, cowpoke!” The AP probe found that 20 of those privileged supplicants gave a million-plus each, and 40 donated more than $100,000. “Don’t anyone move a muscle!” These do not include reps from foreign governments — who gave another $170 million to the fund. “Frisk ’em, Clyde!” By all accounts the Clinton Foundation, run by Bill, does charitable work. But, conveniently, it also polishes the couple’s political image. AP did not find what if anything the 85 donors actually got for buying Hillary’s time. Maybe they gained nothing more than a smile and a handshake. Ha! Yeah, right. If you believe that, I’ve got some swamp in Arkansas to show you ... “Hands where I can see ’em, mister!” If it looks like a scam and smells like a scam, what the hell do you call it? If you’re the Clintons, you call it a charity. This is not their first whiff of corruption or other sordidness. Let me run a few examples by you. Monica Lewinsky, Whitewater, deleted emails, Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Benghazi, Travelgate, Troopergate ... Bill reportedly bedded every beauty queen he could get his hands on (Miss Arkansas 1958 says he was a yawn in the sack). Meanwhile, Hillary attacked any woman who dared accuse her hubby of sexual shenanigans. Worse, while she was secretary of state, Boeing gave the Clinton Foundation $1 million and arranged six-figure speaking gigs for Bill — and, lo and behold, won a $35-billion contract with the U.S. air force. “Hand it over, hombre!” Speaking of hombres, Donald Trump gains most from the Clintons’ corruption. If not for Hillary, Trump’s chances of being president are slim to none. But her monkey business has made her as unpopular as Donald’s mouth has made him. And Trump is no fool. “It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the state department begins,” the Republican nominee said at a rally Tuesday night. “It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office.” Even Clinton’s Democrat supporters concede the optics suck. I still think Trump will beat Hillary Nov. 8, despite the polls. If not, Bonnie and Clyde reclaim the White House. Or the Underwoods? Ever watch House of Cards, the Netflix series? It follows the perverse political path of slimeball President Frank Underwood (played by a drawling Kevin Spacey) and Claire, his icy first lady (a blond Robin Wright). The Underwoods are a ruthless, cynical power couple. The show is brilliant, though far-fetched. You know that politicians commit dastardly deeds to gain power. But, good grief, the Underwoods actually snuff a reporter by shoving her onto subway tracks and use carbon monoxide to eliminate a congressman standing in their way. There are limits, even in politics. But the Underwoods’ other plots and ploys ring true to what we see in real-life politicians, in Ottawa, Washington and any other capital. No one suggests the Clintons are inspiration for the Underwoods. Nor are the original Bonnie and Clyde. But I don’t think the show is based on Abe and Mary Lincoln. mstrobel@postmedia.com Sponsored Links See All Sponsored Links Strobel Bonnie and Clyde of U.S. politics By Mike Strobel, Toronto Sun First posted: Wednesday, August 24, 2016 06:03 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, August 24, 2016 06:14 PM EDT Hillary and Bill are giving Bonnie and Clyde a run for their money. “Stick ’em up!” That’s how Ms Parker and Mr. Barrow greeted bank tellers back in the 1930s.

In 1970, the team moved to Milwaukee and became the Brewers. AP Photo Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email comment Aug 24, 2016 Jim CapleESPN Senior Writer Close Author of "The Devil Wears Pinstripes" and winner of a Sports Emmy. Reported from 17 World Series, 9 Olympics, 6 continents. Follow on Twitter Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email print comment With the Rams rebooting in Los Angeles, ESPN.com presents a series exploring the remnants departed teams have left behind in the cities they abandoned. SEATTLE -- The Seattle Pilots had an official theme song that included the lyrics: "You brought the majors to the evergreen Northwest; now, go, go you Pilots, you're going to be the best!" Sadly, those lyrics should have been: "Now go, go you Pilots, you're going to be the Milwaukee Brewers (not that you're ever going to be very good there, either)." THE DEPARTED An ESPN.com series exploring the remnants left behind by teams that relocated: • St. Louis Browns: Lovable losers remembered fondly. • Philadelphia Warriors: Image of Wilt's 100-point game will never fade. • Troy Trojans: Yes, this upstate NY town was once a major league city. • Seattle Pilots: Failed season largely forgotten beyond "Ball Four." • Hartford Whalers: The most beloved team that no longer exists? • Montreal Expos: Youppi!, Canadiens keep team's spirit alive. • Buffalo Braves: They left in 1978, but some in Buffalo won't let go. • Minneapolis Lakers: 1948 loss to the Globetrotters was landmark. • Philadelphia/KC Athletics: Vagabond A's led colorful past lives. Story • San Diego Clippers: Why Bill Walton takes blame for hometown's loss. As part of a four-team expansion that also saw the debuts of the Montreal Expos, Kansas City Royals and San Diego Padres, the Pilots began in Seattle in 1969. But just a year later they were gone, relocated to Milwaukee after going bankrupt and being bought by Bud Selig. Nearly a half-century later, little physically remains here from that season. The Pilots' home of Sicks' Stadium was torn down decades ago, and a Lowe's home improvement store now stands on the site. Inside the store is a replica of the departed ballpark's home plate and markings where the bases and mound once were. "You go back a couple generations in baseball history and we had professional baseball from 1901 to 1969, through two world wars and a depression, and then -- poof! -- it's gone," Seattle sports historian David Eskenazi said. "The first year we didn't have pro baseball was 1970." The Pilots might be remembered even less had it not been for the finest baseball book ever written: "Ball Four," Jim Bouton's diary of that 1969 season. Bouton wrote in his Opening Day entry after beating the Angels 4-3, "Already we're better than the Mets." The Pilots did not remain so. Ichiro Suzuki and the Mariners wore Pilots uniforms during a "Turn Back the Clock" promotion in 2006. AP Photo/John Froschauer The Mets went on to win their first World Series that year, but Seattle went 64-98 and finished last in the six-team AL West. The aptly named Sicks' Stadium was a tiny and old minor league ballpark with plumbing issues that resulted in players sometimes taking cold showers or just going home without showering. Perhaps conditions would have been better had the Lowe's been around in 1969. Those Pilots drew only 677,944 fans, though that still was more than the Phillies, White Sox, Padres or Indians drew that year (the major league average was 1,134,569). They drew 14,993 for the April 11 home opener, a 7-0 win over the White Sox, but three days later a mere 3,611 watched the Pilots lose to the Royals. Only 1,954 fans showed for another April game. I was there Aug. 22 for Tommy Harper Night, held when Harper stole his 60th and 61st bases of the year, yet it was of so little interest it was attended by just 6,719 fans besides me. "I don't think this is a town that will ever draw 25,000 or 30,000 regularly," Bouton wrote. "It's a town much more concerned with culture than athletics." (This has changed, as all those Seahawks No. 12 jerseys document.) A Lowe's store now stands at the site of Sicks' Stadium, the Pilots' home for their year in Seattle. Transcendental Graphics/Getty Images Low attendance and a poor stadium -- workers were still nailing and painting the bleachers of the renovated Triple-A park the day of the home opener -- were not the only issues. The Seattle owners, Dewey and Max Soriano, were not rich enough to support the Pilots -- they needed to sell 47 percent of the team stock to former Cleveland Indians owner William Daley. Nor were there rich businessmen in the area to take over the franchise in that era -- Bill Gates and Paul Allen still were Seattle teenagers just learning the wonders of computers. Before Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks started here, Boeing was the main local company. It was about to begin staggering layoffs that would lead to an early '70s billboard that infamously read: "Will the last person leaving Seattle turn out the lights." Maybe the Pilots inspired the sign. One week before the 1970 season began and with the team's finances in ruins, the Pilots' fate was still so much up in the air that they sent their equipment truck from spring training in Arizona to Provo, Utah. There the drivers stopped and waited for word whether to continue to Seattle or veer northeast to Milwaukee. On March 31, eight days before the team's season opener, word was sent: Go to Wisconsin. The Pilots were moving to Milwaukee. As the late Mike Hegan told me once, the day after the move to Milwaukee was announced, he and his teammates entered their spring training clubhouse and found their jerseys now had MILWAUKEE stitched across the chest rather than SEATTLE. "It's amazing how cold this business can be," Hegan said. Pilots third baseman Rich Rollins takes a swing wearing a helmet with the "scrambled egg" design that replicated the look of some military headwear. Darryl Norenberg/USA TODAY Sports Seattleites still know all too well how cold it can be. In 2006, Howard Schultz, who turned Starbucks into a global phenomenon, sold the NBA's SuperSonics to a group of Oklahoma businessmen who moved the team to Oklahoma City in 2008. Fortunately, the Pilots' legacy lives on in an important way beyond "Ball Four," the home plate at Lowe's and the occasional fan wearing a replica cap with the pilot-like scrambled egg design across the bill. Thanks to Washington Attorney General Slade Gorton and trial lawyer Bill Dwyer, the state successfully sued the American League over the Pilots' departure. The league agreed to give Seattle another expansion team in 1977: the Mariners. Although after 39 seasons and not a single World Series appearance, Seattle is still wondering whether the Mariners will ever go, go to be the best.

United Airlines ending BGM airport flights Anthony Borrelli , aborrelli@pressconnects.com | @PSBABorrelli 5:21 p.m. EDT August 24, 2016 United Airlines is suspending one of three daily flights from the Greater Binghamton Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport due to construction at Newark. (Photo: AP File Photo ) 65 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE United Airlines will discontinue its flights out of Greater Binghamton Regional Airport in November, the airline announced Wednesday. The airline had been offering daily flights out of the Binghamton area to Newark Liberty International Airport, and in a statement, United officials said service would no longer be offered after Nov. 29. The decision to discontinue that service comes after a continuous review of its operations and measures of demand for service, according to the airline. "We have determined that our service between Newark and Binghamton does not meet our expectations and is no longer sustainable," United said in a statement. Customers with reservations for travel beyond Nov. 29 will be refunded. Although losing the major airline is disappointing, it does leave room for expanding services through the remaining two airlines — American and Delta  — that run flights out of Binghamton, Broome County Aviation Commissioner David Hickling said Wednesday. "We loved the fact that we had three major airlines serving our market; we've had a great relationship with them," Hickling said. "United put a lot of thought into it, but ultimately, they're in a market to make money, so it's a business decision, and I respect their decision as much as I am disappointed by it." On Wednesday, United Airlines officials would not say whether services at other regional airports in the state were being reviewed. "We still have tremendous connectivity out of Binghamton," Hickling said. "Both American and Delta are going to do well with this decision (by United); they'll probably pick up more passengers." American and Delta offer nonstop service to Philadelphia and Detroit, respectively, out of Binghamton. Delta to Detroit offers 115 domestic flight connections and 19 international connections. American to Philadelphia provides 87 domestic connections and 27 international connections. In April, United also withdrew services after two years operating out of Elmira Corning Regional Airport. It had offered daily flights to Chicago, complementing existing service provided by Allegiant, Delta and American Airlines. Following the announcement that United was discontinuing at the Elmira airport, Chemung County Executive Tom Santulli said it was believed United "didn't do as much corporate business as they thought" they would get when they first began offering flights there. United Airlines and United Express operate more than 4,500 flights a day to 339 airports across five continents. In 2015, United and United Express operated more than 1.5 million flights carrying more than 140 million customers. The airline also operates more than 720 mainline aircraft, and this year, the airline anticipates taking delivery of 21 new Boeing aircraft, including 737 NGs, 787s and 777s. The airline is a founding member of Star Alliance, which provides service to 192 countries via 28 member airlines. Federal funds for runway The loss of United flights at the Binghamton airport followed an announcement earlier Wednesday by U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand that $10.7 million in federal funding had been awarded to help repair the airport's runway. Last year, the airport made repairs after a section of runway pavement failed. Further testing found the main runway needed upgrades along its entire length. On Wednesday, Schumer's office announced $10,705,035 in funds were allocated through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration Airport Improvement Program. Officials say this will allow the airport to rehabilitate its runway's touchdown zone and lighting along its runway. "This major airport upgrade will ensure all of the passengers, businesses, academics and pilots who fly in an out of the Southern Tier each day have both a pleasant experience and, most importantly, a safe one," Schumer said in a statement Wednesday. In a July letter to FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, Schumer had requested the full $10.7 million cost of runway rehabilitation be made available in this fiscal year, to avoid potential delays in the project.

But new research is adding some clarity to the reasons behind the rising number of drone incidents, suggesting that more often than not, technical glitches rather than piloting errors are to blame. If you've ever tried your hand at piloting a drone, then you'll understand that things don't always go to plan. A slip of the joystick here, an overzealous acceleration there, things can come unstuck pretty quickly and the learning curve can be unforgiving. The US government has introduced a smartphone app, an awareness campaign and mandatory registration for these reasons: to keep rookie pilots both aware of the dangers and accountable for any missteps. Lehmann Avaiation launches modular drones Drone technology has changed rapidly over the past decade and France's Lehmann Aviation is looking to help professional drone users future-proof their UAVs with what the company claims is the world's first modular design in its latest line of drones. While it far from absolves us humans of blame, a new study carried out by researchers at Australia's RMIT University and Edith Cowan University has indicated that more often than not, technical problems may actually be the cause of drone accidents. The team examined 150 reported civil incidents between 2006 and 2016, and found that malfunctions were the cause for 64%. The research found that in most of these cases, a breakdown in the communication links between the operator and drone was the reason for the incident. Really, this is neither good news nor bad news for the drone industry as accidents are accidents, whether caused by humans or failing technologies. Rather, the study emphasizes the need for more robust communications systems for drones. The researchers believe this is an area where drones could follow the lead of larger aircraft and benefit from more regulatory oversight. Now, drones being used to deliver drugs in prison Police has said that they recovered two drones carrying mobile phones and drugs near London's Pentonville prison and have set up a special task force - Operation Airborne - to catch offenders trying to get contraband into the jail. "Large transport category aircraft, such as those from a Boeing or Airbus, are required to have triple redundant systems for their communications," says Dr Graham Wild from RMIT's School of Engineering. "But drones don't and some of the improvements that have reduced the risks in those aircraft could also be used to improve the safety of drones." Recently announced drone laws in the US allow any drone under 25 kg (55 lb) to be flown commercially without any form of airworthiness check, so long as the operator has a remote pilot certificate. In the view of the researchers, this allows too much margin for error. "Drones are being used for a wide range of tasks now and there are a lot of day-to-day activities that people want to use them for, delivering pizzas and packages, taking photos, geosurveying, firefighting, and search and rescue," says Wild. "It's essential that our safety regulations keep up with this rapidly-growing industry."

Natalie Walters Aug 24, 2016 12:16 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Qantas Airways (QUBSF) CEO Alan Joyce appeared on BloombergTV's "Trending Business" on Wednesday morning to talk about the company's record profits for 2016.  Before today's market open, the airline company reported an 85% rise in net profit for the year through June to $780 million, as well as its first dividend since 2009.  The incredible jump in profits is mainly due to the company's "transformation program," which to date has delivered $1.66 billion in benefits to the bottom line, Joyce explained. "Without that, Qantas wouldn't be producing these record results," he said.  In addition, Qantas' international business growth can be linked to partnerships with three airlines - Emirates, China Eastern (CEA) and American (AAL), Joyce said. "That's helped restructure that business and allowed us to focus on growth, particularly in Asia," he explained.  Qantas' growth should continue as the airline will receive the first of eight Boeing Co. Dreamliners at the end of 2017, BloombergTV's Rishaad Salamat pointed out. Qantas has the option to buy another 45 of the long-range, fuel-efficient aircraft, he added.  "This aircraft's technology is going to change the game for Qantas," Joyce told Salamat. The company will decide whether to order more Dreamliners based on the performance of the first eight planes, Joyce said.  "I'd like to order all of them if I can make a good return out of them,'' Joyce said.  "We have to demonstrate we can make money out of the eight we have," he added.  Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like Asian Markets Mixed as Investors Await Jackson Hole Speech Japan closes up as dollar strengthens, pending Janet Yellen's remarks on Friday, but Chinese production curbs hit oil prices and Australia's mining slowdown hits the construction sector.

The Orion, SLS, and GSDO programs have been working on parallel development paths to complete work to get ready for EM-1, and ESD will be in charge of final integration of that work as it comes together at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. See Also SLS Forum Section L2 SLS Section Click here to Join L2 The three programs have gone through their critical design reviews, and now ESD is reviewing how the work and the schedules fit together now and in the future, including the challenges of integration in both areas. “Each of the programs went through the typical systems engineering approach – you do a systems requirements review (SRR), and then a preliminary design review (PDR) and then a critical design review (CDR),” Mr. Hill explained in an interview with NASASpaceFlight.com “For the integration ‘stuff’, we did a systems requirements review, but our ‘parallel’ to the preliminary design review was what we call a ‘design-to-sync.’  So we reviewed all of our design products there.  And then this past spring and summer we did what we call ‘build-to-sync,’ which is kind of a parallel to the critical design review that each of the programs did. “(That involved) pulling together the 170-plus products that we, under the Exploration Systems Development portfolio, have developed from an integrated standpoint.” Recent schedule forecasts have the integrated EM-1 Orion spacecraft and the SLS Core Stage arriving at KSC a few months later than earlier predictions, which were used to derive the current September-November, 2018 launch readiness period, and Hill noted that they are looking at different ways of adjusting the work at KSC to try to meet that window of time. “I have a team right now taking a look at if we get Core Stage (to KSC) at the end of March (and) get Orion at the end of April, early May of ’18, can we still make the September-November timeframe (for launch),” he explained.  “We believe we can. “Until recently, everybody assumed that there was a hard nine-month schedule (at KSC). We’re interrogating that; we don’t think it’s nine months – it was based on a one shift, five days a week schedule. “So we’re looking at ‘what if we introduce a three-shift, six days a week or a three-shift, seven days a week [schedule]?’ We’ll probably go to six days a week, just to give us a little margin.  (We’re looking at) if we do that, how much do we shrink down the schedule from nine months? “(A) ‘back of the envelope’ look (says) we can get (the schedule) down to seven months and still keep thirty days of margin in there. (And we’re also looking at) how do we shrink it down even more.” In addition to looking at adding work shifts to the KSC schedule, ESD and the three programs are looking at the work itself to see if time could be saved there. “We’re also looking at the integrated tests that are going to be done at Kennedy,” he explained. “We had planned to do a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), a full up (launch countdown) rehearsal.  We may be able to do a tanking test, get that behind us, and not have to do a full up wet dress, because Orion really doesn’t get a lot of fueling or anything like that (in a WDR). “We might be able to do that independently of Orion, so we might go out to the pad without Orion and do those tests.” Other examples of refining the path to EM-1 includes the additional pre-mate, pre-launch testing involved with the Mobile Launcher. “We had planned to do a full-up Mobile Launcher test at the park site and then take it into the Vehicle Assembly Building and basically repeat all of those tests,” Mr. Hill added. “(The) Vehicle Assembly Building looks like it’s going to come in a little bit ahead of where we thought it was, so we might be able to just bring in the Mobile Launcher in and just do that test once – that takes a few weeks (of work) out of the schedule. “So we’re looking at other options – that’s what they pay us to do, they pay us to try to deliver on time and on budget and we going to continue to do that on a daily basis.” The build-to-sync effort that started earlier this year will continue into the Fall of this year. Mitigation of schedule concerns over two years ahead of launch will provide the program with options. *Click here for 100s of SLS News Articles* “What we’ll do is work our way through whether we choose a specific launch date or maintain the two-month window,” Mr. Hill added. “We’ll see how we come out in the end.  That will culminate with an agency review sometime in the late October timeframe, early November.” In the interview at the Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the first SLS Core Stage is being manufactured and assembled, Mr. Hill added also talked about recent adjustments to the Core Stage schedule for EM-1 that has impacted on the schedule discussions. “We just went through a renegotiation with Boeing and rebaselined the entire (Core Stage) schedule; we’re sticking to that schedule. “We believe that we can ship out of here (MAF) with the engines integrated to get to Stennis in the September (2017) time-frame, get it on the B-2 test stand – where we’re going to do a full-up Core Stage hot-fire.” Although the schedule is still targeting shipment of the Core Stage from MAF to Stennis in late September, 2017, the rebaseline does lengthen the time spent at Stennis for the “Green Run” test campaign before the Core Stage is put back on the Pegasus barge and shipped to KSC, which moved from January to March, 2018. “Part of the renegotiation was to extend the time at Stennis – one of the things we did that we hadn’t planned on (earlier) was to repair the Core Stage if we damaged it somehow during the hot-fire,” That renegotiation had a ripple effect on the EM-1 flow, with Mr. Hill explaining the Program will have to step on the gas to counter such changes. “We’ve added in about thirty days for that in that schedule. There’re some other areas where we were really assuming – you’ve heard of ‘green-light’ schedules? “I call the next step above that a ‘motorcade’ kind of a schedule where you don’t worry about green lights or red lights, you just blow through everything. “We were kind of not as conservative on our first go-round and I think we’ve got a more realistic schedule today and that’s why it’s where it’s at.” (Images: NASA and L2 – including photos from Philip Sloss and SLS renders from L2 artist Nathan Koga – The full gallery of Nathan’s (SpaceX Dragon to MCT, SLS, Commercial Crew and more) L2 images can be *found here*) (To join L2, click here: https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/) Related Articles NASA Lunar Imaging CubeSat – SkyFire – to ride with EM-1 Space Industry press forward with exploration hardware development Share This Article L2 - What's Popular Recent Forum Posts Latest SpaceX prime Falcon 9 rockets for December return Long March 3C launches fourth Tianlian-1 spacecraft Cygnus OA-5 departs Station after one month mission Atlas V successfully launches with GOES-R advanced weather satellite Soyuz MS-03 completes ISS docking with Expedition 50 crew Shenzhou-11 returns Chinese duo to Earth Ariane 5 ES successfully launches Galileo quadruplets Software and Service Module cited as main critical paths to EM-1 launch date As OA-7 Cygnus moves to Atlas V, high praise noted for Antares RTF Long March 2D fires opening salvo in new weather observation constellation Tags Antares Ariane 5 Atlas V CCDev china CRS Cygnus Dragon Dream Chaser EFT-1 ESA ET EVA Falcon 9 FRR HLV ISS Long March Mars Orbital Orion Progress Proton-M Russian SLS SNC Soyuz SpaceX SRB SSME STS-119 STS-125 STS-126 STS-127 STS-128 STS-129 STS-130 STS-131 STS-132 STS-133 STS-134 STS-135 T&R TPS ULA Archives Select Month November 2016  (17) October 2016  (21) September 2016  (27) August 2016  (25) July 2016  (19) June 2016  (22) May 2016  (23) April 2016  (23) March 2016  (22) February 2016  (18) January 2016  (21) December 2015  (23) November 2015  (24) October 2015  (24) September 2015  (27) August 2015  (23) July 2015  (24) June 2015  (22) May 2015  (21) April 2015  (19) March 2015  (24) February 2015  (17) January 2015  (17) December 2014  (25) November 2014  (21) October 2014  (27) September 2014  (23) August 2014  (19) July 2014  (23) June 2014  (20) May 2014  (21) April 2014  (21) March 2014  (21) February 2014  (21) January 2014  (22) December 2013  (25) November 2013  (22) October 2013  (27) September 2013  (28) August 2013  (23) July 2013  (23) June 2013  (24) May 2013  (23) April 2013  (20) March 2013  (20) February 2013  (20) January 2013  (23) December 2012  (21) November 2012  (23) October 2012  (28) September 2012  (25) August 2012  (23) July 2012  (24) June 2012  (23) May 2012  (41) April 2012  (25) March 2012  (26) February 2012  (28) January 2012  (23) December 2011  (32) November 2011  (26) October 2011  (25) September 2011  (25) August 2011  (28) July 2011  (32) June 2011  (24) May 2011  (31) April 2011  (27) March 2011  (24) February 2011  (25) January 2011  (24) December 2010  (26) November 2010  (30) October 2010  (31) September 2010  (25) August 2010  (28) July 2010  (22) June 2010  (26) May 2010  (27) April 2010  (29) March 2010  (28) February 2010  (25) January 2010  (22) December 2009  (22) November 2009  (28) October 2009  (28) September 2009  (29) August 2009  (32) July 2009  (28) June 2009  (25) May 2009  (31) April 2009  (28) March 2009  (30) February 2009  (26) January 2009  (23) December 2008  (25) November 2008  (28) October 2008  (27) September 2008  (20) August 2008  (22) July 2008  (18) June 2008  (26) May 2008  (22) April 2008  (22) March 2008  (23) February 2008  (25) January 2008  (23) December 2007  (23) November 2007  (25) October 2007  (30) September 2007  (23) August 2007  (38) July 2007  (28) June 2007  (34) May 2007  (30) April 2007  (26) March 2007  (25) February 2007  (28) January 2007  (25) December 2006  (35) November 2006  (27) October 2006  (29) September 2006  (36) August 2006  (31) July 2006  (39) June 2006  (30) May 2006  (27) April 2006  (28) March 2006  (30) February 2006  (32) January 2006  (26) December 2005  (25) November 2005  (26) October 2005  (30) September 2005  (28) August 2005  (35) July 2005  (30) June 2005  (25) May 2005  (19) April 2005  (29) March 2005  (4) February 2005  (1) NASASPACEFLIGHT About NASASpaceFlight Advertise With Us Contact Us NASASpaceflight © 2005 - 2015 Website Designed by Dr Nox & Associates

(CRUS) Signaling Upcoming Gains S&P 500: Enjoy a Rare Thanksgiving Bull Feast! View All Posts iShares Dow Jones US Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:ITA) — As I reviewed a list of ETF returns, ITA, which tracks the Dow Jones US Select Aerospace & Defense Index, stood out as a consistent performer with a low expense ratio of 0.44%. Reviewing my August AAII ETF guide, this fund shows a line of black numbers, and no red, indicating annual returns that are difficult to match: six-month (+18.98%), one-year (+10.70), three-year (+14.89%), five-year (+17.49%) and 10-year (+11.82%). These returns are through July 31, and they don’t reflect sales charges and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. ITA pays an annual dividend of $1.35 per share for a current forward yield of 1%. Morningstar gives ITA a five-star rating for the fund’s unusual combination of below-average risk and high returns. The top 10 holdings in ITA are United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LLL), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (NYSE:COL) and Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT). Turning to the chart, we see that ITA made a new high in early June, which exceeded its previous all-time high of around $125, made in the second quarter of 2015. But in late June, profit-taking drove shares below their 50-day moving average. However, ITA managed to hold above its 200-day moving average and preserve its bull market stance. The current channel in which shares trade is a bull recovery channel, which is confirmed by very high volume at its start and a supportive MACD indicator. Buy ITA as an investment in the U.S. aerospace and defense industries, which are uniquely suited to meet the replacement and new equipment needs of the U.S. armed forces.

Then Airbus has a website for you. Airbus (EADSF) has launched a booking site dedicated solely to A380 flights, hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the aircraft among some passengers. "Booking systems today do not allow the passengers to easily choose their preferred aircraft and we decided to fill that gap by easing the access to the iconic A380 aircraft, for everybody," said Marc Fontaine, Airbus Digital Transformation Officer. The A380 super jumbo jet operates on 102 routes to around 50 destinations globally, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Dubai, Tokyo and Sydney. The new website, http://iflya380.com, allows passengers to pick any A380 flight operated by one of the 13 airlines that fly the super jumbo. Related: Airbus cuts production of A380 super jumbo Airbus said the aircraft has proven to be a hit with travelers, but the company is struggling to convince more airlines to buy it. The A380, designed to challenge Boeing (BA) in the super large aircraft market, took 15 years to develop at a cost of $25 billion. But orders have not matched Airbus' expectations. Airlines are now moving towards more fuel efficient planes, rather than super large aircraft, to cut down costs. Fuel is the second biggest expense for airlines, behind staff costs. The company announced it is cutting down production of the aircraft. It said it will build only 20 of the twin-deck A380 next year, and only 12 per year from 2018. That's down from 27 it delivered in 2015.

By Austin Wright and Jeremy Herb 08/24/16 05:25 AM EDT “In the case of Trump vs. Clinton, defense executives see the same thing in Trump that people in other industries and the media see, which is that he’s a totally unknown quantity, and that’s scary,” said industry consultant Loren Thompson. | Getty Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print The nation’s top defense contractors have long been a bastion of support for Republican candidates for office. But this time, they’re with Hillary Clinton. The Democratic presidential nominee is leading Republican rival Donald Trump by a ratio of 2-to-1 in campaign donations from employees working for defense giants like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. That’s a sharp turnaround from 2012, when defense contractors gave more to then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney than to President Barack Obama. Story Continued Below It’s also a departure from recent decades, in which the industry overall favored Republican congressional and presidential candidates in eight of the past 10 election cycles, with Democrats getting more in 2008 and 2010. Since Trump locked up the Republican nomination three months ago, employees of 25 of the nation’s largest defense companies have donated $93,000 to Clinton, compared with $46,000 for Trump, according to a POLITICO review of filings with the Federal Election Commission. Clinton's donor rolls also include more than two dozen top defense executives, while Trump’s show just two. Donors with ties to Pentagon contractors may simply be betting Clinton will win. But some say they are concerned about Trump's pronouncements on national security, which have included skepticism about NATO’s role in countering Russia, and they fear he will follow through on his pledge to upend business as usual in Washington. “I’ve worked with Republicans and Democrats of all stripes over the years,” said Linda Hudson, who ran the U.S. branch of British defense firm BAE Systems, the Pentagon’s eighth largest contractor, from 2009 to 2014. “And it’s the first time I’ve seen one who scares the hell out of me if he were to become president.” 2016 Clinton asks Romney’s allies for cash to stop Trump By Gabriel Debenedetti Hudson, who’s given $5,400 to the Clinton campaign this election cycle, said she considers herself a Democrat but has contributed in the past to lawmakers in both political parties who have strong positions on defense issues. Her biggest problem with Trump, she explained, is that “he appears to have no impulse control.” On the stump, the real estate mogul and reality television star has repeatedly criticized defense contractors and their lobbyists for exerting undue influence on government spending. Clinton, meanwhile, was an ally to some of them when she was in the Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee. “My view is Hillary is far more aligned with the types of issues that are important to the defense industry than Trump is,” Hudson said. Officially, defense firms are trying to avoid taking sides in this year’s race for the White House — with most of their corporate political action committees contributing to House and Senate candidates but not to the Clinton or Trump campaigns. But that hasn’t stopped many of their top executives from making their preferences known through individual contributions. And those preferences skew toward Clinton, who defense watchers say offers what weapons makers crave most: predictability. “In the case of Trump vs. Clinton, defense executives see the same thing in Trump that people in other industries and the media see, which is that he’s a totally unknown quantity, and that’s scary,” said industry consultant Loren Thompson, who plans to vote for the former secretary of State. A number of big names in defense circles have opened their checkbooks for Clinton. They include former Lockheed Martin CEO Robert Stevens; Edward Kangas, who chairs the board of directors at United Technologies; Pam Wickham, the vice president for corporate affairs and communications at Raytheon; John Casey, who leads the Marine Systems division at General Dynamics; Vivek Lall, a senior executive at General Atomics; and Frank Ruggiero, the top in-house lobbyist at BAE Systems, among others. Many of Clinton’s defense industry donors have longstanding ties to the Democratic Party, including Greta Lundeberg, Boeing’s vice president for strategy and advocacy and a former National Security Council staffer in the Obama administration; and Robert Hale, an adviser at Booz Allen Hamilton who was the Pentagon’s comptroller under Obama. Others have histories of giving to both political parties, including Gregory Walters, a senior in-house lobbyist at Lockheed Martin, who also contributed this year to Republican Rep. Kay Granger of the Texas congressional district where Lockheed assembles its F-35 fighter jet. Biden reassures NATO allies: I don't think Trump 'understands what Article 5 is' By Nick Gass At least four other in-house lobbyists at Lockheed have given to Clinton. In contrast, Trump’s donor rolls include just two senior executives at major defense firms, according to POLITICO’s analysis. Scott Feeney, the director of international government relations at Rockwell Collins, has given $225 this year to the Trump campaign, and Jennifer Gallagher, listed as a senior manager for government relations at Raytheon, has given $250. Feeney did not respond to a request for comment, and Gallagher declined through a spokesman to comment. One Republican defense lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he said he has to preserve relationships on both sides of the aisle, said the defense “community is just much more comfortable with Clinton.” The lobbyist said he plans to vote for Clinton in what will be his first vote ever for a Democratic presidential candidate. “With Hillary Clinton we have some sense of where she would go, and with Trump we have none,” the lobbyist said. “He knows nothing about the system.” The lobbyist also speculated that some defense executives might be contributing to Clinton — who has a polling advantage over Trump in all the key battleground states — because they believe she’s going to win. Asked to comment, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign pointed out that defense contributions make up a small fraction of overall fundraising totals. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Some of the defense contractors named in this article declined to comment, while others noted that they have no control over the individual political contributions of their employees. the playbook interview Playbook Interview: David Petraeus By Daniel Lippman “As a corporation we have a longstanding practice of not participating in presidential election campaigns,” said Lockheed spokesman William Phelps. “Any contributions made by our employees is personal and not associated with the corporation.” In all, Trump’s campaign has received $55,000 in contributions from employees of the 25 major defense contractors, compared to $273,000 for Clinton — a 5-to-1 advantage. These totals do represent a small amount of the hundreds of millions of dollars raised overall by the campaigns, but they’re indicative of trends in an industry that depends on government contracts for its revenues. The totals only include contributions from individuals who have given more than $200, as the campaigns are not required to itemize smaller donations. This lopsided ratio is a reversal from 2012, when Romney brought in $1.4 million from defense PACs and industry employees, edging out Obama, who bought in $1.2 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. “All the people I know in the industry who are actively involved in the campaigns are on the Clinton side,” said Thompson, the defense industry consultant. “Clinton has been in public life for decades, her priorities are well understood, and many senior executives in the defense industry know her personally.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Austin Wright awright@politico.com @abwrig Jeremy Herb jherb@politico.com @jeremyherb This story tagged under: Military Hillary Clinton Elections Donald Trump 2016 Elections Hillary Clinton 2016 Donald Trump 2016 Defense Industry Show Comments Politico Magazine 15 Trump Flip-Flops in 15 Days By Ruairí Arrieta-Kenna How the Left Created Trump By Rob Hoffman Giuliani Took Money From a Group That Killed Americans.

EDASC organized the day-long tour for Thornquist as part of an ongoing initiative to showcase local businesses who manufacture parts for the aerospace industry. Sternlicht noted the importance of introducing state Commerce officials to vital Skagit companies such as Chinook. "Not only is Chinook a prominent Boeing supplier, but also its social enterprise mission merits more awareness statewide. These visits help both Skagit and state folks to work together in economic development." Rob Martin, Chinook Enterprises Founder and CEO led the hour-long tour. "We were very excited to showcase what we do here, and to discuss business opportunities and challenges we face as a social enterprise in the aerospace assembly field." Chinook's history in aerospace dates back to 1987 when the company began assembling parts for the 747 Program. Over thirty-five years later, Chinook's award-winning production team is busier than ever.
