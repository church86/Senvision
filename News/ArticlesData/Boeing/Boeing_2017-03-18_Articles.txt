(U.S. Army photo by Spc. Alajuwan D. McCoy, 1st Air Cavalry Brigade PAO, 1st Cavalry Division.) Boeing and the U.S. Army have signed a $3.4 billion contract for Boeing to remanufacture 244 AH-64D Longbow Apaches to the AH-64E Apache Guardian standard and to provide 24 new build AH-64Es to an unnamed foreign customer through foreign military sales.  That customer could be Qatar, which had previously ordered 24 AH-64Es. Through analysis of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's arms sales data, Qatar is the only country to specifically order 24 AH-64Es.  "This agreement is great news for our Army, our soldiers, the American taxpayers, our industry partners and numerous international partners,” said U.S. Army Col. Joseph Hoecherl, the Apache project manager with Redstone Arsenal's Program Executive Office for Aviation.  “It is a direct result of the professional dedication and diligent efforts by government and industry teammates to provide the much needed capabilities of the world's best attack helicopter - the AH-64E Apache - at a fair and affordable price that results in year over year savings to the taxpayer. In the hands of our trained U.S. soldiers, the Apache's technologies and resulting capabilities are essential to Army operations around the globe." The 'E' model Apache is an improved version of the venerable Apache helicopter, which can target tanks, vehicles, buildings, personnel, and even other helicopters and UAVs. It is equipped with a 30mm chain gun and can carry Hellfire missiles, Hydra rockets and other missiles.  The "E" model includes more powerful T700-GE-701D engines, improved digital connectivity, IFR capability, improved landing gear, composite rotor blades and increased payload. They can also control unmanned aerial vehicles through manned-unmanned teaming to provide reconnaissance.  The work will be done in Mesa, Arizona.  "The Apache has made a tremendous impact in the defense of the nations that have flown it for the last 37 years,” said Kim Smith, Boeing Attack Helicopters vice president and program manager. “Our team understands the responsibility we have to deliver the best aircraft on time at an affordable price every day, and we are committed to maintaining that well established tradition of excellence.” Tags Rotorcraft Military Aircraft Aircraft Apache Boeing Gunships Military Helicopters Boeing Ah-64 Apache Bell Ah-1z Viper Republic Of Korea Army Aviation Attack Helicopter Boeing Ah-6 Sony Ericsson T700 Cellular Phone United States Arizona Apache Project Manager Joseph Hoecherl Mesa Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Redstone Arsenal's Program Executive Office For Aviation Colonel Qatar Vice President And Program Manager Kim Smith Army Ge United States Army Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Additional places for NASA astronauts purchased from Boeing The article from SpaceFlights.NEWS Boeing sold places inside Russian Soyuz spacecraft to NASA. Agency will be probably forced to use these seats in 2019 to let their Astronauts to reach International Space Station due the delay of NASA’s Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program. It was not particularly happy moment in the history of NASA and probably one of the more important failures of program managed by NASA in recent years. Whole program of development of the new American manned spacecraft able to deliver astronauts to International Space Station is not going along with schedule. First flight of NASA astronauts inside manned Dragon or Boeing CST -100 will probably not appear in 2019 as it was originally planned due the technical issues during development of both constructions. Results of this delay, which is not limited only to one from two contractors, but affected Boeing and SpaceX, are not easy for NASA. Agency did not purchased additional seats for their astronauts from Roscosmos in 2016 and due the procedures of Roscosmos. These require purchasing seats in advance and not later then 3 years before flight, it is now impossible to book flight for 2019 at Roscosmos. NASA decided not to risk leaving ISS for whole year in 2019 and purchased additional places inside Soyuz from Boeing. Company acquired these places as part of the compensation from RSC Energia obtained in 2015. Settlement and compensation were result of a lawsuit between companies about Sea Launch joint venture, where both were business partners until 2011. Total value of the contract between NASA and Boeing is $373.5 million with average price per seat of $74.7 million. It is almost $7 million less comparing to prices offered by Roscosmos, so in fact for NASA it is kind of economical success. However it should not be surprising, that Agency is not proud of this purchase.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Commercial Crew Program with delays, NASA seeks for alternatives The article from SpaceFlights.NEWS According to spacenews.com NASA decided finally to seek alternative to planned manned Dragon and CST-100 spacecrafts with first regular missions scheduled for 2019. Explanation is simple – NASA resigned to purchase places for their astronauts for 2019 from Roscosmos, and in case of any delays with SpaceX manned Dragon or Boeing CST-100, 2019 could be first year without American astronauts inside International Space Station. According to Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA associate administrator for human exploration and operations NASA would like to create alternative plan to provide continuous access to ISS in 2019 in case if SpaceX and Boeing would not manage to keep present schedule for their Dragon and CST-100 vehicles. It simply means, that NASA is not putting confidence in official schedule for Commercial Crew Program. To remind it covers first unmanned flight of Dragon in late 2017 with finishing certification in 2018 and first crewed mission in May 2018; alternative option, Boeing CST-100 should performed unmanned flight in May 2018. Both Companies are suffering for over 12 months of delay. New plan, which should be announced in March, is based on two options. First is proposition of new edition of “year in space” program in the cooperation with Roscosmos; it could start in late 2018 and help in keeping one NASA astronaut for whole 2019. Another option is purchasing two seats inside Soyuz spacecrafts which were acquired by Boeing from RSC Energia as part of the settlement from 2015. It was result of a lawsuit between companies about Sea Launch joint venture, were both where business partners until 2011. Still both options are not comfortable for NASA and give only limited presence of NASA astronauts if we compare presented opportunities to present Expeditions with usually two NASA astronauts.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Mar 19, 2017 at 8:13AM Six months ago, David met Goliath. Six months later, Goliath is getting carried away on his shield. This contest began last August, with tiny SpaceX going up against United Launch Alliance (ULA), the giant space venture jointly operated by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), in a critical contest to see who would launch the U.S. Air Force's next "GPS III" satellite. The U.S. Air Force loves SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket -- and at these prices, rightly so. Image source: SpaceX. A bit of history Historically, ULA had provided monopoly service to the U.S. Air Force on its large satellite launches. But the Air Force had recently certified SpaceX to bid on its contracts -- and compete with ULA. SpaceX parlayed that certification into one GPS III contract win in May 2016, when a legislative snafu in Congress temporarily deprived ULA of access to the engines it needed to launch its rockets, handing the contract to SpaceX by default. But freshly restocked with new engines from Russia, ULA had no intention of allowing SpaceX to beat it in a real contest on a second GPS III contract. Both companies submitted their best bids to the Air Force -- and as we learned this week, SpaceX won. The news broke with a whisper on Tuesday, when buried in the Pentagon's daily digest of contract awards came a statement that SpaceX had been awarded the Air Force's second contract "to deliver a GPS III satellite to its intended orbit." The Air Force referred to Boeing and Lockheed's bid only obliquely, noting that "two offers [were] received" for the work, but that SpaceX's bid had won. How SpaceX won How did SpaceX win the contract? As with the first GPS award last summer, price appears to have been dispositive. As you may recall, in the May 2016 award, the Air Force had expected to pay about $140 million for the first GPS III launch, and was surprised when SpaceX offered to put its satellite in orbit for "40% less" (or $82.7 million). This time around, SpaceX bid a bit higher -- $96.5 million. In so doing, SpaceX built an extra $14 million or so worth of profit on its bid. But it appears there was still no contest between the two bids. After all, by its own admission, the best price ULA can offer for a low-end Atlas V mission is about $200 million -- $164 million for the launch, plus a portion of its standard $1 billion-a-year retainer fee prorated and attributed to the mission. Even after its latest markup, though, SpaceX beat that price by half. What it means for investors This means that -- in theory, at least -- SpaceX still has room to grow its profit margin by more than 100% before running into any real competition from Boeing and Lockheed. (Or more realistically, SpaceX could jack its rates up another 45%, and both beat ULA's price and also satisfy the Air Force's hoped-for price of under $140 million.) SpaceX could even earn more profit if it succeeds in cutting its costs by successfully reusing its first recovered rocket later this month -- proving the feasibility of such reused rocket launches. What's more, this situation could continue for at least a couple more years. According to ULA, its new, cheaper Vulcan launch vehicle -- designed to replace the Atlas V -- will not reach "initial launch capability" until sometime in 2019. And even then, ULA is only targeting a best price of $100 million per satellite launched. (Factor in a pro rata portion of ULA's $1 billion retainer fee, and the price would probably be even higher.) Ballpark ULA's combined cost at $135 million, and that price might finally be cheap enough to satisfy the Air Force. But it still won't be cheap enough to beat SpaceX's prices. Seems to me that Boeing and Lockheed Martin have their work cut out for them. Unless they're willing to operate ULA at a loss, they simply cannot compete with SpaceX on cost, for government launch missions, over the next two years -- and their profits will suffer for it.

According to Allen, the toughest challenge in this field is the continuous development of techniques, in addition to the enormous amount of data. He noted that the companies that will be successful after 40 years are the ones that will manage to deal with this data and benefit from it in development and innovation. He also expected space industry to be the upcoming field of competition, revealing that huge attention is paid to this industry. To Asharq Al-Awsat, he said: “We see that during the coming 25 years the chances of space commerce will be close to reality.” “What about your cooperation with Saudi Arabia and Boeing vision in achieving Saudi Vision 2030?” asked the newspaper. The Boeing president replied: “Innovation in products, services and operations is a backbone of Boeing and throughout the past decades Boeing has made a radical change in the field of commerce travel in Saudi Arabia. As for Saudi Vision 2030, we have huge opportunities and we are cooperating with the kingdom through several initiatives that will provide job opportunities and contribute in transforming the existing techniques and the space industry infrastructure in Saudi Arabia.” The newspaper asked: “With the increase of aviation accidents, do you think that this has an influence on the use of airplanes as a means of safe transportation?” He answered: “It would be beneficial to mention that 2016 was the second safest year in the history of aviation, regardless that airplanes are the safest way for travel. We, in Boeing, place safety as a priority.” “How did the companies deal with the drop in oil prices and its influence on cancelling some deals by the buyers?” asked Asharq Al-Awsat. “The drop in oil prices has existed for two years and its influence varies between the negative and positive. The situation is currently stable and in case of any rise in prices then the companies tend to purchase airplanes that consume less fuel. Also, the mounting demand on airplanes depends on the increase of travelers and this helps in covering the cost of operational expenses,” Allen answered. When asked about the outcome of the Boeing program to support the Arab youth in the Middle East, he replied: “I mentioned in the beginning that Boeing in Saudi Arabia is committed to achieving the Saudi national goals through providing jobs for Saudi youths and we are determined to continue along this path.” The newspaper asked: “Marc, you are in your forties and you are the president of Boeing. This represents an inspiration to the youth. What can you tell them about your story?” Allen said: “What I can say to any ambitious youth is that he should know his goals in life. He should have a specific goal and, most importantly, he should be comfortable in the way he will achieve it. You should be yourself and avoid imitating others. This is the first step in being a leader.” Abdul Hadi Habtoor More Posts Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Related Boeingoil pricesSaudi Vision 2030.

Tia Dufour An aerial view of the Pentagon as seen from a Marine Corps CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter, July 8, 2011. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Tia Dufour/Released) In a Thursday announcement, President Donald Trump announced six nominations for senior positions at the Pentagon.  Patrick Shanahan, currently Boeing's Vice President for Supply Chain & Operations, has been nominated to be the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the #2 job in the Pentagon. He will effectively be the Chief Operating Officer (COO) if confirmed.  David Norquist, a partner with accounting firm Kearney and Company, has been nominated to be the Undersecretary of Defense, Comptroller. That will effectively make him the Pentagon's budget director, an incredibly important role.  David Joel Trachtenburg, the president and CEO of consulting firm Shortwaver Consulting, has been nominated to be the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy. He's served in the past on the staff at the House Armed Services Committee and in several positions within the Pentagon.  Kenneth Rapuamo, a senior vice president and the director of Studies and Analysis at the ANSER corporation, has been nominated to be the Assistant Secretary of Defense of Defense, Homeland Defense and Global Security.  Elaine McCusker has been nominated to be the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, effectively making her the Pentagon's deputy budget director. She's currently the Director of Resources and Analysis at U.S. Central Command in Florida.  Robert Daigle has been nominated to become the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE). He's previously served in that office during the Bush Administration, and according to the White House is a staff member on the House Armed Services Committee. His job will be to analyze programs defense-wide, like the ones on Redstone Arsenal.  All of these positions will have an impact on Redstone Arsenal, but perhaps none more than Patrick Shanahan, the nominee to be the Deputy Secretary of Defense. In his previous roles with Boeing, he's been in charge of the company's efforts on missile defense and Army aviation, both of which play a big role on Redstone Arsenal.  All six nominees will have to be voted on by the Senate Armed Services committee before going to full Senate for a vote. There is no timetable for that happening.  Tags Alabama United States United States Department Of Defense Patrick Shanahan Boeing United States Assistant Secretary Of Defense Under Secretary Of Defense For Acquisition, Technology And Logistics United States Principal Deputy Under Secretary Of Defense Redstone Arsenal United States Secretary Of Defense The Pentagon David Norquist Undersecretary Comptroller Bush Administration Director, An Incredibly Important Role Deputy Secretary Of Defense Robert Daigle Donald Trump Senate Director Of Cost Assessment And Program Evaluation Anser Corporation Florida Deputy Budget Director Chief Operating Officer (coo) President David Joel Trachtenburg Pentagon Secretary Of Defense , Comptroller Director Of Resources And Analysis U.s.

Once completed, the plant will have the capacity to process the final assembly work of as many as 100 737 aircraft every year. The airframes, which will still be manufactured by Boeing in America, will be flown to Zhoushan for the installation of fittings, seats and entertainment systems. Many of these aircraft will be destined for the Chinese market, given that the projected growth of demand over the next few years means that the country will buy as much as $1 trillion worth of aircraft from Boeing, and European rival Airbus. Boeing is very much behind Airbus in terms of assembling aircraft in China. Airbus has had a manufacturing plant in Tianjin for several years, with a second facility currently being planned (and coincidentally, one in Alabama, USA). Despite that, Boeing is working hard to maintain strong ties with China. As we reported in December, the company's Vice Chairman had made great efforts during the Presidential election campaign to underline the huge importance of the Chinese market to his company. Apparently, 150,000 jobs at Boeing depend on contracts and orders with China.

Models of Boeing 747 and 777 passenger planes are displayed. Reuters/Bobby Yip 19 March 2017 Oman Air, the national carrier of Oman, has announced that a new Boeing B737-800 aircraft has joined its fleet. This new aircraft will be used on short and medium-haul routes and has a capacity of 162 seats, with 12 business-class seats with a seat pitch of 46 inches and 150 economy-class seats with a seat pitch of 30 inches. Each seat is equipped with an LCD screen measuring 10.6 inches. Oman Air has operated B737s for many years and the aircraft provide the backbone of the airline’s long and medium-haul fleet, with 32 currently in operation. The new aircraft will be deployed soon on its arrival for commercial flights. Abdulaziz Al-Raisi, executive vice president of products and brand development, said: “Oman Air is adding new aircraft to its fast-growing fleet to keep up with the expansion program. Known for its energy-efficient systems, and combined with Oman Air’s superb maintenance staff and facilities, this is an ideal acquisition as we spread our wings to further afield.” The aircraft’s inaugural flight departed Seattle on March 13 and arrived in Muscat on March 15. With the addition of the new Boeing 737–800, Oman Air’s fleet stands at 51. Currently Oman Air’s fleet consists of five Boeing 787 Dreamliners, six Airbus 330-300s, four Airbus 330-200s, five Boeing 737-900s, 26 Boeing 737-800s, one Boeing 737-700 and four Embraer 175s. Oman Air is continuing with its expansion plans in 2017 with four new additions to the fleet already this year, the latest being the Boeing 787 Dreamliner which joined the fleet on Feb. 23. Two new 737-800s were added to the fleet in January and February. In addition, a new Dreamliner B787-9 will be joining Oman Air’s fleet in April. The delivery of new aircraft is part of Oman Air’s dynamic program of fleet and network expansion. Advertisement © Arab News 2017 © Copyright Zawya. All Rights Reserved.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon If the Liberal government goes ahead with its decision to purchase Super Hornet fighter jets instead of stealthy F-35s, Canada may be giving up its sovereignty over the High Arctic as it comes to depend on U.S. jets flying from airfields in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Rankin Inlet, Iqaluit and Alaska. That was the unanimous opinion of half a dozen retired fighter pilots I spoke with recently, pilots with decades of experience flying over the continent’s northern margins and in senior positions at NORAD headquarters in Colorado: that Canada would be relegated to “second-tier status” in defending its own territory. U.S. war planes such as the F-35 and F-22 would defend the bulk of Canada’s vast northern air space because they would be invisible to Russian radars and would be able to seamlessly share data and sensor information with each other and with airborne and ground command posts, the retired Canadian pilots said. Canada’s CF-18 Hornets and Super Hornets, operating much older technologies and much less able to deliver such complicated data fusion, would likely be tasked with defending North American cities far to the south or with shooting down any missiles that managed to penetrate the first line of defence, they said. The 18 Super Hornets the Trudeau government has said it intends to buy are expected to cost between $5 and $7 billion. On Tuesday, the Canadian government sent a letter to its U.S. counterpart outlining what it’s looking for in a potential Super Hornet purchase, which the jets’ manufacturer, Boeing, will use to draft a formal proposal by this fall. If the price and timeline are right — and if the purchase would provide enough economic spinoff benefits for Canada — the Liberals hope to sign a contract by late this year or early next. The plan has drawn plenty of criticism. “Will Canada be surrendering sovereignty? The simple answer is yes,” said Lt.-Gen. George MacDonald, who flew CF-18 Hornets from Bagotville, Que., for NORAD for five years and was the binational military alliance’s deputy commander before 9/11 and then served as vice chief of the defence staff in Ottawa before retiring in 2004. (He now works for CFN Consultants, which has as a client Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-35.) “The Russians would be delighted to see Canada flying Super Hornets in the north,” said Gen. Tom Lawson, the retired former chief of the defence staff and ex-deputy commander of NORAD, who sometimes works as a consultant for Lockheed. “The Super Hornets will be a big, bright object on the radars of Russian early-warning aircraft. With the F-35, the Russians will not see them until they are too close.” Gen. Jean Boyle, a former chief of defence and fighter pilot who was Boeing’s vice-president of international business when the Super Hornet was coming online nearly 20 years ago, says he can see the argument against using Super Hornets in the Far North. “In times of increased tension there is no doubt that NORAD would put its best assets, the (U.S. Air Force’s) F-35 and F-22, forward instead of a Super Hornet, to ensure the defence is thorough. “My position, even when I was chief and ever since I was a colonel and started to understand national security, is that Canada should have a defence capability where we can defend all the northern and maritime approaches to our country, 100 per cent, that it is fully paid for by us and that there are no arguments on that point.” “I am loathe to say we should buy the F-35 but skeptical about the capabilities of the Super Hornet,” Boyle said. “Having been with Boeing when it was developed, I am relatively aware of what the Super Hornet can do. It is fourth-generation compared to fifth-generation.” Related Liberals take next step toward buying 18 Super Hornets, hope for deal by year’s end Buying ‘political insulation’: Liberals to call for bids in 2019 for permanent fleet to replace CF-18s Retired air chiefs urge Liberals to ditch ‘costly and unnecessary’ plan to buy Super Hornet jets A fourth retired Canadian air force general, who had not worked for either Lockheed or Boeing but whose company does not allow employees to be quoted by name, concurred. He highlighted “survivability issues” for Super Hornet crews because they could be seen by enemy radars, and warned that new Russian cruise missiles would be “a game-changer” if not confronted by a fighter with cutting-edge technology. None of the former pilots interviewed for this article were among the 13 retired air force three-star generals who recently sent a letter to the prime minister decrying the Super Hornet purchase. “I don’t know what the government’s calculus is but if they look to the threats in the future we should go to a competition quickly,” Lawson said. “Enough information is already available to develop an operational requirement to have a competition within one year to 18 months and to have the first aircraft delivered within three years.” That is approximately the same timeline the government has been using to justify the need for an emergency purchase of Super Hornets rather than F-35s. The RCAF told parliamentarians last year that it can safely fly its existing CF-18s until 2025. The F-35 and Super Hornet were both “tremendous airplanes,” Boyle said. “My position is to not buy from an interim proposal. We should move forward with an open competition. Put them up against each other and make a decision.” — with files from The Canadian Press Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Workers at the company’s Washington state factories were informed by their union that Boeing had issued a federally-required notice that “involuntary layoffs were scheduled for May.” A Boeing spokesman confirmed the 60-day notice, but declined to say precisely when it would initiate the layoffs or how many positions would be cut. Boeing has been cutting staff to reduce costs since early 2016, primarily through buyouts and the attrition of executives, managers and engineering staff. The notices are the first official signal from the company that it will lay off some of the factory workers who assemble its jets. The Machinists union in Seattle, which represents thousands of Boeing employees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After years of record buying, the pace of orders for Boeing’s twin-aisle jets, including its 777 and 787 Dreamliners, has slowed significantly. Boeing is cutting back current-generation 777 production, its most profitable large jet, by nearly 60% from its peak. Boeing is adjusting its employment to account for that lost revenue and is under pressure to offer better prices to airlines while promising Wall Street improved profit margins. As of last month, Boeing had 148,000 workers. About half its employees work in its commercial aircraft unit, where the buyout offers were made. The company had already cut the jetliner unit’s head count by 9% in the past year.

Trump Sends Coal Lobbyist to EPA and Boeing Exec to DoD Published on Friday, March 17, 2017 by Common Dreams Drain What Swamp? Trump Sends Coal Lobbyist to EPA and Boeing Exec to DoD 'Personnel is policy' by Nika Knight, staff writer 0 Comments "How's that swamp draining going again?" (Photo: Defending Our Future/Twitter) A coal lobbyist and a Boeing executive are to be nominated to deputy positions at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Defense (DoD), respectively, making President Donald Trump's campaign promises to "drain the swamp" continue to look like a lot of hot air. Andrew Wheeler, the lobbyist to be nominated as deputy EPA administrator, works for an oil and gas industry-serving law firm and is a registered lobbyist for Murray Energy, the largest privately-owned coal company in the country, according to The Hill. He also served on the staff of climate change denier Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), and will join several fellow former Inhofe staffers at Scott Pruitt's EPA. Patrick Shanahan, meanwhile, is a top Boeing executive with no military or political experience. "He is, however, familiar with defense procurement from the business side,"  reports the Seattle Times, which notes that Shanahan "ran Boeing's military rotorcraft division in Philadelphia for two and a half years, where he was responsible for the Apache and Chinook helicopter programs as well as the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor airplane." (On Friday, it was reported that an attack possibly from a U.S.-made Apache helicopter killed 31 Somali refugees off the coast of Yemen.) The coal lobbyist and Boeing executive join former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson and a plethora of former Goldman Sachs executives in Trump's cabinet. These latest hires continue to confirm suspicions that Trump's policy isn't so much to drain the swamp, as to fill it. Trump's broken promises to drain the swamp weren't forgotten by observers: Goldman Sachs, Exxon, Boeing, and big coal run our government now. https://t.co/YaZ3701uG3 — Arden Jones (@ardenjones478) March 17, 2017 So Coal lobbyist to the EPA and Boeing VP to be second in command at Defense... how's that swamp draining going again? — President Sanford (@DanSantheMan) March 17, 2017 "Personnel is policy," as Washington Post correspondent James Hohmann tweeted: Personnel is policy: A coal lobbyist will be #2 at EPA, a Boeing exec will be #2 at DOD and Goldman's CEO celebrated alumni at WH/Treasury. — James Hohmann (@jameshohmann) March 17, 2017 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License Share This Article Related Articles The Trump GOP Prescription for America: Don’t Get Sick FBI and NSA Chiefs Forced to Fact-Check Boss as Trump Live-Tweets Hearing Memo to the Media: How Not to Cover the President A Last Chance for Resistance More in: U.S. , Donald Trump, Coal, Pentagon, EPA, Goldman Sachs, Corporate Power Top Comments (Click to see more comments or to join the conversation) Join the resistance!

Tech was busy, too. We’re reviewing the potential impact of the Trump administration’s proposed budget; a Boeing executive tapped for deputy defense secretary; healthcare IT doings at Accolade and Limeade; PACCAR’s work on self-driving trucks with Nvidia; Alexa’s move onto Siri’s turf (and an early sign of what advertising via voice assistant may sound like); new stats from PitchBook on VC investments in women-founded companies; and some recommended reads. The details: —Federal research funding flows into Washington’s innovation economy through institutions like Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The budget proposal floated by the Trump administration this week would stanch that flow, with potential impacts to scientists and, eventually, the entrepreneurs who license their discoveries to build new businesses and patients who benefit from novel treatments. It’s a long way from a White House budget proposal to the actual federal budget that determines grant-making levels at agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. But the cuts outlined this week to NIH and other federal agencies provoked a strong response from Washington state’s scientific research community. Fred Hutch and the UW are among the top recipients of funding from NIH, which is in line for a nearly 20 percent cut. As The Seattle Times reports, Fred Hutch President Gary Gilliland said the proposed cuts “are indefensible and would severely impede our progress.”.” Some 85 percent of the research center’s funding comes from NIH. —Pat Shanahan, a senior Boeing executive and University of Washington regent, was nominated to be deputy secretary of defense by President Donald Trump. The Seattle Times has a good look at Shanahan’s Boeing career and what the nomination might mean for the relationship between the aerospace giant and the administration, which got off to a rocky start. —Seattle-based Accolade is teaming up with Teladoc (NYSE: TDOC)—which provides quick access to doctors via phone, mobile app, or Web—to help drive up utilization of the service among people whose health insurance plans cover it. It’s the latest partnership for Accolade, which bills itself as a healthcare concierge, helping people navigate and efficiently use their benefits, and is building an ecosystem of partners that provide those benefits. The company previously teamed up with Bellevue, WA-based Limeade, a corporate wellness technology provider. —Limeade, meanwhile, added a new service that can identify employee turnover risks based on their utilization of corporate wellness programs. Limeade allows employers to examine trends in employee turnover in discrete groups, such as within a given department or location, but not at the level of an individual employee. The insights the dashboard delivers are based on Limeade research showing that “turnover rates were four times higher among employees who weren’t registered for a well-being program compared to registered employees,” the company says in a news release. Employees who registered but had lower participation levels had turnover rates two times higher than those with high levels. —The pace of deal-making and alliance-building in self-driving vehicles continues accelerating. Bellevue-based heavy truck manufacturer PACCAR—which makes trucks under the nameplates DAF, Kenworth, and Peterbilt—is working with NVIDIA, the chip-maker whose graphics processing units are fast becoming work-horses in machine learning applications. The companies said they’ve already developed a proof-of-concept self-driving truck. —If you use Alexa on your iPhone, will Siri be jealous? The turf war over virtual assistants took on a new dimension this week when Amazon put Alexa inside its popular iOS app. Open the Amazon app on your iPhone or iPad, tap the microphone, and Alexa is there. In the words of Wired reporter Brian Barrett: “Amazon’s shopping app, already a top destination, now becomes a Trojan Horse for Amazon’s most promising product in years. Stop in to check the daily deals, and get acquainted with the most fully formed voice assistant out there while you’re at it. Might as well order an Echo or Dot or Tap while you’re in there. The Fire Phone may have fizzled, but who needs it when you’re on the iPhone 7?” —In other voice assistant news, Google Home started inserting what appeared to be advertising into its chatbot’s “My Day” dialogues with users, which provide information about the weather, calendar events, and the like. The Register reports the details of the ad, which promoted the debut of the Disney live action “Beauty and the Beast” reboot. Google’s initial corporate response, which The Register described as “absolutely pants-on-head mad” denied that it was an ad, and then doubled-down on the advertising for the film: “the beauty in the Assistant is that it invites our partners to be our guest and share their tales.” A Google spokesperson later added that it “wasn’t intended to be an ad. … We’re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users and we could have done better in this case.” The indispensable Twitter account of @SwiftOnSecurity took note of the episode and offered the following reminder: We carry a camera and microphone tethered to the greatest, fastest centralization of trust in human history. Arrogance is still ill-advised. — SwiftOnSecurity (@SwiftOnSecurity) March 16, 2017 —Seattle-based PitchBook says venture capital investors funded startups with female founders at a higher rate in 2016 than in any prior year. It’s still a pretty low rate: 16.8 percent of VC investment deals in 2016 went to companies with at least one female founder, up from 16.5 percent in 2015, and 7.2 percent in 2007. —A couple of Xconomy stories to catch up on: Former Gates Investor, Advisor Unveil $200M Biomatics Health Fund Visit the Titanic in OceanGate’s Carbon Fiber Sub: Only $105,129  —And finally, in these fraught and unprecedented times, it’s hard to know what’s important. But this clearly is: Making sure a pint is a pint. Crosscut raised the issue of the city of Seattle enforcing a true, 16-ounce pint. Apparently, there are glasses out there that are designed to hold only 14 ounces, but look and feel like a standard 16-ounce pint. Is there not yet an app for this?

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Mar 18, 2017 at 10:50AM Last November, U.S. legacy carrier United Continental (NYSE:UAL) announced that it would cut its capital spending plans for the next few years by deferring 61 orders for Boeing's (NYSE:BA) workhorse 737 jet. This caused some investors to worry about whether Boeing would still be able to ramp up 737 production as planned. However, Boeing continues to sell current-generation 737s -- confusingly called the 737 Next Generation (or 737 NG) by Boeing -- at a slow but steady pace. Combined with the company's policy of "overselling" its production slots, this means that Boeing's 737 production plans still look safe. Boeing has an aggressive plan for the 737 With demand for the aging (but highly profitable) Boeing 777 widebody falling off a cliff lately, the Boeing 737 is set to become the company's main cash flow generator in the years ahead. To maximize the 737 program's cash flow and meet customer demand, Boeing plans to aggressively raise output over the next two to three years. Boeing plans to boost production of the 737 by 36% over the next three years. Image source: Boeing. Today, Boeing is building 737 jets at a rate of 42 per month. It will boost production to 47 per month this summer, with plans to increase output to 52 per month next year and 57 per month in 2019. These projected increases are supported by a backlog of roughly 4,400 unfilled 737 orders. That said, most of the remaining orders are for the upcoming 737 MAX variant. Boeing plans to deliver the first MAX airplane next quarter, but it won't fully switch over to 737 MAX production until late 2019 or 2020. Thus, if too many customers want to switch from the 737 NG to the 737 MAX, it will disrupt Boeing's production plan. United changes its plans This explains why so many investors were concerned when United Continental converted a slew of orders from the 737 NG to the 737 MAX. United had ordered 65 737-700s earlier in 2016. However, CEO Oscar Munoz overhauled his management team during the course of the year. The new leadership group decided that the 737-700s weren't really needed. United executives decided in late 2016 that the airline had ordered too many planes. Image source: United Airlines. United Airlines ended up keeping the four orders that were scheduled for delivery in 2017, but converting them to the larger 737-800 model. The other 61 737-700s -- which were set to arrive in 2018 and 2019 -- were deferred indefinitely. United hasn't even decided which version of the 737 MAX it will take. Boeing rebuilds its backlog Ordinarily, order deferrals aren't very worrisome for popular models like the Boeing 737. Airbus and Boeing both routinely take in more orders than their production capacity allows, anticipating that some customers will want to defer or cancel orders for one reason or another. That said, as of January, industry analyst Scott Hamilton observed that Boeing had "pretty much used up its over-sales margin" for the 737 following the big United Airlines deferral. This potentially raised the risk that any future deferral requests would force Boeing to alter its production plans. Yet that line of thinking assumes airlines are done with buying 737 NGs and only want state-of-the-art models like the A320neo and 737 MAX. However, both of those next-gen models have long backlogs. Airlines that need extra planes in 2018 or 2019 may have no choice but to buy an older-technology aircraft like the 737-800. Big "end-of-line" discounts can also spur sales among more price-sensitive airlines. Indeed, orders for the 737 NG are still flowing in at a steady pace. Year to date, Boeing has sold 22 737 NGs, compared to just 15 737 MAX aircraft. Thus, within a few months, Boeing has replaced more than a third of the deferred United orders in its backlog. This result is particularly impressive considering that Boeing was still sold out of 737 NG production slots (or close to it) after the United deferral. It suggests that if a few more customers choose to convert 737 NG orders from late 2018 or 2019 to future 737 MAX orders, Boeing would have no trouble lining up replacement buyers. The 737-800 and other members of the 737 NG family aren't exactly state-of-the-art anymore. Nevertheless, they are proven performers that airlines are still happy to buy -- at least if the price is right. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

Who's next on his hit list? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Mar 18, 2017 at 10:13AM President Donald Trump is on a roll. A series of tweets targeting the high cost of Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) F-35 stealth fighter jet apparently resulted in LockMart cutting $600 million off the price of a batch of 90 stealth fighters in January. It may have even had something to do with Boeing (NYSE:BA) offering the Navy a steep price cut on a deal to buy a dozen F/A-18 and EA-18G fighters in March. Now, if Boeing could just be convinced to cut the price on its Air Force One contract by a few hundred million, savings resulting from Trump's defense-spending tweet storms could soon top $1 billion. This gets us to wondering: Which big-ticket defense-spending programs will Trump target next -- and which defense companies will see their profits pinched as a result? Here are three possibilities. 1. The $14 billion supercarrier Image source: Huntington Ingalls. Huntington Ingalls' (NYSE:HII) Ford-class supercarrier seems one likely suspect -- and at $14 billion a pop, this gigantic aircraft carrier offers a big potential target for Trump's next tweet storm. Earlier this month, Trump boarded the USS Gerald R. Ford to make a speech in support of his proposal to grow the U.S. Navy to 350 ships in size, including 12 full-size nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. That's two more carriers than we currently have -- which sounds like good news for Huntington Ingalls. But here's the thing: At the same time as Trump made the case for enlarging the Navy, he also suggested that he wants all of these new ships to come with smaller price tags. "The same boat for less money, the same ship for less money, the same aircraft for less money," promised the president. "That's what we do." Unfortunately for Huntington Ingalls, it might also "do" in Huntington Ingalls' current 12.1% operating profit margin, if Trump follows through on his promise. 2. $13 billion for a submarine? Dive, dive! Image source: General Dynamics. Huntington's problems may not end at the water's surface, either. While it's the principal contractor building the Ford-class carriers, Huntington will cooperate with peer shipbuilder General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) to build the new Columbia class of ballistic missile submarines, which will replace the current Ohio class (and up until recently, it was commonly called the "Ohio Replacement Class"). According to the U.S. Navy, Columbia-class nuke boats will cost just $6.6 billion -- eventually, and assuming General Dynamics and Huntington can build them fast enough, and win bulk contracts for their construction, so that efficiencies of scale kick in. But according to the Congressional Budget Office, before that happens, the lead ship of the class -- USS Columbia -- will cost about $13 billion to build. That's bound to create sticker shock at the White House, and it could earn Huntington and General Dynamics some nasty tweets. If this results in lower prices, and reduced profit margins, it could prove especially problematic for General Dynamics, which, unlike Huntington Ingalls, earns only an 8.8% profit margin on its shipbuilding business as it is. 3. Bombs away! (and bombers, too?) Image source: Northrop Grumman. If Trump wants to find a really big big-ticket item to attack, though, he'll need to raise his sights above the horizon -- raise 'em way up, in fact, and scan the skies for Northrop Grumman's (NYSE:NOC) new B-21 "Raider" stealth bomber program. The Air Force initially laid out a goal of buying B-21s for about $550 million. So, pricing its bid at just $511 million per plane, Northrop Grumman may feel it has won itself some immunity from Trump's criticism of too-high military aircraft prices. But there are a couple of caveats I need to point out here. First and foremost, Northrop quoted its $511 million price tag in 2010 dollars -- although its bid to build the plane was placed in 2015. In today's dollars, the plane is already expected to cost closer to $558 million per unit. Additionally, this per-plane cost refers only to the cost of construction and does not include the cost of developing the B-21 in the first place. Once you add all of the costs in, the actual cost to U.S. taxpayers of building a fleet of 100 B-21 stealth bombers comes to $79.2 billion (best case), or even as much as $93 billion (my best estimate). Across a fleet of 100 aircraft, that works out to nearly $1 billion per airplane, or about 10 times the average cost that Lockheed Martin is targeting for its F-35 stealth superjet. A tempting target for a mean tweet from Trump? I think so. Northrop Grumman had better "watch its six," or its fat 13% operating profit margin could soon be at risk.

Aerospace company Boeing is all set for "involuntary layoffs" in may, media reports said. On Friday, Workers at the company's Washington state factories were informed by their union that Boeing had issued a federally-required notice that "involuntary layoffs were scheduled for May", CNN Money reported A Boeing spokesman confirmed the 60-day notice, but declined to say precisely when it would initiate the layoffs. Boeing has been cutting staff to reduce costs since early 2016, primarily through buyouts and the attrition of executives, managers and engineering staff. The notices are the first official signal from the company that it will lay off some of the factory workers who assemble its jets. A person familiar with the notices said this latest round of cuts in May would affect fewer than 500 staff. After years of record buying, the pace of orders for Boeing's twin-aisle jets, including its 777 and 787 Dreamliners, has slowed significantly. Boeing is cutting back current-generation 777 production, its most profitable large jet, by nearly 60% from its peak. As of last month, Boeing had 148,000 workers. About half its employees work in its commercial aircraft unit, where the buyout offers were made. The company had already cut the jetliner unit's head count by 9% in the past year. --IANS vgu/ (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Workers at the company’s Washington state factories were informed by their union that Boeing had issued a federally-required notice that “involuntary layoffs were scheduled for May.” A Boeing spokesman confirmed the 60-day notice, but declined to say precisely when it would initiate the layoffs. Boeing has been cutting staff to reduce costs since early 2016, primarily through buyouts and the attrition of executives, managers and engineering staff. The notices are the first official signal from the company that it will lay off some of the factory workers who assemble its jets. A person familiar with the notices said this latest round of cuts in May would affect fewer than 500 staff. The Machinists union in Seattle, which represents thousands of Boeing employees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After years of record buying, the pace of orders for Boeing’s twin-aisle jets, including its 777 and 787 Dreamliners, has slowed significantly. Boeing is cutting back current-generation 777 production, its most profitable large jet, by nearly 60% from its peak. Boeing is adjusting its employment to account for that lost revenue and is under pressure to offer better prices to airlines while promising Wall Street improved profit margins. As of last month, Boeing had 148,000 workers. About half its employees work in its commercial aircraft unit, where the buyout offers were made. The company had already cut the jetliner unit’s head count by 9% in the past year. –CNNMoney’s Chris Isidore contributed to this report.

By The Herald Editorial Board Someone will have to explain to us the logic in following a call for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending during a presidential campaign with a budget proposal that seeks to cut and in some cases eliminate federal support for a range of transportation projects and services that are vital to the state’s and nation’s economy and quality of life. President Trump, in order to pay for some $58 billion in new spending in his budget proposal — $54 billion of it to balloon the Defense Department budget to $639 billion — proposes $58 billion in cuts in discretionary spending at 19 other agencies and several other programs. The Environmental Protection Agency and State Department suffer the deepest cuts. But significant cuts are made throughout the federal government, including about $2.4 billion, a 13 percent reduction, for the Transportation Department, reducing its budget to $16.2 billion. Those cuts, if adopted by Congress, would reach Snohomish County and the rest of Washington state. Among projects in the county that could lose federal funding: Community Transit’s Swift II bus line, a bus rapid transit route that is supposed to begin service in 2018, connecting the Boeing plant at Paine Field, the park-and-ride at McCollum Park and the park-and-ride at Canyon Park in Bothell. The $66.6 million project was to be split, 70 percent through federal New Starts transportation grants, about 25 percent from state funding and about 5 percent from local tax revenue and other local sources. (Despite Trump’s budget proposal, Community Transit spokesman Martin Munguia, in a blogpost Friday, said that the project is moving ahead and has authorization from the Federal Transit Administration to begin work prior to final approval of its grant.) Lynnwood’s extension to Sound Transit’s Link light rail system, which is to connect a Lynnwood station to the larger light rail system by 2023. The $2.35 billion project was to be split with 50 percent federal funding and 50 percent from local and state sources, including car tabs, sales tax and rental car tax. Trump’s budget also would: cut federal support from many Amtrak routes, including the two that serve Washington state, the Empire Builder and Coast Starlight; seek to privatize airport air traffic control; and eliminate subsidies that provide commercial air service to rural airports. Most curious, when stood next to Trump’s promise of $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements, is the $499 million in cuts to the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery program. The TIGER program, created through legislation sponsored in 2009 by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, has provided $4.6 billion in funding for road, rail, transit, ports and even bicycle and pedestrian projects. Beyond the federal investment, the program leverages state and local funding for such projects, averaging $2 in state and local funding for every $1 in federal spending. TIGER grants have supported 16 projects in the state with $239 million in funding. Most recently, TIGER provided $10 million last July for $55 million in improvements to cargo-handling facilities at the Port of Everett’s South Terminal, work that will support Boeing’s 777X program. Another $10 million TIGER grant was the final piece of funding necessary for the $129 million project for a new Mukilteo terminal for Washington State Ferries. Snohomish County has previously applied for a $16 million TIGER grant to replace the 83-year-old Granite Falls Bridge over the Stillaguamish River, part of the Mountain Loop Scenic Byway between Granite Falls and Darrington. The TIGER program has faced threats of cuts in the past. House Republicans in 2014 proposed only $100 million for the program. But it has bipartisan support in the Senate. Sen. Murray, who is the ranking minority member on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees transportation projects, is joined in her advocacy by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is the subcommittee’s chairwoman. But more than bipartisanship in Congress will be necessary to save transit programs and transportation grants. Transportation projects in the past could typically count on some level of support from both parties. Things have now changed. A month ago, Sound Transit officials were relatively confident of federal funding, noting past support regardless of which party held the White House. Sound Transit spokesman Geoff Patrick told The Herald’s Noah Haglund: “Transportation is strongly linked to economic prosperity. In many ways, it’s a very nonpartisan issue.” But following release of the president’s budget, Sound Transit CEO Peter Rogoff described the zero-out of federal funding as a “body blow.” “We did not anticipate a scenario in which the federal government would completely walk away from the table after decades of partnership with cities across America,” Rogoff said in a release. Trump, practicing his “art of the deal,” may be making an opening gambit here, asking for everything to position himself before negotiating. That may work in real estate, but it’s a lousy way to write a budget because it attempts to pit scores of worthy programs and agencies against each other. Are we to choose between TIGER grants and funding for PBS, between Meals on Wheels and cleanup of Puget Sound, between after-school and summer programs for students and medical research by the National Institutes of Health? Last year, Congress disregarded President Obama’s budget, and declined testimony from the director of the Office of Management and Budget. Congress, likewise, should round-file President Trump’s budget.   Most Read Future of Boeing’s 787 seems secure, but maybe not in Everett EVERETT — Weak orders for the Boeing Co.’s sleek 787 Dreamliner have… Mar 20th, 2017 by Dan Catchpole Learning doesn’t stop for students stranded by snowslide MILL CREEK — The 42 students from Henry M.

Trump's Money Man Jane Mayer, The New Yorker March 19, 2017 AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File Last month, when President Donald Trump toured a Boeing aircraft plant in North Charleston, South Carolina, he saw a familiar face in the crowd that greeted him: Patrick Caddell, a former Democratic political operative and pollster who, for forty-five years, has been prodding insurgent Presidential candidates to attack the Washington establishment. Caddell, who lives in Charleston, is perhaps best known for helping Jimmy Carter win the 1976 Presidential race. He is also remembered for having collaborated with his friend Warren Beatty on the 1998 satire “Bulworth.” In that film, a kamikaze candidate abandons the usual talking points and excoriates both the major political parties and the media; voters love his unconventionality, and he becomes improbably popular. If the plot sounds familiar, there’s a reason: in recent years, Caddell has offered political advice to Trump. He has not worked directly for the President, but at least as far back as 2013 he has been a contractor for one of Trump’s biggest financial backers: Robert Mercer, a reclusive Long Island hedge-fund manager, who has become a major force behind the Trump Presidency.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 March 2017 by Military News Ninth Boeing-Built Wideband Global SATCOM Satellite to Expand Military Communications Capabilities for U.S., Allies CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., March 18, 2017 – Boeing’s [NYSE: BA] ninth Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellite launched into orbit today and will provide the United States and six allied nations with increased communications capabilities to prevent, protect against and respond to attacks. The WGS-9 satellite was funded through an agreement between the United States and Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and New Zealand, and will also serve Australia (which funded the WGS-6 satellite). Each partner country gains access to the capabilities provided by the full WGS system, which include flexible and secure communication transmissions in the X- and Ka-band frequencies. “This unique international collaboration increases military interoperability and expands affordable high-data-rate communications for U.S. and allied partners around the globe,” said Rico Attanasio, executive director, Boeing Department of Defense/Civil Satellite Programs. “WGS-9 is among the most capable military communication satellites on orbit today.” WGS-9 launched on a United Launch Alliance Delta IV rocket. Boeing is on contract for 10 WGS satellites, the last of which is tentatively scheduled for launch in 2018.

ULA Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email A United Launch Alliance Delta 4 rocket boosted a $424 million military communications satellite into orbit Saturday evening, the latest in a globe-spanning constellation of high-speed relay stations used by the United States and a half-dozen partner nations. The Boeing-built Wideband Global SATCOM -- WGS-9 -- communications station will provide high-speed communications services to U.S. and allied nations, including drone command and control, voice and video links, messaging, data relay, email and television broadcasts to troops in the field. The satellites are used by The White House, the State Department and all branches of the U.S. military. Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and New Zealand paid for two of the satellites in the fleet and are able to use a portion of the network in return.    A time exposure captures the fiery trail of a Delta 4 rocket as it shot away from Cape Canaveral Saturday night carrying a powerful military communications satellite. United Launch Alliance “WGS provides anytime, anywhere communications for soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and international partners through broadcast, multicast and point-to-point connections,” said Robert Tarleton, director of the Air Force’s Military Satellite Communications Systems at the Space and Missile Systems Center. “This very successful cooperative effort, along with the U.S. and Australia cooperative effort for WGS-6, enhances the foundation for long-term cooperation in military satellite communications and has been very effective in promoting increased interoperability among our strategic allies.” Putting on a spectacular weekend sky show, the Delta 4’s hydrogen-fueled main engine and four strap-on solid-fuel boosters ignited on time at 7:44 p.m. ET, generating 1.8 million pounds of thrust and instantly pushing the booster away from launch complex 37 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Generating a brilliant plume of fiery exhaust visible for miles around, the 217-foot-tall rocket smoothly climbed away, consuming propellants at a furious rate, shedding weight and quickly accelerating. The four strap-on boosters burned out in pairs and were kicked away from the first stage about one minute and 42 seconds after liftoff. The Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-68A first stage engine shut down as planned just under four minutes into flight. The spent stage then fell away and the second stage RL10B-2 engine, also built by Aerojet Rocketdyne, ignited and fired for another 15-and-a-half minutes to put the vehicle and its satellite payload into a preliminary elliptical orbit. A second three-minute burn finished the job and about 42 minutes after liftoff, the 13,000-pound Wideband Global Satcom 9 satellite was released into a so-called “super-synchronous” transfer orbit with a low point of around 270 miles and a predicted high point of about 27,571 miles. Over the next several weeks, small on-board thrusters will be used to circularize the orbit at an operational altitude 22,300 miles above the equator. At that altitude, satellites take 24 hours to complete one orbit and appear to hang stationary in the sky, allowing the use of fixed antennas on the ground along with line-of-sight communications with mobile forces. After WGS-9 reaches its final orbit, Boeing engineers will spend several weeks checking out and testing the relay station and maneuvering it to a classified position before turning it over to the Pentagon. WGS-9 and WGS-8, launched last December, are both expected to be operational later this year. One more WGS satellite will be launched late next year, the tenth member of a constellation replacing older Defense Satellite Communication System spacecraft. Each WGS spacecraft has 10 times the capability of the older satellites and, starting with WGS-7, an additional 17 percent improvement in bandwidth due to operational changes. WGS 8 and 9 feature 90 percent more bandwidth than earlier models using a high-tech router-like device known as a Wideband Digital Channelizer provided by IBM. The solar-powered satellite features eight steerable X-band beams and 10 Ka-band beams covering 19 independent coverage areas, along with full-Earth coverage in X-band. This was the 35th launch of a Delta 4 rocket since the current version of the booster began flying in 2002, all of them successful. Including less powerful Delta 2 boosters and Atlas 5 rockets, ULA has now flown 118 successful missions in a row. ULA, a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, was formed in December 2006. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

What do you make sure to pack? Comox, B.C. pilot Dale Erhart is packing six First World War replica biplanes all into one Boeing C-17 for his flight. He and his flight team will be reenacting the harrowing experience of some of the earliest pilots when they head to France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the iconic Battle of Vimy Ridge on April 9. Canadian historians consider the battle to be a pivotal moment in our history. "We want to honour our veterans and pay homage to really the birth of our nation," said Erhart, speaking during On the Island. Erhart is part of the group Vimy Flight, a team that has been training with the planes at 19 Wing Comox Airport. Once their mission is completed in France, the two Sopwith Camel "Pups" and four Nieuport scout aircraft will be loaded back into the Boeing and flown back to Canada. There they will unload again, reassemble, and fly the biplanes to Ottawa in time to perform at Canada's 150th anniversary celebrations. The flight team will be taking part in numerous activities during the celebrations overseas — Erhart said they have received numerous requests for flyovers at many locations, including Vimy. He said the real work however begins when they touch down. "Once we're on the ground we draw all the attention, and that's when we'll be able to provide the stories." Erhart said he is eager to share the experiences of Canadian pilots, many of whom only had a few hours of flight experience before strapping into the single open cockpit aircraft and flying into battle more than a century ago. A logistical challenge Earhart said the biplanes are relatively small, with most measuring only 6.7 meters across. With help from the Royal Canadian Air Force his team was able to interlock the Nieuport planes in a staggered position to make them all fit in the C-17. The replica aircraft include two Sopwith "Pups" and four Nieuport 11s. (Dale Erhart/Facebook) They then took the wings off of the Sopwith Pups and slid them under the Nieuports, cramming the fuselages behind the bigger aircraft. Earhart said there has been a tremendous amount of administrational support from the regulatory bodies involved including the French government and Transport Canada. 'Once you get into the air, it's marvelous' Erhart was an Air Canada pilot for 20 years after his military career that saw him fly numerous aircraft. After training with the biplane replicas for months in preparation for the celebration, he said piloting them is a completely different experience.  "You get into something that weighs 600 pounds, where you're combating any sort of light wind gusts and you have very low power settings ... It's a challenge," he said. "But once you get into the air, it's marvelous." Erhart said he and his team (all of whom are former military pilots) felt incredible freedom flying the planes — they had a range of visibility rarely experienced in modern aircraft.

Army and 'International' Customers Buy Apache Attack Helicopter For $3.4B By Janice Williams @manhattanjan On 03/18/17 AT 10:10 AM Close The U.S. Army is slated to receive a new fleet of Boeing's latest Apache attack helicopter after striking a deal with the American aircraft company. The sales to the Army and an unidentified international customer total $3.4 billion, but it wasn't clear what portion of that is the Army purchase. The Army will get 244 re-manufactured Apache “E” variant helicopters while the international customer will receive 24 brand new models, Boeing said in a statement Thursday. The multi-year deal, which is said to be a “significant savings to taxpayers,” is the first of its kind for the Apache “E” variant.  Boeing has sold Apache helicopters to the U.S. and 15 other countries for more than 30 years, but only seven countries outside of the U.S. have purchased the “E” model since its creation in 2011. "This agreement is great news for our Army, our soldiers, the American taxpayers, our industry partners and numerous international partners,” U.S. Army Col. Joseph Hoecherl, the project manager for the Apache deal, said. “It is a direct result of the professional dedication and diligent efforts by government and industry teammates to provide the much-needed capabilities of the world's best attack helicopter—the AH-64E Apache—at a fair and affordable price that results in year over year savings to the taxpayer. In the hands of our trained U.S. soldiers, the Apache's technologies and resulting capabilities are essential to Army operations around the globe." It wasn’t known how many years the U.S. Army and the international client were given to pay off the debt, but Boeing insisted the re-manufactured attack helicopters came at an “affordable price.” Trump has been critical of Boeing aircraft's hefty price tags, telling the company during a South Carolina rally in February that the “price is too high" for the presidential aircraft, Air Force One. The president said he would consider replacing the current Air Force One with a competitor’s aircraft manufacturer, which may potentially be Lockheed Martin. However, Trump said he would be open to using Boeing aircraft to replace the Lockheed Martin F-35s that the Army is currently using.

The bad choice of a German who joined Lufthansa as an apprentice mechanic, and had no worthwhile management experience except working in middle management within a subsidiary, raises questions about the motives of those who selected him to head PIA. Why does every government, from General (retd) Pervez Musharraf to Asif Zardari and now Nawaz Sharif’s, choose to appoint semi-literate controversial persons, whether they be a high school educated PIA pilot or this mechanic or shoe manufacturer, and expect to turn around this ailing white elephant? From the controversial swap of brand new DC-10 with the aging Boeing jumbo, to the leasing of Russian aircraft for Hajj or Umrah in the 1980s or 1990s, or Boeing and Airbus thereafter, PIA’s successive managements and their corporate planning have always paid between 60 per cent and 90 per cent more cost than the leasing rate by private airlines and other regional operators. It could only have happened in Pakistan that PIA bought Boeing 747-300 from Cathay Pacific without engines, for which the airline was paying separately per hour. Which airline would buy brand new B777 and then choose a blacklisted aircraft seat manufacturer to install seats with defective in-flight entertainment? Should alarm bells not have been raised when in 2005, PIA cancelled manufacturer recommended vendors along its network and appointed a single supplier located in a remote part of the UK only to end up being imposed with a partial ban by the EU in 2007 because of maintenance and safety issues? With no accountability, it only encouraged a corrupt political crony to appoint a single supplier for all spare parts based in Dubai resulting in half of the fleet being grounded. All this happened with approval of the board of directors, some of whom were also on the CAA governing body and aware of the leasing cost of comparative aircraft operated by private airlines. It is common knowledge that even sensitive recruitments, including pilots and engineers, are being made in violation of merit and that nepotism reigns supreme with whole families serving in the airline, compromising flight safety. I doubt whether any accountability would take place even after the interior minister’s intervention and FIA probe, because it would expose the mafia within the establishment, bureaucracy, the political elite and their cronies within PIA and CAA, who have destroyed this airline.

This is the first multi-year agreement for the Apache "E" variant. The Army will receive 244 remanufactured Apaches while 24 new ones will go to the international customer. "This agreement is great news for our Army, our soldiers, the American taxpayers, our industry partners and numerous international partners," said U.S. Army Col.

By Ian Jefferies Amazon reportedly has ambitions to develop its own delivery fleet to round out its already massive sales operation. Under the theoretical business model Amazon won’t need UPS, FedEx or the U.S. Postal Service to deliver the diverse set of goods consumers now receive at their doorstep. The idea is novel, and perhaps even doable for the Seattle-based company. But until then, and even when implemented, a fundamental truth remains: Amazon — like other corporate titans such as Boeing and Microsoft — will need an integrated shipping network to seamlessly move goods from production to warehouses before last-mile delivery. And for that to be feasible, another truth remains: Our nation’s most storied means of moving goods — freight railroads — will play an integral role, moving finished consumer goods between boats and trucks, as well as the variety of goods that help make the products we use daily without always remembering what occurred to create them. However, against the backdrop of structural market and traffic shifts — namely the steep decline of a coal sector that railroads invested to support (sometimes at the government’s behest) — this will only occur if policymakers forgo measures that induce uncertainty and threaten revenues required for investments to maintain and upgrade infrastructure and equipment. Freight rail is part of a network that together moves some 54 tons of good per American each year. This includes basic goods — food, consumer goods, automobiles — as well as critical resources — water treatment materials, agricultural fertilizer and home-powering energy resources. The movement of these goods profoundly impacts the economy and communities. Major U.S. rail carriers supported 1.5 million jobs, generated $33 billion in local, state and federal taxes and produced $274 billion in economic activity in 2014 alone. Sustaining this positive force depends on investment — railroads spent more than $30 billion alone in 2015 — which rests on economic freedom to earn necessary revenue. So it is especially troubling that members of an independent agency known as the Surface Transportation Board want to disregard Congressional intent and reregulate railroads through a series of questionable measures. Just last year, in a praiseworthy effort led by the Senate Commerce Committee — on which Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, serves — Congress plotted a path for the board. It expanded membership from three board members to five and allowed greater autonomy. It did not, however, direct the board to reregulate commodities such as iron and steel without any request to do so from these industries. Nor did Congress hope the board would consider capping rates of return that railroads can earn. But most importantly, reauthorization in no way advocated for “forced access,” a rule that would require railroads to open their lines to competitors. Under this framework, Railroad A gets access to Railroad B’s infrastructure and customer because the government forces Railroad B to do so — not because it is the optimal route. It is a radical approach that disregards property rights, ignores the time-consuming nature of railroad switches and forces carriers to provide access at below-market rates. It would create chaos as railroads deal with widespread orders to switch traffic and would lessen railroad efficiencies and it would reduce railroads’ abilities to invest in their networks. This, despite the clear correlation between partial deregulation in 1980, $600 billion in investments since, and historic improvements in safety, service and pricing. Federal reregulatory efforts occur amid a steep drop in coal production, permitting red tape and an uptick in bullish state and local governments. Just this year, in a measure that was ultimately withdrawn but may now re-emerge, the Spokane City Council proposed fining rail cars carrying crude oil or coal. The unprecedented move is a microcosm of what the larger business community faces: unfounded opposition. The collective result of these factors, particularly if the proposed regulations are enacted, is a slowed rail and logistics network and a lack of needed dollars for private infrastructure that helps the Washington and U.S. economies. Railroads are as safe, resourceful and reliable as ever in 2016 because they are treated the same as other private businesses. This should remain the case, as positive public impact rests on public policy pillars that allow for differential pricing, nimble operations and a respect for private property rights. The Senate Commerce Committee continues to recognize the need for a healthy and financially viable freight railroad sector.

In initial tests, the company achieved 58 kilowatts of power but expects its laser to reach its full potential by the time of its delivery in the next few months. The laser is what the company calls a “combined fiber” laser beam, bringing together individual lasers to form a single, stronger beam. Lockheed has been testing it at an installation in Bothell, Wash., and plans to ship it to an Army installation in Huntsville, Ala., in the next few months. “We’re really at the dawn of an era of the utility of laser weapons,” said Robert Afzal, senior fellow for laser and sensor systems at Lockheed Martin. The Army’s specialized military vehicles “can now carry something which is small enough and powerful enough for what we believe will be militarily useful.” Multiple military agencies and defense companies have been working on laser weapon capabilities. In 2014, Boeing published a video of its 10-kilowatt laser destroying a mortar in flight. Proponents say lasers could be cheaper than traditional munitions systems because they don’t require expensive projectiles and they don’t need to be reloaded. That could make the system useful in taking down airborne adversaries, such as off-the-shelf drones. The idea of an off-the-shelf drone fleet commanded by a non-state entity presents new challenges for a global military establishment that has focused for centuries on war with other governments. For example, Gen. David Perkins said this week that a U.S. ally had taken down an adversary’s off-the-shelf quad-copter – which can be purchased online for a few hundred dollars – with a multimillion-dollar Patriot missile. Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said: “That’s $3 million to shoot down a three-or-four-hundred-dollar drone. . . . What if you could do that with a beam of light that costs a buck?” More powerful projectiles such as Hellfire missiles are also more likely to cause collateral damage, making them less practical in certain situations. Proponents say laser weaponry could be more precise and ultimately more effective against small airborne targets. Lasers “hit targets at the speed of light, they cost almost nothing per shot, and they have an almost unlimited number of times they can be used,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the nonprofit Lexington Institute, which receives funding from defense firms including Lockheed Martin and Boeing. “A medium-sized laser should be able to take out any number of drones in a very short period of time because they are so fragile.” The Navy has already deployed a ship-based laser that it says is ready for combat use, but the Army faces a unique set of challenges. To protect American soldiers from low-budget drone fleets, the Army would need a highly mobile laser that can sit on the back of a truck. The agency would have to find a way to carry enough battery power to fire continually without the truck overheating. Such a large power source isn’t a problem if it’s stationary on a ship or military installation, but moving it around the battlefield might be difficult. With the 60-kilowatt laser announced this morning, Lockheed says that it has reached that goal and that the weaponry is ready to be deployed. “In terms of the maturity of this technology to be field-able on an Army vehicle, this technology is ready for that,” Afzal said. The company said its initial testing showed the laser to be near physical limits for accuracy and reasonably energy-efficient, directing 43 percent of electricity used to power it directly into the laser itself, helping it deal with the mobility problem. The system is designed to be a low-weight solution that sits on a ground-based vehicle called a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), essentially a truck designed for carrying large artillery. The Army already has laser weapons it is testing, but Lockheed’s laser may have advantages in power and portability. The 60-killowatt laser has its origins in the Defense Department’s Robust electric laser initiative, which started in 2010 and ended when a 15-kilowatt laser was developed. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, has its own initiative to create a turret-based laser that can fire downward from an aircraft.

By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day | March 15, 2017 -- 02:00 GMT (19:00 PDT) | Topic: Security NEW YORK -- Millions of records from a commercial corporate database have been leaked. The database, about 52GB in size, contains just under 33.7 million unique email addresses and other contact information from employees of thousands of companies, representing a large portion of the US corporate population. Dun & Bradstreet, a business services giant, confirmed that it owns the database, which it acquired as part of a 2015 deal to buy NetProspex for $125 million. More security news Secret Service laptop with Trump Tower plans stolen from car Feature or flaw? How to hijack a Windows account in less than a minute Internet of Things security: What happens when every device is smart and you don't even know it? Microsoft Edge used to escape VMware Workstation at Pwn2Own 2017 The purchased database contains dozens of fields, some including personal information such as names, job titles and functions, work email addresses, and phone numbers. Other information includes more generic corporate and publicly sourced data, such as believed office location, the number of employees in the business unit, and other descriptions of the kind of industry the company falls into, such as advertising, legal, media and broadcasting, and telecoms. This entire database is used for marketers who want to directly target their own email campaigns and through other communications methods for current and prospective customers. The data can be bought either in bulk or by type of record by companies, but it's not known exactly how much the going rate is for a full data set of this size. We understand from a 2015 brochure that the cost of accessing a half-million records can cost some firms up to $200,000. Troy Hunt, who runs breach notification site Have I Been Pwned, obtained the database and analyzed the records. In a blog post Tuesday, Hunt said the breakdown was entirely US-focused. California was the most represented demographic, with over four million records, followed by New York with 2.7 million records and Texas with 2.6 million records. Hunt's analysis of the records showed that the leading organization by records is the Department of Defense, with 101,013 employee records, followed closely by the US Postal Service with 88,153 employee records. The US Army, Air Force, and Department of Veterans Affairs are all listed with a combined 76,379 records. AT&T, Boeing, Dell, FedEx, IBM, and Xerox were among the most named companies in the database, with tens of thousands of employee records each. "Whilst you could piece together parts of the data from information already in the public domain, having it aggregated and so easily searchable in this fashion is enormously valuable," said Hunt in an email on Tuesday. "It also serves as a reminder that we've lost control of our privacy; the vast majority of people in the data set would have no idea their information is being sold in this fashion and they certainly don't have any control over it." Hunt ran the exposed database through Have I Been Pwned's database of breached records, which showed 14 percent of email addresses already existed in his database. The data is now searchable in Have I Been Pwned. But it's not known exactly how the data was exposed, or who is to blame for the leak. A spokesperson for Dun & Bradshaw would not talk on the record beyond an emailed statement, sent prior to publication. "We've carefully evaluated the information that was shared with us and it is of a type and in a format that we deliver to customers every day. Based on our analysis, it was not accessed or exposed through a Dun & Bradstreet system," the statement read. How to contact securely: Zack Whittaker can be reached securely Signal or WhatsApp at +1 (646) 755–8849, and his PGP fingerprint for sending email is: 4D0E 92F2 E36A EC51 DAAE 5D97 CB8C 15FA EB6C EEA5. Read More The spokesperson said an internal investigation showed that while the data belongs to the company, its own systems were not breached or exposed. The company added that the data was approximately six months old and the bulk data had been sold to "thousands" of other firms. Dun & Bradstreet downplayed the risk to its customers and those it collects data on. The company said that the data contains "generally publicly available business contact data, used for sales and marketing purposes." That doesn't lessen the possibilities for abuse of this data, said Hunt. "When you have someone's first and last names, their job title and their email address along with the company they work for, you have [personal identifiable information]," he said in his blog post. "And that's really what makes this a highly volatile collection of data; this much personal information on this many people and set in the context of their professional roles poses numerous risks to the organizations involved here," he said. This kind of data can be used by marketers, but it can also be used by nefarious actors who target victims for malicious gain. In recent years, there have been a spate of phishing attacks designed to target financial officers and other senior corporate staff, in an effort to trick employees into turning over financial information to later con money from tax returns. This data would make it easy for cybercriminals to carry out those kinds of attacks, said Hunt in an email. "It's an absolute goldmine for phishing because here you have a huge amount of useful information from which to craft attacks," he said. "From this data, you can piece together organizational structures and tailor messaging to create an air of authenticity and that's something that's attractive to crooks and nation-state actors alike." It's not clear if the sale of this kind of data falls within data protection and privacy laws, though the company maintains it is compliant with US privacy laws. He added that the company sometimes inadvertently collects "much more highly sensitive and confidential personal data," which it doesn't provide or sell to customers and actively purges from its own records. The company wouldn't comment on how the leak will affect its business, with no clear indication of how many times the data may have been accessed, downloaded, or shared. But for ordinary corporate workers whose data has been sold thousands of time, Hunt said there's "zero" chance of claiming their data back.

Lifestyle People Channeling the power of arts into education . Charlie Neuman / San Diego Union-Tribune/Zuma Pre Merryl Goldberg, music professor at Cal State San Marcos and founder and executive director of Center ARTES. Merryl Goldberg, music professor at Cal State San Marcos and founder and executive director of Center ARTES. (Charlie Neuman / San Diego Union-Tribune/Zuma Pre) Lisa DeaderickContact Reporter The arts have long been an important part of Merryl Goldberg’s life, from the time she was a little girl, playing around on the bongos before she could walk to more recently teaching music and overseeing an organization that focuses on arts education and integrating the arts into primary and secondary schools. “I founded Center ARTES in 2003 to bridge the power of the arts with research in education,” she says. “Over the years, we have partnered with the San Diego County Office of Education, reached nearly every school district, and have facilitated programs with arts non-profits to provide professional development with classroom teachers.” As founder and executive director of Center ARTES at California State University, San Marcos — where she’s also been a music professor for the past 24 years — Goldberg and her team come up with ways to support students and teachers through the arts, bolstered by research. They write grants, partner with schools and organizations, and conduct research. She’s even written a book on the subject, “Arts Integration: Teaching Subject Matter Through the Arts in Multicultural Settings.” Goldberg, 58, lives in Carlsbad with her daughter, who’s a high school senior. She took some time to talk about her book, the research behind integrating arts with traditional education, her organization’s literacy initiative, and her mean left hook. Q: Why did you found Center ARTES? A: I’ve never met a kid who wasn’t capable; I have met a lot of kids who haven’t had opportunities. I was one of those kids for whom the arts opened a world of possibility. It enabled me to find solace when I was bullied in the fourth grade, and it literally brought me around the world after college as a professional musician on tour. The arts motivate students in the most wonderful ways. Like any language, the arts provide bridges and mirrors: bridges to the world and experiences, and a mirror to reflect on oneself. When arts are integrated into the classroom, I often hear teachers say, “I never knew this child could do so well; my shy students are coming out of their shells, my English language learners are participating!” Q: What led you to write your book on arts integration? A: For me, it’s about opportunity. Too many kids do not even have access to arts in their education, which puts them at a disadvantage in terms of a career path. For example, CEOs at companies (that include) Boeing and ViaSat specifically seek to hire individuals with arts backgrounds. The work in high-tech requires individuals who are engaged creative thinkers, can think outside the box, and work in cooperative teams. Twentieth century careers rely on the skills of cooperation, flexibility and empathy. Simply put, arts teach all those skills. Learning through the arts is a far cry from rote learning, which in the end doesn’t amount to much in the real world. Q: Overall, what would you say your book tells people about how to integrate arts in these settings? A: The book is a how-to on using the arts throughout the curriculum. For example, how to use a painting to study math, how writing a song can teach you about history, or how drawing from nature can be an effective science lesson. The book is really pragmatic in that it has chapters on how to teach reading, math, science, and social studies through art, music, dance, theater and media arts. What I love about Carlsbad … My neighborhood sits behind the Agua Hedionda lagoon — it is gorgeous. The entire neighborhood is awash in enjoyment over our slice of nature. Many of us have fire pits and we sit together enjoying a glass of wine while watching the nightly “crow show.” Thousands upon thousands of crows nest every night in the Agua Hedionda lagoon. It’s quite a show. Q: What can you tell us about this initiative to improve literacy through the arts? A: “ART=OPPORTUNITY” is a team effort involving leaders in arts, education and business. It is a research-based initiative that provides leadership training, literacy residencies, summits, workshops and anchor events for educators, parents, youth and teens and arts providers. To further our goals we’re creating hands-on materials. We’ve created baseball cards with the research-based messaging points to be used in teacher education settings, professional development, parent education and even in classrooms. … Our goals are to change public opinion from arts as fluff, to arts are essential, and then get schools to provide students with real opportunities to learn in, and through, the arts. To excel in education, attain better jobs and develop empathetic citizens; research shows arts can have a significant role in each of these. Q: What programs do you have planned for this year as part of this initiative? A: We just concluded a literacy residency with award-winning children’s book authors Sara Pennypacker and Jon Klassen. Our next event features the PASACAT Philippine Music and Dance ensemble in a workshop for teachers at the California Center for the Arts, Escondido on May 2. Next fall, we are planning two big summits, one for arts teachers and teaching artists, and a teen summit. We’ve also partnered with business executives to provide mentoring for district visual and performing arts coordinators. We will be also collecting stories from all segments of our community on how the arts have provided opportunities for success. Eventually, we’ll have an online platform for the stories and a museum exhibit. Q: How can literacy be improved through the arts? A: First off, I’d like to debunk the notion that literacy is separate from the arts. The arts are, in and of themselves, literacy. Have you read a picture book to your child lately? You’re literally reading pictures. As part of our recent literacy residency, author/illustrator and Caldecott Award-winner Jon Klassen engaged families at The New Children’s Museum in “reading” pictures. Dance, theater and music are also universal languages through which we express and interpret our understandings of the world, our emotions, and document our cultures. Q: You teach music and you also play in a Klezmer band? A: I was on the road for 13 years performing with the Klezmer Conservatory Band out of Boston. Klezmer is eastern European Yiddish music — think the wedding scene from “Fiddler on Roof,” tap your toes, and you’re there. I play the saxophone. Though I don’t tour any more, I play my saxophone for nearly every keynote talk I do. It’s an attention-getter and gives me an opportunity to engage audiences in an art experience firsthand. The band toured all throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe (including Poland), Australia and New Zealand. I also performed in the USSR (the former Soviet Union) in 1985, though our tour was cut short. In a wonderful twist of the universe, I’m slated to visit St. Petersburg, Russia, in April to deliver a keynote to a joint audience of musicians and scientists. I’m bringing my sax with me. Q: What was the first instrument you learned to play? A: Ha! When I was in second grade, I saw a picture of the saxophone in my music book. I knew I had to play it, but when I was in the fourth grade and we could choose an instrument, my parents wouldn’t let me play the saxophone. They said it was a “boy’s” instrument. So, I took guitar lessons. However, I snuck saxophone lessons, and look, it paid off. By high school my parents relented. Q: What’s been challenging about your work in arts education? A: A challenge for me is working with my students to catch up on all the arts education they’ve missed out on in their K-12 education. When I ask my student teachers to make a collage about the arts in their lives, the three most popular arts are: fashion, tattoos and cars. It saddens me that most of my college students have never had the opportunity to be on a stage, hold a paintbrush in their hand, or play an instrument. I can’t even begin to think about what talent has gone untapped. Q: What’s been rewarding about it? A: Being around people, especially young people who are imaginative, creative, innovative, is an amazing privilege. I also revel in being part of changing the landscape of education so that all kids (especially kids who have not had opportunities) have a chance to have arts too. Q: What has doing this work taught you about yourself? A: I think I’m pretty darn resilient, persistent, hopeful, and definitely dedicated to seeking out possibility; at the same time, I hope I’m kind. Q: What is the best advice you’ve ever received? A: These seven words: “I’ll have to get back to you.” Q: What is one thing people would be surprised to find out about you? A: I’m an avid boxer. I’ve been boxing for years and I have a wicked left hook. Seriously. Q: Describe your ideal San Diego weekend. A: I always start out my weekend with a boxing workout at the UFC gym in Carlsbad, then a walk at the beach or on the Oceanside pier, and happy hour at Vigilucci’s market in Carlsbad Village with friends. Sunday morning is reserved for hanging in my backyard reading the New York Times, a nature walk at the lagoon off of Manchester, where fish fly out of the water, capped off with a theater performance at one of San Diego’s fabulous theaters.

Announcement from US Air Force LOS ANGELES AIR FORCE BASE EL SEGUNDO, California—The US Air Force successfully launched the ninth Boeing-built Wideband Global SATCOM satellite aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV  Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle from Space Launch Complex 37B, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida at 8:18 p.m. EDT.  "WGS-9 launch marks an important occasion for the Wideband constellation as it is a major milestone in a 20-year partnership with Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand," said Mr. Bob Tarleton, director of Space and Missile Systems Center's Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate.   "This accomplishment is the result of the remarkable relationship with our international partners and our exemplary operations at the 45th Space Wing, 50th Space Wing, and industry," said Tarleton. "Thanks to the astounding commitment, focus on the mission, and team work, we successfully launched the next satellite in the WGS satellite constellation." This mission demonstrates the Air Force's continued commitment to deliver secure and reliable satellite communications around the globe to U.S. forces and her allies.   WGS satellites play an integral part in the strategic and tactical coordination of military operations.  With this launch, WGS-9 will significantly enhance the current WGS constellation by providing increased communication capacity and coverage.  Improving on previous WGS satellites, WGS-9 utilizes a state-of-the-art channelizer, which increases the communication capacity by approximately 45% compared to the first seven WGS satellites.  Over the next few months, Boeing will begin on-orbit testing of WGS-9 to verify performance and prepare the satellite for operational use. Ultimately, WGS-9 will be controlled by the US Air Force's 3rd Space Operations Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base.  The WGS-9 satellite will enter operations in October 2017.  With one more satellite in production, the WGS constellation is planned to have a total of 10 satellites on orbit by 2019.   Topical Tags :  Military    Agencies    Launch    Satellite Operator    Service Provider      Regional Tags :  Asia/Asia Pacific    Europe    North America             FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News University of Alberta's Ex-Alta 1 Smallsat to Dig Into Space Weather Orbital ATK Adds Their Expertise and Technologies to ULA's WGS-9 Launch Strike and a Social Movement Cause Delay at Arianespace Pressure Mounts on Australian Government to Launch Space Agency Marlink Involved in Hybrid Digital Network for Iraqi O&G Company More News Eutelsat Approves of ND SatCom's Plug 'n Play Ka-Band Terminal Enhanced RF Wireless Testing for US Government Program Supported by Quintech Electronics Mesh Test Matrix Multimedia Exchange Platform for Arab States Broadcasting Union Secures Newtec Dialog® Technology On the CABSAT 2017 Show Floor...

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A Delta IV rocket blasted off Saturday night (March 18) to deliver a $445 million U.S. military communications satellite into orbit, the ninth member of a planned network of 10 satellites. Built and flown by United Launch Alliance, the 22-story tall booster lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station here at 8:18 p.m. EDT (0018 March 19 GMT), soaring out over the Atlantic Ocean after a 34-minute delay to resolve an issue with ground support equipment. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Perched on top of the rocket was the U.S. Air Force's ninth Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellite, built by Boeing. Once in position more than 22,000 miles (35,400 km) above the equator, the satellite, known as WGS-9, will join a constellation that provides the military's highest capacity communications service. The WGS network is used to relay television broadcasts, video conferences, images and other high-bandwidth data to and from ships, aircraft, ground forces, operations centers, the U.S. Department of State, the White House and select partners worldwide. The spacecraft support both X-band and Ka-band communications, which are parts of the electromagnetic spectrum used for data transmission. The satellites can seamlessly cross the bands to accommodate voice, data, video and other types of communications over a broad range of ground-based and mobile terminals.  "WGS provides anytime, anywhere communications for soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and international partnership through broadcast, multicast and point-to-point connections," said Robert Tarleton, director of the Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate at Air Force Space Command in Los Angeles. © Provided by Space.com In exchange for part-time use of the WGS network, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and New Zealand picked up the $442 million bill to manufacture WGS-9. The United States has a similar partnership with Australia, which paid for the WGS-6 spacecraft that was launched in 2013. International partners receive proportional access to the bandwidth provided by the WGS constellation based on financial contribution, the Air Force said. The 10th and final member of the WGS constellation is targeted for launch in late 2018.  Follow Irene Klotz on Twitter @Free_Space. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Opinion Editorial: Trump low-orbit space budget clips high expectations During Florida visit Trump promises space, tech jobs Presidential candidate Donald Trump promises space and technology jobs for Central Florida. Presidential candidate Donald Trump promises space and technology jobs for Central Florida. Privacy Policy When President Trump unveiled the outline of his first federal budget proposal this past week, many analysts described it as a mixed bag for America’s space program. We’d call it a missed opportunity. There’s bad news and good news for space. While Trump proposed cutting $200 million, or about 1 percent, from NASA’s $19.3 billion budget this year, the space agency would fare much better than other non-defense agencies; the EPA, for example, is the target of a proposed 31 percent cut. The president called for canceling NASA’s mission to send astronauts to an asteroid, but preserving funding to develop the agency’s next rocket and crew vehicle. He advocated a deep cut in NASA’s Earth science programs, but maintained support for a robotic mission to Jupiter’s moon Europa. However, the president’s plan falls short of revitalizing and redirecting the manned space program after years of sluggishness and drift under President Obama. It fails to meet the high expectations Trump created last month in his first speech to Congress, when he declared, “American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.” Trump’s budget outline doesn’t take a side in the ongoing debate over whether the moon or Mars should be NASA’s next destination for U.S. astronauts. And its lower bottom line for NASA will make it harder for the agency to dig out of the rut it’s been stuck in since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. U.S. astronauts have been forced ever since to hitch rides to and from the International Space Station on Russian rockets. A NASA backed effort to support private rocketeers SpaceX and Boeing in developing the capability to carry crew to the station is behind schedule due to insufficient funding. A couple of days before the president unveiled his budget outline, the Planetary Society, a foundation dedicated to promoting space exploration, released a video letter from CEO and “Science Guy” Bill Nye with five recommendations on space for the president. One was to remain focused on a goal of sending astronauts to Mars. Another was to raise NASA’s budget 5 percent a year for the next five years. Nye asserted that funding increases at this modest level would keep the space agency on course to reach the Red Planet by the 2030s. The series of spending hikes recommended by the society would raise NASA’s budget to $24.6 billion by 2022. This total hike of $5.3 billion is puny next to the $1 trillion that the president wants to invest in rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure. And as Nye said in the video letter, NASA funding “is money that gets spent on Earth, in the United States, and supports tens of thousands of jobs across the country” — a pitch that should especially resonate with the president. Trump’s budget reflects at least one of the society’s recommendations: “Embrace commercial space.” He would continue Obama’s policy of supporting companies in developing rockets to carry U.S. astronauts to low Earth orbit, and would hand over more responsibility for the space station and satellites to the private sector. This is a smart way to free more of NASA's limited resources for more-distant missions. Trump still hasn’t named his NASA administrator. He has yet to follow through on a promise made by two aides during his campaign to reconstitute the National Space Council under the leadership of Vice President Mike Pence. He’s expected to release more details on his budget in the coming weeks. It’s possible his plans for space could become clearer, and better. Meanwhile, the focus will shift to Congress, where members draft and pass the budgets that actually become law. Congress recently approved a bill sponsored by Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson that would direct NASA to send humans to Mars in the next 25 years. It also would continue support for SpaceX and Boeing as they develop rockets to carry U.S. astronauts. It would increase NASA’s budget — though just 1 percent next year, not the 5 percent proposed by the Planetary Society. Unlike most other issues and agencies in Washington, D.C., the space program and NASA enjoy bipartisan support. Historically, investments in space have yielded scientific and technological breakthroughs and elevated America’s international prestige. In Florida, the nation’s launching pad, at least 11,600 aerospace companies with 132,000 employees contribute more than $17 billion a year to the state’s economy. Congress would be wise to build on what Trump has proposed, and make sure the space program is part of any infrastructure plan they might pass at the president’s initiative.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 18, 2017 9:13am   Comments Share: Related Ambarella And Life After GoPro Ambarella's Growth Fails To Impress, Analyst Sees 'Rough Road' Ahead Related AVAV 22 Stocks Moving In Wednesday's Pre-Market Session Earnings Scheduled For March 7, 2017 The U.S. deployment of attack drones in the tense Korean theater is a symbol of not only the role unmanned aircraft are playing in the so-called war on terror, but a sign of a rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive defense market dependent on robot warfare. Business, as they say, is booming. Jane's Defense is forecasting that the world's militaries will spend $82 billion based on a forecast of 63,000 military drones being sold in the next 10 years. “It’s a really crowded marketplace,” said Dan Wasserbly, an analyst at IHS Jane's/IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO). “Everybody makes these things now." At least 140 specific models of drone are used by the world’s defense agencies for either surveillance or to take out human and other ground targets, according to the Military Factory, with the U.S. using them heavily in Afghanistan and Iraq. Though there are philosophical arguments against using these killer robots, it’s clear drone warfare is ingrained in global defense budgets of all sizes. 2 Military Vendors Hold Half Of Drone Market The long-endurance Gray Eagle drones being deployed in South Korea are manufactured by the privately held General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., the leading military drone contractor, though some engines and armaments are provided by publicly traded companies. The Gray Eagles carry the potent, armor-penetrating Hellfire missiles produced by the Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT). General Atomics, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC), Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) account for 66 percent of the drone market, according to the defense intelligence journal C4ISTNET. It said that General Atomics’ MQ-9 Reaper — powered by a Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) engine and a Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) targeting system — accounted for more than a quarter of the defense drone market. "General Atomics is the top vendor that owns more than a third of the defense market at more than $4 billion," the journal said, quoting a study by market research firm Govin. "Northrop Grumman is a distant second with less than half of that capture. Combined, these top two vendors account for more than 50 percent of the UAS [unmanned aircraft systems] market. Textron owns 10 percent of the market, while Boeing rounds out the top four with seven percent." Anti-Drone Defense: A Growing Sector  The increased reliance on drones likely will lead to attempts by competitors to break into General Atomics lion's share of the market, said Philip Finnegan, director of corporate analysis for the Teal Group, a defense and aerospace analytical firm. One of the big growth sectors in the drone defense business is developing anti-drone defense systems to deal with the deluge of small drones that can be used for guerrilla warfare. The radical Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have perfected the use of drones for surveillance and is seeking to weaponize them. Wasserbly said it wouldn't be a good investment to use a missile to down a drone, since many are so cheap and small. Boeing and Northrop Grumman are developing systems for truck-mounted laser guns for the U.S. Army, Wasserbly said. The nonprofit Battelle Memorial Institute makes the “DroneDefender,” which shoots radio frequencies to confuse enemy drone’s GPS systems. “It looks like a really impressive rifle,” Wasserbly says. The Teal Group's Finnegan said drone counter measures are vital. "There's going to be explosive growth in that area," he said. "It is going to be huge." Billions At Stake The Teal Group's latest study estimates that military unmanned aircraft will rise from a $2.8 billion business in 2016 to $9.4 billion in 2025. The civilian, local government and commercial side has perhaps even more potential, with Teal forecasting the $2.6 billion in sales last year reaching $10.9 billion by 2025. Business Insider predicted overall U.S. drone revenues — both military and commercial — would reach $12 billion by 2021 compared to $8 billion in 2015. Like any other sector, there are risks. The Motley Fool picked AeroVironment Inc.(NASDAQ: AVAV) among the four of the best drone stocks last year, but sales soon plunged. Another pick, Elbit Systems Ltd. (NASDAQ: ESLT) was up more than 37 percent from a year ago and another, Ambarella Inc. (NASDAQ: AMBA) was up more than 48 percent from a year ago. The degree to which a reliance on aerial robots will render existing manned systems obsolete is unclear. Though drones have replaced some attack helicopters, Wasserbly said unmanned systems are more “supplemental” to global defenses. The U.S. military has for years used unmanned vehicles and vessels to combat mines, and advanced robotics in those areas are expected to also grow. "Unmanned military ground, sea and air vehicle technology is evolving rapidly and we are seeing strong growth across all three sectors over the next five to ten years," said Derrick Maple, principal analyst for unmanned systems at IHS Jane's.

( Source: Youtube) Elon Musk’s SpaceX won its second-ever launch contract from the U.S. military by underbidding an alliance of defense industry giants. Cost was a determining factor in awarding the $96.5 million contract to Space Exploration Technologies Corp., Claire Leon, the Air Force’s launch enterprise director, said on a conference call Wednesday. The company will launch an Air Force GPS satellite on an upgraded Falcon 9 rocket sometime in 2019.

Musk’s Falcon 9 rocket won U.S. Air Force certification for national security space missions in May 2015, breaking a lock long held by ULA. Contracts for military launches include satellites that let troops communicate on battlefields and are estimated to be valued at about $70 billion through 2030, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. With the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, SpaceX has a $1.6 billion contract to resupply the International Space Station and a second pact valued at as much as $2.6 billion to transport crews to the orbiting lab. The closely held company expects to launch a commercial satellite early Thursday and to launch its first “flight proven” rocket — one that has been flown and recovered on land or at sea — later this month.

SEATTLE — Anxious questions about the future of the United States’ trade policy dominated a gathering of trade-dependent businesses Monday in Seattle. Trade policy used to be the domain of businessmen and businesswomen, attorneys, regulators and policy wonks toiling in relative anonymity. Now, widespread economic anxieties have put it in the crosshairs of national politics. Thousands of jobs and business worth billions of dollars across Washington are tied to trade. Many local employers — Amazon, Boeing and Brooks Sports, to name a few — have prospered off globalization and freer trade. With so much to gain, it is easy to find supporters for international commerce here. However, elsewhere in the state and across America, people see trade as undercutting local economies and throwing communities and families into financial chaos. That angst contributed to President Donald Trump’s election in November. Opening U.S. ports and borders to foreign goods has contributed to an exodus of manufacturing and other jobs, he claimed on the campaign trail. Trump’s harnessing of widespread economic anxiety and trade skepticism has put him at odds with many in the Republican Party, a longtime champion of trade. Like many fellow moderate Republicans, Rep. Dave Reichert, who represents much of King County, has walked a careful path — advocating for trade without running afoul of the White House. At the Washington Council on International Trade’s conference Monday, Reichert told the audience that Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a tentative trade deal with 11 other nations, was “disappointing, but it’s not the end.” Reichert, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Trade, said he expects the president to soon take up a “renegotiation (or) a re-examination” of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The deal went into effect in 1994 and substantially removed barriers to economic activity between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. Trade skeptics have long blamed it for undermining large swaths of the American economy. Scrapping or overhauling the deal was a marquis promise from candidate Trump. The president has set a clear tenor when it comes to trade. However, how his tone translates into policy is less clear. “This is a highly unpredictable … situation,” the Congressman said, pausing while he scanned the crowd. Reichert said he agrees with Trump on three points: Trade deals should be fair, should create jobs in the U.S. and should spur American exports. “I think we have a great possibility here to move things forward. It’s not going to be easy,” Reichert told The Daily Herald after speaking at Monday’s conference. The new administration is still working on how it wants to change or replace NAFTA, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said during an interview on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News Channel. Changes to American trade policy could have huge implications for Washington’s economy, which heavily relies on foreign trade. “Any time you start talking about raising tariffs, other countries are going to retaliate,” said Carl Wollebeck, who manages the Port of Everett’s marine operations. “So, yeah, I get nervous.” Many of the ships that call at the Port of Everett are bringing goods to or from South Korea, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and other nations, he said. Limits on trade quickly can affect what moves through the port’s terminals. For several years, a steady amount of steel from New Zealand had moved into the U.S. through the Port of Everett. Recently, the U.S. invoked anti-dumping protections on the commodity. Imports of New Zealand steel “stopped. We don’t get that anymore,” Wollebeck said.   Most Read Future of Boeing’s 787 seems secure, but maybe not in Everett EVERETT — Weak orders for the Boeing Co.’s sleek 787 Dreamliner have… Mar 20th, 2017 by Dan Catchpole Learning doesn’t stop for students stranded by snowslide MILL CREEK — The 42 students from Henry M.

Toner comes to the position after working as a principal engineering manager in Microsoft’s cloud division for a year. Throughout his career, he has spent more than nine years working for the company in both the U.S. and the U.K. He also spent six years leading engineering teams at Amazon, including in AWS, and has served as a software architect for the Seattle Sounders and a mentor for the 9 Mile Labs incubator. He will drive engineering and operations strategy for Amplero, a particularly important role as the company is preparing to expand its platform. “Seattle is a hotbed for data-centric and AI technology advancements, and Amplero is no exception. They are at the forefront of the emerging artificial intelligence industry, and the work they are doing with machine learning and multi-arm bandit experimentation is completely transforming the way brands engage with their customers,” Toner said in a press release. “I am excited to join such an innovative group that is paving the way for this new category of marketing.” Marjorie Thomas. (LinkedIn Photo) — The Allen Institute announced this week that Marjorie Thomas will join the institute as CFO on May 8. Thomas is currently the CFO of media delivery software company RealNetworks, where she has worked for the past two years. She has also held senior financial positions at Intuit, Sony Electronics and Hewlett Packard. As the Puget Sound Business Journal reports, the job listing for the CFO position details a plan to double the headcount of the Allen Institute in a surge of growth. “We are fortunate to have such an experienced, accomplished and visionary business leader join our executive team,” Allen Institute CEO Allan Jones said in a press release. “I look forward to working with Marjorie as the Institute continues to accelerate foundational research and make a transformational impact on science around the world.” Maria Karaivanova. (Madrona Photo) — Madrona Venture Group announced the addition of two new employees: Maria Karaivanova joins the firm as a principal, and Alice Ryder will serve as the company’s director of investor relations. Karaivanova joins the company from Bay-Area IT services provider Cloudflare, where she spent five years leading business development. She also has past experience at Intel and Boeing. She will use that technological expertise to evaluate investment opportunities, focusing on enterprise and security. Alice Ryder.

She has also held leadership positions at Expedia and Clearwire. She will work with Madrona investors and continue to build out the firm’s C-suite program, which connects C-level leadership with Madrona portfolio companies. “Both Maria and Alice embody what we look for at Madrona, experts in their field who have a passion for working effectively with entrepreneurs and innovative ideas,” said Tim Porter, managing director, Madrona. “While they have been on board just a short time, each of them has already made meaningful contributions, and we are looking forward to working together in the coming years.” Ryan Windham. (Cedexis Photo) — Portland-based Cedexis — a well-funded startup that manages the transfer of things like app data, video, and other content — announced the promotion of Ryan Windham to CEO. Windham was previously Cedexis’ VP of product and strategy, prior to which he spent three years in leadership and executive roles at F5 Networks. Cedexis’ current CEO, Scott Grout, will become the company’s executive director. “A window of opportunity has opened for Cedexis, and I, along with the company, plan to move quickly and assertively to meet the challenge. Today’s DevOps teams are looking for truly cloud-native solutions to ensure reliable, efficient, and massively scalable application delivery for modern application architectures; Openmix provides exactly the platform to meet that need. We truly are in the right place at the right time and I look forward to leading the charge for the great change ahead at Cedexis,” Windham said in a press release. Don Antonucci. (LinkedIn Photo) — Don Antonucci, previously the president of Seattle-based healthcare provider Regence Blue Shield, announced this week that he is leaving the company to serve as the chief business development officer for San Francisco-based digital healthcare company 10xHealth. Antonucci had been a leader in various Regence branches for seven years. At 10xHealth, he will oversee business development for a young cloud-based digital health service that focuses on bringing down healthcare costs for its customers. “Today’s insured healthcare markets are ripe for transformation because premiums are too high and too much healthcare is suboptimal,” Antonucci said in a press release. “Poor outcomes, wasteful workflows and high error rates account for at least 30 percent of what we do in healthcare and as much as 70 percent of what we spend. I believe the adoption of 10xHealth’s advanced IT and risk management solutions will enable the nation’s most innovative health insurers to lead their markets with a ‘best care – best cost’ competitive position and accelerate their growth in share, revenues and earnings. Having the opportunity to join the team and help scale the adoption of these advanced solutions is something I wanted to be a part of.” Paul Farmer.

In initial tests, the company achieved 58 kilowatts of power but expects its laser to reach its full potential by the time of its delivery in the next few months. The laser is what the company calls a “combined fiber” laser beam, bringing together individual lasers to form a single, stronger beam. Lockheed has been testing it at an installation in Bothell, Wash., and plans to ship it to an Army installation in Huntsville, Ala., in the next few months.   “We’re really at the dawn of an era of the utility of laser weapons,” said Robert Afzal, senior fellow for laser and sensor systems at Lockheed Martin. The Army’s specialized military vehicles “can now carry something which is small enough and powerful enough for what we believe will be militarily useful.” Multiple military agencies and defense companies have been working on laser weapon capabilities. In 2014, Boeing published a video of its 10-kilowatt laser destroying a mortar in flight. Proponents say lasers could be cheaper than traditional munitions systems because they don’t require expensive projectiles and they don’t need to be reloaded. That could make the system useful in taking down airborne adversaries, such as off-the-shelf drones. The idea of an off-the-shelf drone fleet commanded by a non-state entity presents new challenges for a global military establishment that has focused for centuries on war with other governments. For example, Gen. David Perkins said this week that a U.S. ally had taken down an adversary’s off-the-shelf quad-copter — which can be purchased online for a few hundred dollars — with a multimillion-dollar Patriot missile. Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said: “That’s $3 million to shoot down a three-or-four-hundred-dollar drone. . . . What if you could do that with a beam of light that costs a buck?” More powerful projectiles such as Hellfire missiles are also more likely to cause collateral damage, making them less practical in certain situations. Proponents say laser weaponry could be more precise and ultimately more effective against small airborne targets. Lasers “hit targets at the speed of light, they cost almost nothing per shot, and they have an almost unlimited number of times they can be used,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the nonprofit Lexington Institute, which receives funding from defense firms including Lockheed Martin and Boeing. “A medium-sized laser should be able to take out any number of drones in a very short period of time because they are so fragile.” The Navy has already deployed a ship-based laser that it says is ready for combat use, but the Army faces a unique set of challenges. To protect American soldiers from low-budget drone fleets, the Army would need a highly mobile laser that can sit on the back of a truck. The agency would have to find a way to carry enough battery power to fire continually without the truck overheating. Such a large power source isn’t a problem if it’s stationary on a ship or military installation, but moving it around the battlefield might be difficult. With the 60-kilowatt laser announced this morning, Lockheed says that it has reached that goal and that the weaponry is ready to be deployed. “In terms of the maturity of this technology to be field-able on an Army vehicle, this technology is ready for that,” Afzal said. The company said its initial testing showed the laser to be near physical limits for accuracy and reasonably energy-efficient, directing 43 percent of electricity used to power it directly into the laser itself, helping it deal with the mobility problem. The system is designed to be a low-weight solution that sits on a ground-based vehicle called a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), essentially a truck designed for carrying large artillery.  The Army already has laser weapons it is testing, but Lockheed’s laser may have advantages in power and portability. The 60-killowatt laser has its origins in the Defense Department’s Robust electric laser initiative, which started in 2010 and ended when a 15-kilowatt laser was developed. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, has its own initiative to create a turret-based laser that can fire downward from an aircraft. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/03/16/lockheed-martin-says-it-is-ready-to-hand-over-laser-weapon-to-u-s-army-for-testing/?utm_term=.624fbc423c6b Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

See the launch highlights here.  ( Getty Images ) Advertisement United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV rocket launched the ninth Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS-9) space mission for the U.S. Air Force on Saturday, March 18. The 22-story payload lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The launch, which was broadcasted live on YouTube and ULA's official website, reportedly experienced a 34-minute delay because of a glitch with its ground support equipment. Check out the highlights of WGS-9's launch. The Penultimate: WGS-9 US Military Satellite The WGS-9, which has a jaw-dropping price tag of $445 million, is the second to last in the 10-fleet state-of-the art satellite communication system for the U.S. military. Once in its target position at approximately 22,000 miles above the equator, the latest addition to the advanced WGS network is expected to take the country's military communication service to a whole new level — transmitting real-time television broadcasts and video conferences and high-bandwidth data to and from U.S. Air Force ships, aircraft, ground troops, operations centers, the U.S. Department of State, the White House, and various allies from around the world. International partners are allowed proportional access to the bandwidth provided by the WGS constellation based on financial contribution, according to the Air Force. Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand shared a total of $442 million to produce WGS-9. Australia, on the other hand, paid a part of the 2013 WGS-6 project. WGS-10 is currently in the works with a target launch of 2019. X-band And Ka-band Support WGS satellites support both X-band (weather monitoring, air and marine vessel traffic control, defense tracking, and vehicle speed monitoring) and Ka-band (close-range targeting on military aircraft) radar frequencies. The satellite can support 8.088 gigahertz of bandwidth, with an expected downlink speed of up to 11 Gbps. "WGS provides anytime, anywhere communications for soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and international partnership through broadcast, multicast, and point-to-point connections," Robert Tarleton, director of the Military Satellite Communications Systems Directorate at Air Force Space Command in Los Angeles, said. WGS Program And Delta IV The mission marks the seventh flight of the Delta IV in the Medium+ (5,4) configuration for the WGS-9 mission and its 35th launch since its inauguration in 2002. It has launched all WGS satellites in orbit today. The Boeing Co. was awarded the first contract to develop the WGS system, which initially proposed two satellites, in 2001. With its expendable launch vehicles Atlas and Delta, it has facilitated numerous U.S. government space missions in the last five decades. The U.S. Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Reconnaissance Office, and the U.S. Air Force are among the prominent organizations in its launch portfolio. The United Launch Alliance is a 50-50 venture between the Lockheed Martin Corp. and the Boeing Co., established in 2006.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) WASHINGTON (Los Angeles Times/TNS) - FirmGreen Inc., a Newport Beach, Calif., renewable energy company, is preparing to start construction on a solar project in the Philippines. The job could have yielded about $180 million in contracts to U.S. manufacturers to supply most of the equipment — but the work most likely will be done in China instead. When FirmGreen was unable to get the necessary loan guarantees from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, it had to seek them from China’s version of the federal export-credit agency, Chief Executive Steve Wilburn said. And that financial assistance was available only if FirmGreen promises to manufacture the project’s equipment in China. “I’m a patriot. I’m a former Marine, a 100 percent disabled Vietnam vet, and for me to have to go to China and other overseas sources for manufacturing goes against my grain,” Wilburn said. “But I have to survive as a businessman.” Now exporters such as Wilburn, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, are urging President Trump to help fix the Ex-Im Bank — a move they said would boost the White House’s efforts to increase U.S. manufacturing jobs and reduce the nation’s trade deficit. Two administration Cabinet secretaries have indicated they support the bank. But it’s unclear whether Mr. Trump will take action, adding to the uncertainty that has plagued the controversial agency in recent years. Many conservatives would like to kill it altogether. The bank, opened during the Great Depression, helps U.S. companies sell their products overseas by providing loan guarantees to foreign buyers and other assistance for sales of goods manufactured domestically. It has strong support from Democrats and business-friendly Republicans. About 85 other countries have similar export-credit agencies. Such aid is crucial for projects in developing nations, which often require government-backed financing and scare private banks because of fears of default. But the Export-Import Bank has been hobbled for more than a year by board vacancies that prevent it from approving financial assistance to any project of more than $10 million. That means FirmGreen hasn’t been able to get financing for its Philippines project — and Wilburn said he can’t wait any longer. In the 2016 fiscal year, the bank authorized just $5 billion in financing — a quarter of what it did in its last fully operational year in 2014 and the smallest amount in four decades. The Trump administration has sent mixed messages about the bank, which many conservatives strongly dislike even though it costs the government no money and has generated a total profit of $3.8 billion for taxpayers since 2009. Those opponents, including groups such as Heritage Action for America and the Club for Growth, say the bank’s assistance is corporate welfare that largely helps mega-companies such as Boeing Co. and General Electric Co. that don’t need the aid. The bank’s default rate is well below 1 percent. But conservatives worry because taxpayers are on the hook for any losses the bank can’t cover on about $87.2 billion in outstanding assistance. House Republican leaders blocked the bank’s reauthorization in 2015, leading to its closure for five months. After supporters pushed through legislation authorizing the bank to operate until Sept. 30, 2019, a key Senate Republican committee chairman blocked confirmation of President Obama’s nominees to fill vacancies on the board. The five-person board has only two members, one short of the quorum needed to approve assistance for larger projects. As a result, the bank said, 40 such projects with a total value of $30 billion are waiting for approval. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he didn’t think the bank was needed. “It’s sort of a featherbedding for politicians and others, and a few companies,” he told the conservative National Review in 2015. “And when you think about free enterprise, it’s really not free enterprise. I’d be against it.” And the bank reportedly is on a hit list of programs that the White House budget office wants to eliminate in the upcoming federal budget. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney voted against the bank’s 2015 authorization when he served as a Republican House member from South Carolina. The bank is funded by interest and fees on its aid, and it sent $284 million in profit to the Treasury last year. Although the bank receives no appropriations, lawmakers each year set the amount it can spend to pay salaries and other overhead. But recently, Mr. Trump has appeared to do an about-face, signaling support for the bank. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., a bank proponent, said Mr. Trump promised her after a Feb. 9 White House meeting that he would nominate a third board member. “I specifically talked with the president about the need to get the Export-Import Bank up and running,” she said in a Senate speech a week later. “The great news is that President Trump agrees, and he informed me that we can in fact say he supports the Ex-Im Bank and that he would be nominating someone soon to serve on the Export-Import Bank.” White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said last week that she could provide no update on Mr. Trump’s plans for the bank. The only action Mr. Trump has taken came last month, when he withdrew Obama’s January nomination of Democrat Claudia Slacik to fill one of the board’s vacancies. That could have indicated he doesn’t plan to fill the vacancies or simply that he wants to make his own nominations. Two key Cabinet members, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, have publicly indicated support for the bank recently, although with changes to focus its aid on small businesses.

News Business Business News Next poised to report fall in full-year profits amid plunging pound The retailer is expected to reveal a 4 per cent slide in annual pre-tax profits to £792m, down from £821.3m last year Ben Woods Sunday 19 March 2017 16:30 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online An increase in import costs due to the weak pound is said to have hit the group hard Getty Images High street giant Next is poised to report a fall in full-year profits this week, as the market looks for any signs of price hikes to mitigate the effects of the plunging pound. The retail bellwether is expected to reveal a 4 per cent slide in annual pre-tax profits to £792m, down from £821.3m last year, as a shift in spending away from clothing and footwear takes its toll on sales. The group said in January that it predicts overall full-price sales to fall by 1 per cent after tough trading over Christmas sparked a 0.4 per cent fall in the quarter to 24 December. Read more Fitch: Retailers Being 'Battered' by Shift to Online Shopping and Changes to How People Buy Clothes Chief executive Lord Wolfson, a pro-Brexit campaigner, has also warned that the cost pressures driven by the Brexit-hit pound could see it hike prices by up to 5 per cent. Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: “The market will be hoping for better news from clothing retailer Next following its fourth-quarter trading update in early January which showed Christmas sales at high street stores below expectations. “A major issue for the group is the increase in import costs due to the weak pound and investors are keen to see if that is going to be passed on to customers or absorbed by the company.” Lord Wolfson offered a gloomy outlook for Next when he updated the market in January, forecasting 2017 to be “even tougher” for the firm and 2018's profits to tumble to between £680m and £780m. He said that while the Government was right not to be rushed into a Brexit plan, fears over the negotiations would heap further pressure on an embattled retail sector.

The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

Getty 6/38 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 7/38 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 10/38 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

We're on our own' — Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) March 16, 2017 * This statement pretty much sums up the Trump administration’s position on climate change: Mulvaney: "We are not spending money on climate change anymore. We view it as a waste of your money." — Dan Primack (@danprimack) March 16, 2017 * Here’s something in Trump’s budget that hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves: President Donald Trump is calling for privatizing the nation’s air traffic control operations in his budget proposal, a top priority of the airline industry. The proposal says spinning off air traffic operations from the Federal Aviation Administration and placing them under an “independent, non-governmental organization” would make the system “more efficient and innovative while maintaining safety.” * Trump tries to pretend that his executive orders on lobbying are how he’s keeping his promise to drain the swamp. But who needs lobbyists when the entire administration is made up of swamp dwellers. Trump’s latest Goldman [Sachs] hire is Jim Donovan, a two-decade veteran of the Wall Street bank, who was nominated to the No. 2 position at the Treasury Department on Tuesday… This week, Trump also reassigned former Goldman Sachs partner Dina Powell to the more prominent role of deputy national security adviser for strategy… Donovan will join a handful of other Goldman alumnus in the Trump administration. Gary Cohn…Jay Clayton…Steve Bannon… * In other swamp news: President Trump on Thursday nominated a top Boeing executive to be the second-highest-ranking civilian at the Pentagon. Trump announced Patrick Shanahan’s nomination to be deputy Defense secretary… * At this point I’m not sure that it matters what Mike Huckabee thinks. But this tweet is the perfect example of the kind of advice you get from the confederate insurgency. Hoping @POTUS tells Hawaii judge what Andrew Jackson told overreaching court-"I'll ignore it and let the court enforce their order." — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) March 15, 2017 * After diving into all that ugliness, I need to go to a different place. I don’t know where these ladies are headed, but I’m going to let them take me there. Nancy LeTourneau Nancy LeTourneau is a contributing writer for the Washington Monthly.

Read more about the partnership here. Answer from Aaron Yip, software engineer: With the turn of the 1900s, Germany was perfectly poised to become the greatest superpower in written history, one of the most industrialized nations at the time (next to UK and Argentina) paired with the biggest military for the following 50 years. The German empire and territories would soon give birth to an overwhelming portion of future Nobel Laureates and many of the greatest minds of the 20th century including Max Born, Hans Bethe, Alexander Grothendieck, Bernard Katz, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Walter Kohn, Hans Adolf Krebs, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, and Albert Einstein. All of these people would be forced to flee the German empire. Where did they go? Well… The United States is universally renowned for its universities and industry giants today like Apple, Google, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox and Uber; as well as Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM all the way to Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, United States Steel, Ford, and General Electric. Albert Einstein, fleeing Germany, would find refuge at Princeton and change the world forever in many ways. On the eve of World War II, he penned a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which would establish the Manhattan Project. There, future Nobel Laureates Hans Bethe and Enrico Fermi, refugees from Italy, ran the labs that invented the atomic bomb to end WW2 for the United States. Picture shows a German 55 euro cents special edition stamp commemorating the the 100th anniversary of the publication of late German-born physicist Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity in Berlin June 15, 2005. Reuters Nobel Laureates With Immigrant Roots Abdul Fattah Jandali is a political migrant from Homs, a city now destroyed by the Syrian civil war. Jandali started university at the American University of Beirut, but protests ultimately forced him to flee Lebanon. He finished his degree at Colombia University in the U.S. and continued with an economics PhD at Wisconsin University. There he met and dated Joanne Carol Schieble, a German-Swiss Catholic. She became pregnant, and they placed their child for adoption in San Francisco. The couple that adopted their baby named him Steve Jobs. In the late 1960s, Michael and Eugenia Brin left the USSR to escape anti-Semitism with their son. Michael Brin became a professor at the University of Maryland, and Eugenia Brin became a research scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Their son, Sergey Brin, received a NSF fellowship that took him to Stanford University. He met Larry Page; the duo became fast friends and transformed information technology. Google was born with an investment of $100,000 by Stanford alum and Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim, a German immigrant. Steve Chen, born in Taiwan, founded YouTube. Jan Koum from Ukraine founded WhatsApp. Brazilian Mike Krieger founded Instagram. Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox founder, is an Iranian-American. Travis Kalanick, Uber founder, was born to Polish and Russian Jewish immigrants. Andrew Grove, born in Hungary, founded Intel. Jerry Yang from Taiwan founded Yahoo, Herman Hollerith from Germany founded IBM and Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart from Germany founded Pfizer. AT&T? Alexander Graham Bell from Scotland; P&G? William Procter from England and James Gamble from Ireland; Goldman Sachs? Marcus Goldman from Germany. Pierre Omidyar, France, founded eBay. Scottish American Andrew Carnegie founded US Steel as well as Carnegie Mellon University. Irishman William Ford and Mary Ford, daughter to Belgian immigrants, raised Henry Ford who in turn founded the Industrial Revolution, automobiles, and the Ford Motor Company. General Electric's Thomas Edison was born to a Canadian father. Walt Disney, Amazon, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, McDonalds — the list goes on and on and on. Fortune 500 Companies With Immigrant Roots These companies employ more than 19 million people globally with combined revenues of $4.8 trillion (2014) for the United States. This figure exceeds the GDP of every country in the world except the U.S., China, and Japan. Immigrants are twice as likely to start a new business than non-immigrants. Seven of the 10 most valuable brands in the world come from American companies founded by immigrants or children of immigrants. A Luo boy was born on the shores of Lake Victoria outside Kendu Bay, British Kenya in 1936. As he grew up, he traveled widely — visiting Europe, India and Zanzibar — and became a cook for missionaries and a local herbalist in Nairobi. In 1960, he attended the University of Hawaii where he met and dated Stanley Ann Dunham, an American woman. Their son, Barack Obama, would become the seventh US president with immigrant parents—a lineage that includes Thomas Jefferson. Stanford Professor Maryam Mirzakhani was born in Iran in 1977. Twenty-two years later, she started her PhD at Harvard University. At 37, she became the first woman to win the Fields Medal—the highest honor in mathematics—putting her in a very small circle that includes Terence Tao, an Australian-American mathematician. Harvard Professor Pardis Sabeti was born in Iran in 1975 and left before the Iranian Revolution. Sabeti pioneering the use of genetic sequencing to track and monitor Ebola during its 2014 outbreak; she established critical measures to control the virus and prevent future epidemics. For 36 years, Iranian-American Firouz Naderi served the U.S. government at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There, he led the deployments of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers to Mars. For his contributions to advancing space exploration, Naderi received NASA's highest honor—the Distinguished Service Medal. SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk. Reuters South African Elon Musk builds on the Martian dream with his work at SpaceX. In his biography, answering why he choose to move to the U.S., Musk says, "The United States is definitely ahead in culture of innovation. If someone wants to accomplish great things, there is no better place than the U.S.” This is absolutely correct. But let us imagine a slightly different world. A world where Maryam Mirzakhani and Pardis Sabeti are Canadian Professors; where Apple and Google are Canadian companies; where Carnegie Mellon University and the Industrial Revolution were founded in Canada; and so were YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber, Sun Microsystems, Intel, Yahoo!, IBM, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Goldman Sachs, eBay, Boeing, Citigroup, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, Walgreen, State Farm Insurance, Lockheed Martin, Walt Disney, Oracle, Amazon, McDonalds, and innumerable other companies. Imagine Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, and Vinod Khosla running Canadian internet giants. For our entire history, our country has been defined by welcoming when other nations oppressed. The most American thing is unconditional love — love that ended wars; love that helped build everything from YouTube and Instagram to McDonalds and Disney; love that uncovered new laws of physics, advanced the frontiers of space, and saved countless millions of lives on earth. The most American thing ever is exclaiming boldly and unyieldingly, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free; the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me.” Those were the greatest minds of the last century who came and helped transform America into the global center of innovation from technology and politics to sciences and the arts.

SpaceX’s Dragon capsule descends under parachutes toward the Pacific Ocean early Sunday. Credit: SpaceX SpaceX’s Dragon cargo craft ended a four-week mission Sunday with a parachute-assisted splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, returning from the International Space Station with more than 3,600 pounds of cargo, blood and urine samples, and specimens from a rodent research experiment aimed at helping patients with catastrophic bone injuries and osteoporosis. Flying northwest to southeast over the Pacific Ocean, the 12-foot-wide (3.7-meter) automated spaceship streaked through the upper atmosphere, its carbon ablative heat shield weathering temperatures up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,650 degrees Celsius). Two drogue parachutes deployed to stabilize the descending ship, then three orange and white main parachutes, each stretching 116 feet (35 meters) in diameter, unfurled to slow the spacecraft to a gentle splashdown speed. The capsule was scheduled to reach the Pacific Ocean around 200 miles southwest of Long Beach, California, at 10:46 a.m. EDT (1446 GMT; 7:46 a.m. PDT), where a small SpaceX recovery crew was on standby to hoist the spacecraft on a vessel for the trip back to the Port of Los Angeles. Once Dragon is back in California, SpaceX will hand over time-sensitive samples to NASA for delivery to science teams around the world. The items inside Dragon’s pressurized compartment include tissue from mice euthanized in orbit. Researchers sent 40 mice into space on Dragon to examine how bone fractures heal in the absence of gravity, and search for the biological reasons why most animals, including humans, cannot regrow lost limbs. “We’re trying to understand what happens in the body as the bones start healing,” said Rasha Hammamieh, the rodent research project’s chief scientist from the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research. The military is co-sponsoring the bone health experiment, with an eye toward learning lessons that could be applied to helping injured soldiers recover from catastrophic bone injuries. There are also implications for civilians, such as elderly patients with osteoporosis. “Up in space, you lose bone,” said Melissa Kacena, co-investigator for the bone experiment and an associate professor of orthopedic surgery, anatomy and cell biology, and biomedical engineering at Indiana University. “In fact, astronauts lose about 1 to 3 percent of their bone density in a month. Someone with advanced osteoporosis loses closer to 1 percent per year.” Kacena added that scientists want to test drugs on rodents that might be able to “rebuild your bone systematically, so it could have applications not only for bone healing, but also for osteoporosis.” Bacterial and stem cell researchers also had a stake in Dragon’s nearly month-long mission. “We are excited to put MRSA, which is a superbug, on the International Space Station and investigate the effects of microgravity on the growth and mutation patterns of these bugs,” said Anita Goel, chairman and science director of Nanobiosym, which developed the experiment with the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space. “I have this hypothesis that microgravity will accelerate the mutation patterns,” Goel said before Dragon’s Feb. 19 launch. “If we can use microgravity as an accelerator to fast forward and get a sneak preview of what these mutations will look like, then we can esssentially build smarter drugs back on Earth.” A science team led by a Mayo Clinic biologist sent human adult stem cells to the space station, pursuing research that could help transplant patients and stroke victims. Materials from the stem cell experiment, which will also help researchers learn how human cancers start and spread, also came back to Earth. SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft is the only vehicle currently capable of returning large amounts of cargo from the space station to Earth intact. The Dragon supply ship is seen just before release Sunday from the International Space Station’s robotic arm. Credit: NASA/ESA/Thomas Pesquet The station crew packed 3,642 pounds (1,652 kilograms) of cargo and research samples inside Dragon’s internal cabin for re-entry, according to a NASA spokesperson. The items included 2,034.9 pounds (923 kilograms) of science equipment, 825.2 pounds (374.3 kilograms) of vehicle hardware, 279.5 pounds (126.8 kilograms) of crew supplies, 228.6 pounds (103.7 kilograms) of miscellaneous spacewalking gear, and 9 pounds (4.1 kilograms) of computer resources. Several items were loaded into the Dragon capsule’s trunk for disposal during its destructure re-entry, including disused hardware from NASA’s Robotic Refueling Mission, an experiment that tested technologies and techniques for future satellite servicing missions. Other gear tagged for disposal include OPALS, an external payload developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which arrived at the station in April 2014 and tested a high-speed laser communications link between the space station and ground stations on Earth. Another package that was fixed outside the space station discarded Sunday was one in a series of Materials on International Space Station Experiments, or MISSE payloads, that tested the radiation tolerance of a new computer system built for long-duration spaceflight. The unpressurized cargo complement that burned up inside Dragon’s trunk on re-entry accounted for around 1,788 pounds (811 kilograms). Dragon’s total cargo load at departure was approximately 5,430 pounds (2,463 kilograms). The Dragon capsule will go to SpaceX’s test facility in Central Texas for inspections, decommissioning and potential refurbishment for another flight. Sunday’s splashdown concluded the 10th visit of a SpaceX Dragon capsule to the space station since May 2012, and the first Dragon flight of the year. The mission launched Feb. 19 atop a Falcon 9 rocket from pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and reached the space station four days later. Astronauts Thomas Pesquet and Shane Kimbrough oversaw the ship’s departure from the complex earlier Sunday, sending the command to release Dragon from the station’s robotic arm at 5:11 a.m. EDT (0911 GMT). Ground controllers at mission control in Houston took control of the Canadian-built robotic arm Saturday to detach Dragon from its temporary berthing port on the research lab’s Harmony module, taking the opportunity to use the cargo craft’s laser navigation sensor and thermal camera to inspect and test a docking adapter installed last year that will eventually be the parking spot for commercial crew carriers in development by Boeing and SpaceX. The SpaceX Dragon cargo craft is pictured during a night pass, with its navigation and strobe lights switched on, just before departing the space station Sunday. Credit: NASA/ESA/Thomas Pesquet Once Dragon was released from the robot arm, the spacecraft conducted three firings of its Draco thrusters to depart the vicinity of the space station. “Houston, it looks like it’s time to say goodbye to Dragon,” Pesquet said. “There’s a part of us that will come back to down to Earth with her, and I mean that literally because it carries lots of important scientific samples, and some obtained directly from the crew. “I know scientists can’t wait to get their hands on their results, and thanks to return vehicles like Dragon, the ISS is able to fulfill its mission of science and discovery,” Pesquet said. “From all the crew of Expedition 50, many thanks and congratulations to all the teams involved in this CRS-10 mission.” Michael Hopkins, an astronaut servicing as spacecraft communicator in mission control in Houston, replied: “Thanks for those words, Thomas, and congratulations to the crew as well. You guys did a fantastic job, as well, always staying ahead of the timeline, and it’s going to be great to get Dragon back on Earth.” Dragon’s Draco thrusters fired again around 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) to slow its velocity for re-entry, and the spacecraft jettisoned its disposable unpressurized trunk section minutes later, discarding the three external payloads at the ends of their missions. The next Dragon resupply mission under SpaceX’s multibillion-dollar contract with NASA is expected to launch no earlier than May, flying with a previously-used pressure shell for the first time. SpaceX’s two cargo contracts with the space agency cover at least 26 logistics deliveries through 2024. Meanwhile, NASA’s other commercial resupply contractor, Orbital ATK, is set to launch its next Cygnus cargo craft to the space station Thursday or Friday from Cape Canaveral aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 booster.

The commercial, from the American Made Coalition, is airing on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday and will appear on cable news channels in the D.C. metropolitan area and several states through April 9. The ad will also run online, according to a coalition spokesman. The ad is the latest example of advocacy efforts on the border-adjustment proposal, which has divided GOP lawmakers and businesses. The proposal, part of the House GOP tax-reform blueprint, would subject imports to U.S. taxes and exempt exports. ADVERTISEMENT Supporters argue that the border tax would level the playing field for American-made products, while opponents argue that it would lead to consumers paying higher prices for goods. Senate Republicans are looking at alternatives to border adjustability, because a growing number of senators have raised concerns about the provision. The ad from the American Made Coalition — which includes Boeing, GE and Merck — references the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation’s estimate that the House GOP tax blueprint would lead to 1.7 million more jobs. The commercial starts with images of lights going out in a factory while somber music plays, and the end of the ad shows lights being turned on. “For years, lights have been turned out in American factories. Lights that likely won't be turned on again,” text displayed in the ad states. “Because of old tax policies, our country has lost millions of American jobs. Stop favoring foreign-made imports over American-made goods. Support tax reform and create 1.7 million new American jobs.” Groups that oppose the border-adjustment proposal have also been running TV ads. Late last month, the National Retail Federation launched an infomercial-parody ad that has aired on “Fox and Friends” and “Saturday Night Live.” The Club for Growth, a free-market group, has run an ad urging Rep. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) to oppose the proposal.   View the discussion thread. Most Popular Most Popular Discussed Past: 1 day 1 THE MEMO: Five takeaways from...

News World Saudi Arabia's billionaire king is on a lavish Asian adventure — here's what he's spending his money on His essentials include plenty of limousines and far too many golden escalators Tom Murray, Business Insider Sunday 19 March 2017 12:26 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online King Salman descends on one of his golden escalators from a plane AFP Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud, who has an estimated net worth of over $17 billion (£13.8 billion), is not one for subtlety. He's currently on a lavish tour of Asia, and has arrived in every country on his itinerary — most recently China — on a golden escalator from his personal plane. He also isn't travelling alone — when he landed in Indonesia, he was joined by an entourage of 620 staff and a further 800 delegates. The pomp and pageantry on display during the tour has caught the world media's attention — and not for the first time. In 2015, he and his 1,000-person entourage caused the closure of a French Riviera beach for three days. Salman's group poured concrete on the beach to install an elevator directly on the sand. The King's most recent trip has lived up to his reputation. Scroll down to see the various extravagant things he's spent his money on while on his Asian adventure. 500 limousines King Salman flew two Mercedes-Benz S600 limousines with him on his trip. You may be thinking: "But what limousines will his entourage travel in?" Don't worry, the Saudi King had 500 limousines ordered into Tokyo to ferry him and his crew around the capital. 1,200 hotel rooms Bad news for luxury travellers in Tokyo at the time of King Salman's visit — they may have struggled to find a spare room. The King booked a reported 1,200 hotel rooms at Tokyo's top hotels to accommodate his staff and delegates. Two golden escalators Because one is never enough. A Lockheed C-130 Hercules How do you transport a pair of golden escalators? You take your military transport aircraft, of course. The Hercules is designed to haul tanks, artillery, and paratroopers over long distances — it can even fly with one engine. In the Saudi King's arsenal, though, it is reportedly used to carry his nearly 500 tonnes of luggage — limousines and escalators included. 100 bodyguards King Salman's 1,500-strong squad includes 25 princes, 10 ministers, and over 100 security personnel. The retinue have a combined net worth in the multi-billions. Six Boeing passenger jets In order to transport the King's entourage of 1,500 people, six Boeing passenger jets were chartered for the trip — including his personal 747, painted in gold. 459 tonnes of luggage The airfreight firm charged with the colossal task of handling the King's luggage said that 63 tonnes of his cargo were unloaded at Jakarta, and the rest were taken with him to his holiday destination in Bali. It's unclear what luxury items are included in King Salman's luggage — besides the escalators and limousines— but there's only so many Fabergé eggs you can fit in a suitcase. • Here are the ages you peak at everything throughout life • The 10 best airports in the world • 34 movies to watch in your 20s Read the original article on Business Insider UK. © 2016.

Caroline Morris was giggling so hard the 8-year-old could barely tell people how she felt about her first airplane flight at the Girls Fly event March 11 at Ocala International Airport. "It was scary but awesome," Caroline managed to get out between laughs as local pilot and aviation writer Judie Betz helped unfasten the first-time flier's safety harness and earphones following a 15-minute introductory flight. The flight reached an altitude of 2,000 feet and a cruising speed of about 120 mph. Caroline got to take the controls and turn the aircraft. "I saw trees and beautiful houses," Caroline said. She was at the event with her mother Carolyn and sister Victoria, 17. The family lives in Summerfield. Caroline loved it so much she said she would definitely go flying again. Betz, a pilot for 30 years, was one of several pilots providing the introductory flights. Betz flew her pink plane named "Bella Rose," which is painted with flowers. The annual event, which is offered by the Women of Aviation Worldwide during Women in Aviation Week, is aimed at encouraging girls in the sport and business of aviation. It included a ground-instruction class on aircraft fundamentals, a tour of the airport control tower and seminars by women involved in different aspects of aviation. Women in Aviation week is observed in March when the first woman received a private pilot's license in 1910, according to Carol Ann Garratt, 62, who has made three flights around the world in her Mooney airplane. Garratt, an invited presenter who conducted several of the programs, said only about 6 percent of people involved in aviation are women. The programs' message is "you can do it," Garratt said. The introductory flight for participants are organized by the Experimental Airplane Association's local chapter 812. According to Warren Levin with the EAA chapter, 23 girls in the Young Eagles program were set to take introductory flights and receive a Log Book that contains information on financial support for a ground school. EAA chapter president Bob Law said information about aviation scholarships is also available at Young Eagles.org. Trinity Catholic High School senior Alexandra Sexton — a 17-year-old who earned her private pilot's license in November 2016 — conducted several of the programs. On March 11, she talked about aircraft operation fundamentals, pointing out the flaps, rudder and other controls on an airplane in a hangar. Alexandra, who told the group to "never stop learning," is the first student in the TCHS aeronautical science classes backed by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University to attain her private pilot's license. Embry-Riddle adjunct professor John Edsall said about 33 percent of students in his classes at TCHS are female. Alexandra's sister, Charlene, 15, enjoyed an introductory flight and thinks her sister is "pretty cool." Charlotte McGillicuddy of Williston attended with her daughters, Courtney, 17, Amber, 12, and family friend Elizabeth, 12. Courtney said she sees flying as "less scary than driving." Remi Gray of Jacksonville accompanied her daughters Ayanna, 13, and Amaya, 11. The three were part of a group that took a tour of the 90-foot-tall control tower. Eric Park with airport operations led the group to the top where 360-degree windows provide panoramic views. Ground controller Paul Ragan told the visitors that the airport's air space extends up to 1,500 feet and covers a 4-mile-diameter circle and that controllers work the tower form 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. At a closing seminar, several women shared their aviation experiences with the group. Garratt spoke of a "shortage of pilots" and encouraged the students to reach out for ground- and flight-training scholarships Retired airline captain Ann Edmonson, 66, of the Spruce Creek fly-in community near Daytona, told the group she began flying at age 38 and has flown such jet aircraft as Boeing 747s and Airbus 330s. Edmonson, a former Delta Airlines captain, flew a Boeing 767 for about four years during her 25-year-plus commercial flying career, which ranged from flying cargo including livestock to making international flights to South America, Europe and Asia. Caroline Rimes, 21, of Lake Butler, who has earned her private pilot's license and plans to become a commercial pilot, told the participants to "have confidence in themselves." Aircraft mechanic Daniella Radyvonyuk, 23, said she worked on aircraft engines and now installs electronic equipment in planes. She said that as she progressed in the profession she had a simple reply whenever male co-workers challenged her with a repair job. "I will fix it," she said.

She said that as she progressed in the profession she had a simple reply whenever male co-workers challenged her with a repair job. "I will fix it," she said. ___ Information from: Ocala (Fla.)

With over 20 years of trading experience, Mark has amassed a wealth of knowledge with regards to training and teaching online traders across the world. Mark is a recognised pioneer in the retail currency trading industry and has achieved great success since forex trading was introduced to the retail online trading market in 1997. He founded PowerTraders in Vancouver Canada in 1997, the first educational company offering training classes for forex training and during his career he was employed as a forex instructor by the Online Trading Academy. Mark graduated 1981 from the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, earning a Bachelor of Arts Degree with Specialized Honors. Website: www.xtrade.com 19 March 2017 Changes in the global political climate have resulted in increasing uncertainty in trading markets and economies around the world. For investors, this could be either a great time to invest in assets or a better time to protect their net worth. Although positions may vary, the one thing that many economists believe is that inflation is set to rise in the lead up to 2020. The introduction of value-added tax (VAT) could push the cost of living and doing business within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region higher. This is because VAT will increase business costs and this will be passed on to the consumer which would, eventually, lead to a rise in prices and therefore result in inflation. For the United Arab Emirates, inflation rates are projected to reach 2.5 percent by Q4 of 2017 and potentially reach 3.3 percent by 2020. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is projected to realise a 3.5 percent inflation rate in Q2 of 2017 and forecast to reach 3.1 percent by 2020. On the other hand, with the adoption by the Bahrain Finance Minister and the Shura Council in Saudi Arabia of the GCC Value Added Tax (VAT) Framework Agreement, greater regional integration and commerce can be expected in 2018 when compliance is set to begin. This has the potential to lower compliance costs and to be highly stimulative, generating new business opportunities throughout the region.  Given that the economy is set to grow and inflation is forecast to rise it is evident that individuals in the region need to educate themselves on how to protect their wealth in real-terms and make decisions that will enhance the opportunity to achieve financial freedom. Advertisement A diversified portfolio will usually help protect any individual from inflation. However, the portfolio needs to be balanced with commodities, stock and currencies that are carefully chosen based on how they react to rising prices. Gold is the one commodity that everyone should have in their portfolio. Gold is a store of value and when prices rise, so too will the price of gold, thus protecting an individual’s wealth in real-terms. Certificates of Deposit (COD) are quite popular in this region as people purchase and hold these from local and international banks for a certain period of time in return for interest. Usually speaking, the interest rate is higher than the inflation rate, however in some situations there is risk involved if inflation rises faster than interest rates. Another form of investment is Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) which are quite popular in the West as the principal is always adjusted to account for inflation. For example, if you purchase a $100 TIPS with a 2 percent inflation rate, then the principal amount after adjusting for inflation will now be valued at $102. TIPS are available in many countries and it is advisable to contact a bank and request more information about this kind of security. In terms of stocks, with the introduction of President Trump’s Manufacturing Council consisting of many C-Level executives from renowned multinational companies, it is worth mentioning that these companies are the forerunners when it comes down to shaping the future of the global manufacturing industry. Some of these companies include: Intel Corporation; Dell Technologies, Ford Motor Company, Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Tesla, Boeing, Under Armour, 3M and many more The potential for growth of these companies has significantly increased and by investing in them or perhaps the companies that they collaborate with in the automotive, technology, aviation, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries and more, will certainly contribute to protecting investors from inflation and increase their overall net worth in the long-run. Lastly, currency trading. Search engines, mobile newsfeeds and push notifications are keeping people at the forefront of what is happening during the age of information. Furthermore, online trading Apps like Xtrade empower investors to make trades in real-time. Global events shape the rise or fall of certain currencies and by being aware of the macro- and micro-economic environments, individuals can make educated decisions on which currencies are on path to inflation and make trades to mitigate the losses incurred from a weakening currency. Protecting oneself from inflation is not a simple task. It is very complex and involves a plethora of economic, financial and political factors. However, by equipping oneself with the knowledge on options and how to react, the chances to succeed in protecting the real-value of their wealth are in fact, quite high.

U.S BRANDS itself , as that T RESPECTS those treaties to the last dot. Russia should then call and send docs indicating the approval.. Military strict is one thing nat security could use them. I would allow that .. wehy not? Anyways,, U.S WILL have carriers to do that too. Maybe private.. The more is ionvested the better. The BEST would be to seek , what is needed for certain challenges for some rockets to be possible. But the First be the NK systems.. brought the Oxygen. But the RD 170 were not related to NK. Russia showed and Russia received ultra light materials that probably the world didn't knew it was possible. The metal made them lighter. And other perks. But well. RD 180 will be in U.S for a while. something THAT good is not easy o come by. But eventually they will be phased out as OBSOLETE. And for what I heard it be very soon. Specially in Russia. Where some will make the RD 180 look, like the first sling shot vs the most modern weapon today.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

Not only have no deputies been confirmed to join Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, but they haven't even been nominated in the first place. As of Friday, the President has yet to send a single nomination to the Senate for top posts at the State Department, aside from Tillerson himself. The totals do not count ambassadorships because they are not considered jobs charged with running the department. That puts him far behind the last three presidents. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had already nominated seven top officials each by this time in their first terms. President Bill Clinton had nominated nine people to help lead the State Department by now, according to data from the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. Although the process generally took through March and April for previous nominees to complete their confirmations, that has only heightened concerns that without even a nominee announced for many roles, it could be months before Trump's State Department has the key people in place to run the nation's foreign policy. Positions such as the deputy secretary of state and deputy secretary of state for management are some of the workhorse jobs that keep the trains running on time at Foggy Bottom. During Obama's first term, both roles had Senate-confirmed officials in place in January, with nominees to other positions on the way. So far, Trump has not named who he'd like to see in either spot. Mark Toner, acting spokesman for the State Department, said the administration was "working on identifying qualified candidates for senior department positions and trying to fill them as quickly as possible." Other employees stepping in Toner cautioned that the department was not rudderless, as employees are filling in to handle responsibilities while the process plays out. "I think it's also important to stress that there's a very capable diplomatic corps and civil service corps within the State Department," he said. "And many of these individuals have stepped into acting roles or remained in acting roles in order to provide consistency through the transition." Another State Department spokesperson declined to comment further on the issue Friday, instead referring back to Toner's previous statements. But although officials working temporarily on an acting basis do play an important role to help the government keep running during a transition, their power can be limited, according to Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, which shared some of its data with CNN. "An acting person is a bit like the substitute teacher," Stier said. "They may be a wonderful teacher, but the fact that they're the substitute teacher means they get no respect, they have no perceived authority to solve things, they don't set the lesson plan, and you also don't build the same kind of rapport with your peers across government, which is also super important." At places like the State Department, this can be particularly true for the jobs like deputy secretary of state, as that person tends to manage much of the day-to-day operations. Stier compared deputy secretaries to chief operating officers, saying little effective management can be done without them. Moreover, with the boss -- in this case, Tillerson -- constantly traveling the world as the nation's top diplomat, that creates extra logistical challenges. For example, Tillerson is currently in Asia, visiting with counterparts in Japan and South Korea, and soon China. Back in Washington, if a world leader or top foreign official comes to town during that time, like German Chancellor Angela Merkel did Friday, it would generally fall to Tillerson's deputy to handle such a visit in his absence.

But although officials working temporarily on an acting basis do play an important role to help the government keep running during a transition, their power can be limited, according to Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, which shared some of its data with CNN. “An acting person is a bit like the substitute teacher,” Stier said. “They may be a wonderful teacher, but the fact that they’re the substitute teacher means they get no respect, they have no perceived authority to solve things, they don’t set the lesson plan, and you also don’t build the same kind of rapport with your peers across government, which is also super important.” At places like the State Department, this can be particularly true for the jobs like deputy secretary of state, as that person tends to manage much of the day-to-day operations. Stier compared deputy secretaries to chief operating officers, saying little effective management can be done without them. Moreover, with the boss — in this case, Tillerson — constantly traveling the world as the nation’s top diplomat, that creates extra logistical challenges. For example, Tillerson is currently in Asia, visiting with counterparts in Japan and South Korea, and soon China. Back in Washington, if a world leader or top foreign official comes to town during that time, like German Chancellor Angela Merkel did Friday, it would generally fall to Tillerson’s deputy to handle such a visit in his absence.

Leading indicators and consumer sentiment readings were both strong. Among the sectors, financials weighed while utilities and industrials were showing the best gains. WTI crude oil for April delivery settled at $48.78 a barrel, up just 3 cents on the day, but up 0.6% for the week. April gold added 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,230.20, and up 2.4% for the week. Equities were headed for a higher close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.02% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.03%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.09%. Stocks traded very near the break-even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could finish with either a small gain or a small loss for any or all of the indexes. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Friday was McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) which traded up 1.16% at $129.47. The stock’s 52-week range is $110.33 to $131.96. Volume was roughly 30% above the daily average of around 3.5 million shares. The company had no specific news. United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX) traded up 1.09% at $113.58. The stock’s 52-week range is $96.89 to $114.44. Volume was about 20% above the daily average of around 2.9 million shares. The company had no specific news Friday. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) traded up 1.06% at $180.08 The stock’s 52-week range is $122.35 to $185.71. Volume was about equal to the daily average of around 3.4 million. The company scored orders valued at more than $3 billion for its Apache attack helicopters. Adding to the joy was the announcement that a U.K. investigation into allegations of corruption from arch-rival Airbus has been expanded into France. 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) traded up 0.75% at $191.74. The stock’s 52-week range is $163.05 to $192.14, and the high was posted this afternoon. Volume was about 40% above the daily average of around 1.8 million shares. The company announced a $2 billion acquisition of the personal-safety unit of Johnson Controls. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 21 are on track to close higher Friday and 9 are set to close lower.

"I think it's important that China continues to open itself and widens the door if you will," said Cook, speaking at the government-sponsored China Development Forum. Cook's comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China, with protectionist rhetoric from U.S. President Donald Trump sparking concern of increased trade friction between the two countries. "The reality is countries that are closed, that isolate themselves, it's not good for their people," said Cook, in a rare public speech. Apple said on Friday it will set up two new research and development centres in Shanghai and Suzhou in China.It has pledged to invest more than 3.5 billion yuan ($508 million) in research and development in China. Apple has been singled out in Chinese media as a potential target for retaliation in the event of a trade war. The Global Times warned last November if Trump triggered a trade war with China, Beijing would then target firms from Boeing to Apple in a "tit-for-tat" approach.

The draft budget requested substantial cuts to 15 federal agencies while boosting funds for three. Read: Trump’s Budget Plan Increases Funding To Combat Immigration, Hurts Local Law Enforcement After the Treasury Department, a major financial industry regulator, saw its proposed funding reduced to its lowest level in more than two decades, the share prices of several of America’s biggest banks spiked, only to drop substantially in value Friday. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) shot up 0.8 percent in the first half hour of trading Thursday, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rose 0.7 percent and both Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) jumped 0.6 percent over the same thirty minute period. All four fell substantially Friday, closing at, respectively, $24.96, $243.90, $58.66 and $90.66.   Compared to the megabanks, defense firm shares saw an inverse movement amid news that the proposed budget increased military spending by nearly 9 percent to its highest level since 2012. Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) dropped 1.5 percent Thursday, while fellow defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), Boeing Co. (BA), Raytheon Co. (RTN) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) fell by between 0.5 and 0.9 percent, only to skyrocket to a full recovery by market close on Friday. The sudden drop may have been a result of shattered expectations for military spending, as defense hawks in Congress such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona criticized the budget proposal. Read: Defense Company Stocks Rise After New Spending Plan Announced From Trump Administration Ahead Of Address Before Joint Session Of Congress In the hours after news surfaced that the Environmental Protection Agency would see nearly a third of its funding slashed, drawing its budget down to the lowest level in history, major corporate polluters saw temporary share price gains. Alcoa Corporation (AA) and German pharmaceuticals firm Bayer AG (BAYN.DE), two of the world’s top air polluters, according to the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute, saw respective share price growth of 1.6 percent and1.3 percent in the aftermath of the budget proposal’s release Thursday. Both fell back toward their pre-budget levels by Friday afternoon, with Alcoa finishing the trading day at $34.96 and Bayer hitting $106.85 by market close. One of the oil and gas sector’s top methane emitters and the former and only workplace of Rex Tillerson, Trump’s appointee for secretary of state, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) saw a modest increase of a third of a percent in the wake of the budget release, only to level off Friday for a market close of $82.

In a letter Thursday, governors from Ohio, Nevada, Michigan and Arkansas wroteSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan and said the legislation the House is considering “does not ensure the resources necessary to make sure no one is left out, and shifts significant new costs to states.” They said the bill “does not meet” goals set out by President Donald Trump about state flexibility and making sure people are covered. x The most dangerous thing about DJT's coalition may be their belief that a border wall will make them safer than a well-functioning CDC— Conor Friedersdorf (@conor64) March 17, 2017 Ariel Edwards-Levy/HuffPost: Almost No One Likes The New GOP Health Care Bill And many people hate it. Americans are more likely to hate the GOP’s proposed health care bill than they are to even tepidly support it, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. The top-line numbers alone aren’t good for the bill’s proponents: The public opposes the bill released by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and backed by President Donald Trump by a 21-point margin ― 45 percent to 24 percent ― according to the survey, with 31 percent unsure. The GOP plan also is on the wrong side of a significant gap in intensity, with just 5 percent strongly favoring the bill, and 32 percent strongly opposed. Leading the charge are voters who supported Hillary Clinton, nearly three-quarters of whom say they strongly oppose the bill. Seventy-nine percent expect that it would be worse than Obamacare, with 53 percent saying it would make things worse for them personally. Democrats are already counting the issue as a potential campaign vulnerability for the GOP. “The data shows that Democrats are well positioned to win back [Obama/Trump voters] in 2018 and 2020, particularly thanks to the debate over the controversial Republican healthcare plan to repeal the ACA,” the progressive group American Bridge argued in a polling memo released this week. Internal surveys for the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA found that Obamacare was a more “potent” topic than the fight over the Supreme Court, the group told CNN. x US reporters shocked when this German reporter asked #Trump: "Why do keep saying things you know are not true?" pic.twitter.com/dm79kI7RHe— Brent Goff (@brentgofftv) March 17, 2017 Vox: In these 105 counties, Planned Parenthood is the only full-service birth control clinic HHS Secretary Tom Price wanted to see a list of counties where Planned Parenthood is the only option for women who need subsidized birth control.

At issue is a process known as reconciliation, which allows certain bills to pass through the Senate with a simple majority (rather than the typical 60 votes) as long as all of its provisions meet a certain series of tests, which were spelled out decades ago in a rule named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd. Republican leaders have emphasized that they are working hard to get the best bill that they can through the Senate given the limitations, but conservatives argue that the current House bill favored by Speaker Paul Ryan doesn't go far enough in fully repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a true free market alternative. And they say the authors of the legislation are hiding behind the vagaries of the reconciliation process to justify some of the policy decisions that have angered conservatives. x Want to #SaveACA?

It’s so bad that the mayor carries around a naloxone injector in case he encounters an overdose victim. The city has tried setting up a needle exchange, hiring a drug czar, even suing the drug companies that brought pain pills to the state of West Virginia. None of those tactics have stopped the epidemic. “There doesn’t seem to be enough emphasis on what we’re losing,” John Wilson said, fighting the tears falling down his face. OTOH, Vann R.

To those who object to deep cuts in those programs, Mick Mulvaney, the president’s budget director, had a blunt message on Thursday: What did you expect? He said that after-school programs had failed to help children in schools, that housing programs were “not well run,” that government health research had suffered “mission creep” and that grants to local communities “don’t do any good.” x icymi, don't get @aaronecarroll mad https://t.co/zLRViCDGX5— Greg Dworkin (@DemFromCT) March 17, 2017 James Pethokoukis/The Week: What would a failed Trump administration look like? It certainly doesn't need to involve President Trump's impeachment and removal from office. Rather, imagine this: As the 2018 midterm elections approach, Trump's only accomplishment is starting construction on the southern border mega-wall. No ObamaCare replacement. No big tax cut. No big infrastructure plan. And millions of American voters are starting to consider that handing total power in Washington to a party led by a short-attention-span novice was a cosmically bad idea. It hardly seems like a far-fetched scenario right now. First, repealing and replacing ObamaCare, the GOP's top priority, was just dealt a hammer blow by the Congressional Budget Office. Conservative Republicans will surely focus on the CBO finding that the American Health Care Act would reduce projected debt by $300 billion and cut taxes by $900 billion over a decade. But the more relevant numbers to many Americans will be the 14 million people losing health insurance coverage next year and the 20 percent rise in insurance premiums if the bill becomes law. Republicans may quibble about details and degree, but the CBO forecast is almost certainly correct directionally. Priority two doesn't look a whole lot healthier. The GOP plan to deeply cut tax rates depends on the blueprint's controversial and deeply confusing border-adjustment provision, where imports would be taxed but exports wouldn't. Not surprisingly, the plan has split GOP business backers depending on whether they export goods (like Boeing) or import them (like Walmart). Dropping this provision — as seems highly probable — would blow a trillion-dollar revenue hole in a plan already counting on aggressive growth forecasts to avoid hemorrhaging red ink. x .@FreedomCaucus chairman: Despite changes, GOP healthcare bill doesn't have the votes https://t.co/QWbB9FkFCG— Scott Wong (@scottwongDC) March 17, 2017 x NEW CBO-DERIVED ESTIMATES: Coverage losses under the House bill by congressional district and coverage type. https://t.co/7gZu3wGQo5— Topher Spiro (@TopherSpiro) March 17, 2017 Alex Roarty/McClatchy: Centrist Democrats struggle to draft a survival strategy It was a secret meeting about an existential crisis. Gathered behind closed doors in a Denver hotel, 30 conservative Democrats plotted a potential path forward for their party – an effort to devise a strategy that might help them avoid total annihilation in red states across America. These political moderates had been called together by former Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, and they showed up out of fear that their party is growing more liberal by the day, and less interested in their centrist positions. x .@NPR is whipping the health care vote. https://t.co/XZvO5YUqQ1— Margot Sanger-Katz (@sangerkatz) March 17, 2017 I think the time to offer a Democratic fix to ACA has not arrived yet. I’d rather throw them an anvil while they are floundering. But for later: Pending  Horizon blog: No, really: Democrats should offer an ACHA alternative Some people on the left are rightly mocking Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) for saying Democrats who don't like the Republican Obamacare repeal-and-replace plan should put forward their proposal. After all, the Democrats' already did: it is the current law. But this is a good chance to highlight differences and drive home the problems with Trumpcare. While the ACA has gotten marginally more popular during this repeal fight, polling shows almost no one thinks the law is perfect, and most want to see it significantly improved. Democrats could quickly and easily put out a package based on already-scored ideas that would reduce premiums, increase coverage, and lower the deficit. It would do all the things Trump promised to do during the campaign but is now planning do the opposite of with his current repeal-and-replace plan. x CNN/ORC poll: Americans break with Trump on immigration policy @henryolsenEPPC @CNNPolitics https://t.co/gnTTtzDd7b— (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) March 17, 2017 336 Comments Share this article 141 141 141 336 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

(COL) Recent Posts: Here’s How You Can Invest In The World’s Most Innovative Country: Switzerland (EWL) Why Microsoft Corporations’s Dividend Payments Could Double Within 5 Years (MSFT) The Best ‘Trump Trade’ Right Now is Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL) View All Posts Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL) might not be as popular as Boeing Co (BA) or Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), but the company’s roots can be traced back to WWII and the venerable P-51 Mustang. In the ’60s, it produced the Apollo spacecraft that put Neil Armstrong on the moon. By the late ’70s, it was commissioned to spearhead NASA’s Space Shuttle program, starting with “Challenger,” and eventually building four other orbiters that made hundreds of trips into outer space. The GPS systems used by so many of our electronic, automotive and aviation products might not even exist without Rockwell-Collins. Its “Navstar” GPS satellites were among the first commissioned by the Pentagon. By many measures, it has produced some of the most impressive and influential aerospace and communications technology of the 20th century. And even after several mergers and acquisitions, and an eventual spinoff in 2001, Rockwell-Collins is still an aviation, defense and technological force to be reckoned with. But this is more than just a company with an impressive lineage. It is the “best-in-breed” for its sector, heavily integrated into aerospace, defense, infrastructure and even rail. Growth in these sectors equals earnings growth for COL. Given President Trump’s effect on consumer and defense stocks, and his expected $54 billion increase in defense spending alone, I’d expect Rockwell-Collins to be highly valued like many of its peers and trading at new all-time highs, but shares still have a little way to go before hitting either benchmark. And even though Rockwell’s shares have rallied since Trump’s election, there’s still a disconnect between its valuation and that of its peers. 7 Stocks That Will Hit All-Time Highs in 2017 This disconnect is likely because Rockwell sells direct to companies like Boeing and Lockheed, instead of directly to the government. So when investors are researching top defense contractors, Rockwell’s name isn’t the most readily apparent. As more the popular trades get crowded, the information will trickle down To get an idea of value, Rockwell’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 17.24 is 43% lower than its industry average (Bloomberg). Its ratio is also lower than both Boeing’s and Lockheed Martin’s, even though its income streams are quite diverse. Oddly, the opposite tends to be the case when you look at other similar supplier-versus-end seller examples such as Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and its supply chain companies.

Sun was reacting to annual trade policy agenda sent to Congress by the new US government implying that America is not bound by World Trade Organisation (WTO) decisions. The new US policy will also strictly enforce its trade laws, which include a “safeguard” provision that allows the Washington to unilaterally impose relief “if increasing imports are substantial cause of serious injury to a domestic industry,” state-run Global Times reported. US President Donald Trump, who made some tough statements against China before and after his election, branded Beijing as a currency manipulator to gain unfair advantage from exports and even threatened to impose 45 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods. China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, told media last week that China and the US are interdependent, and bilateral trade relations affect not just the two countries but the world. “Many Americans and their Western friends think that China has to rely on the US. I think they are partially right. But the US has to rely on China as well,” Zhong said. The report said the new US document asserts that “Americans are not directly subject to WTO decisions,” and that the US will defend its national sovereignty over trade policy and use all possible sources of leverage to encourage other countries to open their markets to US exports of goods and services. Zhong said China receives 26 per cent of Boeing airplane orders, 56 per cent of US bean exports, 16 per cent of automobile exports and 15 per cent of integrated circuit exports. China-US trade reached USD 519.6 billion in 2016, representing 207 times that of the 1979 amount, when diplomatic relations started, he said. However, the balance of trade is heavily tilted in favour of China as US exports amount to about $100 billion. “A trade war is not in the best interests of the two countries and peoples because a trade war only does much more harm than good,” Zhong had said.

EDT March 17, 2017 The Air Force's WGS-9 communications satellite was lifted atop a United Launch Alliance Delta IV rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 37. (Photo: United Launch Alliance) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Space Coast viewers could be in for a treat Saturday with a powerful Delta IV rocket's planned twilight blastoff from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The 217-foot United Launch Alliance rocket is targeting liftoff at 7:44 p.m., about 10 minutes after sunset, and will receive an extra boost from four solid rocket motors attached to the first stage. “It’s a good time for a launch,” said Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, commander of the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing. “That dusk time is beautiful, and then to have the four solids on, it’s a show.” If the launch of a heavy military communications satellite occurs on time, the rocket will bolt from Launch Complex 37 with more than 1.8 million pounds of thrust. As it climbs over the Atlantic Ocean, the trail of exhaust from the solid boosters will catch the fading sunlight and turn bright white as it streaks through a darkening sky, perhaps through colorful clouds. “With four solids, if you’re there in the local area, it’s going to be a pretty amazing experience with the sound and the vibration and the acoustics from the vehicle lifting off,” said Laura Maginnis, ULA’s vice president for government satellite launches. “For those viewing at the launch site, it will be a pretty powerful sight and pretty quick off the launch pad with those solid motors.” The launch window extends to 8:59 p.m., so a twilight launch could turn into a night launch if any issues crop up during the countdown. Weather doesn’t figure to be a factor, with the Air Force’s 45th Weather Squadron predicting a 90 percent chance of favorable conditions. A backup launch opportunity is available Sunday evening, if necessary. Flying on top of the rocket is the Air Force’s ninth Wideband Global Satcom satellite, or WGS-9, the latest addition to a constellation forming the Defense Department’s highest capacity space-based communications network. The $424 million satellite, built by Boeing, was bought by five international partners who gained access to the network: Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The mission was delayed from March 8 to fix an engine issue found during pre-launch inspections. Before the delay, the Air Force was promoting the flight as the “Super Bowl of launches,” a showcase event helping to kick off yearlong celebrations of the service’s 70th anniversary. The Delta IV's nose cone is painted with the Air Force’s 70th anniversary "Breaking Barriers" logo, along with mission artwork featuring the partner countries’ flags. Hundreds of guests including international partners and the head of Air Force Space Command had been expected to attend the launch, which coincided with an Air Force conference in Orlando. The delay scrapped those plans. Fewer VIPs may be in attendance, but the Space Coast can still look forward to an eye-catching launch.

Weapon manufacturing giant Lockheed Martin says it has finished a 60-kilowatt laser system that will be handed to the Army for further testing. First tests on the tank saw it reach 58 kilowatts of power but bosses at Lockheed believe it will fulfil its full potential in the next few months as development continues. The “combined fibre” laser beam uses several lasers to form a larger, stronger beam.  © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Lockheed Martin Lockheed has been testing the new mega weapon, that experts believe will change the face of warfare, in Washington state. Now it is expected to transport the tank to an army base in Alabama. Robert Afzal, senior fellow for laser and sensor systems at Lockheed Martin, said: “We’re really at the dawn of an era of the utility of laser weapons.” © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Lockheed Martin He added that special vehicles “can now carry something which is small enough and powerful enough for what we believe will be militarily useful.” Boeing has also been testing similar weapons and shared a video in 2014 of a 10-kilowatt laser destroying an airborne mortar. Military experts are particularly excited about the developments because firing laser weapons will cost a fraction of the price of firing traditional weapons, be more accurate and will not require reloading. © Provided by Trinity Mirror Plc Credits: Lockheed Martin Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, described a recent incident in which a US ally had used a multimillion-dollar Patriot missile to destroy a quad-copter similar to those easily bought in toy shops. He told the Washington Post: “That’s $3 million to shoot down a three-or-four-hundred-dollar drone. . . . What if you could do that with a beam of light that costs a buck?”  The US army is already testing other laser weapons, however the latest Lockheed design is thought to be more powerful and portable.

NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks finished modestly lower Friday as worries about international trade hung over the first meeting between President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. At a White House press conference with Merkel, Trump denied he was an isolationist, but pledged to fight for “fair” trade with Germany and other countries. Merkel said she favored “win-win” trade agreements. Meanwhile, finance ministers and central bankers from major economies were looking for reassurance from US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the G20 meeting in Germany, following Trump’s tough rhetoric. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a quiet session down 0.1% at 20,916.68. The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.1% to close at 2,378.21, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index was essentially flat at 5,901.00. Large gainers in the blue-chip index included Boeing and McDonald’s, while banks JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs both declined. Amgen slumped 7.0% after it released clinical data that showed its Repatha drug, in concert with other treatments, reduced the chance of a major cardiovascular event by 20 percent. Analysts said the finding was solid, but a bit underwhelming given lofty expectations for the drug. Tiffany rose 3.0 % after reporting a three percent decline in fourth quarter net income to $158 million that translated into $1.45 per share, beating expectations by seven cents. Adobe Systems advanced 4.1% as it reported a 36.3% rise in first-quarter earnings to $398.4 million on record revenues thanks to growth in cloud-oriented software.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business Front & Center: The long and fulfilling days of Addison Pemberton, president of Liberty Lake manufacturer Scanivalve SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 2017, 5 A.M. By Michael Guilfoil For The Spokesman-Review Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Five facts Business started: 1955 Employees: 42 Products: intelligent pressure and temperature scanning equipment for aerospace research and development Clients: Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Honeywell More information: www.scanivalve.com, (509) 891-9970 Addison Pemberton keeps one foot firmly in the future, the other planted in the past. By day he is president and co-owner of Scanivalve, a Liberty Lake manufacturer of sophisticated pressure instrumentation used in wind tunnels to measure the aerodynamics of aircraft, cars, bridges and skyscrapers. At night, he and a cohort of volunteers painstakingly restore vintage airplanes, including an iconic 1942 twin-engine Grumman Goose that hasn’t flown in decades … but may next month. During a recent interview at one of his two Felts Field hangars, Pemberton discussed dropping out of college, ice cream and how he got the name Addison. S-R: Where did you grow up? Pemberton: San Diego. S-R: What was your favorite class in high school? Pemberton: Physics. S-R: How about extracurricular activities? Pemberton: When not at school, I spent all my waking hours either learning to fly or working at Scanivalve, my parents’ business. I started doing machine work there with my brother when I was 12. By high school I was making three bucks an hour – enough to buy all the aviation gas I could burn. S-R: Did you assume you’d go into the family business? Pemberton: I did. My dad and I spent hours in the lab together and really bonded. S-R: What’s one lesson that stuck? Pemberton: Any technical or life problem you have, you can approach someone of consequence. For instance, when we read about (Paul) MacCready’s human-powered Gossamer Albatross in Popular Science we were fascinated, and my dad said, “Let’s call this guy. He lives in Bakersfield.” So we called him up, flew to Bakersfield the next weekend, and became lifelong friends. Another time we contacted an inventor in Germany, went to visit him, and his son ended up living with us for a year. Try to get the best gunfighter you can get, because they’re usually approachable. S-R: Are you the best gunfighter for somebody? Pemberton: Everybody has their niche, including me. One of the biggest privileges I have at Scanivalve is the technical interchange with customers. Quite often I’ll send them to a competitor, because they’re trying to overbuy. My stuff is very fast and accurate but expensive, and all they need is a Walmart-type solution. S-R: Where did you go to college? Pemberton: Initially two private Christian schools, and ended up at San Diego State. But I never graduated. I was 24 and one semester shy of a degree in mechanical engineering when Scanivalve found itself in a desperate state. We were transitioning from a smoky machine shop to an electronic company, I was working 80 hours a week, and suddenly our machine shop manager quit. My parents were overseas, so I left school to help run the business with my brother Jim. Those were crazy years. S-R: Is he still involved? Pemberton: Yes, we’re co-owners and business partners. Jim is the money guy, and I’m the technical guy. S-R: Besides morphing from analog to digital, how has the company evolved during the past 35 years? Pemberton: We’ve grown. We had 90 people at one time, but were very labor-intensive. Today we have eight CNC machine centers, each doing the work of 10 people. We farm more stuff out than we ever did, because we don’t want to be over 50 people. Annual revenue is around $7 million. S-R: What have been some best and worst times? Pemberton: The early ’80s were the worst. What saved our necks was being able to store-buy a PC in 1985 that would interface with my analog equipment. S-R: And the best time? Pemberton: The ’90s. Digital turned out to be quite lucrative. Then 9/11 hit us hard. The aerospace market evaporated for about two years. But that pushed us into wind engineering – the aerodynamic study of buildings and bridges – and turbine performance testing for power plants. S-R: How about today? Pemberton: These are trying times for small businesses. We do more paperwork than we ever did. S-R: How many other manufactures do what you do? Pemberton: Two. One in Virginia and one in Massachusetts. S-R: Why did you relocate your company from San Diego to Spokane in 1995? Pemberton: I wanted to leave California, which had become very restrictive and expensive, with too many dang people. S-R: Why did you choose Spokane? Pemberton: We could have been anywhere in the world. We looked at six small West Coast cities, including Bend, Oregon. We wanted to live where it was pretty, and Spokane offered the infrastructure we needed. I’d been here repeatedly in the late ’70s, because when I was in college I ferried airplanes to Alaska every summer, and the weather was always better on this side of the Cascades. S-R: What’s a typical day for you? Pemberton: I start my morning at 8, meeting with all my engineers to set priorities. Then I spend most of the day responding to emails – drafting quotes, providing technical support – or talking on the phone. People today expect instant answers. By late afternoon, things usually slow down enough that I can get out on the production floor and look at stuff. Then I come to the hangar, where my wife has dinner prepared, and we spend the evening restoring vintage aircraft. When I get home around 11:30 or midnight, I read all my new emails so I know what I’m going to get hit with the next morning – problems or orders from all over the world. S-R: What do you like most about your job? Pemberton: The people I work with. S-R: What do you like least? Pemberton: Government bureaucracy. S-R: What’s been the biggest surprise? Pemberton: That we’ve been able to keep reinventing ourselves and stay competitive. S-R: How do you market your testing equipment? Pemberton: Web, trade shows, some magazines, and I have 13 international distributors. But a lot of it is word of mouth – Scanivalve is the Frigidaire of high-speed pressure instrumentation. S-R: What qualities do you look for in job candidates? Pemberton: Whether their hobbies are technical. Do they work on their own car? What projects did they enjoy in college? I’ve been very impressed with the quality of candidates we’re getting from Eastern – particularly someone who gets his degree when he’s married, has kids and is holding down a full-time job. That guy has hustle. S-R: Do you have many women applicants? Pemberton: Not for engineering positions. But I work with lot of women in this industry who are very, very capable. S-R: When did your passion for vintage airplanes begin? Pemberton: I’ve enjoyed aircraft since I was little. My dad bought an airplane when I was 8. That plane was 21 years old, but airplanes last forever. I have seven – from a Piper Super Cub to the Grumman Goose – and the newest one was built in 1961. S-R: Where did you get the amphibious Goose? Pemberton: From the Palm Springs Air Museum. It was never going to fly again. But after putting 8,000 hours into restoration, we hope to fly it next month. Most pilots would agree it’s one of the coolest airplanes ever built. S-R: What appeals to you about restoring vintage aircraft? Pemberton: The technology, and the diversity of character. If you go to a parking lot today, you can’t tell a Rav 4 from a Rogue – they all look the same. But every one of these airplanes has a very distinct character. S-R: When you finish restoring a vintage plane, is it a shell surrounding modern technology, or an old aircraft with a few upgrades? Pemberton: Structurally it’s accurate. The engines are later dash numbers, and we use newer avionics and alternators and backup power. But they fly just like they did. They’re still a piece of history. I have a Model 40 – the oldest functioning Boeing of any kind in the world. When I flew it around the country, some people drove 300 miles to see it. S-R: How many flight hours have you logged? Pemberton: More than 12,000. S-R: Have you ever crashed? Pemberton: No. I’ve had engines quit and ended up in a field, but I’ve never destroyed an airplane. S-R: You work from 8 in the morning to midnight. That sounds like two full-time jobs. Pemberton: And I’ve been doing it for 40 years. But it beats going home and sitting in front of the television. S-R: What’s atop your bucket list? Pemberton: I want to take the Goose to the Arctic Circle, and teach my five grandkids to fly. S-R: Do you have a secret talent? Pemberton: I have a knack for organizing people. S-R: Any guilty pleasures? Pemberton: Ice cream is my biggest vice. S-R: What would you change about yourself? Pemberton: I’d lose 30 pounds. S-R: How do you relax? Pemberton: Restoring vintage aircraft. The thing about Scanivalve is that the challenges are rewarding, but slow coming – it takes years to develop something. At the hangar, I can bend a piece of metal, reproduce a part, and I feel like I’ve accomplished something. Instant reward at night, long-time reward at Scanivalve. S-R: By the way, what’s the story behind your name? Pemberton: I tell people my mother couldn’t think of what to call me, so when she added a son to the family, she called me “Addison.” But actually I’m named after my grandfather.

In November 2015, its Amos-5 satellite failed despite being less than four years old. Then, in September last year, it lost its Amos-6 satellite in a catastrophic explosion atop a Falcon-9 rocket when a ground-test went badly wrong. That explosion didn’t just cost Spacecom dearly in lost business, it also scuppered a potential sale of the company to a Chinese business. Spacecom has rented AsiaSat-8 for a four-year period to fill the gap of the lost Amos-6, and has an option for a 5th year if needed. AsiaSat-8 is now being marketed by Spacecom as Amos-7.  The follow-on satellite (and totally replacing the lost Amos-6) will be Amos-8 and is due for launch early in 2020 provided that the company can raise sufficient capital and corporate backing. Spacecom’s CEO David Pollack says that his business was “very much hurt” by the September explosion, and that it represented a major setback to its business. Talking to trade magazine Space Intel Report, he admitted that the satellite’s loss also meant the loss of a deal in place with Facebook. Pollack says that the building of its Amos-17 satellite is continuing (with Boeing) and that he was now in discussion with a launch provider for the satellite, which is due for delivery in early 2019.  Amos-17 will go to 17 degrees East upon launch.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Science Image Source: NASA Space Station astronauts celebrate St. Patrick’s Day with gorgeous night shot of Dublin Mike Wehner @MikeWehner March 17th, 2017 at 6:15 PM Share Tweet Here on Earth, most people celebrate St. Patrick’s Day by heading down to their local watering hole for a pint of Guinness or maybe a couple glasses of green beer. Up on the International Space Station, however, such a thing just isn’t possible, but that doesn’t stop them from recognizing Earthen traditions all the same. NASA Commander Shane Kimbrough and ESA pilot Thomas Pesquet took the opportunity to peer down from their perch some 200-odd miles above the surface to catch a glimpse of the city that is probably partying harder than anyone tonight: Dublin, Ireland. Don't Miss: Yet another new Galaxy S8 feature was uncovered that no iPhone can match “Dublin at night,” Pesquet tweeted, along with a photograph of the sight. “Always a great city to visit with a fantastic atmosphere.” Kimbrough later tweeted his own greeting, saying “Enjoy the #StPatricksFest Parade down there!” Dublin at night. Always a great city to visit, with a fantastic atmosphere 🇮🇪 https://t.co/UHDEIQINjG pic.twitter.com/nbp7AQ9Ofl — Thomas Pesquet (@Thom_astro) February 12, 2017 The photo is absolutely fantastic, and it was snapped at a high enough resolution to make out individual city streets. The center, downtown area is the brightest of all, and is undoubtedly filled with many revelers as the shot was taken. You can view the image in its full resolution on the NASA site here. The International Space Station, which makes about 15 orbits per day around our planet, is potentially nearing the end of its lifespan. It was originally launched in the late 1990s and has seen many repairs and upgrades since then. The station’s final days were originally estimated to fall somewhere in 2020, but Boeing, the craft’s principal contractor, has discussed with NASA the possibility of keeping it alive through 2028. The Trump administration’s various cuts to NASA funding could potentially impact that, as could many other factors.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday March 21, 2017 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Launceston Airport upgrade begins Zona Black@zeeeblack 18 Mar 2017, noon A $2 million redevelopment will change the way passengers pass through security screening. REVAMP: Artist's impressions show the new boards that could be part of the Launceston Airport departures lounge. Work has begun on the latest development at Launceston Airport. When it is completed, the airport will boast a new security screening area, which the airport’s general manager said will help to improve service punctuality. The $2 million project will see the security screening area moved to sit adjacent to the existing airline check-in desks. The move will mean that passengers will be able to pass through security before entering the dining and shopping area. General manager Paul Hodgen said the relocation would go a long way to easing screening and boarding congestion. “Now, people are waiting for when their plane arrives, and then rush through security, causing congestion,” Mr Hodgen said. “[The new process will] also have punctuality benefits to the airlines.” Mr Hodgen said airport management was also exploring further revamps for its shopping and dining area, which already underwent a transformation last year. He said they were investigating installing departure boards, similar to those in the new domestic terminal at Melbourne’s Tullamarine Airport, which give time indications as to when gates will open for boarding. While work has already begun, passengers won’t notice anything major until the winter months. Mr Hodgen said he expected that the security screening work would take place about August, after the peak season for the airport had passed. Traditionally, airlines tend to drop off any extras services or flights that they may have introduced over summer, around this time of year. However, Mr Hodgen said, some airlines had not only kept the services running, but added more. Virgin Australia, he said, look to be adding additional services on Melbourne and Brisbane routes throughout April, especially around Launceston AFL games, and the V8 Supercars Tasmanian round at Symmons Plains. Qantas is also upgrading some of its services from the smaller Dash 8s to Boeing 717s, to cope with extra traffic on three dates in April. There is more development in store for the airport, with a tender to be awarded shortly for works to upgrade the taxi rank area. The tender for the $2 million development was awarded to Vos Constructions.
