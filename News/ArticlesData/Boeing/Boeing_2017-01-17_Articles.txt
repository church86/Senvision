Valerie Young Jan 18, 2017 1:14 PM EST Love them or hate them, Donald Trump's tweets are news. Bad news, perhaps for stocks of corporations that cross the president-elect, but great news for the likes of TDAmeritrade (AMTD) . "Our main fundamental business is to make a commission every time somebody trades," CEO Tim Hockey said in a phone interview after the firm reported average client trades of 487,000 in the three months through December, the third-highest in its history. "We now have a president who is quite comfortable making statements about individual companies as well as industry sectors as well as things like the dollar." Net income at the Omaha, Neb.-based firm climbed 5% to $216 million, or 41 cents a share, as Trump's election and his running social-media commentary afterward prompted clients to tweak their portfolios. That matched the average of estimates compiled by FactSet.  Having a president-elect who expresses himself so freely buoys trading because it's a business intrinsically linked to "news or something that is newsworthy," Hockey said. The numbers bear him out. In December, Trump tweeted twice about Boeing  (BA) . His first post: "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Later, he noted "cost overruns" on Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 fighter jet and said he was asking Boeing to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet."  Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Following the tweets, Boeing volumes rose 93% at TDAmeritrade from the previous 15-day average. Wall Street giants including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) , Goldman Sachs (GS) , and Morgan Stanley (MS) , have also seen double-digit increases in their trading revenue following Trump's election.  "While this hyperactivity is good for business, it also underscores the fact that there is a lot of noise out there for our clients to sift through," Hockey said on an earnings call Wednesday. "The big story this quarter was the role futures played as our clients reacted to the election." The firm said futures-trading volume jumped 60% on Nov. 8, the day of the election, as clients sought a way to hedge their portfolios or "be opportunistic when breaking news hit after hours."  "Our clients essentially went into wait-and-see mode right up until Nov. 8 and then they exploded out of the gate when the election was done," Hockey said in the interview. Interest rate-sensitive assets, meanwhile, climbed 14% to $125 billion, leaving TDAmeritrade poised to benefit from the Federal Reserve's December decision to raise short-term rates by 25 basis points. Only the second hike since rates were cut to nearly zero during the financial crisis, the move may be followed by as many as three increases this year. Net client assets at the online brokerage increased by $19 billion, yielding a growth rate of 10% as inflows from institutional or registered investment advisors outpaced those from retail clients. Early in the quarter, TDAmertrade agreed to buy competitor Scottrade for $4 billion, the largest purchase in its history, adding about 450 branches. The deal is expected to close in September.  "Strong organic growth from net new client assets, rate-sensitive assets and new accounts, coupled with emerging tailwinds from the improving interest-rate environment, provides a solid base for future earnings growth," CFO Steve Boyle said in a statement.  The company's shares rose 0.7% to $46.19 on Wednesday. TD Ameritrade has increased 5.9% so far this year and 34% since Election Day.  FindTheCompany | Graphiq If you liked this article you might like Closing Bell: Mexican Peso Rallies Against Greenback; Lockheed Martin Falls Wall Street ended the week mostly lower after an earnings disappointment from Chevron weighed on the energy sector.

A pilot’s pilot, he flew for more than 60 years, with over 30,000 hours on more than 100 different aircraft — from Piper Cubs to mach 2 F-14 Tomcats. With an extraordinary career in aviation, Chuck Graffy was one of the last survivors from the great era of experimental test pilots, working on some of the greatest military planes ever designed. Born in Chicago in 1924, the grandson of German immigrants, “Chuck” was the fourth of six children (a sister and five brothers). His love of all things aeronautical started early. As a boy of 10, he began building flying-model airplanes, interestedly noting what affected flight, adjusting for weight, balance and wingspan, and hand-carving the propellers. A distributor of Megow Airplane kits was so impressed by the youngster’s meticulous construction that he provided Chuck with free models to build, to use for displays in toy stores. At 11 years old, Chuck would ride his bike four miles out to Midway Airport to watch the planes. He struck a friendship with a pilot and would wash his plane in exchange for plane rides. He was hooked. At 15 he began taking flying lessons (in a Welch), earning his pilot’s license a year later. He excelled at his high school drafting classes, and after graduation worked 60 hours a week as a junior engineer for the Studebaker Company, while starting college night classes (Illinois Institute of Technology), later earning his B.S. in aeronautical engineering. During World War II , Chuck was a very young captain (21!) in the Army Air Corps, where he trained fighter pilots (including training Pacific ace Dick Bong in gunnery school) ) utilizing P-42s, P-47s, P-51s. Post-war, he worked as draftsman for the short-lived Tucker Automobile Company in Chicago. Chuck then was approved to stay on in the Army Air Corps Reserve, and was one of 10 men sent to Denver to train in jets. When a Boeing executive learned that Chuck had more than 60 hours of  jet experience, he immediately recruited the young man to Boeing. Chuck became an engineering test pilot in Wichita to test the B-47, XB-47, YB-47, RB-47 the B-52 and its many variants.   Test pilot Chuck Graffy with a B-47 Stratojet At this time, test pilots were in an extremely dangerous occupation — averaging a death a week. (Six of his Boeing comrades were killed in crashes.) Test pilots had a base salary, and then would bid on the plane to be tested. Chuck was substantially younger than the other pilots, but his engineering background gave him a significant edge. He studied the operation handbooks for the planes. “I was so steeped in the airplane, I knew it backwards and forwards.” He knew which planes to avoid, and which to test. He never lost a plane. Sought by General Electric Flight Test to be their engineering test pilot in Schenectady, New York, Chuck flew diverse jet aircraft (B-45, B-57, B-58, F-106, F-100, F-104) under a classified security clearance. In the early 1960s, Chuck was selected as West Coast manager to lead General Electric’s Pacific Missile Range programs and moved his family to sunny Santa Barbara. GE was designing guidance systems and Chuck’s planes (twin engine Convair, DC6, A-26, B-57 and B-66) would simulate missiles. When the program folded, he decided to stay where the weather was better, and for a short time bought and ran Decorator Marble company before returning to the skies. He flew as private pilot for Fess Parker, corporate pilot for Bill Wilson and McMahon Company (Howard 500, Beechcraft 18), and for Daryl Tomlin Corporation (Jet Commander 1121 and Falcon 20). In the mid-1970s Chuck  became owner and general manager of Golden State Airlines (DC-3, Convair 440 and Convair 580), with charter flight contracts with LA Times, Disney, and the U.S. Navy. After selling the business, he joined Hughes Aircraft as senior engineering test pilot, working again with a classified security clearance. He flew developmental tests on military hardware (including the FLIR infra-red systems Hughes developed in Goleta.) utilizing World War II Douglas A-26 , F-14 Tomcat and Citation Jet.   There was virtually no plane Chuck Graffy would not or could not fly— for work or for fun. Chuck did cloud seeding for Sagandaga Reservoir  in New York, flew airmail to Santa Cruz Island, looped the Golden Gate Bridge in a P-47,  and flew through a hanger ....”just because.” In New York, he would buzz the family home in an F-86 to let his sons know he was on his way home, and on Santa Barbara Street when kids saw a plane circle the neighborhood and dip its wings, they’d know that it was time for dinner as dad would be home in 20 minutes from the airport. He had the opportunity to fly celebrities such as Elvis Presley, Jimmy Durante, Paul Anka. He picked up Ed McMahon after the Tonight Show and flew him to Las Vegas where he was performing.)  He was asked to be an astronaut, but after watching the earliest launches at Cape Canaveral, Chuck demurred. “Things were blasted up, and then would fall backwards and go into fire.” He wanted no part of it when he realized the pilot could not control the choices, decisions and environment. “All I ever wanted to do was fly" he'd say. "Every day you wake up and think, ‘I can’t wait to get to work.’ I just loved to fly." When he was down on the ground, he was a superb, natural athlete. He excelled as a ball player in his youth, was a top scoring (290s) league bowler, avid golfer, and in the last 20 years was a champ at lawn bowling tournaments, enjoying the great camaraderie of the lawn bowling aficionados downtown. Besides his love of flying, it was his family that was the pride of his life. He met his wife, Jeanne, when she was a teenager, and wooed her with letters through the war. Together they raised a family of five, fueling them with his sense of drive, independence, and accomplishment: Kurt (Cathay Gunn), Neal, Erin (Dr. James Garcia), Colleen, Kerry (Fred Mariea). And they were equally devoted to their grandchildren: Colette, Colin, Kyle and Kirsten Gunn-Graffy, and Spencer Mariea. He was preceded in death by all his siblings and his infant grandson Kieran Gunn-Graffy. A Mass will be held Saturday, Jan. 21, at the Old Mission at 10 am, followed by a reception.     VIEW COMMENTS > © Noozhawk | All Rights Reserved.

On Tuesday, NASA filed a "presolicitation" requesting that private firms reach out to NASA if they can transport astronauts to and from the orbital research platform. NASA is “considering contracting” with Boeing on a noncompetitive basis, primarily because there may not be a suitable alternative. The Chicago-based aerospace firm has ties with Russia, allowing it to serve as a middleman to get American astronauts on board the Soyuz (Russian for 'union'). Particularly, Boeing won the seats NASA now seeks from Energia, a Russian aerospace firm, in a settlement negotiated in late 2016.  "Only Russian spacecraft carry people to [ISS] right now," according to NASA’s website.  The transportation services include one astronaut in the fall of this year and another in the spring of 2018, according to a document published by the General Services Administration (GSA). Procuring seats on the Soyuz will "maximize ISS science utilization," it notes. © Photo: NASA/JPL-Caltech Get Psyched: NASA Announces Mission to Asteroid Worth Quadrillions of Dollars The Soyuz space capsule sits atop a rocket that launches Japanese, Canadian, Russian, and American astronauts from Earth into space in just nine minutes, NASA notes. Passengers can expect to arrive at ISS in six hours, about an hour shorter than a flight from New York to London.  Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft has encountered design flaws in development, postponing the company’s manned flight to ISS until December 2018. Elon Musk’s SpaceX firm delayed their first mission to the space station after an unmanned Falcon 9 spacecraft blew up in the middle of a test launch.  As a result, the US continues to rely on Russia, a source of ire for many US lawmakers. The prospect of continued domestic provocations aimed at Moscow could, however, very well endanger Americans on the space station. Some of the services GSA and NASA want to acquire include "provision of Emergency Rescue services, on-orbit rescue services for the duration of the six-month missions," and, of course, bringing the astronauts back home. This is a key piece of leverage Moscow has over Washington in the undesirable event of escalated tensions.  © Flickr/ SpaceX Photos SpaceX Successfully Launches Falcon 9 After September's Explosion (VIDEO) Washington has significant financial incentive to send explorers up to ISS on spacecraft that are not Russian. Since 2006, the price of a seat on the Soyuz has jumped from $25 million to $81 million, according to NASA data. NASA and GSA did score a coup in 2007 and 2008, however, when the agencies landed seats for a mere $21.8 million.  ...

Reply Mikhas 04:18 19.01.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete Yet, reading western zio-msm you are somehow led to believe that nasa get their folks up there on their own accord. I read the Danish newspapers when Russia accepted the first Danish hitchhiker up to space, they were all thrashing "Russian old obsolete but still somewhat reliable tech" Even the little weasel of n astronaut himself, upon safe return to earth., had nothing but veiled insults to say about his Russian hosts and " next time it's the latest modern US technology that'll take us there....and Mars." Hard swallowed western pride...

First, developing a carrier is not cheap. Next, Russia once it get on it's feet, could work to make this trips cheaper. Next is U.S desire for private corporations to take over. This will take time, and WILL cost lives. Everyone knows that. So for now Russia should seek at ways to lower rates, and make the trip more pleasant. Making a carrier is not only expensive, BUT, dangerous. And the newer the tech the more so. PLUS believe it or not, NASA saves a TON of cash. Just seat and take numbers. I bet ANYTHING you want, that creating a new shuttle , plus all the R&D, will make each trip cost 100's of millions!! See is more easy to just ride along, where Russians also travel. Makes things cheaper. I'll DEMAND NASA tell how much a new carrier will cost , it's life span , and calculate REAL cost per trip. I don't care what ANYONE say, is will be extremely expensive. U.S is NOT in it's prime. TRUMP will want to change the trips to be made in U.S. But the cost will be in TRILLIONS. depending on what carrier type is used. Because the trips MUST be competitive. In other words a carrier that do 10 trips is a WASTE. Russia ALSO will have to rescind of this present carrier type. Hoping for something reusable. Perhaps, at first revive the BURAN. I would had done it long ago. Buran had no big propulsion like the U.S shuttles. ANd could stay in space a real , REAL long time. On it's own , with no one. Reason, Soviet BRASS said, West have NOTHING like this, when the truth was learned. Because you find in docs of the day, that they THOUGHT it was a shuttle copy or close one, to teach west we can also build that. But BURAN was BEYOND IMAGINATION. ANd could stay in space several times the amount the Shuttles did. with way more cargo about double. And much more. So one with more space, lots of room for occupants and all amenities, and Russia have a great carrier. That can be re launch , over and over. The issue always been the TILES. CREATE a MOLD that can be placed wrapping the carrier and be molded. Or a one piece unit. No more lose or flying tiles.

A recent solicitation from the Pentagon calls for a non-explosive electromagnetic pulse artillery shell capable of wiping out ‘a wide range of electronics, critical infrastructure, and computer-based systems.’ The non-kinetic system would first be incorporated into a 155mm projectile and later scaled down to enable the use of multiple shells, allowing for devastating electronic attacks that are delivered by standard munition but cause no physical damage. A solicitation from the Pentagon calls for a non-explosive electromagnetic pulse artillery shell capable of wiping out ‘a wide range of electronics, critical infrastructure, and computer-based systems.’ It would fit into a 155mm artillery piece, like the M777 Howitzer, pictured HOW EMP WORKS  EMP, or electromagnetic pulse weapons use missiles equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon. This uses a super-powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated beam of energy. The energy causes voltage surges in electronic equipment, rendering them useless before surge protectors have the chance to react. The aim is to destroy an enemy's command, control, communication and computing, surveillance and intelligence capabilities without hurting people or infrastructure. According to the solicitation, the weapon will be designed to be cost-effective and precise, launching the non-kinetic effects (NKE) from a close range to limit the affected area. Essentially, such a weapon would render the target’s entire electronic infrastructure useless. The DoD will first develop a prototype weapon for the 155mm projectile, with the ultimate plan to create a ‘ruggedized, hardened electronics subsystem.’  During the development process, the report says they’ll also be exploring and demonstrating different ways to carry out non-kinetic attacks, and testing the system’s capabilities in the field. ‘Extensive use of wireless RF networking for critical infrastructure and communications systems provides an alternative attack vector for the neutralization of an adversary’s underlying industrial, civil, and communications infrastructure without the destruction of the hardware associated with those systems,’ the solicitation states.

Share this article Share 252 shares According to the solicitation , the weapon will be designed to be cost-effective and precise, launching the non-kinetic effects (NKE) from a close range to limit the affected area. Essentially, such a weapon would render the target’s entire electronic infrastructure useless ‘Advances in munitions-based microelectronics and power technologies make possible the implementation of non-kinetic cyber and electromagnetic ‘or electronic warfare (EW)’ attacks that could be delivered via artillery launched munitions. ‘The precision delivery of the non-kinetic effects (NKE) electronics payload close to the target allows low power operation which limits the geographical extent of impacted systems, and reduces the overall impact on the electromagnetic spectrum.’ The new development comes more than a year after a report warned that America is falling behind in the development of critical electromagnetic weapons that some say could wipe out 90 percent of its population. BOEING'S 'CHAMP' WEAPON  In 2012, aircraft manufacturer Boeing successfully tested the weapon on a one-hour flight during which it knocked out the computers of an entire military compound. During Boeing's experiment, the missile flew low over the Utah Test and Training Range, discharging electromagnetic pulses on to seven targets, permanently shutting down their electronics. Boeing said that the test was so successful even the camera recording it was disabled. Pictured is Boeing's Champ, or Counter-electronics High-powered microwave Advanced Missile Project, one of the EMP weapons that is under construction Although the project is shrouded in secrecy, experts believe the missile is equipped with an electromagnetic pulse cannon. This uses a super-powerful microwave oven to generate a concentrated beam of energy which causes voltage surges in electronic equipment, rendering them useless before surge protectors have the chance to react. Boeing's CHAMP takes out enemy electronics with pulse.  The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments says the technology is 'one of the most critical operational domains in modern warfare.' However, it concluded 'unfortunately, 'failed to keep pace' is an appropriate description of the Department of Defense's (DoD) investments in EMS warfare capabilities over the last generation.' The report, 'Winning the Airwaves: Regaining America's Dominance in the Electromagnetic Spectrum', added the technology will become as revolutionary as smartphones. 'In the same way that smartphones and the Internet are redefining how the world shares, shops, learns, and works, the development and fielding of advanced sensors and networking technologies will enable militaries to gain significant new advantages over competitors that fail to keep pace,' it says.  THE CONCRETE THAT COULD SHIELD AGAINST EMP ATTACKS   The EMP-shielding concrete could be applied in a spray-on technique that would allow for cost-effective retrofitting Engineers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln have developed a type of concrete that could act as a shield against ‘doomsday’ electromagnetic pulse attacks. The conductive concrete both absorbs and reflects electromagnetic waves to protect the electronics inside, and the creators say it could be used in new structures or applied through a spray-on method to retrofit existing buildings.  The researchers created a concrete that conducts electricity, replacing some of the standard concrete materials with magnetite. The concrete also includes carbon and metal components, enhancing its absorbing abilities and allowing it to reflect as well.  The new concrete is now available for commercialization, and the team has joined with ABC Group in a research agreement for a new patent-pending pending product that would work with a shotcrete construction method, a spray-on technique that would allow for cost-effective retrofitting.   Read more: Munition-Delivered Non-Kinetic Effects (NKE) | SBIR.gov Share or comment on this article e-mail 252 shares Most watched News videos Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps First ladies first?

 NASA is in a strange and expensive pickle with the Russians Dave Mosher Jan. 18, 2017, 4:35 PM 8,898 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Russian Soyuz rocket launch. NASA/Joel Kowsky NASA, in dealing with Russia's monopoly on human spaceflight, is hoping Boeing can help — that is, by buying tickets the company owns for rides aboard Russian rockets. When NASA retired its last space shuttle in July 2011, it expected commercial carriers like SpaceX and Boeing to launch its astronauts into space by 2015. But both companies hit snags with the development of their rockets and spaceships, causing the first planned launches to slip to 2018, according to a September 2016 audit by NASA's Office of Inspector General (OIG). This left NASA with one option for getting astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) for the next 3 years: a Russian spacecraft called the Soyuz. NASA is no stranger to buying Soyuz seats — it has done so for more than a decade — but Russia has taken full advantage of its temporary monopoly to charge ever-more-exorbitant sums for them. And now the space agency may need more than it originally expected. As Eric Berger reported Wednesday at Ars Technica, NASA issued a new solicitation on January 17 to buy two more Soyuz seats from Boeing, plus "an option to acquire crew transportation from Boeing for three crewmembers on the Soyuz in 2019." In other words: NASA may end up buying five tickets aboard the Soyuz from Boeing. If that sounds a little convoluted, particularly since Boeing's delays helped put NASA in this pickle in the first place, welcome to the current state of human spaceflight industry. As Berger notes at Ars Technica, RSC Energia — the Russian entity that makes and launches Soyuz rockets and spacecraft — recently settled a $320 million lawsuit with Boeing. Part of Boeing's settlement package includes five Soyuz seats and, according to NASA's recent solicitation, one is scheduled for 2017, another for 2018, and three for 2019. NASA wants those tickets to ensure it's making good on its roughly $75 billion investment in the ISS, set to disband in 2024, by filling it up with as many crewmembers as possible. What might NASA pay Boeing for each of its Soyuz tickets? A NASA representative declined to provide Business Insider with an estimate, but noted "prices will be finalized during contract negotiations" and that the space agency "will ensure it receives a fair and reasonable price for the transportation services from Boeing before a contract is awarded." Representatives from Boeing also wouldn't give specific numbers, but told Business Insider in an email that "the pricing is attractive" and that "we would not charge NASA more than what they would pay Roscosmos [Russia's space agency] if they were purchasing these seats directly." If what Roscosmos charges is any guide, however, Boeing's Soyuz seats could still cost NASA dearly. When NASA still had the space shuttle in 2008, Roscosmos charged it as little as $21.8 million per Soyuz seat. By 2018, however, it intends to charge NASA $81 million per seat — an increase of 372% over 10 years: How much NASA is paying Russia for each US astronaut seat aboard a Soyuz spacecraft from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider That's according to NASA OIG's September 2016 audit data. The chart below, also based on the report, factors in the price of a seat and the number of astronauts that NASA plans to launch (about six per year) to show how much NASA has paid Russia and could end up paying for Soyuz seats. The total cost over 12 years is more than $3.36 billion — and that's not including the possible purchase of Boeing's three Soyuz seats for 2019. Assuming NASA's budget remains roughly $18.5 billion a year, that means about 3% of the agency's funding could be diverted to Russia in 2018: How much NASA will pay Russia to send US astronauts into space from 2006 through 2018. Skye Gould/Business Insider A presentation given by a NASA official in May 2016 estimates the cost of each seat aboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft will be $58 million. The Sept. 2016 audit made clear that any other hiccups in the NASA's commercial crew program, which could earn Boeing and SpaceX up to $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion (respectively) for their services, will be costly. "Given the delays in initiating a U.S. capacity to transport crew to the ISS, NASA has extended its contract with the Russian Space Agency for astronaut transportation through 2018 at an additional cost of $490 million," the report stated. "If the Commercial Crew Program experiences additional delays, NASA may need to buy additional seats from Russia to ensure a continued U.S. presence on the ISS." Indeed, that looks to be the way things are headed now. This article was updated to include new information provided after its original publication.

Chicago - Jan. 25, 2017   Beachwood Politics Our monthly archive. Who We Are Chicago by the numbers. Sausage Links Wiki Daley Wiki Rahm Illinois Channel CAN TV Ralph Martire Doonesbury Government Attic Division Street Indie Political Report The Obameter ProPublica The Intercept SCOTUS Blog American Dream Betrayed Boeing Joins New Lobbying Group To Defend $8.7 Billion In State Tax Breaks By Alwyn Scott/Reuters SEATTLE - A dispute over $8.7 billion in Washington state tax breaks is heating up after Chicago-based Boeing joined a new lobbying group set up to preserve the industry incentives, the biggest in U.S. history. The group opposes efforts to make the aerospace tax breaks, passed in 2013, dependent on Boeing maintaining minimum employment levels in the state. Such "claw-back" bills had failed the past two years, but union leaders and a lawmaker said in interviews on Tuesday they planned to try again in the legislative session that started this week. The new group, Aerospace Works for Washington, will be a "megaphone" to warn that jobs are at risk, said Lake Forest native Maud Daudon, chief executive of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, which is leading the effort. "We are in a competition to keep them here," she said. "Any state in the country would die to get these jobs." The group also may oppose European Union efforts to eliminate the incentives under World Trade Organization rules, and may try to extend them to Washington's growing space industry, Daudon said. Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft maker, has its largest factories in Washington, and is the state's largest private employer, with 72,000 workers. As with previous proposals, "Boeing is opposed to any effort to alter the Washington aerospace tax incentives," the company said in a statement on Tuesday. "Changing the parameters of the incentives now would simply increase the cost of building airplanes in this state, and unnecessarily put excellent, family-wage jobs in Washington at risk." SEEKING JOB GUARANTEES Aerospace Works for Washington has more than 30 members, including elected leaders, economic development organizations and chambers of commerce from state regions where aerospace manufacturers have factories. It includes trade groups of retailers, restaurants, hotels and other industries. Alaska Airlines, owned by Alaska Air Group Inc., is also a member. No labor groups are involved. Daudon said the broad membership signals growing opposition to changing the incentives. Union leaders said their members still support the tax breaks "as long as Boeing doesn't ship jobs out of state," said Larry Brown, legislative director for the International Association of Machinists, District 751. The 2013 tax cuts were designed to "maintain and grow" aerospace employment in the state and are available to any local aerospace manufacturer. Since the law passed, Boeing has eliminated 11,414 jobs in Washington, about 15 percent of its state workforce, the company's employment data showed. In the year through November 2016, the state lost 5,500 manufacturing jobs, largely in aerospace, according to state employment security department data. Boeing said in December that job cuts and movements were necessary to respond to competition from European rival Airbus and years of constricted U.S. defense spending. Boeing said it fulfilled its commitment in the 2013 law to locate the assembly line and wing factory for its new 777X jetliner in the state. - Previously in Boeing: * $3.1 Billion In Profits, Pays $0 In Illinois Income Taxes.

The agency had described its probe into the mystery of Cooper, who vanished out the back of a Boeing 727 into a freezing rain wearing a business suit, a parachute and a pack with $200,000 in cash, as one of the longest and most exhaustive in its history. The agency said it will preserve evidence from the case at its Washington, DC headquarters, but it won’t act on further tips unless people find parachutes or Cooper’s money. Handout . / Reuters Artist sketches released by the FBI of a man calling himself DB Cooper, who vanished in 1971 with $200,000 in stolen cash after hijacking a commercial airliner Now a group of amateur scientists known as Citizen Sleuths have analysed microscopic particles from Cooper’s clip-on tie, which he left on his seat before exiting the aircraft. It revealed the presence of elements including cerium, strontium sulphide and pure titanium, which the group describes as “rare and exotic” at the time, thus narrowing the field of possible suspects. One place they were being used was for Boeing’s high-tech Super Sonic Transport plane, which was developed with government funding in the 1960s and 1970s. Handout/ Reuters Some of the stolen $20 bills recovered after DB Cooper leapt from the plane  Lead researcher Tom Kaye told King5 he wonders if Cooper was a Boeing employee or contractor who wore a tie to work. He said: “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these (manufacturing machines). He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants.” Kaye is appealing to the public, particularly those with experience in the aerospace industry in the Northwest around the time, to contact Citizen Sleuths with theories on what those materials could have been used for. He added: “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say ‘Oh my gosh. I know what that means having those particles on the tie.’” Associated Press This is the Northwest Airlines jet hijacked by DB Cooper in 1971 On 24 November, 1971, the night before Thanksgiving, a man described as being in his mid-40s with dark sunglasses and an olive complexion boarded a flight from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. He bought his $20 ticket under the name “Dan Cooper,” but an early wire-service report misidentified him as “DB Cooper,” and the name stuck. Sitting in the rear of the plane, he handed a note to a flight attendant after takeoff. “Miss, I have a bomb and would like you to sit by me,” it said. The man demanded $200,000 in cash plus four parachutes. He received them at Sea-Tac, where he released the 36 passengers and two of the flight attendants. The plane took off again at his direction, heading slowly to Reno, Nevada, at the low height of 10,000 feet. Somewhere, apparently over southwestern Washington, Cooper lowered the aircraft’s rear stairs and jumped. He was never found, but a boy digging on a Columbia River beach in 1980 discovered three bundles of weathered $20 bills - nearly $6,000 in all. It was Cooper’s cash, according to the serial numbers. Over the years, the FBI and amateur sleuths have examined innumerable theories about Cooper’s identity and fate, from accounts of unexplained wealth to purported discoveries of his parachute to potential matches of the agency’s composite sketch of the suspect. The 40th anniversary of the case in 2011 brought a wave of attention. An Oklahoma woman told the FBI about a late uncle who showed up to Thanksgiving dinner in Oregon that year with serious injuries. A team that included a paleontologist from Seattle’s Burke Museum announced that particles of pure titanium found in the hijacker’s clip-on tie suggest he worked in the chemical industry or at a company that manufactured titanium. A book that year, “Skyjack: The Hunt for DB Cooper,” by Geoffrey Gray, posited several theories, including that Cooper might have been a transgender mechanic from Washington state, the Associated Press writes. The most promising leads in recent years have come from amateurs, Gray said - including a notion put forth by a scientific illustrator at the University of Chicago that Cooper might have taken his persona from a French comic called “Dan Cooper,” a series about a test pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force. In one issue from 1963, the character boards an airliner wearing a dark suit and a mask over his eyes and sits in the back of the plane. He demands to be given a briefcase that’s in the cockpit, and then, wearing a military parachute, he jumps out - over a wooded area, at night, in the rain. The comic was never translated into English, raising questions about whether the hijacker might have been a francophone. “The fascination with Cooper has survived not because of the FBI investigation, but because he was able to do something that not only captured the public imagination, but also maintained a sense of mystery in the world,” Gray said.

Preble This article appeared on Politico on January 18, 2017. President-elect Donald Trump has made cutting wasteful defense spending a top priority, specifically targeting federal defense contracts. He called defense industry leaders to the proverbial woodshed to protest costly projects, including threatening on Twitter to cancel Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Boeing’s contract to build two new Air Force Ones. These tweets send a strong message, and both Boeing and Lockheed have said they intend to work with Trump to reduce program costs. But significantly reducing bloat in the defense budget will require much more than tweets. It’s a huge challenge, but Trump can draw on a set of policy proposals that enjoy broad, bipartisan support within the think tank community, including two letters signed by respected scholars from 16 institutions. They include eliminating excess overhead, modernizing the military’s pay and benefits system and overhauling its weapons acquisitions process. Such reforms will require support from Congress, no guarantee since most proposed changes target entrenched interests. But in just the few months since his election, Trump has shown how to use the bully pulpit against major defense contractors. If he uses the same tactics against wavering lawmakers, he could create a robust coalition that finally trims waste in the defense budget and modernizes the military. Instead of threatening defense contractors on Twitter, Trump should adopt a comprehensive plan to cut bloat at the Pentagon. Here’s how. Trump made a smart choice in selecting South Carolina Congressman Mick Mulvaney to be the next director of the Office of Management and Budget. From that position, Mulvaney could impose the sort of budget discipline that he could only advocate as a member of Congress. Mulvaney knows about waste at DOD, and railed against the Overseas Contingency Operations slush fund that Congress created to evade the budget caps set by the bipartisan Budget Control Act. He should also be skeptical of claims that the Pentagon needs bigger budgets to fulfill current missions. After all, American taxpayers spent over $600 billion on the military in 2016, more than was spent, in inflation-adjusted dollars, during a typical year during the Cold War. What would a smart plan to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary military spending look like? A number of think tanks, including Cato, where I work, have put forward proposals, and they have a few consistent recommendations. First, Congress should close unneeded bases. Despite broad support from the most senior military officers for such a move, lawmakers have refused to allow it. Members focus on parochial concerns, such as jobs lost, and the negative economic impact on surrounding communities. They should consider the many cases in which former military facilities were converted to more productive uses, such as Philadelphia’s Navy Yard or the Brunswick Naval Air Station in Maine, not to mention the national interest in a more effective defense. Base closures will help the Pentagon tackle another vexing problem: A civilian workforce that has grown too large relative to the number of men and women serving on active duty. The Pentagon now employs some 60 civilians for every 100 uniformed personnel, the highest ratio ever. And the civilian contractor workforce is nearly as large and obscures the extent of the Pentagon’s back-office bloat. Reforming the military’s pay and benefits system would also reap long-term savings and bring a woefully out-of-date system into the 21st century. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission noted that today’s young people have different expectations than earlier generations accustomed to long-term employment and private-sector pensions. The commission focused mostly on maximizing value for the troops, but the Trump administration should also take exploding costs — up 76 percent per service member in inflation-adjusted dollars from 1998 to 2014 –into account when it crafts an alternative. Lastly, if reforming procurement turns out to be Trump’s hobby horse, he shouldn’t expect a Congress full of yes men. Very few people dispute that the Pentagon spends a lot of money on hardware, but everyone disagrees on how to get more bang for the buck. Congress often forces the Pentagon to buy weapon systems it doesn’t need or want. Then, on top of that, the process used to determine the requirements for new weapons, and the regulations imposed on delivering them, leads to rampant cost growth. Trump should look into easing regulations and, as his tweets imply, demand strict accountability on costs. Tackling waste when budgets are rising is hard and may be impossible. This is true of any enterprise, but it’s especially true at the Pentagon, which doesn’t have to balance — or even audit — its books. For all his talk of streamlining military spending and despite his threats to defense industry executives to do better, Trump will not dislodge the status quo through bluster alone. If he is truly committed to improving the Pentagon’s business practices, he should embrace necessary but politically difficult reforms and reconsider his pledge to boost Pentagon spending. These actions will be far more effective at driving change than his many tweets could be.

 Boeing has an updated F-18 in the works — here's how it's 'comparable' to the F-35 Alex Lockie Jan. 18, 2017, 9:22 AM 47,475 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Boeing concept for the Advanced Super Hornet, pictured here without enclosed weapons pods. Boeing President-elect Donald Trump caused a genuine uproar in the combat-aviation community when he tweeted in December, "Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!" The idea that an F/A-18 Super Hornet could be "comparable" to the F-35 met swift and intense condemnation, and Lockheed Martin quickly lost billions in value on its stock. "No, Mr. Trump, You Can't Replace F-35 With A 'Comparable' F-18" a headline at Breaking Defense said. "You can't replace the F-35 with an F-18 any more than you can replace an aircraft carrier with a cruise ship," a headline at Popular Science said. Lt. Col. David Berke, a former commander of the US Marine Corps' first operational F-35B squadron, told Business Insider the idea of upgrading a legacy fighter to do the F-35's job was plainly "preposterous." Virtually everyone pointed to a single aspect of the F-35 that the F/A-18 lacked: stealth. But the US and other countries already have in their sights a modern update on the F/A-18 that is meant to complement the F-35. The update may be poised to deliver even more capability than Lockheed Martin's Joint Strike Fighter in some areas, even without being as stealthy. Dan Gillian, Boeing's vice president of F/A-18 and EA-18 programs, told Business Insider that even with the coming F-35C naval variant, US carrier air wings would still field versions of the F/A-18 into the 2040s. The company is planning considerable updates that will focus on "addressing the gaps" in naval aviation. Gillian and the Boeing team call it the Advanced Super Hornet, a modern update on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, which itself was an update on the original F/A-18 Hornet. Gillian says Boeing designed the Super Hornet "from the beginning in an evolutionary way with lots of room for growth in power, cooling, and weight so it could adapt to changes over the years." An EA-18G Growler launching from the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in a US Navy picture taken in the Arabian Gulf in 2014. US Navy/REUTERS "We have a legacy with the F-18 — on time on cost," Gillian said, which one could contrast to the F-35 program, which has faced constant production overruns in cost and time. In fact, a recent report says the Navy's version of the F-35 just hit yet another setback that could take years and billions to fix. Gillian says Boeing could start fielding Advanced Super Hornets by the early 2020s at the latest, while some limited contracts to bring elements of the Advanced Super Hornet are already underway. So even though the designs of the F-35 and the F/A-18 reflect different missions, they certainly are comparable in terms of price, availability, and capability. So what does a 2017 update of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet look like? Boeing "When we talk about the Advanced Super Hornet package, it can be delivered to a build of new airplanes and it can be retrofitted to existing airframes," Gillian said. "An airplane that I'm building today off the line has some systems that have matured over time that a Super Hornet would not have," he added, saying there would essentially be no difference between a 2017 Advanced Super Hornet and a Super Hornet plucked off an aircraft carrier and brought up to date. The physical characteristics of a fully decked out Advanced Super Hornet would be as follows: Shoulder-mounted conformal fuel tanks to carry 3,500 pounds of fuel and reduce drag. These fuel tanks could "extend the reach about 125 nautical miles," meaning the planes can "either go faster or carry more," according to Gillian. An infrared search and track radar, which would be the first such capability included on a US fighter jet since the F-14 Tomcat. This will allow the Advanced Super Hornets to counter enemy stealth capability and to get a read on heat-emitting entities without emitting any radar signal of their own. "There was a fixation on stealth attributes," Gillian said of fifth-gen fighters, "which is an important attribute for the next 25 years, but tactical fighters are designed for stealth in one part of the spectrum, all planes emit heat." Advanced electronic warfare capabilities. Currently, the F-18 family leads the US military in EW platforms with the Growler, an EW version of the Super Hornet in which Boeing has "taken out the gun and installed more EW equipment ... Instead of missiles on the wing tips it has a large sensing pods," Gillian said. The Navy has scheduled the F-35C to eventually carry the advanced EW pod, but the initial generation of F-35s will have to rely on Growlers for EW attacks. The Advanced Super Hornet will have EW self-protection, but not the full suite present on the Growler. An advanced cockpit system with a new 19-inch display. Basically "a big iPad for the airplane, allowing the pilot to manage all the information and data that’s out there," Gillian said, comparing its utility to the F-35's display. Improved avionics and computing power as well as increased ability to network to receive targeting data from platforms like the F-35 or the E-2 Hawkeye. The Advanced Super Hornet would also feature an improved active electronically scanned array radar. Further enhancements still to be considered by the US Navy for Advanced Super Hornets include the following: An enclosed weapons pod would make the plane more aerodynamic while also cutting down on the plane's radar cross section. Combined with the form-fitting fuel tanks, the Advanced Super Hornet could cut its radar signature by up to 50%. An improved engine could increase fuel efficiency and performance. Boeing hasn't yet begun earnestly working toward this, and it could add to the overall cost of the project significantly. Hypothetically, Advanced Super Hornets could field IRST before F-35Cs come online. Growlers will also serve in the vital role of EW attack craft, without which the F-35 cannot do its job as a stealth penetrator. So while an Advanced Super Hornet will never be comparable to the F-35 in all aspects, it could certainly develop some strengths that the F-35 lacks. Additionally, Gillian said the Advanced Super Hornets would not cost much more than the current F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, which run about $70 million apiece. Even if that price rose by $10 million, it would still be lower than that of the cheapest expected F-35s, which come in at $85 million. Conclusion: Could Boeing create an F/A-18 'comparable' to the F-35? It's unanimous. The F-18 will never do the F-35's job, and vice versa. Lockheed Martin "The Advanced Super Hornet is really a collection of systems and design changes that when implemented achieve a significantly different capability for the air wing," said Gillian, who stressed that the Super Hornet and Growler platforms were "well positioned" to improve in scope and capability over time. Gillian made it clear, however, that the Advanced Super Hornet program had been, since its inception, meant to accompany the F-35, with carrier air wings consisting of three squadrons of Super Hornets and one squadron of F-35s into the 2040s. The US Navy has contracts already underway to update its existing Super Hornet fleet with elements of the Advanced Super Hornet package, and it seems the US will end up with both Advanced Super Hornets and F-35s, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The F/A-18, not designed with all-aspect stealth in mind, will most likely never serve as a penetrating aircraft for heavily contested airspace, but its future onboard America's aircraft carriers is well defined for decades to come. But with Boeing's field record of delivering F/A-18 projects on time and on budget, and the US Navy left waiting by overrun after overrun in the F-35 program, the two planes are starting to look like apples and oranges — both good choices. Choosing which to buy and when may simply come down to what is available on the market.

Donald Trump made a point, and he made it often during the campaign, that we would be rebuilding our military. While the run was good for shareholders, many on Wall Street are starting to take a more cautious view on the sector in 2017. A recent Jefferies report from makes it clear that the firm too is in the cautious camp. While the analysts think defense budgets can grow at a 3% compounded annual growth rate over the next few years, there could be margin pressure, and also what they define as “Risk by Tweet” as the new president is fond of using Twitter as a forum to target business at times. With business jet deliveries down double-digits last year, and production cuts on some of the big airliner orders, the cautious stance at Jefferies is warranted. They have four top picks for 2017, and of course, all are rated Buy. Boeing This top aerospace industrial has been on a roll since the election and may be ready to breakthrough to multiyear highs. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services worldwide. The company operates in five segments: Commercial Airplanes, Boeing Military Aircraft, Network & Space Systems, Global Services & Support, and Boeing Capital. Recent reports indicate that the U.S. Navy plans to divest its older model F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets in coming years and hopes to buy dozens of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to deal with a shortfall of strike fighters aboard its carriers. If implemented, the plan would provide dozens of new orders for Boeing and keep its St. Louis production line running for several more years. The Jefferies team also sees big value in the stock and said in a research note late last year when the stock was trading right where it is now: Boeing’s 30% dividend hike was 2 times what we had expected, although shares have declined since the announcement. The dividend yield is now ~1% higher than the average DJI yield and given that Boeing’s recent yield has been in the 3% range, we see significant upside to shares. Looking at core earnings and adding back 787 amortization, shares trade at just 13 times our 2017 estimates, in line with stable growers, while cyclical shares are carrying multiples above 20 times earnings. The analysts noted this in the new report: Boeing should be able to launch a 737MAX-10X before year end to customers that want a complement to their MAX fleet. The plane should probably require modest development spending and should be ready by 2020. Longer term, we expect Boeing’s effort to define the production system necessary to produce its next family of mid-market planes to become clearer somewhere between 2018 and 2019. Boeing investors receive a 3.6% dividend. The Jefferies price objective for the stock is $185, the consensus target is $159.30. Shares closed Tuesday at $157.67.

Boeing officials say they’re working to lower costs of the Air Force One program after criticism from President-elect Trump. (Image “Air Force One” by Gage Skidmore via Flickr, by CC license 2.0.) Boeing looks to cut costs of Air Force One The chief executive of Boeing said Tuesday that progress is being made in lowering costs of its next generation of Air Force One program, according to The Hill. The comments followed Boeing executives’ second round of meetings that day with President-elect Donald Trump, who had threatened to cancel the program on Twitter last month after saying its costs had gotten “out of control.” The announcement comes less than a week after competitor Lockheed Martin disclosed plans to significantly lower costs of its F-35 fighter jet to the U.S. military—a decision that also stemmed from meetings with Trump after he similarly criticized the cost of the aircraft program via Twitter. Automakers respond to Trump General Motors officials announced Tuesday that $1 billion will be invested into existing operations in the U.S. while 7,000 or so domestic manufacturing and IT jobs will also be created or retained, according to this Detroit Free Press article published in USA Today. GM’s announcement comes a week after President-elect Donald Trump criticized the auto giant’s operations in Mexico—although GM officials say the plans unveiled Tuesday had been in the works for years. Trump’s Twitter criticisms have also garnered similar responses from Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in recent weeks. BMW, meanwhile, said that its plans for a $1 billion-factory in Mexico will move forward despite Trump’s weekend threats of a 35 percent border tax on German automakers, according to Reuters. D.C. hotel costs surge for Inauguration Hoteliers in the Washington D.C. area may rake in some hefty cash for the upcoming presidential inauguration. MarketWatch reported Tuesday that the average nightly hotel stay in D.C. in the days leading up to the Jan. 20 event stands at about $2,071—a whopping 927 percent spike from the usual costs this time of year. While hotel occupancy rates were still unavailable, Airbnb says it’s so far accommodated  15,100-plus bookings in the D.C. area for the weekend—10 times the figure it saw during the 2013 inauguration and already exceeding the company’s earlier expectations of 10,000 guests. Rolls-Royce hit with bribery penalties Government investigators in the U.S., Great Britain and Brazil disclosed Tuesday that they reached an $800 million deal with Rolls-Royce to settle claims that the British company had used bribery and secret payoffs to other countries to win business contracts dating back as far as 1989, according to USA Today. The settlements were revealed in court papers that were unsealed this week and allow the company, which has since publicly apologized, to continue business operations without criminal prosecution.

Muilenburg said his meeting with Trump on Tuesday was an "excellent conversation" which could lead to a deal "in the very near term." Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!— Donald J.

"That's going to lead to substantial cost reductions." Regarding fighter jets the Boeing boss said, "we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability and its's done affordably." The meeting comes a month after Trump’s criticism of the cost of building the new Air Force One fleet by Boeing. The President-elect has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. On December 6, he tweeted a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled. Boeing said it has so far received $170 million of the contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes.

In addition to Boeing’s contract to build the new Air Force One, they talked about the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Mr Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced fighter jet. "We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft," Mr Muilenburg said after the meeting. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification. "I think Mr Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business," Mr Muilenburg said. "We’re on the same page here." Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, Mr Muilenburg touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest US exporter supports. "You want manufacturing jobs – aerospace is the place to invest," he said. "We’re proud to take on that mission." Mr Trump’s public pressure on Boeing began on December 6, when he tweeted that "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than US$4 billion. Cancel order!" Mr Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4bn. "We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens," he said, adding he gave Mr Trump his "personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company". Boeing is not the only defence contractor who has felt the fury of Mr Trump’s tweets. The Lockheed chief executive Marillyn Hewson has met twice with him after he attacked the company for "out of control costs" on the F-35 jet, the largest US weapons programme. The $379bn programme for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered last week. Trump also called on Boeing to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet," referring to the company’s F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defence analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect’s criticism, Ms Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs "significantly" on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems Plc, a key subcontractor on the programme. "Over a period there’s no question we’ve been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period," Mr Carr said on Tuesday. "We respect that and we’ll work towards a contribution towards that." At the time of Mr Trump’s tweet about Air Force One, it was not immediately clear where his estimate of $4bn originated. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer said the president-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, "he’s heard these big numbers", said Frank Kendall. "Those are often programme costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They’re not contract values, necessarily." "The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4bn – the 747s we’re buying – so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means," Mr Kendall said. "We’re still negotiating with Boeing on that." Mr Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office on Friday, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. ""His general interest in reducing costs is terrific – his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics." * Bloomberg business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Southwest Airlines beats profit forecasts on fare price hike Raytheon hit as F-35 missile maker’s sales slow Ryanair targets Lufthansa’s Frankfurt hub to increase services Qantas relaunches Beijing route after eight-year gap MOST VIEWED Business | All Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet UAE and India pledge to boost bilateral trade by 60% London-based renewables investment adviser to open Dubai office Emirates slashes fares on routes to US, rekindling Open Skies tension UAE military contingent participates in India’s Republic Day parade Etihad Airways to deploy new Dreamliners on Levant and Far East routes Language of money best left to the present Singapore Airlines replaces Boeing 777 on two-stop route Airbus ‘in danger’ as Brexit trigger looms Owning cars, watches or art – directly or via a fund – is an investing option More Most Viewed ‘Ninety bodies found’ at Libyan ISIL camp bombed by US Matchmaking advertising billboards taken down in Dubai Life lessons: ‘My mother is British ... but I am 100 per cent Emirati’ Top Gear cast in Dubai for two-day shoot Emirati and Indian musicians release song to celebrate their countries’ friendship - video Trump changes his mind on Nato Burj Khalifa and Adnoc tower light up in colours of Indian flag Crowds cheer on Ironman 70.3 Dubai competitors and Ironkids Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet US businessman arrested after anti-Muslim tirade at JFK More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: Trump and Iraq’s oil Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent Municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Uncertain times in UAE football as China flexes its financial muscle Christo cancels Arkansas project and will now focus on Abu Dhabi’s The Mastaba About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Muilenburg told Reuters, "we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably”. “Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business," Muilenburg said. “We're proud to take on that mission and I think Mr Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country." Last month, Muilenburg met with Trump and told him that his company could build a cheaper Air Force One for less than originally quoted. Trump took to Twitter to blast the company for alleged cost overruns, saying they should cancel the contract. “I don't need a $4.2 billion airplane to fly around in,” Trump told “Fox News Sunday” earlier this month, referring to Air Force One. Boeing said a contract for $170 million for Boeing 747 planes, but said no cost has been finalized yet, Reuters reported. Muilenburg has appeared to strike an agreeable tone with the incoming president and said he made a “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing company”.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that “we’re going to do an infrastructure bill and it’s going to be big.” Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports on the campaign trail, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday’s inauguration, saying it will mark “the dawn of a new era for our country, it’s an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America.” Trump was set to make his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He’ll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he’s sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One program. “We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost,” Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump’s comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday’s inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he’s missed since 1987. “WRONG (or lie!)” Trump tweeted. “He boycotted Bush 43 also because he ‘thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in....he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.‘ Sound familiar!” Lewis’ office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush’s 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would “love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don’t, we’ve got some great seats for others to partake in. It’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power.” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a “reflection of the division” in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach “too complicated” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called “border adjustment” that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It’s part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he’ll offer “insurance for everybody.” Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide “universal access.” European Union nations bracing for Trump’s ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect’s stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump’s view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren’t paying their fair share had “caused astonishment.” Also this week, Trump’s picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana made his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: January 17th, 2017 >> Story Satnews Daily January 17th, 2017 ViaSat's New Satellite ...A Step Closer to Becoming First Global Internet Service Provider Stepping up to a belief the company has held for years, ViaSat's aim is to be the first global Internet service provider—a step that brings them ever closer when the company launches ViaSat-2. At an informal press event, ViaSat revealed its latest and most advanced satellite, which will put the company on a path to be more competitive in the Internet market. Carlsbad-based ViaSat is scheduled to launch its ViaSat-2 satellite in late March or early April. They partnered with Boeing to construct and test the satellite, which will increase ViaSat’s broadband Internet performance. The photo is of two Boeing 702 satellites in its thermal vacuum. Courtesy photo At Boeing’s satellite facility on Tuesday, ViaSat and Boeing executives engaged in an hour-long presentation about ViaSat-2’s capabilities, their business partnership, plus a tour of the facility highlighted by revealing its state-of-the-art satellite. The total project cost, meanwhile, is about $600 million, which include the launch, satellite, insurance and ground equipment, and took three years to construct. However, no photos were allowed to preserve company and technological strategies. Nevertheless, ViaSat’s crown jewel stands 25-feet high, about 10 feet wide and, once its solar panels deploy in space, it will have a wingspan of 150 feet. Arianespace, a French company, will deliver the satellite on its Ariane 5 rocket. “We’re really evolving toward, what we believe, is the first global Internet service provider,” said Dave Abrahamian, ViaSat’s director of space systems. “Our whole mantra for the past 10 years … is to reduce the cost per bit, increase capacity substantially so that satellite-based broadband is no longer the choice of last resort. We’ll move that ball significantly forward when we launch ViaSat-2.” ViaSat-2, meanwhile, will have roughly two times more the capacity than ViaSat-1, when it launched in 2011, for a total capacity of 300 gigabits per second (Gbps). With 300Gbps of capacity, it will give customers download speeds between 25 to 50Mbps. It will also providing seven times more coverage. With a successful launch, which is scheduled for March or April in French Guiana in South America, ViaSat-2 will expand the Carlsbad-based company’s reach across the Atlantic Ocean to the Middle East and the northern tip of South America. Alaska will be the only state not to receive coverage from ViaSat-2 due to the angle of Earth. “We don’t have to sacrifice capacity for coverage area,” Abrahamian explained. “We can also move capacity around. ViaSat-2 solves that problem.” In addition, the increase in ViaSat’s reach and capacity will allow its customer base to increase by an estimated two to three times, said Keven Lippert, executive vice president of Satellite Systems and Corporate Development at ViaSat. Currently, the company has about 700,000 residential and business users on its ViaSat-1 satellite plus more than 550 commercial aircraft along with maritime vessels and the U.S. government. Its domestic airline portfolio includes United, JetBlue, Virgin America and most recently, American Airlines.

It was the first-ever communications satellite and broadcasted the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Courtesy photo “We won the American Airlines contract first for their 737… and (a sizable portion of their) North American fleet,” Abrahamian said of the Boeing partnership. “We think we can compete favorably with cable providers. The cost per user…, which is their metric, is greatly, greatly in our favor. There is no great efficient means of providing broadband in a large area than satellite.” Abrahamian said another advantage for the company comes from aircraft service. With the launch, and ViaSat’s European partner Eutelsat, 85 to 90 percent of all flight routes will be covered. Lippert, though, said the ultimate advantages of the new satellite will allow the company to become more competitive in the Internet market. Notably, ViaSat can challenge low- to mid-tier cable and DSL Internet service providers. In addition, ViaSat-2 will begin to ease data caps currently in place. Abrahamian, though, said ViaSat-2 will dovetail into ViaSat-3, the company’s most aggressive effort to date. The project will launch a trio of satellites for global coverage and could eliminate the data caps plaguing Internet satellite companies. It will be the first satellite with one terabyte of capacity, which is larger than the more than 400 combined communication satellites currently in space. “I think the other point is our competition is more and more not other satellite companies,” Lippert said. “It’s DSL, cable and traditional telecom companies. That’s really our goal … and where we’re headed.” As for Boeing’s role, the two companies partnered to build the ViaSat-2 satellite. ViaSat constructed the systems and the design, while Boeing built the satellite (a 702 high-power series) and performed the mandatory testing requirements plus delivery to the launch site. Mark Spiwak, president of Boeing Satellite Systems International, and Ron Dukat, Boeing-ViaSat program director, said the partnership has flourished. “What we can offer customers like ViaSat is the best of the best,” Spiwak said. “Certain customers, like ViaSat, have certain proprietary information that they may not want to share that and we respect that.” As for the launch schedule, Abrahamian said ViaSat-2 had undergone and passed all testing performed by Boeing and is now waiting to be shipped to South America. Testing included temperature performances, where in space there is a 600-degree difference between light (300 degrees Fahrenheit) and shade (-300), noise exams up to 10,000 hertz and simulated space tests in Boeing’s thermal vacuum. “You get one shot at this,” Spiwak added. “These are 22,000 miles away so it’s a pretty rigorous test program so it makes sure it works for 15 years or whatever the design life is on orbit. You can’t go up there and fix it.” Once there, it will be fueled and launched into its orbital slot. However, ViaSat will conduct numerous systems tests once the satellite is in space and will be operational for consumer use by the fourth quarter 2017, Lippert added.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Boeing Co's chief executive said on Tuesday that he and President-elect Donald Trump "made progress" on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft, and suggesting a deal could be struck soon. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump's efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defence contractors. It also showed Boeing's adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the US manufacturing economy. Trump has been pressuring defence companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. Last month he said a USD4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be cancelled. Boeing has said it so far has a USD170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established. Trump also last month asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defence company to price a contract for Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the "excellent conversation" with Trump could lead to a deal "in the very near term." "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices," Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. "That's going to lead to substantial cost reductions." On fighter jets, he said, "we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably." Muilenburg praised Trump's approach to negotiations. "I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business," he said, noting that as the US' top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million US manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. "If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest," he said. "We're proud to take on that mission and I think Mr Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country." "I appreciate the teamwork approach on this - I think it's the right way to do business." Boeing's stock was down 0.6 percent at USD157.87 in afternoon trade.

Large orders have been placed for the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX. Boeing has announced its design for a further stretch of the MAX and is preparing to see the first of the MAX family enter service this year. Neos and Bombardier CSeries aircraft will continue their in-service momentum. The widebody market, however, has hit the doldrums. Orders have slowed, Airbus and Boeing have both announced production rate cuts and there is talk – some of it already confirmed - of order deferrals. But it would be wrong to cast a gloomy outlook for the industry as a whole or for the widebody market in particular. Projections are for another profitable year for the world’s airlines in the order of almost $30 billion. And the trend-line for air passenger growth continues its upward climb. Passenger numbers are expected to reach almost 4 billion this year, which will be a record. Reflecting that appetite to fly, airlines increased the number of unique city-pair connections in 2016 by more than 700 to over 18,000. By 2036, IATA forecasts that 7.2 billion passengers will travel by air annually, almost double the 3.8 billion who flew in 2016. While narrowbodies – especially in the low cost sector -- will play a crucial role in delivering those billions of new fliers to their destinations, it must not be overlooked that those numbers cannot be met without the indispensable widebody. Airlines that invest in a widebody fleet are playing a long game – it’s an investment in anticipated passenger growth and in new destinations. People don’t just want to travel; they want to go to faraway places. China’s outbound international market is booming. China and India will both eclipse the US as the world’s largest air traffic markets by 2029. The widebody is the only way to satisfy that demand, particularly on large hub-to-hub routes. And while the new generation of narrowbodies is eminently capable of carrying people farther, there are operational and customer service advantages to the widebody that the narrowbody cannot easily deliver on long-haul flights. Twin aisles are quicker to board and deplane; they offer more bin space and lavatories, larger galleys and greater IFE options, as well as crew rest areas. They also offer more ways for airlines to customize and differentiate their product; that’s important in an increasingly competitive market. Yes, there will be some order deferrals and yes, in some long-haul markets today there are airlines with a lot of capacity chasing the same passengers. But the upward trend in air travel demand is undeniable. The widebody is how that demand will be fulfilled.

In addition to Boeing's contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company's F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-35 as the Pentagon's advanced fighter jet. "We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft," Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification." VIDEOS TOP JOBS Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of "the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases," although no specific reductions have yet been announced. "Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business," Muilenburg said after their meeting Tuesday. "We're on the same page here." Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, its CEO touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest U.S. exporter supports. "You want manufacturing jobs — aerospace is the place to invest," Muilenburg said. "We're proud to take on that mission." Trump's public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. "We're going to get it done for less than that, and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens," Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his "personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company." More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn't the only defense contractor that's felt the fury of Trump's tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for "out of control costs" on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered Jan. 11. Trump also called on Boeing to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet," referring to the company's F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect's criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs "significantly" on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems, a key subcontractor on the program. » Next page...

The 35-year sentence Manning received was the longest ever imposed for a leak conviction. Manning has already served seven years of her sentence and will now be released on May 17, 2017.  ADVERTISEMENT She was originally set to be released be released in 2045.  Manning's grant came in a batch of 209 commutations and 64 pardons, announced with four days left in Obama's presidency.  The former Army private, who is transgender, has reportedly struggled with mental health issues. She has tried to commit suicide twice and has spent time in solitary confinement as punishment.  Obama's move could also have consequences for the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, whose organization published material leaked by both Manning and Snowden.  "If Obama grants Manning clemency Assange will agree to US extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case," WikiLeaks tweeted last week.  The president's decision is sure to roil an ongoing debate about weighty issues such as intelligence leaks and criminal justice reform.  The Hill's Jordan Fabian has the full story on Manning's commutation here.  The president also pardoned retired Gen. James Cartwright, who was convicted in 2012 for lying to FBI investigators while being questioned about leaks involving a top secret U.S. program to derail Iran's nuclear program.  Our Katie Bo Williams has more on the Cartwright pardon here. The Manning commutation is already sparking controversy, with one Republican senator saying that Obama had commuted the sentence of a traitor. The Hill's Mark Hensch has that story: Sen. Tom CottonTom CottonConservative nonprofit pressures GOP to approve Trump budget pick In a divided US, one event proved there's still bipartisan foreign policy Mulvaney vows to give Trump straight talk on entitlements MORE (R-Ark.) says President Obama treated "a traitor like a martyr" in commuting former soldier Chelsea Manning's prison sentence. "When I was leading soldiers in Afghanistan, Private Manning was undermining us by leaking hundreds of thousands classified documents to WikiLeaks," he said in a statement Tuesday. "I don't understand why the president would feel special compassion for someone who endangered the lives of our troops, diplomats, intelligence officers, and allies. We ought not treat a traitor like a martyr." Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, though, is praising the decision, reports The Hill's Paulina Firozi. "In five more months, you will be free. Thank you for what you did for everyone, Chelsea. Stay strong a while longer," Snowden tweeted.   BOEING CEO MEETS WITH TRUMP: The head of Boeing said Tuesday he and President-elect Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump to speak with Putin, other world leaders Saturday Trump orders publication of stats on terror-linked crime by foreign nationals Warren goes on tweetstorm over refugee ban MORE made progress on reducing the cost of the next generation of Air Force One planes in their second meeting since Trump slammed the program on Twitter. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices," Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters after meeting with Trump. "All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I'm pleased with the progress there." In December, Trump tweeted that costs for the new Air Force One are "out of control" and threatened to cancel the program. The Hill's Rebecca Kheel has more here.   PENTAGON IDENTIFIES GITMO DETAINEES SENT TO OMAN: The Pentagon on Tuesday identified the 10 Guantanamo Bay detainees sent to Oman. The Pentagon's confirmation came a day after the Arabian Peninsula country announced that it had accepted the detainees. Among those transferred include two men who the Pentagon acknowledged were cases of mistaken identity. "The United States is grateful to the government of Oman for its humanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility," the Pentagon said in a statement Tuesday. "The United States coordinated with the government of Oman to ensure these transfers took place consistent with appropriate security and humane treatment measures." The transfer is part of President Obama's push to clear the facility as much as possible before he leaves office Friday. Forty-five detainees now remain at Guantanamo. Oman has a rehabilitation program for extremists and previously took in 20 Yemeni detainees from Guantanamo. The Hill's Rebecca Kheel tells us more about who the 10 detainees are here.   McCAIN PROPOSES $640B DEFENSE BUDGET: Sen. John McCainJohn McCainMcConnell warns Trump: Don’t lift Russia sanctions Week ahead: Russian sanctions in the spotlight Trump: 'Very early' to consider lifting Russian sanctions MORE (R-Ariz.) is proposing a $640 billion base defense budget for the next fiscal year, $54 billion above what had been projected by the Obama administration. "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to 'fully eliminate the defense sequester' and 'submit a new budget to rebuild our military.' This cannot happen soon enough," McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, wrote in a 33-page white paper released over the holiday weekend. "The damage that has been done to our military over the past eight years will not be reversed in one year. Just stemming the bleeding caused by recent budget cuts will take most of the next five years, to say nothing of the sustained increases in funding required thereafter." The Hill's Rebecca Kheel has more here.    TRUMP'S NAVY BUILDUP: President-elect Donald Trump wants to expand the Navy's fleet to 350 ships, the largest build-up since the end of the Cold War.  But where that money will come from is unclear and defense contractors aren't counting their ships yet, writes The Hill's Kristina Wong.  Experts say that going from the current fleet of 274 ships to Trump's 350 goal will cost about $165 billion over 30 years. And it will be impossible to achieve unless there's a dramatic increase in the defense budget, currently at $619 billion. There are expectations on Capitol Hill and within the Pentagon that Trump will substantially increase the defense budget. However, there are key obstacles to raising defense spending.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) NEW YORK—Vice President-elect Mike Pence is pledging to a group of mayors that the Trump administration will make a serious investment in infrastructure. Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that “we’re going to do an infrastructure bill and it’s going to be big.” Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports on the campaign trail, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday’s inauguration, saying it will mark “the dawn of a new era for our country, it’s an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America.” Trump was set to make his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He’ll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he’s sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump had previously criticized the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One program.

(Tim Vizer/Belleville News-Democrat via AP, File) “We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost,” Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag.

On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he’s missed since 1987.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2017 Lewis’ office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush’s 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would “love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don’t, we’ve got some great seats for others to partake in. It’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power.” Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach “too complicated” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

It’s part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump’s ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect’s stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump’s view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren’t paying their fair share had “caused astonishment.” Trump also said that Britain’s decision to leave the 28-nation EU would “end up being a great thing,” and he predicted that other countries would also leave. Also this week, Trump’s picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening.

Political Reporter For Dailymail.com Published: 13:38 EST, 17 January 2017 | Updated: 19:12 EST, 17 January 2017 e-mail 43 shares 38 View comments Boeing's boss said today that he and President-elect Donald Trump 'made progress' on lowering the cost of a new Air Force One and on a Boeing fighter aircraft, suggesting a deal could be struck soon. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump's efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors.  It also showed Boeing's adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy. Scroll down for video  Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg (pictured) met with President-elect Donald Trump today at Trump Tower and said the two made progress on the price of new Air Forces Ones  Dennis Muilenburg, head of aerospace giant Boeing, stopped and talked to reporters after speaking with President-elect Donald Trump  Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings.  Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled.  Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established. Last month, Trump also asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company to price a contract for Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the 'excellent conversation' with Trump could lead to a deal 'in the very near term.' 'We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,' Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next New tax battle brewing between Trump and Ryan as...

On fighter jets, he said, 'we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably.' Muilenburg praised Trump's approach to negotiations. 'I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business,' he said, noting that as the U.S.' top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. 'If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest,' he said. 'We're proud to take on that mission and I think Mr Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country.' 'I appreciate the teamwork approach on this - I think it's the right way to do business.' Boeing's stock was down 0.6 percent at $157.87 in afternoon trade.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Pence promises big investment in infrastructure Tuesday Jan 17, 2017 at 6:57 AM Jan 17, 2017 at 4:40 PM Jonathan Lemire The Associated Press NEW YORK - Vice President-elect Mike Pence is pledging to a group of mayors that the Trump administration will make a serious investment in infrastructure.  Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports on the campaign trail, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump was set to make his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance ofFriday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Trump also said that Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation EU would "end up being a great thing," and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple - "it is the unity of the Europeans." In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: "We Europeans have our fate in our own hands." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep.

SMITH / POOL Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg speaks to media after a meeting in Trump Tower in New York City, United States on January 17, 2017. EFE/BRYAN R. SMITH / POOL Menéame Boeing said Tuesday that excellent strides were made in bringing down the Air Force One replacement fleet's cost, which President-elect Donald Trump said last month was exorbitant. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification ... all that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost. I'm pleased with the progress there," the company's CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, said after a meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower. Trump caused a stir on Dec. 6 when he complained in a tweet that the cost of the new Air Force One was too high. "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" he wrote. Muilenburg first met with Trump on Dec. 21 to discuss the issue and then on Tuesday sat down again with the real-estate mogul at Trump Tower for what he told reporters was a "very productive" conversation. Trump also has criticized Lockheed Martin for "out-of-control costs" on its F-35 jet and asked Boeing to offer a price for a similar aircraft, its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Muilenburg said he also spoke Tuesday with Trump about fighter planes but did not offer any details. Content providers. Contact EFE.

Las Vegas Sun January 27, 2017 Currently: 48° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events Sports betting UNLV sports Gaming Education NHL in Las Vegas Smith's World HS Basketball Newsletter signup 0 Comments Pence promises big investment in infrastructure Carolyn Kaster / AP Vice President-elect Mike Pence walks through the halls of Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017. By Jonathan Lemire and Catherine Lucey, Associated Press Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017 | 1:16 p.m. NEW YORK — Vice President-elect Mike Pence is pledging to a group of mayors that the Trump administration will make a serious investment in infrastructure. Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports on the campaign trail, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump was set to make his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Trump also said that Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation EU would "end up being a great thing," and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple — "it is the unity of the Europeans." In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: "We Europeans have our fate in our own hands." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill, and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports while campaigning, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump also made his first trip to Washington in weeks on Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump flew in for a black-tie dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The Chairman's Global Dinner drew nearly 150 diplomats and ambassadors, well-heeled donors, soon-to-be White House staffers and Cabinet picks. "We have great respect for your countries. We have great respect for our world," Trump told the group after he was introduced by Pence, who assured that the future president was willing to engage with the world, despite his "America First" mantra. "I'm not sure that the national media here in America completely understands the president-elect. I can assure you that the world will," Pence said, adding that Trump "will be a president who puts America first, but we will work every day with nations around the world to advance the peace and prosperity of our allies and our friends across the world." The president-elect is expected to return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in.

"Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he'll offer "insurance for everybody." Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide "universal access." European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment."

The Associated Press | (2) Comment By Art | JANUARY 17, 2017 10:25 PM Honestly I do not think the Europeans will be fine. The U.S. pivot towards Russia, and the destabilisation of the Middle East, together with the refugee problem that has generated, are two phases of an ongoing war against Europe and the ideals of equality, social democracy and mutual co-operation that it stands for.

See how we got here. USA TODAY NETWORK Flight officer Rayan Gharazeddine scans the water in the southern Indian Ocean off Australia from a Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion during a search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. (Photo: Rob Griffith, AP) Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the fatal-accident rate among airliners. The story has been updated with the correct statistics. As governments sail away from the nearly three-year search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, failing to find the wreckage and explain what went wrong for the 239 people aboard could haunt the industry that has reached lofty levels of safety. The Boeing 777 disappeared without a distress call March 8, 2014, on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Based on clues from the plane’s electronics, the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia spent $160 million scouring a section of the Indian Ocean floor the size of Pennsylvania. The suspension Tuesday of the underwater search leaves fundamental questions unanswered: What went wrong? Was there a mechanical problem? Did somebody aboard the plane make a mistake – or crash it intentionally? The search's end comes two months after investigators took another detailed look at the clues that dictated where they were looking, and a month after they found that another area of ocean floor the size of Vermont might be more promising. “They’re going to be haunted by what might or might not be in that zone,” said David Gallo, who helped find Air France Flight 447 at the bottom of the Atlantic in 2011 and who is now senior advisor for strategic initiatives at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “This should really drive them crazy.” Investigators say the plane’s wreckage – and potentially the data and voice recorders – could explain whatever problems happened so that they could be avoided in the future. The Boeing 777 is a workhorse of the long-haul fleet, with 1,200 flying worldwide. “We really do need to find the wreckage to ensure that there’s no problem with the aircraft,” said Al Diehl, a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. For example, the recovery of Air France Flight 447 revealed that pilots made mistakes flying in a snowstorm, but also a problem with pitot tubes, sensors that stick out of the fuselage of the Airbus A330, that gave the pilots bad information. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said the manufacturer has been fully dedicated to the Malaysia search and investigation. The company’s thoughts continue to be with the families, friends and colleagues of those aboard the flight, he said. “We accept the conclusion of government authorities leading the investigation and search that, in the absence of credible new information that leads to identification of a specific location of the aircraft, there will be no further expansion of the search area,” Alder said. The disappearance came at a time of dramatic improvements in safety. The number of fatalities aboard passenger airliners worldwide from 1959 throgh 2015 was 29,165, according to a Boeing study. But the total for the last decade was 3,133, according to the study. The last fatal crash of a U.S. passenger airline was in February 2009. “Historically, we’ve achieved this very high level of aviation safety by finding the wreckage and other data, and analyzing it – lessons learned from previous accidents,” Diehl said. Finding sunken planes is hard, even when the location is better known than the Malaysia flight. A Northwest Airlines plane that crashed in Lake Michigan in 1950 without modern tracking equipment has never been found. The Aviation Safety Network counts 84 planes, each with at least 14 people aboard, that have gone missing since 1948, typically over oceans, mountains or other remote areas. The Malaysia flight’s transponder and automated maintenance system stopped signaling less than an hour into the flight. But a satellite caught hourly pings from the plane, which suggested it flew far out over the ocean until running out of fuel. Because the ocean is several miles deep in the search area, the vessels first mapped the ocean floor and then dragged sonar vehicles on miles-long cords to scan the bottom. They found details as small as anchors and as large as a shipwreck. But no airliner. “It’s probably one of the largest continuous maps of the seafloor ever made, with the resolution they made it," Gallo said. He called deep-sea exploration one of the hardest tasks on Earth, comparable to space expeditions. “You’re actually mounting an expedition into an unknown world where the mountains are taller, the valleys are deeper and wider. There are volcanoes and earthquakes,” Gallo said. “It’s almost like going to Mars, to look for a plane. You’re mounting an expedition to an unknown world.” USA TODAY Search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 turns up shipwreck instead USA TODAY Underwater searches 'not easy ... but not impossible' USA TODAY New MH370 report says plane crashed into ocean at high speed More than 20 fragments of the Malaysia plane have washed up on distant shores, along the coast of Africa, and the islands of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodriguez. Damage to flaps from the wings suggested that they were in position for cruising rather than landing when the plane plunged into the sea. The search committee conducted a November review of how those fragments drifted and other data. In December, the committee changed its interpretation of where the wreckage might be, to north of where search vessels were focused, in an area of about 9,600 square miles. “The experts concluded that, if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be exhausted,” the committee said in a Dec. 20 report. But without a more precise location, the transport ministers of the three countries in charge of the search announced Tuesday the last vessel had left the search area located about 1,000 miles west of Australia. “The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness,” said the statement from Liow Tiong Lai of Malaysia, Li Xiaopeng of China and Darren Chester of Australia. “Whilst combined scientific studies have continued to refine areas of probability, to date no new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft.” Chester told reporters that he understood the "disappointment and frustration" of relatives of the passengers, some of whom he met with, and that he shared their disappointment even if he couldn't "possibly understand their grief." "They have been waiting for answers now for almost three years, and it is the unanswered questions for them which is the most difficult part for them to deal with," Chester said. But the three governments agreed in July that they would suspend the search if they didn't develop any more precise information about the plane's location. "If I continue the search effort and came to you today and said I have reached agreement with Malaysia and China to find another 20, 30, 40 or 50 million dollars, you'd be saying to me well, 'Why are you spending taxpayers' money in this way?'" Chester said. "But by coming to you and saying that we agreed in July last year that in the absence of any credible new evidence leading to the specific location of the aircraft, we intend to suspend the search, you are now asking well why won't you extend it to a new area. I don't think there's a perfect answer." The advocacy group Voice 370, which represents families of the passengers, urged the search to continue. The group called the November review “a mere smokescreen” and said requiring the “precise location of the aircraft” before continuing the effort would “bury the search.” “In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” the group said on its Facebook page. 16978 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k1YhMX NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports on the campaign trail, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump was set to make his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Trump also said that Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation EU would "end up being a great thing," and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple — "it is the unity of the Europeans." In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: "We Europeans have our fate in our own hands." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening.

It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he'll offer "insurance for everybody." Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide "universal access." European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana made his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening. ___ Associated Press writers Julie Pace in Washington and Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report. ___ Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire © 2017 The Associated Press.

By: Hana Levi Julian Published: January 17th, 2017 Facebook Twitter Telegram Google Reddit LinkedIn Printer-Ready Page Layout Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg at Trump Tower in NYC Photo Credit: DS Levi U.S. President-elect Donald Trump met with Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York City to discuss the company’s F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet — a possible competitor for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter jet, which has overrun its production times and costs — and to discuss a replacement fleet for Air Force One. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters at a quick briefing following his one-hour meeting with Mr. Trump. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements on Air Force One, streamlining the process – all that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost.” Mr. Trump had scrapped the original replacement plans for Air Force One, saying the price was simply “too high.” Muilenberg revealed no further details about the discussion over the military aircraft. Israel received delivery of its first two F-35 stealth fighter jets — named the “Adir” in Hebrew — this past month, with more expected to arrive this year. By the end of the next decade, Israel is expected to receive a total of 50 of the aircraft. But a Pentagon report released this month revealed the aircraft has yet to be fully “bug free” and has more than 200 technical issues that still must be addressed.

Trump continues to hold meetings at his offices days before the inauguration in Washington. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)    5427097 Boeing’s CEO confirmed that the company, which is currently building an updated Air Force One for the president, has taken steps to provide a “better airplane at a lower cost.” The confirmation came from Boeing’s CEO Tuesday. Speaking to reporters in a brief gaggle in the lobby, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company has made some “great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One,” according to pool reporter Katie Reilly of Time Magazine. “We talked about a couple of topics. We discussed Air Force One. We discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg said after emerging from the elevator in Trump Tower. He characterized his meeting with Trump as an “excellent conversation.” The meeting follows recent comments from the president-elect regarding the cost of the Air Force One. In early December, Trump tweeted that while Boeing is building a band new 747 Air Force One, costs were out of control, with a price tag north of $4 billion.”Cancel order!” Trump said at the time. Boeing responded by assuring the public that it was dedicated to providing the best product at the lowest cost, and followed up by meeting with the president-elect. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Muilenburg said. “All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I’m pleased with the progress there,” the CEO said. “And similarly on fighters, we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably.” “I think Mr Trump is doing a great job with engaging the business,” Muilenburg said when asked if he thought Trump’s habit of tweeting directly to companies was the “right way” to negotiate on business. “We want to generate jobs in the U.S.,” he told reporters. “I think Mr. Trump’s engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country,” Muilenburg said. When asked when a deal would be finalized, Muilenburg said that “I think we’re making great progress,” but declined to state a date. “I appreciate the teamwork approach on this. I think it’s the right way to do business,” the Boeing CEO said of his meetings with the president-elect. Follow Ted on Twitter Send Tips to [email protected] .

John Lewis, D-Ga. testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington at the confirmation hearing for Attorney General-designate, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Lewis says he's doesn't consider Donald Trump a "legitimate president," blaming the Russians for helping the Republican win the White House. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)(Cliff Owen) The Associated Press Donald Trump is making his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach and his focus turns to the nation's capital. The president-elect also on Tuesday continued his social media attacks on Rep. John Lewis, an Alabama native and civil rights icon. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

"We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices," Muilenburg told reporters after their second meeting at Trump Tower in New York. "All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I'm pleased with the progress there." Story Continued Below In December Trump posted on Twitter that the cost estimates of the next-generation pair of Air Force One aircraft were "out of control" and raised the prospect of canceling the project. Muilenburg and Trump subsequently met at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where the Boeing executive pledged the company would build two new presidential aircraft for less than $4 billion. Outgoing Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told POLITICO at the time that new Air Force One will be so expensive because it requires so many added features demanded by White House security personnel. The price tag could be pared down "if you change the requirements," James said. "If you have lesser communications requirements, if you have lesser countermeasures, if you have lesser any of these factors." She also said that while the Air Force oversees the program, the aircraft standards are set by the White House. Leaving their meeting on Tuesday, Muilenburg said he and the president-elect also talked about fighter aircraft and "options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably." Trump has criticized the cost of Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, and said he's asked Boeing to explore pricing for an F/A-18 alternative. But last week Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who also met with Trump for the second time, said the company is "close to a deal" that will bring down the cost of the F-35. When asked whether Trump's Twitter comments were the right way to negotiate business, Muilenburg said the president-elect "is doing a great job with engaging the business. We're all on the same page here. Our objective is to provide the best capability for our country most affordably. We want to generate jobs in the U.S.” He added: “If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest. We’re proud to take on that mission. And I think Mr. Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Ellen Mitchell emitchell@politico.com This story tagged under: Defense Listen to today's flash briefing POLITICO Playbook's must-listen rundown on what's driving the day in Washington.

By Tony Capaccio, Toluse Olorunnipa and Julie Johnsson Bloomberg Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said he “made some great progress” in face-to-face talks with Donald Trump on the president-elect’s demand to hold down costs on the next-generation version of Air Force One. In addition to Boeing’s contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced fighter jet. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.” Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” although no specific reductions have yet been announced. “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business,” Muilenburg said after their meeting Tuesday. “We’re on the same page here.” Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, its CEO touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest U.S. exporter supports. “You want manufacturing jobs — aerospace is the place to invest,” Muilenburg said. “We’re proud to take on that mission.” Trump’s public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens,” Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.” More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn’t the only defense contractor that’s felt the fury of Trump’s tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for “out of control costs” on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered Jan. 11. Trump also called on Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet,” referring to the company’s F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect’s criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs “significantly” on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems, a key subcontractor on the program. “Over a period there’s no question we’ve been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period,” Carr said in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday from Davos. “We respect that and we’ll work towards a contribution towards that.” At the time of Trump’s tweet about Air Force One, it wasn’t immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer said in an interview that the president-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, “he’s heard these big numbers,” Frank Kendall said in an interview. “Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They’re not contract values, necessarily.” “The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion — the 747s we’re buying — so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means,” Kendall said. “We’re still negotiating with Boeing on that.” Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. “His general interest in reducing costs is terrific — his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics,” Kendall said.

(AP file) NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump is making his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach and his focus turns to the nation’s capital. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He’ll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he’s sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One program. “We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost,” Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump’s comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday’s inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he’s missed since 1987. “WRONG (or lie!)” Trump tweeted. “He boycotted Bush 43 also because he ‘thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in….he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.’ Sound familiar!” Lewis’ office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush’s 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycotts, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said “it’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power,” but noted that it is their right. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach “too complicated” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called “border adjustment” that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It’s part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump’s ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect’s stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump’s view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren’t paying their fair share had “caused astonishment.” Trump also said that Britain’s decision to leave the 28-nation EU would “end up being a great thing,” and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple — “it is the unity of the Europeans.” In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: “We Europeans have our fate in our own hands.” Also this week, Trump’s picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill, and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports while campaigning, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump also made his first trip to Washington in weeks on Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump flew in for a black-tie dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The Chairman's Global Dinner drew nearly 150 diplomats and ambassadors, well-heeled donors, soon-to-be White House staffers and Cabinet picks. "We have great respect for your countries. We have great respect for our world," Trump told the group after he was introduced by Pence, who assured that the future president was willing to engage with the world, despite his "America First" mantra. "I'm not sure that the national media here in America completely understands the president-elect. I can assure you that the world will," Pence said, adding that Trump "will be a president who puts America first, but we will work every day with nations around the world to advance the peace and prosperity of our allies and our friends across the world." The president-elect is expected to return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program.

Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he'll offer "insurance for everybody." Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide "universal access." European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill, and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports while campaigning, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump also made his first trip to Washington in weeks on Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump flew in for a black-tie dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The Chairman's Global Dinner drew nearly 150 diplomats and ambassadors, well-heeled donors, soon-to-be White House staffers and Cabinet picks. "We have great respect for your countries. We have great respect for our world," Trump told the group after he was introduced by Pence, who assured that the future president was willing to engage with the world, despite his "America First" mantra. "I'm not sure that the national media here in America completely understands the president-elect. I can assure you that the world will," Pence said, adding that Trump "will be a president who puts America first, but we will work every day with nations around the world to advance the peace and prosperity of our allies and our friends across the world." The president-elect is expected to return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he'll offer "insurance for everybody." Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide "universal access." European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment."

Associated Press Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, center, departs after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017. Associated Press   By JONATHAN LEMIRE and CATHERINE LUCEY     NEW YORK -- Donald Trump is making his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach and his focus turns to the nation's capital. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycotts, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said "it's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power," but noted that it is their right. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Trump also said that Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation EU would "end up being a great thing," and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple - "it is the unity of the Europeans." In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: "We Europeans have our fate in our own hands." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary.

WABC By Josh Einiger Tuesday, January 17, 2017 WASHINGTON, DC (WABC) -- It was Donald Trump's first time as President-elect, literally on the international stage. Tuesday night, three days before the inauguration, before more than 200 foreign diplomats in Washington, Donald Trump couldn't help but remind them that he won. "We set records in so many different ways, they don't love talking about that on the news," Trump said. "They don't like saying more counties than anybody you look at a map of the counties in this country that we won and it's literally entirely, it just looks like it is entirely red." Earlier, they were checking the sound on the Capitol steps where Trump will officially take the oath on Friday. He'll use two Bibles, including one his mother gave him, and one used by Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama. But nothing is normal about this inaugural. With demonstrations gearing up against the pending repeal of the Affordable Care Act, as many as 400,000 Americans are expected in Washington to protest the inauguration. Then there are the planned no-shows. One in four congressional democrats is boycotting the event. "I can't go to this inauguration because he continues to spew hatred, bigotry and prejudice," a democrat said. Trump is taking office with unprecedented unpopularity. Just 40% percent of Americans approve of how he's handled the transition. That's 30 points lower than his last three predecessors. Tuesday, Trump tweeted that the polls are rigged. Later, he told that crowd of foreign dignitaries the team he's chosen is top notch. "I'm very proud of everybody, the cabinet members," Trump said. "We have put together a team, I think the likes of which has never been assembled. So, we'll have further reports in the years to come, but I think you'll see that.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Nation & World Politics Boeing CEO says he ‘made some great progress’ in talks with Trump about Air Force One Originally published January 17, 2017 at 10:24 am Updated January 18, 2017 at 6:19 am Dennis Muilenburg, Boeingchief executive (BRYAN R. SMITH / POOL/EPA) Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with the president-elect at Trump Tower on Tuesday to talk about the jet maker’s contract to build the new Air Force One and about the F-18 Super Hornet. Share story By Tony Capaccio, Toluse Olorunnipa and Julie Johnsson Bloomberg News Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said he “made some great progress” in face-to-face talks with Donald Trump on the president-elect’s demand to hold down costs on the next-generation version of Air Force One. In addition to Boeing’s contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced jet fighter. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.” Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” although no specific reductions have yet been announced.

Cancel order!” After that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. Boeing isn’t the only defense contractor that’s felt the fury of Trump’s tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for “out of control costs” on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. Trump also called on Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet,” referring to the company’s F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect’s criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs “significantly’’ on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Comments Share Tweet Share Share Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg says he and President-elect Donald Trump made “great progress” during a meeting on the next Air Force One fleet. Muilenburg visited Trump Tower Tuesday morning to discuss the contract for the second time since Trump publicly criticized the aerospace giant for the estimated cost of the Air Force One program. Related: Boeing’s problems are nothing when compared to ‘the old days’ Last month, Trump tweeted, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” The New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, told reporters the cost to the government was “ridiculous,” though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, “but not that much.” In the wake of that, Muilenburg vowed that the company would build the new version of the jet for less money. However, the Air Force would likely have to change its requirements to lower costs. “It was a terrific conversation,” Muilenburg said after his first meeting with Trump. “I have a lot of respect for him. He’s a good man and he’s doing the right thing.” In March, the Government Accountability Office estimated the total program cost of the Air Force One program at more than $3.2 billion. Much of that would be for research and development. The Defense Department put the cost of two new aircraft around $4 billion, the Associated Press reports. That cost would also include research and development, construction and maintenance. As of December, the Air Force spent around $170 million on contracts to begin identifying what would need to be done to a 747-8 to adapt it for use by the president and his staff. Under the current deal, the Air Force would purchase the 747-8, which is a newer version of the two currently in use by the government. The two modified Boeing 747s President Obama has used were built in the 1980s. They took flight in the early 1990s. The new Air Force One planes wouldn’t be ready until about 2023 or 2024, which would be the end of Trump’s second term — if he sought and won re-election. Reuters reports that after their second meeting, Muilenburg, who wouldn’t go into much detail, said he and Trump “made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One,” which could lead to “substantial cost reductions.” Comments Share Tweet Share Share Most Popular It's all fun and games until you become president 'Gold' could at least be closer to the truth Port of Seattle CEO placed on administrative leave More Microsoft fights US government and wins Is Elon Musk getting into the tunnel game?

Federal News Radio conducted an exclusive data center survey to assess how agencies are storing data. Download the results. Bond prices rose, while the dollar’s value sank against the British pound and other rivals. Advertisement At 12:50 p.m. Eastern Time, the Dow was down 46 points at 19,840. The S&P 500 fell 5 points to 2,270. And the Nasdaq fell 28 points to 5,547. CONGRESS-HEALTH OVERHAUL Analysis says premiums would jump WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress’ nonpartisan budget analyst says premiums would jump sharply and millions more people would be without health coverage under a bill Republicans passed last year eliminating President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. The Congressional Budget office says under that measure, premiums for people buying policies on the law’s online marketplaces would jump up to 25 percent in the first year after enactment. They’d about double by 2026. It also says there’d be 18 million new uninsured people in the first year after enactment. That number would grow to 32 million by 2026. Republicans have said they’re using last year’s bill as a starting point as they try to dismantle Obama’s law this year and replace it. Last year’s measure did not include any replacement provisions. Obama vetoed last year’s bill. TRUMP-BOEING Boeing CEO cites progress on Air Force One cost WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of Boeing says “great progress” has been made in negotiations with President-elect Donald Trump to settle on a new price tag for the Air Force One program. Trump last month blasted the proposed cost to replace the aging fleet of presidential aircraft. He met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg last month and again today in Trump Tower. BRITAIN-BREXIT British PM calls for a clean Brexit break LONDON (AP) — Britain’s future outside the European Union is becoming much clearer. Prime Minister Theresa May, in a speech today, said the U.K. wants to free itself from governance by the EU. But it still wants to be allies — and trading partners, without tariffs — with the 27 remaining EU nations. Some analysts are saying her plans are ambitious — like a divorcing couple who want to stay best friends, share the kids, and keep each other’s front door keys. DAVOS Dollar rise could hurt developing economies DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — The dollar’s strength could lead to financial bailouts in emerging market economies and even an intervention to limit the currency’s rise. That’s the view of David Rubenstein, co-CEO of The Carlyle Group, a leading private equity firm. Addressing delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Rubenstein says there’s a risk of “potentially another Mexican-style crisis” in emerging markets because many firms that borrowed in dollars won’t be able repay the loans if their earnings are in local currency while the dollar appreciates. He says there’s around $4.5 trillion in emerging market corporate debt that is dollar-denominated. He says there may well have “to be some intervention” to rein in the dollar or “you’re going to have to bail some of these countries out.” DAVOS-CHINA Chinese president presses case for free trade DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) —Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) is pressing his case for free trade, urging the world to “say no to protectionism” and warning that “no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war. Xi made the comments today in an opening address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Swizerland. It’s the first such visit ever by a Chinese head of state to the gathering of world business and political leaders. Xi didn’t directly mention U.S. President-elect Donald Trump but cast China as a standard-bearer of free trade amid concerns in some corners that the new U.S. administration may enact more protectionist measures in trade. Xi says the world must “remain committed to promoting free trade and investment through opening up” and said “pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room.” UNITED NATIONS-WORLD ECONOMIC FORECAST UN forecasts modest economic recovery but no robust revival UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations is forecasting a modest economic recovery in 2017-18 but warns the projection is an indication of economic stabilization rather than a signal of robust revival. In its annual economic report released today, the U.N. says the world economy expanded by 2.2 percent in 2016, the slowest rate of growth since the 2009 recession. It forecast growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2018, a slight downward revision from its mid-year predictions in May. The U.N. report says: “Underpinning the sluggish global economy are the feeble pace of global investment, dwindling world trade growth, flagging productivity growth and heavy levels of debt.” It says low commodity prices have exacerbated these factors. Assistant Secretary-General Lenni Montiel has urged redoubled efforts to promote stronger global economic growth. WAL-MART-HIRING Wal-Mart to add about 10,000 retail jobs in the US NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart plans to add about 10,000 retail jobs in the U.S. as it opens new stores and expands existing locations. The world’s biggest retailer said Tuesday that there will also be about 24,000 construction jobs as well. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. says there will be 59 new, expanded and relocated Walmart and Sam’s Clubs facilities. The chain is planning $6.8 billion in capital investments in the U.S. in the coming fiscal year, which starts on Feb. 1. The investments include construction and remodeling of stores, clubs and distribution centers, and the expansion of new services such as online grocery pickup. Last week Amazon announced that it would add 100,000 full-time jobs over the next 18 months. GENERAL MOTORS GM announces $1B factory investment, new jobs DETROIT (AP) — General Motors will make a $1 billion investment in its factories that will create or keep around 1,500 jobs. A person briefed on the matter says the investment is part of the normal process of equipping factories to build new models, and it’s been planned for months. GM also says axle production for its next generation full-size pickup trucks will move to Michigan, creating 450 U.S. jobs. Some of that production had been done in Mexico. And, the Detroit automaker is confirming that a supplier in Michigan will make components for those pick-up trucks, moving 100 supplier jobs from Mexico. SKOREA-HYUNDAI MOTOR-US Hyundai highlights US spending plan before Trump inaugurated SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Group says it will significantly increase its investment in the U.S. while Donald Trump is president and is considering building a new U.S. factory. A president of the Hyundai group says Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and their affiliated companies will spend $3.1 billion during the five years through 2021 on research and development and maintaining their factories in Alabama and Georgia. BRITAIN-ROLLS ROYCE Rolls Royce agrees to pay $808 million on bribery claims LONDON (AP) — Jet engine maker Rolls Royce has agreed to pay $808 million to settle bribery and corruption charges brought by authorities in Britain, the U.S. and Brazil. A U.K. High Court judge will examine the deferred prosecution agreement during a public hearing today. The scandal involved intermediaries in overseas markets including Indonesia and China. Rolls-Royce says in a statement that the “voluntary agreements” will result in the suspension of prosecution. But Transparency International’s U.K. executive director Robert Barrington says individuals should be prosecuted so the case serves as a deterrent to bribery. He says that “whether or not this settlement is in the public interest, the key individuals responsible for corrupt behavior must not be allowed to evade justice.” TOBACCO MERGER British American Tobacco agrees on takeover of Reynolds LONDON (AP) — British American Tobacco has agreed to fully take over Reynolds American Inc. on terms that are improved from an initial bid made last year. The takeover would create the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company and combine BAT’s presence in developing countries, where anti-smoking campaigns are not as strong as in the U.S. and Europe, with Reynolds’ almost exclusive focus on the U.S. BAT says it will buy the 57.8 percent of Reynolds it does not already own. Reynolds shareholders will receive for each share $29.44 in cash and 0.5260 BAT shares. BAT says that values Reynolds at $59.64 per share, or $49.4 billion for the stake to be acquired. BAT sells Dunhill, Rothmans and Lucky Strike cigarettes, while Reynolds owns brands like Newport, Camel and Pall Mall. AIRLINES-RANKINGS Hawaiian, Delta top on-time ratings for US airlines UNDATED (AP) — The chances that your flight will be on time and won’t get canceled appear to be looking up. The federal Department of Transportation reports that 86.5 percent of U.S. flights in November arrived on time, an improvement over both the previous month and November 2015. Less than one-third of 1 percent of domestic flights were canceled, the lowest rate in any month since the department started keeping comparable records in 1995. And the rate of bags that got lost, delayed or damaged was the lowest in figures that go back to 1987. Hawaiian Airlines and Delta Air Lines posted the best rates for on-time arrivals, more than 90 percent. Virgin America, which is now owned by Alaska Airlines’ parent, had the worst mark. TAXES-OVERVIEW IRS refund delays could hear the neediest taxpayers WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service’s battle against fraud and identity theft is intensifying as the tax filing season opens, and some of the neediest taxpayers are getting caught in the middle. The agency is barred from issuing refunds before Feb. 15 on any returns claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit. Congress mandated the delay to give the IRS more time to review returns to try to catch fraudulent ones before refunds are paid out. Dave DuVal, vice president of customer advocacy at TaxAudit.com, says some taxpayers are living “paycheck to paycheck and this is money they’re counting on.” This year’s filing deadline is Tuesday, April 18, since the traditional April 15 date falls on a Saturday, and D.C. Emancipation Day is observed on April 17. IMMACULATA-TUITION REDUCTION Immaculata University to cut tuition by 23% for 2017-18 MALVERN, Pa. (AP) — A Catholic college in suburban Philadelphia says it’s reducing its tuition by 23 percent for the 2017-18 academic year to offset the rising cost of higher education. Tuition to Immaculata University in Chester County will be reset from $34,410 to $26,500 next year. Without the reduction, university officials say tuition including room and board would’ve risen to nearly $50,000 in 2017-18. Immaculata will additionally scale back the amount of funding the school awards in scholarships and grants. As a result, students’ out-of-pocket costs will not reflect much of a change. The tuition reduction follows similar plans executed locally by both Rosemont College and La Salle University. Gerald Wargo Jr., vice president for enrollment management, says the move is all about opening up Immaculata to more potential applicants.

Smith | Pool via Bloomberg | Getty Images Dennis Muilenburg, president and chief executive officer of The Boeing Co., speaks with members of the media in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said he had a "very productive" meeting with President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday and was encouraged by progress in talks on the Air Force One replacement fleet and on fighter planes. "We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft," Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements on Air Force One, streamlining the process ... all that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost. I'm pleased with the progress there." Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change BA ---

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Print Email Bloomberg News By Bloomberg News The Times-Picayune on January 17, 2017 at 11:35 AM comments Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg net for the second time since the election with President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday (Jan. 17) to discuss his company's contract to build the next-generation version of Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, according to two people familiar with plans for the meeting. The conversation was also expected to touch on the company's F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin's F-35 as the Pentagon's advanced fighter jet, according to one of the people. Both asked not to be identified discussing a private meeting. Trump shook the defense industry -- and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice -- when he tweeted Dec. 6 that "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that Chicago-based Boeing could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. "We're going to get it done for less than that, and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens," Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his "personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company." More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. JUST IN: Boeing CEO arrives at Trump Tower in New York City for a meeting with the President-elect. pic.twitter.com/ERUH3rhVcZ -- CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) January 17, 2017 Boeing isn't the only defense contractor that's felt the fury of Trump's tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for "out of control costs" on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered January 11. Trump also called on Boeing to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet" to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect's criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs "significantly'' on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. At the time of Trump's tweet about Air Force One, it wasn't immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon's top weapons buyer said in an interview that the President-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, "he's heard these big numbers," Frank Kendall said in an interview. "Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They're not contract values, necessarily." "The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion -- the 747s we're buying -- so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means," Kendall said. "We're still negotiating with Boeing on that." Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. "His general interest in reducing costs is terrific- -- his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics," Kendall said. - Tony Capaccio, Kevin Cirilli (c) 2017, Bloomberg Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Business Names in the News Does your company have a recent hire, promotion, appointment or honoree to announce?

Mr Trump called the meeting at Trump Tower in New York after he pressured the Chicago-based aerospace and defence company last month to lower prices on Air Force One and to price a contract with Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter. Boeing is ready to discuss the fighter jet and Air Force One, "but this is the president-elect’s meeting", said Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher. "He and his team will determine the agenda." Mr Trump met the Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg on December 21, and posted a Twitter message the next day saying he had asked Boeing to offer its older-generation aircraft as a possible alternative to the F-35. He had previously threatened to cancel Boeing’s Air Force One presidential aircraft sale, saying the price was too high, and extracted a pledge from Boeing to keep the cost of the programme under US$4 billion. * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Southwest Airlines beats profit forecasts on fare price hike Raytheon hit as F-35 missile maker’s sales slow Ryanair targets Lufthansa’s Frankfurt hub to increase services Qantas relaunches Beijing route after eight-year gap MOST VIEWED Business | All Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet UAE and India pledge to boost bilateral trade by 60% London-based renewables investment adviser to open Dubai office Emirates slashes fares on routes to US, rekindling Open Skies tension UAE military contingent participates in India’s Republic Day parade Etihad Airways to deploy new Dreamliners on Levant and Far East routes Language of money best left to the present Singapore Airlines replaces Boeing 777 on two-stop route Airbus ‘in danger’ as Brexit trigger looms Owning cars, watches or art – directly or via a fund – is an investing option More Most Viewed ‘Ninety bodies found’ at Libyan ISIL camp bombed by US Matchmaking advertising billboards taken down in Dubai Life lessons: ‘My mother is British ... but I am 100 per cent Emirati’ Top Gear cast in Dubai for two-day shoot Emirati and Indian musicians release song to celebrate their countries’ friendship - video Trump changes his mind on Nato Burj Khalifa and Adnoc tower light up in colours of Indian flag Crowds cheer on Ironman 70.3 Dubai competitors and Ironkids Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet US businessman arrested after anti-Muslim tirade at JFK More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: Trump and Iraq’s oil Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent Municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Uncertain times in UAE football as China flexes its financial muscle Christo cancels Arkansas project and will now focus on Abu Dhabi’s The Mastaba About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Eric Berger - Jan 17, 2017 5:09 pm UTC Enlarge / The Soyuz MS-03 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome with NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy of Roscosmos, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet on board in November. NASA/Bill Ingalls reader comments 154 Share this story NASA's commercial program holds much promise—the development of private vehicles to transport humans into low Earth orbit should eventually bring down spaceflight costs and broaden access to space. But as is often the case with new spacecraft development, both Boeing and SpaceX have faced technical problems with their capsules. Publicly, NASA has maintained the hope that at least one private vehicle, either Boeing's Starliner or SpaceX's Crew Dragon, would be capable of operational missions by the end of 2017 or early 2018. But that no longer appears certain—or even likely. Meanwhile, NASA still has the International Space Station to maintain and must get its astronauts there through the only means possible. Back in 2015, anticipating delays with the commercial crew program, NASA purchased transport on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft through 2018. But that may not be long enough, the agency has decided. Seats for 2019 Further ReadingNASA officials mulling the possibility of purchasing Soyuz seats for 2019Last September, based upon anonymous sources, Ars reported that NASA had begun considering buying additional seats in 2019 as a hedge against further delays with the commercial crew program. Both NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and the agency's head of human spaceflight, Bill Gerstenmaier, subsequently denied this report. These dismissive comments notwithstanding, a new solicitation filed by NASA on Tuesday reveals that the agency is indeed seeking to purchase Soyuz seats for 2019 (NASA will negotiate with Boeing for these additional seats, which Boeing received from Russia's Energia as compensation for the settlement of a lawsuit involving the Sea Launch joint venture). The solicitation seeks an option to buy three additional Soyuz seats in 2019 "as a primary or backup transportation capability to ensure proper launch cadence with no gaps in crew rotation transportation." The solicitation comes just three days before Bolden, a champion of the commercial crew program who has sparred with Congress over funding, leaves office. It seems likely the notification is timed such that there still is time for Russia to build additional Soyuz launch capacity for 2019, while also allowing the current NASA leadership to bypass this politically sensitive issue before leaving office on January 20 when Donald Trump is inaugurated. Undoubtedly, Congress will not be positively predisposed to funding requests for additional Russian seats, especially because the price keeps going up. Since the decision to retire the space shuttle in 2009, the Russian price for a seat has skyrocketed from about $30 million for a trip into orbit to $81.9 million for each of the six seats NASA bought for 2018. It seems likely the price for any seats in 2019 would increase substantially, especially because NASA would be providing less than the three years of lead time as is customary for such orders. More seats in 2017 and 2018 The new NASA request also seeks an additional two seats in 2017 and 2018. This is possible because Russia will scale back its presence on the space station for the next couple of years, from three crew per six months to two, as it seeks to pare expenses. By reducing the number of its crew members, Russia will need to fly fewer Progress cargo ships, which deliver food and supplies to the Russian side of the station. Further ReadingSpace station crew may drop to five because of Russia This Russian decision will make room for one crew member in the fall of 2017 as well as the spring of 2018, and NASA would like to buy those two rides into space, as well, to increase crew time for science research on board the station. "The purchase of these services in 2017 and 2018 will increase US crew size on the ISS from three to four crew members to maximize ISS science utilization," the NASA solicitation states. "Maximizing science utilization of the ISS is a program priority." The additional seats for NASA and US partners would not kick in until September of this year, meaning that Fyodor Yurchikhin and Jack Fischer will still fly as a crew of two in March.

In addition to Boeing's contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company's F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-35 as the Pentagon's advanced fighter jet. "We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft," Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification." Trump has shaken the defense industry -- and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice -- with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of "the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases," although no specific reductions have yet been announced. "I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business," Muilenburg said after their meeting Tuesday. "We're on the same page here." Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, its CEO touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest U.S. exporter supports.  "You want manufacturing jobs -- aerospace is the place to invest," Muilenburg said. "We're proud to take on that mission." Trump's public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. Trump suggests he would ditch F-35 in favor of alternate F-18 from Boeing Missy Ryan President-elect Donald Trump piled on fresh criticism of the Pentagon's most sophisticated aircraft on Thursday, suggesting that he might abandon the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in favor of a cheaper plane due to high costs.

In a message on Twitter, Trump said that cost overruns in Lockheed Martin... (Missy Ryan) "We're going to get it done for less than that, and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens," Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his "personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company." More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn't the only defense contractor that's felt the fury of Trump's tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for "out of control costs" on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered Jan. 11. Trump also called on Boeing to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet," referring to the company's F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect's criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs "significantly'' on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems, a key subcontractor on the program.

(Karen Turner) "Over a period there's no question we've been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period," Carr said in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday from Davos. "We respect that and we'll work towards a contribution towards that." At the time of Trump's tweet about Air Force One, it wasn't immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon's top weapons buyer said in an interview that the president-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, "he's heard these big numbers," Frank Kendall said in an interview. "Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They're not contract values, necessarily." "The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion -- the 747s we're buying -- so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means," Kendall said. "We're still negotiating with Boeing on that." Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. "His general interest in reducing costs is terrific- -- his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics," Kendall said.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    5426391 President-elect Donald Trump will meet with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg Tuesday to discuss the cost of replacing Air Force One, Bloomberg News reports. This will be the second meeting between Trump and Muilenburg as president-elect, and comes just over a month after Trump criticized the plans to replace the aging fleet of Boeing 747s on Twitter, declaring “cancel order.” (RELATED: Trump Tweets: ‘Cancel Order’ For $4 Billion Air Force One Plane)   Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 “The plane is totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower Dec. 6. Calling the cost “ridiculous,” Trump said he thinks “Boeing is doing a little bit of a number” on taxpayers. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” Trump said. Boeing is currently under a $170 million contract with the Air Force for initial stages of the Air Force One replacement, which would not be complete until at least 2024. Muilenburg met with Trump just before Christmas and gave the president-elect his “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company” that costs would be controlled. “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens,” Muilenburg said to reporters after meeting with Trump in Mar-a-Lago, Fl., Dec. 21. Trump has already shown an interest in renegotiating high-value defense contracts. Trump met with Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson earlier in January to discuss ways to bring down future costs on an over-budget program. “We are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft and moreover it’s going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States,” Hewson told reporters after the meeting Friday afternoon.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Boeing’s difficult journey from racism to diversity Originally published January 16, 2017 at 6:00 am Updated January 16, 2017 at 5:33 pm Since Boeing hired its first two black “Rosie the Riveters” in 1942, horizons have expanded. But today’s workers are divided on how close to colorblind the workplace comes. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter “I will not recommend for membership in this union any other than members of the white race.” That may sound like some old declaration from the Deep South. But until after World War II, that was part of the oath sworn by members of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) union, which represented Boeing workers in the Puget Sound region. The union, which organized the Boeing workforce here in 1935, was hardly the sole barrier to racial integration at Boeing. From the company’s founding in 1916, management had not hired a single black person.

Massachusetts St., Seattle More info: 206-518-6000 or naamnw.org/event/martin-luther-king-jr-day-celebration Prewar, such employment bans were pervasive throughout U.S. industry, even here in what’s now one of the country’s most politically liberal regions. Boeing hired its first two black “Rosie the Riveters” in 1942 to build bombers for the war effort — more than nine months after a presidential order banning discrimination at defense companies — and afterward progressed only slowly toward equality. Interviews with current and former employees trace a difficult journey spanning 75 years from the reluctant hiring of those black Rosies through today — when young African Americans can take advantage of Boeing’s official policy encouraging diversity and equal opportunity. (Boeing declined to share the racial demographics of its current workforce.) In recent years a handful of African Americans have risen to prominent positions in the company. Joan Robinson-Berry held various engineering and supplier management roles at Boeing and now heads the company’s growing Charleston, S.C., complex. The highly regarded former chief financial officer James Bell in 2005 served for four months as Boeing’s interim chief executive after a scandal ousted his boss. Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, is widely viewed as a possible future chief executive. Yet even now, with race remaining a divisive issue in America, some black employees find the workplace reality at Boeing still falls short of the colorblind ideal. “Employment for Negroes impossible at Boeings,” reads a headline in the Nov. 8, 1940, issue of Northwest Enterprise. Racist history Even as World War II approached and the nation began a rapid buildup of defense workers, Boeing management resisted a federal edict to cease discrimination, according to Battle at Boeing, a Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History project at the University of Washington. In the fall of 1940, Thurgood Marshall, then a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and later a Supreme Court justice, wrote to the Seattle branch of the organization noting that Boeing had just been granted a $7 million government bomber contract. Marshall encouraged the local branch to push for the hiring of blacks. The union local’s newspaper in June 1940 focuses on whether to bar blacks. After black leaders threatened to bring thousands of protesters to the White House in April 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring companies with government contracts to cease racial discrimination. Local activists in Seattle mounted an intense public campaign to have Boeing comply with the order. Yet in the following months, although Boeing was hiring 1,000 people a week, none of them were African Americans. That July, in a letter to the NAACP’s Washington state branch, Boeing personnel manager Paul Fredrickson conveniently ignored the company’s pre-IAM history of never hiring African Americans and put the blame entirely on the union. He cited the closed-shop bargaining agreement with the IAM’s Local 751 and pointed out that “only those of the Caucasian race are acceptable” to the union. By 1942, the needs of the war effort finally forced a management reversal and African Americans, mostly women at first, were hired. The union only reluctantly acceded, according to Seattle’s African American newspaper at the time, Northwest Enterprise. “We rather resent that the war situation has been used to alter an old established custom,” IAM representative James Duncan said. Even months after it became illegal for defense companies to discriminate, the union defended its ban. The African Americans that Boeing hired were required to pay for special temporary “work permits” that cost more than union dues, allowing them to work even though they were still barred from the union. By 1944, about 1,600 blacks worked at Boeing locally, in a workforce of nearly 43,000 that was churning out B-17 bombers at phenomenal rates. Defense hiring at Boeing and at Puget Sound shipyards brought an influx of African Americans to the region, mostly from the South. According to a history of Seattle race relations by Howard Droker, Seattle’s black population doubled between 1940 and 1944 to about 8,000. The racist clause in the IAM oath was removed in 1946, after the war. Only then did Boeing truly begin to open up to African Americans. A black Rosie the Riveter Lou Annie Charles, now 94, was one of those early black “Rosie the Riveters.” She still lives in her Central District home, paid for, in large part, by her long career at Boeing. Lou Annie Charles, 94, is one of the original Rosie the Riveters from World War II. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times) Born in Muskogee, Okla., she was raised on a farm where she picked cotton and grew vegetables. Charles trained as a riveter in the early 1940s under a New Deal program and was hired in 1943 to work for 60 cents an hour at Boeing’s airplane plant in Wichita, Kan., where she assembled B-29 Superfortress bombers. “It gave me an opportunity to help my parents,” Charles said. “I sent money home. That was a good feeling, to have money to help them.” After the war when Charles and many other Wichita workers were laid off, she moved to Seattle, where the company rehired her in 1950. At the old Plant 2 in Seattle and later in Renton and Everett, Charles worked at Boeing for another 38 years until her retirement in 1988. “I did nothing but rivet,” she said. “I enjoyed it.” The Boeing job allowed her to buy her home in 1956 — a time when the Central District was the only neighborhood open to black people for homeownership — and to put her two children through college. Her daughter became an airline flight attendant, her son a police officer and later an attorney. Recalling her early days working at Boeing, Charles said she met very little racial bias. “Most of the time, I’d be the only black woman in the shop,” she said. “I never had any problem with anyone not wanting to work with me.” She got on well with her workmates, though she said some of her supervisors were prejudiced and “not too nice.” Charles recalls her working life at Boeing fondly and still sends Christmas cards to the remaining members of her old crew. The union’s record Emerson Hamilton, an IAM union official, will be 70 next month and plans to retire in two weeks. Starting in 1979, he worked at Boeing in Seattle and Auburn, making airplane parts for 20 years, then was hired by the union as a full-time staff member. “The Boeing Company is a good company to work for,” Hamilton said. “They provide good jobs. I have no complaints about the benefits and pay. Just some people in management.” In his experience, said Hamilton, the company slapped down any instances of overt racial harassment. “They did not allow that,” he said. “If they ever caught anybody doing it, they always took corrective action.” Boeing: 100 years of flight The people who shaped Boeing — Part 1: Dupler, Mulally, Huntman and Grieser The people who shaped Boeing — Part 2: Lopez, Corvi and Albaugh The people who shaped Boeing — Part 3: Condit, Sutter and Darcy-Henneman From cloth to carbon fiber, a timeline of Boeing’s 100-year flight In good times and bad, Boeing’s force field has shaped region’s fortunes Talton: Formidable challenges loom in Boeing’s next century Flying high: an interactive look at Boeing’s 100-year history Yet he recalls having to fight for his rights in his early years on the shop floor. He found that management constantly left him behind under a grading system that determined whether workers could move up to better positions. “I was training some of the young white guys who came in and they’d get upgraded before me,” he said. “I fought against that.” After he protested to an official in the company’s equal employment-opportunity unit, he got his upgrade. Hamilton said it was similar issues that in 1994 led several dozen African-American employees in the Puget Sound region to file a class-action lawsuit against Boeing, representing about 4,000 black employees. “African Americans were getting fed up,” he said. “They didn’t think they were being upgraded like they should.” After civil-rights activist Jesse Jackson helped broker a $15 million settlement, Boeing donated $50,000 to Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition organization. However, an appeals court reversed the settlement in 2002 and a federal jury later ruled that Boeing had not discriminated in its handling of the promotion system. (A new lawsuit alleging racial discrimination, filed in June by an employee at Boeing’s satellite unit in El Segundo, Calif., is pending.) Hamilton recalls how former district 751 President Bill Johnson and his successor, Mark Blondin, worked to try to make up for some of the union’s history of racism. One gesture involved giving special recognition to Roman Mayfield, one of the first African Americans in the union who became a long-serving shop steward. Though in his early years at the company Mayfield wasn’t allowed in the union, the IAM in 2000 retroactively granted him membership for those years, and honored him with various awards before his death two years later. Yet Hamilton said the union still has some way to go. He says there have never been more than one or two black faces among the slate of full-time union officials, his being one of them. “I take that as a token,” Hamilton said. A double minority Omar Abdul-Alim, 50, joined Boeing in 1989 after leaving the Army. He works as a mechanic in Renton, pressurizing 737 fuel tanks to test the seals before the planes roll out. Omar Abdul-Alim joined Boeing in 1989 after getting out of the Army. He describes his time there as bittersweet — partly due to being a minority in both race and faith. He is African American and Muslim. (Bettina Hansen/The Seattle Times) Abdul-Alim is a double minority: An African American, he grew up Baptist in Rainier Beach, then converted to Islam at age 30. In 2000, he married a Somali immigrant and is active today at a Tukwila mosque popular with the Somali community. He’s grateful that the job at Boeing has given him what it gave generations of local workers without a college degree: the chance to earn good money and create a comfortable middle-class life. Some of the African-American males he hung around with as a youngster sank into lives of drugs and prison. “A few of us were able to escape,” Abdul-Alim said. “I and a few of my friends, we’ve been the blessed ones.” Yet management actions have recently soured his view of Boeing. “It’s not the same company we hired into,” Abdul-Alim said, a common lament among Boeing veterans of every skin color since the last contract froze their pensions. A forceful personality, he said he won’t put up with disrespect on matters of race or religion, whether it comes from a Somali immigrant treating him as an outsider or from a prejudiced white American. “There are people who are ignorant,” Abdul-Alim said. “But I have a thick skin. I have no problem defending myself.” Even though he’s endured a few incidents of hostility to Islam at work, he says “my being an African American was more of an obstacle for me at Boeing than being a Muslim.” Boeing grants accommodations in his schedule to allow him to do his Islamic prayers five times daily. He has a prayer rug at work. What he finds harder to fight against than open hostility from an individual is what he perceives as covert racism from some supervisors. Echoing the complaints of those in that 1990s lawsuit, he said at times he’s seen less-qualified white workers given transfers to better jobs ahead of him. And he said he’s been unfairly disciplined for arguments at work that grew out of racial harassment. “Boeing says it’s open opportunities for everybody. I don’t find that to be true,” he said. Young, black, hopeful For LaDonna Perkins, 25, who next month will complete two years as an engineer at Boeing, the experience so far has been entirely positive, full of openness, encouragement and possibility. She grew up in the small city of Wetumpka, Ala., The daughter of a clothing-factory worker and a carpenter, she’s the first in her immediate family to go to college. Perkins did two summer internships at Boeing before being hired full time. She now works in Renton in the cabin-interiors unit, as a project manager working on an airplane lavatory-lighting system. Of about 50 engineers who graduated with her from the University of Alabama, six were black and three were women. Although she’s the only woman in her five-person work group at Boeing, the larger organization of some 120 people that she’s part of has about 10 percent African Americans, she estimates. “I was very surprised. On my first day at work, I saw three African-American women in my first group,” Perkins said. “In the interiors organization we do have a really diverse group, different people of color and from different countries.” She hasn’t come across any bias. “I grew up in Alabama. I’ve seen prejudice,” she said. “I haven’t experienced that at Boeing.” The encouragement of her manager “pushed me to think of all the things I can do at Boeing,” she said, and she’s taken advantage of Boeing-sponsored courses in professional development and technical matters. She also attended a company diversity conference in California with about 900 employees from all over the country, where she met chief executive Dennis Muilenburg and several vice presidents. “The culture at Boeing is very inclusive,” Perkins said. She’s become an evangelist for engineering and for Boeing to people back home in Wetumpka. “I’ve had a couple of people Facebook message me asking what are the steps to become an engineer,” Perkins said. In 10 years, she said, her goal is to be a Boeing vice president herself.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Nation & World Nation & World Politics Trump meeting today with Boeing CEO over Air Force One Originally published January 16, 2017 at 9:43 pm Updated January 17, 2017 at 9:34 am Trump tweeted Dec. 6 that “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Share story By Tony Capaccio Bloomberg News Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg was meeting for the second time since the election with President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday to discuss his company’s contract to build the next-generation version of Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, according to two people familiar with plans to hold the meeting. Muilenburg arrived for the meeting Tuesday morning at Trump Tower in New York. The conversation between the two also will touch on the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced fighter jet, according to one of the people. Both asked not to be identified discussing a private meeting. Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” although no specific reductions have yet been announced.

Here’s what we know Seahawks assistant head coach for defense Rocky Seto leaves team to enter ministryUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. His public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that Chicago-based Boeing could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens,” Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.” More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn’t the only defense contractor that’s felt the fury of Trump’s tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for “out of control costs” on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered January 11. Trump even called on Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet” to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect’s criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs “significantly’’ on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. At the time of Trump’s tweet about Air Force One, it wasn’t immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer said in an interview that the President-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, “he’s heard these big numbers,” Frank Kendall said in an interview. “Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They’re not contract values, necessarily.” “The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion — the 747s we’re buying — so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means,” Kendall said. “We’re still negotiating with Boeing on that.” Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. “His general interest in reducing costs is terrific- — his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics,” Kendall said.

Iran Air took delivery last week of the first of 100 jets it has ordered from Airbus (EADSF). The first of 80 aircraft from Boeing (BA) are scheduled to arrive in 2018. The badly needed jets will reconstitute Iran's decrepit commercial aircraft fleet, which has been languishing under decades of Western sanctions. Peter Roskam, a Republican member of the House, introduced a bill on Friday to initiate an investigation by the Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence into Iran Air and the nation's other airlines. If Iran Air or any other airline were to be found to support the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or foreign terrorist organizations, the airline would be added to the U.S. sanctions list and be prevented from receiving new aircraft or U.S.-made parts. That would effectively freeze the sale of jets from Boeing to Iran. The legislation would exert little control over the Airbus aircraft that are already delivered, but the airline would not be able to receive spare parts for those planes, or receive any maintenance outside of Iran. If Iran Air received maintenance or parts outside of Iran, that provider would be barred from doing business with the U.S. market. Mahan Air, Iran's second biggest carrier, is still on the sanctions list for aiding Iran's military and is barred from buying Western planes and parts. A new Airbus delivered to Iran Air. Iran drops plan to buy A380 superjumbo Iran Air was removed from the U.S. sanctions list in January 2016 as part of an agreement to convince Iran to restrain its nuclear program. It opened the path for multi-billion dollar sales by Boeing and Airbus. That prompted an outcry from some lawmakers like Roskam, who said the Obama administration offered no proof that Iran Air had stopped its support of the Iranian military or designated terrorist organizations. Roskam and other critics of the sales say Iran Air was removed from the sanctions list for political reasons to complete the six-nation diplomatic agreement The Treasury Department, in a November 23 letter to Roskam, defended the nuclear deal and said Iran Air was cleared from sanctions after a review "of its activity to ensure" sales would be "consistent with our national security and foreign policy goals." Boeing's Iran deal won't prevent production cut The new bill restarts an earlier effort by Roskam. He introduced a bill with a similar aim last year -- the House passed it, but the Senate didn't act. Now Republicans have control of Congress and President-elect Trump has been sharply critical of the nuclear agreement. Boeing, which has said it has proceeded cautiously into a deal with Iran Air, has said repeatedly that it will continue to take its cues from the U.S. government. The company declined to comment on the Roskam bill.

Last month, Boeing’s Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump and told him that his company can build a new Air Force One for less than originally quoted. Trump made headlines for blasting the company on Twitter for alleged cost overruns and called on the government to cancel the contract. The paper reported that it is unclear what the two will discuss at the meeting. Muilenburg has appeared to strike an agreeable tone with the incoming president and said he made a “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing company.” Since early December, Trump has been browbeating Boeing and Lockheed Martin over the costs of the next Air Force One and the F-35, respectively. “I don't need a $4.2 billion airplane to fly around in,” Trump told “Fox News Sunday” earlier this month, referring to Air Force One.

Saturday, 28 January 2017 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview US Congress Renews Push to Sabotage Iran’s Jet Deals: Report News ID: 1298974 Service: Economy January, 17, 2017 - 13:37 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – A bill has been introduced in the US Congress that could scuttle the aircraft deals between Airbus and Boeing and Iran, a report said. Peter Roskam, a Republican member of the House, introduced a bill on Friday to initiate an investigation by the incoming Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence into Iran’s airliners, including Iran Air, according to CNN. If Iran Air or any other airline were to be found to support the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the airline would be added to the US sanctions list and be prevented from receiving new aircraft or US-made parts. That would effectively freeze the sale of jets from Boeing to Iran, the report added.  During a January 2016 visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tehran signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. Iran Air took delivery last week of the first of the jets it has ordered from Airbus. Iran sealed another deal in June worth around $25 billion with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes. In December, the deal with Boeing was finalized, allowing Iran to buy 80 planes within 10 years. The first deliveries are expected in 2018. While Western plane makers are very keen on trade with Iran, Washington still demands that even non-American manufacturers wishing to sell to Iran obtain an export license if their products include materials made in the United States. Airbus, based in Europe, buys more than 40 percent of all its aircraft parts from the US.

The Boeing 777 disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 passengers and crew on board, sparking a two-and-a-half year search that has focused on the Indian Ocean. Authorities from Malaysia, Australia and China initially expected to finish searching a 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq mile) target area by the end of 2016, but bad weather has delayed the probe by another two months. The end of the search without the aircraft being discovered will bring fresh heartache for families. But the reason why the plane crashed and disappeared looks like it will forever remain a mystery and something which conspiracy theorists will continue to speculate on. Here, Mirror Online looks at some of the bizarre conspiracies over the missing plane. Have your say in the comments section belowComment Below Missing: The flight disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board Read More Search for Missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 ENDED nearly three years after jet disappeared with 239 on board Plane was shot down during military ops A shocking book claims that missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may have been accidentally shot down and the search for survivors covered up. ‘Flight MH370: The Mystery ’ makes the incredible allegation that the airline was shot down by US-Thai strike fighters as part of a training drill that went horribly wrong. But just 71 days after the Boeing 777 vanished carrying 239 people from 14 nations relatives say the UK published work is ‘too soon’ and ‘too insensitive’. The book says the drill was to involve mock warfare on land, in water and in the air, and would include live-fire exercises. It adds: “Say a participant accidentally shot down Flight MH370. Such things do happen. No one wants another Lockerbie, so those involved would have every reason to keep quiet about it.” Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in  Share this video Watch Next Rapper "predicted loss of plane" Rapper Pitbull predicted that Flight MH370 would go missing YEARS ago, it has been suggested. Conspiracy theorists have been drawing comparisons between the lyrics of his 2012 track Get It Started and the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the plane on March 8. Lines in the song, which features a guest appearance from Colombian singer Shakira, include: "Now it's off to Malaysia" and "Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day." Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Viewers on YouTube are convinced the two passports is a reference to the stolen Austrian and Italian passports used by two Iranians to board MH370. They also believe the three cities refer to the capital cities of Malaysia, China and Vietnam and the two countries are Malaysia and Vietnam. Ex-PM joins conspiracy theorists Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused the CIA of known the whereabouts of flight MH370. He said in a blog that someone was hide something because if the plane's GPS system failed then Boeing or the US government agency would know why. In his blog in 2015, the 88-year-old suggests that in the event of the jet being hijacked, then control of the aircraft could have been remotely activated elsewhere. He said: "Clearly Boeing and certain agencies have the capacity to take over uninterruptible control of commercial airliners of which MH370 B777 is one. He added: "Someone is hiding something. It is not fair that MAS and Malaysia should take the blame." US military base conspiracy The United States have been forced to flatly deny claims that the plane landed at its military base on the remote island of Diego Garcia. There were strong rumours that the jetliner could have headed for the small coral atoll in the Indian Ocean, which sits around 3,500km from Malaysia. However, a spokesman for the US embassy in the Malaysian capital said there was no truth in this speculation. He told Malaysia's Star newspaper by email: "There was no indication that MH370 flew anywhere near the Maldives or Diego Garcia. "MH370 did not land in Diego Garcia." Afghan hijacking (Photo: Reuters) A Russian newspaper claimed MH370 has been hijacked and flown to Afghanistan, where the crew and passengers were being held captive. A military source reportedly told the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper: "Flight MH370 Malaysia Airlines missing on March 8 with 239 passengers was hijacked. "Pilots are not guilty; the plane was hijacked by unknown terrorists. We know that the name of the terrorist who gave instructions to pilots is "Hitch. "The plane is in Afghanistan not far from Kandahar near the border with Pakistan." Others have since gone on to indicate that the passengers have been divided into seven groups and are living in mud huts with almost no food. MH370 'hid' behind another plane Early in the search it was suggested that the plane may have hidden from detection under another plane. Blogger Keith Ledgerwood suggested: "It is my belief that MH370 likely flew in the shadow of [Singapore Airlines flight] 68 through India and Afghanistan airspace. "As MH370 was flying 'dar' without a transponder, SIA 68 would have had no knowledge that MH370 was anywhere around as it entered Indian airspace, it would have shown up as one single blip on the radar with only the transponder information of SIA68 lighting up ATC and military radar screens". This theory was described as feasible but the planes would have to be within 3,300ft of each other. Alien abduction Social media users have jumped on the possibility of extraterrestrial life having something to do with the missing plane. One user wrote: "After an extensive conversation with my father & his partner, we have come to the conclusion that the only explanation is #aliens mh370." Another added: "I secretly believe that plane is abducted by aliens.. I know I’m not the only one.." And one user even said there were only two possibilities for its disappearance, aliens or a DB Cooper-style heist. He wrote: "This Malaysian airlines flight has the potential to be either the greatest heist since DB Cooper, or alien abduction. I vote aliens." A life insurance scam The Malaysian police chief refused to rule out the possibility of the missing plane being an elaborate insurance scam. Khalid Abu Bakar addressed the world in 2015 to provide an update on the investigation and revealed authorities were exploring every single avenue - no matter how remote. "Maybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance, who wants family to gain from it or somebody who has owed somebody so much money, you know, we are looking at all possibilities," he said. The authorities' investigations extend to examining every detail of the passengers for any clues as to what may have happened. "We are looking very closely at the video footage taken at the KLIA (Kuala Lumpur International Airport), we are studying the behavioural pattern of all the passengers," he added. The Illuminati Reddit users have seemingly taken a keen interest in the disappearance. One, known only as i-am-SHER-locked apparently uncovered that the Boeing 777 in question was the 404th such aircraft to be produced. "An HTTP 404 error means not found," they wrote. "Which in this case is oddly appropriate for the status of the aircraft, or just a coincidence. "Coincidence, I think not." Edward Snowden (Photo: Getty) There were early suggestions 20 employees from the Texas-based Freescale Semiconductor were on board the flight. So Reddit user Dark_Spectre has put two and two together and come up with, well, you decide. "So we have the American IBM Technical Storage Executive for Malaysia, a man working in mass storage aggregation for the company implicated by the Snowden papers for providing their services to assist the National Security Agency in surveilling the Chinese," he wrote. "And now this bunch of US chip guys working for a global leader in embedded processing solutions (embedded smart phone tech and defense contracting) all together..on a plane..And disappeared.. Coincidence??" He goes on to that the plane itself was kidnapped by Chinese authorities to uncover more about Snowden's revelations. Electronic warfare experiment A theory suggesting the plane was hidden as part of an experiment has circulated. Citizens news site Beforeitsnews.com reported: "It is conceivable that the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 plane is 'cloaked', hiding with hi-tech electronic warfare weaponry that exists and is used. "In fact, this type of technology is precisely the expertise of Freescale, that has 20 employees on board the missing flight." It also sparked theories the plane could have been taken by North Korea for similarly unknown purposes. A reddit user wrote: “There’s no telling what crazy logic they [North Korea] might have for taking a plane. They literally have no grasp of reality and have been caught red handed kidnapping foreigners, making s**t up and generally being d****es.” Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in  Share this video Watch Next Fire One of the most widely held theories is that there was a fire on board that killed all on board but burned out before damaging the exterior of the plane. This would explain why the aircraft, on auto-pilot, would fly such a long distance off course. An aviation source said that if this was the case, it would have hit the water at around 600mph after gliding down from 35,000ft. The source said: “The plane would not have dropped like a stone, it would have glided down from 35,000ft for around 10-12 minutes after it had exhausted its fuel. “It would have hit the water with a massive impact - as though the plane had landed on concrete. Nobody could have survived that. “There would have been a huge explosion with the wings ripped off and the fuselage would probably have plummeted straight down.” A military take out or secret weapon at work Conspiracy theory and scientific site Natural News, run by Mike Adams, has another theory. Adams said: “If we never find the debris, it means some entirely new, mysterious and powerful force is at work on our planet, which can pluck airplanes out of the sky without leaving behind even a shred of evidence." He added: “If there does exist a weapon with such capabilities, whoever controls it already has the ability to dominate all of Earth's nations with a fearsome military weapon of unimaginable power." He believes the plane fell into an area "outside the search zone" and could lead to a very dark end for Earth. (Photo: Getty) Pilot suicide One explanation for the sudden disappearance, according to some, could be pilot suicide. But so far no evidence has come to light to suggest either captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid had such intentions. John Brennan, head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), told the Daily Mail, when asked if it was a possibility: "I think you cannot discount any theory." Malaysian police have attempted to investigate whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery. Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said at a news conference: "We are looking at all possibilities." Other theorists have claimed the pilot or crew could have hijacked the plane themselves. But Hugh Dunleavy, the commercial director of Malaysia Airlines, said the captain in charge of the flight was a very seasoned pilot with an excellent record. "There have been absolutely no implications that we are aware of that there was anything untoward in either his behaviour or attitude," Dunleavy told Reuters in an interview. "We have no reason to believe that there was anything, any actions, internally by the crew that caused the disappearance of this aircraft." Cracks in the aircraft Six months before the plane went down, the U.S. aviation watchdog warned airlines of a problem with cracks in Boeing 777s that could lead to a mid-air break up or a catastrophic drop in pressure. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an alert in September last year giving airlines until April 9 to detect and correct cracking in the fuselage skin on Boeing 777s. The FAA warned that failure to do so would leave the aircraft vulnerable to ‘a rapid decompression and loss of structural integrity’. The organisation issued a final directive just two days before the Malaysia Airlines plane took off and said one airline had found a 16-in crack in the fuselage skin of a 14-year-old plane. However, Boeing said that the FAA alert did not apply to the missing jet because it did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing 777s. It's in an Asian Bermuda triangle The idea there could be a second Bermuda Triangle seems a popular one on social media. Its sudden and unexplained disappearance from radar could have several explanations, whether it be a sudden explosion or mid-air disintegration, or even a mechanical failure. But some theorists believe it simply means the plane has entered another Devil's Triangle. Boats and planes have been known to disappear in the patch of sea in the North Atlantic Ocean, known as the Bermuda Triangle, including Flight 19 in 1945, when five torpedo bombers mysteriously vanished. But could there really be another one? One Twitter user wrote: "So...what is up with this Malaysian airplane thing? Is there an Asian version of the Bermuda Triangle?" Another added: "Maybe there's such thing as Asian bermuda triangle. #Malaysia #MalaysiaAirlines." Terrorists crashed it into the sea No terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the missing flight, but that hasn't stopped theorists claiming it's the only explanation. The two passengers who boarded the plane with stolen passports really triggered this possibility, with many believing they must be part of a huge cover up to sink the plane. Pilot David Learmount, who is operations and safety editor of Flight Global magazine, said: “Something happened and the pilots did not tell anyone. Why? It’s a good question. “It’s extraordinary the pilots failed to call because they had plenty of time to. Unless there was a bomb on board but there has been no evidence of that.” Other groups, however, have claimed responsibility over the last few days, including an unknown Chinese group. An email was sent to various journalists in China, saying: “You kill one of our clan, we will kill 100 of you as payback.” But officials in Malaysia have said they believe the group's claim could be a hoax. The email did not explain what had happened to the plane. Pilot 'deliberately turned off passengers' oxygen supply' before ditching into sea (Photo: Getty) Passengers on flight MH370 died of oxygen starvation hours before the pilot performed a controlled ditching in the Indian Ocean, according to a study into the disaster. Analysis by a veteran air accident investigator suggests all 239 people lost consciousness up to four hours before the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared beneath the waves. The most likely scenario is that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately depressurised the cabin, thereby depriving those on board of air, the research concludes. Although oxygen masks would have dropped down automatically from above the seats, their supply was limited to just 20 minutes. Those unable to grab a mask, including sleeping passengers, would have passed out within the space of a few minutes. Pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah is prime suspect because he cleared his diary The captain of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was a prime suspect in the jet’s disappearance – because he had made no future plans. Back in 2015, detectives from Malaysia’s special branch found Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, had cleared his diary of social or work commitments, unlike his crew. The inquiry made him the most likely culprit if the plane was lost due to human intervention.

Here are other cases of plane disappearances and disasters, some of which still remain unsolved. 2014: Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 JUST WATCHED Experts answer your MH370 questions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Experts answer your MH370 questions 02:15 The Boeing 777 passenger jet vanished about an hour into its flight from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. There was no distress call before it lost contact over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. International search teams combed the Indian Ocean for months, but found no clues. Aviation experts and government officials remain baffled over the mystery of the jet and the fate of the 239 people aboard.

MUST WATCH What caused Air France 447 crash 02:55 The passenger jet, an Airbus A330, took off from Rio de Janeiro headed to Paris on May 31 of that year. A few hours later, as it crossed the Atlantic, it told control center its position. That was the last contact with the plane. Its last known position -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports -- complicated the searches. It took almost two years before the bulk of the wreckage, the majority of bodies, and the voice and data recorders were recovered. All 228 people aboard died. French authorities said ice crystals disrupted the system used to determine the plane's airspeed, causing the autopilot to disconnect. The plane plunged into the ocean. 2003: Boeing 727 JUST WATCHED 2014: Joe Padilla, missing since flight disappeared in 2003 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 2014: Joe Padilla, missing since flight disappeared in 2003 04:18 The company jet vanished in the Angolan capital of Luanda. It took off from the main international airport in the city on May 25 of that year, headed for Burkina Faso. It departed with its lights off and a dysfunctional transponder. There are conflicting reports on the number of people in the jet, but flight engineer Ben Charles Padilla is believed to be one of them. Some reports say he was alone, while others say three people were aboard. The plane has not been heard from since. Its whereabouts are unknown to this day. 1999: EgyptAir Flight 990 A National Transportation Safety Board Official stands with piles of wreckage from EgyptAir Flight 990 on November 1, 2000. The passenger jet made a rapid descent, plunging almost 14,000 feet in 36 seconds. The Boeing 767, en route to Cairo from New York City, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the Massachusetts coast in October of that year. Though its debris was later found, speculation remains on the cause of the crash that killed all 217 people on board. Theories included a possible suicide by the pilot or co-pilot, complete with tales of a chaotic struggle for controls in the cockpit. Egyptian authorities have said a mechanical failure was the cause. 1947: British Stardust The British aircraft vanished after takeoff from Buenos Aires, headed to Chile.

Hide Caption 34 of 34 After searches for the plane named Stardust turned up nothing for more than 50 years, conspiracy theorists jumped into action. But theories of aliens, among others, were invalidated in 2000, when the wreckage of the plane was found buried deep in a glacier in the Argentine Andes. The crash on August 2, 1947, killed 11 people, the BBC reported. Stardust's final Morse code transmission was the word "STENDEC." The meaning of the word remains a mystery. 1945: Flight 19 Navy Bombers Members of the Navy pose in front of one of the Flight 19 planes that disappeared in 1945. Flight 19 refers to five Navy bombers that disappeared off the Florida coast on December 5 of that year. A flight instructor flew one plane, and qualified pilots were in the others, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. Radio transmissions indicated that the instructor got lost when compasses malfunctioned. Radio contact was lost before the exact problem was determined, and no traces of the planes were ever found. Adding to the mystery, a search aircraft sent to look for Flight 19 also disappeared. The patrol plane, which took off later that day, has not been seen or heard from since. Flight 19 was reported in the area informally known as the Bermuda Triangle. 1942: British fighter JUST WATCHED WWII plane wreckage found 70 years later Replay More Videos ...

Surprisingly, it was extraordinarily well-preserved, and most of its fuselage, wings, tail and cockpit instruments were intact. Back then, experts say, planes flew with basic supplies, so its pilot's chances of survival were not good. JUST WATCHED WWII plane located after 72 years Replay More Videos ...

The groundbreaking aviator was on her most ambitious flight, vying to become the first woman to fly around the world. In 1937, she attempted the voyage in her twin-engine Lockheed Electra. With about 7,000 miles left to go, she made a challenging landing at Howland Island in the mid-Pacific. Her radio transmissions became unclear, and the last thing she reported over her radio was, "We are running north and south," according to an online biography. After spending $4 million and searching 250,000 square miles of ocean, the United States called off its search. Many theories exist today, but her fate and that of navigator Fred Noonan remain unknown. This year, new footage emerged of her preparing for the doomed flight.

Tim Hepher – Over the past two decades, planemakers Airbus and Boeing have traded the crown in the annual orders race, and it was usually clear who had bragging rights in the fiercely competitive $120 billion annual jet market. On Wednesday, Airbus retained the top spot when it said it had recorded a total of 731 net orders for 2016, beating Boeing’s tally of 668 for the year released a week ago. Standing out as the unusual kingmaker between the two Western giants is Iran, emerging from decades of sanctions to place billions of dollars of new orders. Because of fragile demand elsewhere, its comeback carries unusual weight. While Airbus included all but two of the 100 aircraft it sold to Iran last year, its American arch-rival did not include the 80 aircraft it sold to the country. It is unclear why Airbus formally reported Iranian orders while Boeing did not, and what criteria were used by each company in making their decisions. Airbus is further ahead in the sales process; Iran took delivery of its first Airbus jet on Wednesday, while Boeing’s planes will be delivered from 2018. A source close to Boeing said there was some bemusement at the US planemaker as to why Airbus was able to book all of their Iranian orders. Airbus sources said the company’s year-end numbers had been strictly audited. Analysts say decisions on whether to formally report such orders in annual tallies would depend partly on the status of the US export licenses needed by both companies due to their heavy reliance on US parts. People close to the deals say that while both big jetmakers have received US export licenses for sales to Iran, only some of them cover the whole delivery period running until 2028. Both companies must apply for extensions for part of their orders. Industry sources say the same contractual conditions applied to both companies. Even though Boeing lost the headline order battle, analysts say it may ultimately benefit from lagging Airbus in the Iranian sales process if it can use its rival’s presence in the country to make the case for its own deal to go through, in the face of US Republican political opposition. During his election campaign, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the international nuclear deal that led to the lifting of sanctions on Iran. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Robot arms replace factory hands Indian airlines soar but turbulence ahead → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Identity faces challenges Impact from influx of foreign workers World edges closer to doomsday A rendezvous of families Aleppo traders clear debris from war-scarred souq Read More ...

The jumbo Turkish freighter slammed into the village of Dacha-Suu on the outskirts of Bishkek, killing 37 people and destroying at least 15 houses, Kyrgyzstan’s emergency situations ministry said. Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev blamed the crash on “crew error,” but offered no details about the claim. The deputy prime minister said on Kyrgyzstan’s state-run Kabar news agency that the government had reviewed preliminary information from the accident. Air accident investigations typically take months. A thick mist caused poor visibility at the time of the crash and was being cited as a possible contributor to Monday’s crash. Abulgaziev said other planes landed safely at Manas airport before the crash. Pictures of the immediate aftermath of the accident showed a portion of the village badly damaged. In one image, the plane’s smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car’s roof was completely ripped off in another. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree declaring Tuesday a day of mourning. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan’s capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. It crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the Manas airport, according to Kyrgyzstan’s state-run Kabar Agency. It’s not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 — including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline’s website. The precise breakdown of how many villagers and crew members were killed has not yet been released. One of the plane’s black boxes was found at the scene and it will be examined by experts from Moscow, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of emergency situations, told Kabar. The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines — the country’s national carrier — under its flight number. The flight’s ultimate destination was Istanbul, Turkey, Abulgaziev said, according to Turkey’s Anadolu news agency.. ACT Airlines confirmed the news of the crash on its website. “The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available,” the statement said. Boeing also extended its condolences in an emailed statement, as did Turkish Airlines in a tweet. “A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities,” the Boeing statement said. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company’s website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747’s enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard.

By Dominic Gates Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS “I will not recommend for membership in this union any other than members of the white race.” That may sound like some old declaration from the Deep South. But until after World War II, that was part of the oath sworn by members of the International Assocation of Machinists union, which represented Boeing workers in the Puget Sound region. The union, which organized the Boeing workforce here in 1935, was hardly the sole barrier to racial integration at Boeing. From the company’s founding in 1916, management had not hired a single black person. Prewar, such employment bans were pervasive throughout U.S. industry, even here in what’s now one of the country’s most politically liberal regions. Boeing hired its first two black “Rosie the Riveters” in 1942 to build bombers for the war effort – more than nine months after a presidential order banning discrimination at defense companies – and afterward progressed only slowly toward equality. Interviews with current and former employees trace a difficult journey spanning 75 years from the reluctant hiring of those black Rosies through today – when young African-Americans can take advantage of Boeing’s official policy encouraging diversity and equal opportunity. (Boeing declined to share the racial demographics of its current workforce.) In recent years a handful of African-Americans have risen to prominent positions in the company. Joan Robinson-Berry held various engineering and supplier management roles at Boeing and now heads the company’s growing Charleston, South Carolina, complex. The highly regarded former chief financial officer James Bell in 2005 served for four months as Boeing’s interim chief executive after a scandal ousted his boss. Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, is widely viewed as a possible future chief executive. Yet even now, with race remaining a divisive issue in America, some black employees find the workplace reality at Boeing still falls short of the colorblind ideal. Racist history Even as World War II approached and the nation began a rapid buildup of defense workers, Boeing management resisted a federal edict to cease discrimination, according to Battle at Boeing, a Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History project at the University of Washington. In the fall of 1940, Thurgood Marshall, then a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and later a Supreme Court justice, wrote to the Seattle branch of the organization noting that Boeing had just been granted a $7 million government bomber contract. Marshall encouraged the local branch to push for the hiring of blacks. After black leaders threatened to bring thousands of protesters to the White House in April 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring companies with government contracts to cease racial discrimination. Local activists in Seattle mounted an intense public campaign to have Boeing comply with the order. Yet in the following months, although Boeing was hiring 1,000 people a week, none of them were African-Americans. That July, in a letter to the NAACP’s Washington state branch, Boeing personnel manager Paul Fredrickson conveniently ignored the company’s pre-IAM history of never hiring African-Americans and put the blame entirely on the union. He cited the closed-shop bargaining agreement with the IAM’s Local 751 and pointed out that “only those of the Caucasian race are acceptable” to the union. By 1942, the needs of the war effort finally forced a management reversal and African-Americans, mostly women at first, were hired. The union only reluctantly acceded, according to Seattle’s African-American newspaper at the time, Northwest Enterprise. “We rather resent that the war situation has been used to alter an old established custom,” IAM representative James Duncan said. The African-Americans that Boeing hired were required to pay for special temporary “work permits” that cost more than union dues, allowing them to work even though they were still barred from the union. By 1944, about 1,600 blacks worked at Boeing locally, in a workforce of nearly 43,000 that was churning out B-17 bombers at phenomenal rates. Defense hiring at Boeing and at Puget Sound shipyards brought an influx of African-Americans to the region, mostly from the South. According to a history of Seattle race relations by Howard Droker, Seattle’s black population doubled between 1940 and 1944 to about 8,000. The racist clause in the IAM oath was removed in 1946, after the war. Only then did Boeing truly begin to open up to African-Americans. A black Rosie the Riveter Lou Annie Charles, now 94, was one of those early black “Rosie the Riveters.” She still lives in her Central District home, paid for, in large part, by her long career at Boeing. Born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, she was raised on a farm where she picked cotton and grew vegetables. Charles trained as a riveter in the early 1940s under a New Deal program and was hired in 1943 to work for 60 cents an hour at Boeing’s airplane plant in Wichita, Kan., where she assembled B-29 Superfortress bombers. “It gave me an opportunity to help my parents,” Charles said. “I sent money home. That was a good feeling, to have money to help them.” After the war when Charles and many other Wichita workers were laid off, she moved to Seattle, where the company rehired her in 1950. At the old Plant 2 in Seattle and later in Renton and Everett, Charles worked at Boeing for another 38 years until her retirement in 1988. “I did nothing but rivet,” she said. “I enjoyed it.” The Boeing job allowed her to buy her home in 1956 – a time when the Central District was the only neighborhood open to black people for homeownership – and to put her two children through college. Her daughter became an airline flight attendant, her son a police officer and later an attorney. Recalling her early days working at Boeing, Charles said she met very little racial bias. “Most of the time, I’d be the only black woman in the shop,” she said. “I never had any problem with anyone not wanting to work with me.” She got on well with her workmates, though she said some of her supervisors were prejudiced and “not too nice.” Charles recalls her working life at Boeing fondly and still sends Christmas cards to the remaining members of her old crew. The union’s record Emerson Hamilton, an IAM union official, will be 70 next month and plans to retire in two weeks. Starting in 1979, he worked at Boeing in Seattle and Auburn, making airplane parts for 20 years, then was hired by the union as a full-time staff member. “The Boeing Company is a good company to work for,” Hamilton said. “They provide good jobs. I have no complaints about the benefits and pay. Just some people in management.” In his experience, said Hamilton, the company slapped down any instances of overt racial harassment. “They did not allow that,” he said. “If they ever caught anybody doing it, they always took corrective action.” Yet he recalls having to fight for his rights in his early years on the shop floor. He found that management constantly left him behind under a grading system that determined whether workers could move up to better positions. “I was training some of the young white guys who came in and they’d get upgraded before me,” he said. “I fought against that.” After he protested to an official in the company’s equal employment-opportunity unit, he got his upgrade. Hamilton said it was similar issues that in 1994 led several dozen African-American employees in the Puget Sound region to file a class-action lawsuit against Boeing, representing about 4,000 black employees. “African-Americans were getting fed up,” he said. “They didn’t think they were being upgraded like they should.” After civil-rights activist Jesse Jackson helped broker a $15 million settlement, Boeing donated $50,000 to Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition organization. However, an appeals court reversed the settlement in 2002 and a federal jury later ruled that Boeing had not discriminated in its handling of the promotion system. Hamilton recalls how former district 751 President Bill Johnson and his successor, Mark Blondin, worked to try to make up for some of the union’s history of racism. One gesture involved giving special recognition to Roman Mayfield, one of the first African-Americans in the union who became a long-serving shop steward. Though in his early years at the company Mayfield wasn’t allowed in the union, the IAM in 2000 retroactively granted him membership for those years, and honored him with various awards before his death two years later. Yet Hamilton said the union still has some way to go. He says there have never been more than one or two black faces among the slate of full-time union officials, his being one of them. “I take that as a token,” Hamilton said. A double minority Omar Abdul-Alim, 50, joined Boeing in 1989 after leaving the Army. He works as a mechanic in Renton, pressurizing 737 fuel tanks to test the seals before the planes roll out. Abdul-Alim is a double minority: An African-American, he grew up Baptist in Rainier Beach, then converted to Islam at age 30. In 2000, he married a Somali immigrant and is active today at a Tukwila mosque popular with the Somali community. He’s grateful that the job at Boeing has given him what it gave generations of local workers without a college degree: the chance to earn good money and create a comfortable middle-class life. Some of the African-American males he hung around with as a youngster sank into lives of drugs and prison. “A few of us were able to escape,” Abdul-Alim said. “I and a few of my friends, we’ve been the blessed ones.” Yet management actions have recently soured his view of Boeing. “It’s not the same company we hired into,” Abdul-Alim said, a common lament among Boeing veterans of every skin color since the last contract froze their pensions. A forceful personality, he said he won’t put up with disrespect on matters of race or religion, whether it comes from a Somali immigrant treating him as an outsider or from a prejudiced white American. “There are people who are ignorant,” Abdul-Alim said. “But I have a thick skin. I have no problem defending myself.” Even though he’s endured a few incidents of hostility to Islam at work, he says “my being an African-American was more of an obstacle for me at Boeing than being a Muslim.” Boeing grants accommodations in his schedule to allow him to do his Islamic prayers five times daily. He has a prayer rug at work. What he finds harder to fight against than open hostility from an individual is what he perceives as covert racism from some supervisors. Echoing the complaints of those in that 1990s lawsuit, he said at times he’s seen less-qualified white workers given transfers to better jobs ahead of him. And he said he’s been unfairly disciplined for arguments at work that grew out of racial harassment. “Boeing says it’s open opportunities for everybody. I don’t find that to be true,” he said. Young, black, hopeful For LaDonna Perkins, 25, who next month will complete two years as an engineer at Boeing, the experience so far has been entirely positive, full of openness, encouragement and possibility. She grew up in the small city of Wetumpka, Alabama. The daughter of a clothing-factory worker and a carpenter, she’s the first in her immediate family to go to college. Perkins did two summer internships at Boeing before being hired full time. She now works in Renton in the cabin-interiors unit, as a project manager working on an airplane lavatory-lighting system. Of about 50 engineers who graduated with her from the University of Alabama, six were black and three were women. Although she’s the only woman in her five-person work group at Boeing, the larger organization of some 120 people that she’s part of has about 10 percent African-Americans, she estimates. “I was very surprised. On my first day at work, I saw three African-American women in my first group,” Perkins said. “In the interiors organization we do have a really diverse group, different people of color and from different countries.” She hasn’t come across any bias. “I grew up in Alabama. I’ve seen prejudice,” she said. “I haven’t experienced that at Boeing.” The encouragement of her manager “pushed me to think of all the things I can do at Boeing,” she said, and she’s taken advantage of Boeing-sponsored courses in professional development and technical matters. She also attended a company diversity conference in California with about 900 employees from all over the country, where she met chief executive Dennis Muilenburg and several vice presidents. “The culture at Boeing is very inclusive,” Perkins said. She’s become an evangelist for engineering and for Boeing to people back home in Wetumpka. “I’ve had a couple of people Facebook message me asking what are the steps to become an engineer,” Perkins said. In 10 years, she said, her goal is to be a Boeing vice president herself.

Conflicts Terrorism Disasters Global Economy Environment Religion Scandals Regions Middle East Israel: New defense system can hit targets outside the atmosphere By Yonat Friling Published January 18, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print The delivery of the Arrow-3 on Wednesday.  (Israeli Ministry of Defense) Israel ramped up its missile defense capabilities Wednesday with the delivery of a state-of-the-art system -- developed in part by Boeing -- designed to strike targets outside Earth's atmosphere. The Arrow-3 missile defense system will form the uppermost layer of Israel’s multilayered defense system, Israel Defense Forces officials have said. ISRAELI POLICE OFFICER KILLED AS FIGHTS BREAK OUT OVER DEMOLITIONS It was expected to protect from ballistic missiles capable of flying thousands of miles. Iran has tested such missiles several times in the past, defying international sanctions. Arrow-3 was delivered to the Israeli Air Force Wednesday morning, joining the Iron Dome, the Arrow-2 and David’s Sling. Brig. Gen. Tzvika Haimovich, the head of IDF Aerial Defense Command, said that together the systems would give Israel a protective umbrella, countering threats posed by Iran, Hezbollah and terror groups in Gaza firing short-range missiles. Israel Aerospace Industries worked together with Boeing to develop the Arrow-3. The project was co-managed by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Israeli Missile Defense Organization, a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Israeli officials said IMDO would continue to work with the U.S. in developing additional capabilities for the system. The delivery took place about a year after the last successful intercept that proved the system's ability to detect, track and destroy ballistic missile targets in space. The Arrow-3 test program began in 2013. Its final test flight was in December 2015.

Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday’s inauguration, saying it will mark “the dawn of a new era for our country, it’s an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America.” Trump also made his first trip to Washington in weeks on Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump flew in for a black-tie dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The Chairman’s Global Dinner drew nearly 150 diplomats and ambassadors, well-heeled donors, soon-to-be White House staffers and Cabinet picks. “We have great respect for your countries. We have great respect for our world,” Trump told the group after he was introduced by Pence, who assured that the future president was willing to engage with the world, despite his “America First” mantra. “I’m not sure that the national media here in America completely understands the president-elect. I can assure you that the world will,” Pence said, adding that Trump “will be a president who puts America first, but we will work every day with nations around the world to advance the peace and prosperity of our allies and our friends across the world.” The president-elect is expected to return to New York after the dinner. He’ll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he’s sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One program. “We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost,” Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump’s comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday’s inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he’s missed since 1987. “WRONG (or lie!)” Trump tweeted. “He boycotted Bush 43 also because he `thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in….he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.’ Sound familiar!” Lewis’ office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush’s 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would “love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don’t, we’ve got some great seats for others to partake in. It’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power.” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a “reflection of the division” in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach “too complicated” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called “border adjustment” that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It’s part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he’ll offer “insurance for everybody.” Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide “universal access.” European Union nations bracing for Trump’s ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect’s stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump’s view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren’t paying their fair share had “caused astonishment.” Also this week, Trump’s picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana made his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧World News Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / World News Thu, Jan 19, 2017 - Page 5　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Australia may resume MH370 search ‘DEEP REGRET’:The cost was not the determining factor in China, Malaysia and Australia’s decision to call off the search, the Australian minister of transport said Reuters, SYDNEY A relative of missing passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines flight 370 yesterday cries before a meeting with Malaysian Airlines officials in Beijing, China. Photo: AFP 1 2 The Australian government yesterday said it was not ruling out a future underwater search for a missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet as families of those on board criticized the decision to suspend the hunt after three fruitless years. The location of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. “I don’t rule out a future underwater search by any stretch,” Australian Minister of Transport Darren Chester told reporters in Melbourne, a day after Australia, Malaysia and China officially called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean. The search cost about A$200 million (US$151.16 million) — mostly paid by Malaysia — and has already been extended twice. However, the three countries have been reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane’s final resting place. A recommendation from investigators last month to look to the north of the 120,000km2 area that has been the focus of search efforts was rejected by Australia and Malaysia as too imprecise. The cost had not been the determining factor in halting the search, but restarting it would require “credible new information which leads to a specific location,” Chester said. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull yesterday expressed “deep regret” that the plane had not been found, but reaffirmed the agreement between Malaysia, Australia and China to stop looking. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board might have deliberately switched off the aircraft’s transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometers out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. Authorities are confident it is not in the area that has been searched, Australian Transport Safety Bureau Chief Commissioner Greg Hood said. “Residual search activity,” including satellite and drift analysis would continue until the end of February, Hood said. However, quitting the underwater search drew a swift and angry reaction from relatives of those aboard, who had called for the project to be expanded. In China, Jiang Hui (蔣暉) — whose mother was aboard the flight — said he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended. There was also anger on social media at the news. “Didn’t they say they would never end the search? What the hell happened?” wrote one user on a popular Chinese microblogging site. The only confirmed traces of the aircraft have been three pieces of debris found washed up on Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the aircraft. This story has been viewed 2162 times.

Mariella Moon, @mariella_moon 01.18.17 in Space Comments 407 Shares Share Tweet Share Save NASA is considering buying seats aboard the Soyuz spacecraft for 2019, according to a solicitation it filed recently. The agency originally wanted to end its dependence on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft this year, but SpaceX and Boeing aren't quite ready to take astronauts to the ISS. Boeing had to push back its first manned flight to the space station to December 2018 or later due to a design flaw with the Starliner. SpaceX also had to delay its plans after a Falcon 9 exploded on the launch pad last year. While both companies could very well be able to stick to their new timelines, NASA could be eyeing the purchase as an insurance in case of additional delays. Besides, seats on the Soyuz keep getting more expensive every year. According to the filing, the seats NASA is looking at belong to Boeing, which got them from a lawsuit against Russian aerospace company Energia. Boeing VP John Elbon revealed that NASA "expressed some interest" and that the two entities will "go through the process and figure out if there's an opportunity for [them] to make a deal." Ars Technica also notes that the solicitation was filed shortly before NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, a proponent of commercial space, leaves office. In addition to the seats aboard flights scheduled for 2019, NASA is also looking to purchase two more for 2017 and 2018. Since Russia is reducing its ISS personnel, there's an extra space for a NASA astronaut on the spacecraft.

The bill, introduced on Friday by Peter Roskam, a Republican member of the House, asks for the incoming Director of National Intelligence to launch an investigation into the Iranian airlines to find out if they are associated with the country’s Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or any other foreign terrorist organisations. If they are found to be in support of a terror group, then that airline will be added to the U.S. sanctions list, preventing them from receiving U.S.-made aircraft or parts. Last week, Iran Air received the first of 100 jets that it had ordered from Airbus, while the first of 80 ordered from Boeing is due to arrive in early 2018. While this could not bring back the already delivered aircraft, it would prevent any additional U.S. parts being shipped over for repair. If a non-US aircraft maker shipped parts to Iran Air, then that manufacturer would be barred from doing business in the U.S. Roskam said that there was no proof that Iran Air had stopped supporting the IRGC, and had been removed from the sanctions list for political reasons. These jets would help to improve and rebuild Iran’s dilapidated commercial aircraft fleet, which has been flagging under decades of Western sanctions. Iran's second biggest airline, Mahan Air, is still on the U.S. sanctions list for supporting Iran's military and is barred from buying Western planes and parts. This is Roskam’s second time introducing such a bill; in 2016 it was passed by the House but not the Senate. This year, with Republican control of Congress, it is likely to pass both chambers.   Search search Two prisoners were hanged in Sarpol-e Zahab (western Iran) Iran: ُHorrible scene of a family trapped in a car, swallowed by flood in Sistan & Baluchestan Iran: Tehran's Iconic High-Rise (Plasco Building) Collapsed Due to Fire More than 1,500 retired teachers held a protest gathering in front of Iran Regime's parliament Iran: Execution of four young men in public in Qeshm- 23 November The untold story of the 1988 Massacre in Iran Reyhaneh Jabbari's will Her voice recording from inside prison Public execution in Kazerun, Iran - August 11, 2016 blog Censorship Kills: Remembering Sattar Behesthi The New Orientalism: Iran as a Political Commodit...

McIntyre January 18, 2017 6:25 am EST Print Email Tweet The Federal Procurement Data System puts out a list of the 100 largest government contractors each year. Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT), already targeted by Donald Trump over the costs of the F-35 fighter, is a huge target. With $36.9 billion of federal government contracts called “obligations,” Lockheed Martin has more than double the exposure of the second place company, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), at $16.6 billion. On the other hand, Senator John McCain has proposed that the defense budget rise to $640 billion, a huge jump from previous years. Trump not only wants to cut the price of the F-35 program as much as 10%, Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems, told Bloomberg. The total cost of the program is $379 billion, so almost $40 billion is at risk, a large portion of which would go to Lockheed Martin. Worse, problems with the aircraft have delayed the date when it will be ready. McCain, Congress’s champion of higher military spending, also has savaged the lack of success of the F-35 program. Trump’s love of negotiation with government contractors, which has extended as far at Boeing’s Air Force One program, has special risks for Lockheed Martin. It is the primary builder for the Littoral Combat Ship, the next generation Navy combat program. It has been plagued by problems, which are just the kind of trouble Trump targets for criticism. Lockheed Martin also makes unmanned drones for the government, as well as missile defense systems and radar. On a positive note, as the largest government contractor and a military procurement behemoth, Lockheed Martin would get a boost from a higher defense budget. McCain chairs the Armed Services Committee. In a recent report, the committee suggested that spending increase across all four branches of the military, as well as special forces. Among the list of things the federal government must do quickly, according to the report: A second priority is regaining capacity for our military, which does not have enough ships, aircraft, vehicles, munitions, equipment, and personnel to perform its current missions at acceptable levels of risk. To be clear, adding capacity alone is not the answer, and any capacity that we do add, especially personnel, must be done deliberately and sustainably. That said, as numerous think tanks and independent panels have recommended, each military service needs more capacity. How much more is a question that the next Secretary of Defense must resolve together with Congress. Whatever the answer, regaining capacity will require a multi-year effort and likely will not be achieved over the next five years. We should therefore begin growing the size of our military quickly and responsibly while refining our ultimate end-strength goals based on a revised defense strategy, Given the size and scope of Lockheed Martin in its role as military contractor, it is impossible that some large portion of this investment will not substantially help its sales. McCain may not like the F-35 program, but he could be the catalyst for a boom in Lockheed Martin sales. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Saturday, 28 January 2017 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview Iran Open to Economic Ties with US despite Differences: FM Zarif News ID: 1300731 Service: Politics January, 18, 2017 - 16:59 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran is open to economic relations with the US despite the existing differences between the two countries. “China, Russia and India remain our important partners. They have been with us during our difficult times. But we are interested in expanding our relations with the EU; we are interested in expanding our traditionally good relations with the rest of Asia, with Japan, with Korea," Zarif said on Wednesday while addressing the World Economic Forum underway in the Swiss city of Davos. Heading a high-ranking delegation, Zarif arrived in Davos on Tuesday night. The Davos meeting will continue until Friday. He added, “…and we are open to economic relations even with the United States. So while we have our political differences with the United States, we are not closed to economic relations (with it) as the deal we signed with Boeing indicates”. Iran sealed a major deal in June worth around $25 billion with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes. In December, the deal with Boeing was finalized, allowing Iran to buy 80 planes within 10 years. The first deliveries are expected in 2018. Elsewhere in his remarks, the Iranian foreign minister referred to the Syrian peace talks scheduled to be held in the Kazakh capital of Astana next week, saying, “What has brought Iran, Turkey and Russia together to end the Syrian crisis is the fact that extremism knows no border.” Syria has been gripped by civil war since March 2011 with various terrorist groups, including Daesh (ISIL), currently controlling parts of it. Diplomatic efforts to end fighting in Syria have gained momentum in recent weeks with the announcement of a ceasefire in the Arab country earlier this month. The truce, which has been negotiated between Russia, Iran, Turkey, the Damascus government and the Syrian opposition, excludes terrorist groups such as Daesh and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. It will be followed by a new round of peace talks between the Syrian government and foreign-sponsored opposition groups in Astana on January 23.

Chelsea Manning, a move that cuts decades off her 35-year sentence for leaking classified information and schedules her for release in May. Obama also issued a pardon to retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who recently pleaded guilty to a felony charge of lying in the course of a leak investigation. Story Continued Below “The fact that Obama issued grants of mercy to Manning and Cartwright was viewed by some as a tacit acknowledgment of excess in the unprecedented series of leak-related prosecutions launched during Obama's eight years — a record that far outstripped all previous presidents combined. Manning’s supporters argued her 3 ½-decade sentence was wildly out of proportion to those received by other leakers in national-security-related cases.” — REPUBLICANS SLAM MANNING COMMUTATION: Statements from Republican lawmakers flooded in after Obama’s announcement. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain of Arizona said the commutation would “encourage further acts of espionage and undermine military discipline.” And Sen. Tom Cotton Arkansas said, “We ought not treat a traitor like a martyr.” House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said that Obama “now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won’t be held accountable for their crimes.” And Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas said the commutation “sends a terrible message to the world that the penalties for damaging our security can be swayed by politics.” — DEMOCRATS — AND TRUMP — HAVE BEEN QUIET SO FAR: Democratic lawmakers didn't rush out statements either praising or condemning Obama’s Manning commutation, though Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) said he disagreed on both Manning and Cartwright. And President-elect Donald Trump has also yet to weigh in — his recent praise of WikiLeaks could make Trump's response an interesting one. — SO WHY DID OBAMA OPT TO COMMUTE MANNING, PARDON CARTWRIGHT? We’ll hear from him directly at 2:15 p.m. today when he holds his final press conference as president. EXIT INTERVIEW — CARTER WARNS TRUMP AGAINST RUSSIAN THAW, our colleague Bryan Bender sat down at the Pentagon with outgoing Defense Secretary Ash Carter for an exit interview: “Carter has some parting advice for Donald Trump as the president-elect tries to improve relations with Russia: Don't get your hopes up. "Trump is likely to find exceedingly few areas where Washington and Moscow's interests still align, the outgoing Pentagon chief told POLITICO on Tuesday. And it may be most fruitful to focus on the handful of areas — such as reining in North Korea's nuclear program and keeping weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists — where the two sides can work together. “‘And stand strong where we can't,’ Carter said. … Carter expressed doubts that Trump will get much real cooperation in return — without harming American interests. The Pentagon chief said prospects remain dim that the former Cold War adversaries will join forces to swiftly end the civil war in Syria, fight against the Islamic State, or that the U.S. will be able to turn back Russia's invasion of eastern Ukraine or get Moscow to halt its saber-rattling and cyber mischief. ‘Russia has made it progressively more difficult to align its interests with our interests,’ Carter said in an interview in his Pentagon office.” HAPPENING TODAY — SECDEF FAREWELL ADDRESS: Carter delivers his farewell address this morning at the Pentagon.

David Goldfein discusses the future of American air power at a forum hosted by the American Enterprise Institute. Joined by former Sen. Jim Talent (R-Mo.), the general plans to discuss procurement and the services’ shortage of fighter pilots. The Heritage Foundation also holds a panel discussion on its defense and foreign policy outlook for 2017, featuring James Carafano, who sits on Trump’s Homeland Security transition landing team. MORE DEFENSE INDUSTRY MEETINGS WITH TRUMP — BOEING CEO GOES TO TRUMP TOWER, and now the CEOs of both Boeing and Lockheed Martin have met with Trump twice since he was elected president. Our colleague Ellen Mitchell has more here: “Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Tuesday he and Donald Trump are ‘on the same page’ about simplifying the requirements for the next generation Air Force One in an effort to bring down the price tag. “‘We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,’ Muilenburg told reporters after their second meeting at Trump Tower in New York. … In December Trump posted on Twitter that the cost estimates of the next-generation pair of Air Force One aircraft were ‘out of control’ and raised the prospect of canceling the project.” FROM RUSSIA … PUTIN CHARGES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO UNDERMINE TRUMP, writes The Associated Press’ Vladimir Isachenkov: “President Vladimir Putin took a parting shot at the Obama administration Tuesday, accusing it of trying to undermine Donald Trump's legitimacy with fake allegations and ‘binding the president-elect hand and foot to prevent him from fulfilling his election promises.’ In his first public remarks about an unsubstantiated dossier outlining unverified claims that Trump engaged in sexual activities with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel, Putin dismissed the material as ‘nonsense.’” — IS TRUMP’S TEAM READY FOR A SECURITY CRISIS? The holes in his team at the National Security Council are prompting concerns, writes POLITICO’s Michael Crowley: “The abrupt withdrawal of a top Trump National Security Council appointee and the dozens of high-level personnel holes across key foreign policy and defense agencies have national security experts posing a dark question: Will Donald Trump be ready to manage a national security crisis from Day One? “Sources close to the transition describe Trump’s national security staffing as a ‘black box,’ leaving everyone from Obama administration officials to Trump job seekers and foreign diplomats guessing at who will land crucial positions shaping policy and managing crises.” NOT JUST BUDGET CAPS — HASC OVERSIGHT CHAIR URGES TRUMP TO RAISE TROOP LIMITS, our colleague Connor O’Brien reports: “Rep. Vicky Hartzler is urging President-elect Donald Trump to reassess the formulation and management of U.S. troop levels in ongoing wars. The Missouri Republican, who chairs the House Armed Services Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, has sent a letter to Trump, sharing the panel's findings on force management levels in Afghanistan and Iraq and encouraging him to set caps based on ‘resources needed to achieve the desired end result.’” — GRAHAM NOT CHAIRING SASC CYBER PANEL: “Lindsey Graham, one of the Senate GOP's leading proponents of a select committee to investigate Russian meddling in the election, won't be taking over a new cybersecurity panel to investigate the issue,” report our colleagues Martin Matishak, Elana Schor and Austin Wright. “Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, confirmed on Tuesday that Graham — his good friend — would not be heading the new subcommittee devoted entirely to cyber issues, contrary to earlier statements McCain had made. … He said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) would likely replace Graham atop the new subcommittee.” FOR YOUR RADAR — MULVANEY CONFIRMATION HEARINGS TUESDAY: Trump’s pick for White House budget director, Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), will have two confirmation hearings Tuesday. Mulvaney, whose selection has sparked concerns among defense hawks, will testify in both the Senate Budget and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees. TRANSITION HAND-OFF — KENDALL WORRIES ABOUT TRUMP OUTSIDERS IN THE PENTAGON: Top Pentagon weapons buyer Frank Kendall is concerned the new Trump administration will fill the Defense Department with business executives who don't understand the intricacies and culture of defense acquisition. "What scares me ... is that we're bringing in outsiders who have no idea how the Pentagon works, have no idea how the defense industry works," Kendall said Tuesday in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The outgoing undersecretary of Defense for acquisition, technology and logistics pointed to the first several men in his position, "people were from non-defense industries, the idea was they were trying be managers. I’m a little nervous that may happen in this administration," he said. — KENDALL ADVISER TO TEMPORARILY REPLACE HIM: Pentagon acquisition adviser Jimmy MacStravic will replace Kendall until the new Trump administration settles on a successor, according to a Pentagon spokesman. MacStravic is now the deputy assistant secretary of Defense for tactical warfare systems and is responsible for direct oversight of more than 80 defense acquisition programs.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that “we’re going to do an infrastructure bill and it’s going to be big.” Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports on the campaign trail, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday’s inauguration, saying it will mark “the dawn of a new era for our country, it’s an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America.” Trump was set to make his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He’ll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he’s sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One program. “We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost,” Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump’s comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday’s inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he’s missed since 1987. “WRONG (or lie!)” Trump tweeted. “He boycotted Bush 43 also because he ‘thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in....he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.’ Sound familiar!” Lewis’ office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush’s 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would “love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don’t, we’ve got some great seats for others to partake in. It’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power.” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a “reflection of the division” in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach “too complicated” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called “border adjustment” that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It’s part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he’ll offer “insurance for everybody.” Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide “universal access.” European Union nations bracing for Trump’s ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect’s stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump’s view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren’t paying their fair share had “caused astonishment.” Also this week, Trump’s picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana made his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening. ——— Associated Press writers Julie Pace in Washington and Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report. ——— Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/JonLemire     Tags: trump, tuesday, president, inauguration, would, trump, Other stories from today: Police: Man posed as Bieber online to extort nude photos Poll: Young Americans fear they will be worse off post-Trump Israeli zoo scrambles to find missing monkey     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of Trump's first week in office?

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     NASA Eyes Russian Soyuz Trips To Send Crew To ISS Posted: Jan 18 2017, 5:00am CST | by IANS, Updated: Jan 18 2017, 5:04am CST, in News | Latest Science News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   NASA is considering to acquire two seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecrafts to transport crews for missions in 2017 and 2018 to the International Space Station (ISS), media reported. Don't Miss: Biggest Super Bowl TV Bargain Deals NASA is considering to buy Soyuz seats, through an arrangement with Boeing, because no other vehicles are currently capable of transporting one crew member in 2017, one crew member in 2018, and three additional seats in 2019, Spacenews reported on Wednesday. Boeing had obtained the rights to the seats from Soyuz manufacturer RSC Energia. The two seats in 2017 and 2018 became available to the other ISS partners after Russia decided to vacate them as a cost-saving measure. Buying these seats for 2017 and 2018 missions will increase US crew size on the ISS from three to four and maximise ISS science utilisation. Although the space agency has contracts with two US commercial companies -- Orbital ATK and SpaceX -- for transporting crew to the ISS, their vehicles are still in the developmental stage and can begin fully operational crew flights to the ISS by 2019. NASA is considering to tap Boeing for the launch, return and rescue of US or US-designated astronauts and associated services. The services BASA wants to hire are for the launch of US crew members to the ISS for planned six-month missions, on-orbit rescue services for the duration of six-month missions, provision of emergency rescue services and medical support, thei9r return to the Earth, and post-flight medical support, among others.

Photo - AFP x A relative of missing Chinese passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared on March 8, 2014 cries before a meeting in Beijing on January 18, 2017, a day after authorities announced the end of search operations for the aircraft. Photo - AFP   Sharelines Suspended MH370 search could resume in future, says Australia Suspended #MH370 search could resume in future, says #Australia Sydney: Australia said on Wednesday it was not ruling out a future underwater search for a missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet as families of those on board criticised the decision to suspend the hunt after three fruitless years. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. "I don't rule out a future underwater search by any stretch," Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester told reporters in Melbourne, a day after Australia, Malaysia and China called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean. The search cost about A$200 million ($150 million), mostly paid by Malaysia, and had already been extended twice. But the three countries involved have been reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane's final resting place. A recommendation from investigators last month to look to the north of the 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq mile) area that has been the focus of search efforts was rejected by Australia and Malaysia as too imprecise. Chester said cost had not been the determining factor to halt the search, but he said restarting it would require "credible new information which leads to a specific location". Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Wednesday expressed "deep regret" that the plane had not been found, but reaffirmed the agreement between Malaysia, Australia and China to stop looking. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometres out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which led the hunt, said authorities were confident it was not in the area that has been searched. ATSB chief commissioner Greg Hood said "residual search activity", including satellite and drift analysis would continue until the end of February. But quitting the underwater search drew a swift and angry reaction from relatives of those on board, who had called for the hunt to be expanded. Most of the passengers were from China. About 30 relatives of victims gathered at a monthly meeting with Malaysian Airlines officials in Beijing on Wednesday to protest against the end of the search. Relatives told Reuters the airline invited four representatives to go to Malaysia and discuss the decision but they had rejected the offer. Dan Shuqin, 63, whose sister was on the flight, said authorities had been "playing tricks" for three years. "Can four family members speak for all 140 family members?" she asked. Instead, the relatives called for Malaysian authorities to hold a meeting with the families in China. An airline spokeswoman said its Post Accident Office was in constant contact with family members, but did not give any further details. On Tuesday, Jiang Hui, whose mother was on board the flight, told Reuters he felt "disappointed, helpless and angry" because the search had been ended. There was also anger on social media at the news. "Didn't they say they would never end the search? What the hell happened?" wrote one user on China's Weibo service. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It’s been observed that one of Trump’s 140-character outbursts can cause financial damage, or, at least, temporarily harm the stock of publicly traded companies like Boeing or Lockheed Martin. Story Continued Below But in this instance — an apparent schoolyard retort to Vanity Fair’s brutal Trump Grill takedown the previous day — the tweet actually had the opposite effect. Vanity Fair capitalized on the publicity with a flash sale. "’THE WAY DOWN, BIG TROUBLE, DEAD!’ MAGAZINE TRUMP DOESN'T WANT YOU TO READ," declared a promotion on vanityfair.com, advertising a one-year print-digital subscription for $5. Thirteen-thousand people took the bait within 24 hours. Since then? Another 67,000 new subscribers (total circulation tends to hover a little over a million), the majority of them at the standard annual rate of $15 per year, according to a spokeswoman for the magazine. So you could argue that, with nothing more than a few impetuous thumb-taps on his Android, Trump probably made Vanity Fair at least a million dollars richer. The Trump bump happened to coincide with a broader upswing for the 103-year-old Condé Nast glossy. Vanity Fair was never really on a downswing, but nor has it been entirely immune to the pressures facing the magazine industry at large. In recent months, however, as it has fortified its digital presence with a new flagship web vertical, this publication of record for the power elite has felt especially relevant, and its numbers are apparently in fine shape. “We’ve never been more profitable,” long-time editor in chief Graydon Carter told POLITICO during an interview recently in his office at 1 World Trade Center, where Vanity Fair occupies the skyscraper’s 41st floor. (Since Condé Nast doesn’t disclose company financials, we’ll have to take his word for it.) “I think 2016 might be our best year.” Revenue aside, the increased buzz can be attributed in part to Vanity Fair’s singular perch in the firmament of Trump media coverage. Carter, whose name has topped Vanity Fair’s masthead for nearly 25 years and seven presidential administrations, has been one of Trump’s most caustic chroniclers for three decades and counting. And while Vanity Fair is hardly unique for being a news organization in Trump’s cross-hairs, the target on its back is more personal than most. In these strange new times for media, that is seen as a good thing. “No magazine benefited more directly from Donald Trump’s anti-press zealotry than VF,” the trade publication Folio wrote in naming Carter one of its 2016 “winners” in magazine media. “If this was gamesmanship (which it was),” Folio continued, referring to the Trump Grill review (“Trump Grill Could Be the Worst Restaurant in America”), “score one for Graydon Carter.” Trump and Carter’s on-again-off-again animus (right now it would appear to be very much on) dates back to the 1986 origins of Spy magazine, in which a then 40-year-old Donald Trump — bawdy and ostentatious and ripe for lampooning — became a favorite target of Carter and Spy magazine co-founder Kurt Andersen. Today, the duo’s mockery of Trump as a “short-fingered vulgarian” is the stuff of media legend. “No journalists have followed Trump more closely. No journalists have angered him more often,” NPR’s David Folkenflik said when introducing Carter and Andersen in an interview last year. During the campaign and the transition, as carnival-barker Trump became serious-candidate Trump became President-Elect Trump, Carter found himself with more material to work with than ever before. Look no further than his biting editor’s letters over the course of the past year. November’s 1,960-word opus was particularly nuclear, if understandably misguided in its prediction of what would happen on election day. “He is a mad jumble of a man,” Carter wrote, “with a slapdash of a campaign and talking points dredged from the dark corners at the bottom of the Internet. I don’t think he will get to the White House, but just the fact that his carny act has gotten so far along the road will leave the path with a permanent orange stain.” Trump won on that one very important point, but Vanity Fair comes out with a prize too: a reason to keep writing about the man, to the great pleasure of a growing audience. February’s cover belongs to actor Chris Pratt, but make no mistake, this is a Trump issue, as five of the eight features promoted on the cover would seem to suggest. (Trump’s Dec. 15 tweet also makes an appearance, right there on the front of the mag.) On Jan. 6, Trump and Carter found themselves up close and personal — for the first time in as many as 10 years, according to Carter — when Trump paid a visit to Condé Nast to meet with the company’s top editors and executives. As Carter told POLITICO the previous day (the scheduling of our interview was a happy coincidence), he offered to sit the meeting out: “I went to Anna Wintour,” the Vogue EIC, Condé Nast artistic director and Hillary Clinton supporter, “and I said, ‘listen, I don’t want to make him feel uncomfortable.’” (In a followup, Carter wouldn’t say anything about his interaction, or non-interaction, with Trump, because the meeting was off the record.) If the two of them didn’t have all this history? “I actually think [the coverage] would be exactly the same,” Carter said. “He’s just the most unusual president we’ve ever had, at least in most of our lifetimes. It’s this constant outflow of either erroneous information, or negative information, or semi-truthful information, and the press reacts to that. Ignoring him completely is the only other way to go. If you’re in for a penny, you’re in for a pound.” Back in June, as press coverage of Trump’s campaign marched inexorably toward its apex, Vanity Fair launched The Hive, a section of vanityfair.com covering the corridors of power in Manhattan, Washington and Silicon Valley. Star Vanity Fair writers like Sarah Ellison, William D. Cohan and Nick Bilton found a natural home there, churning out juicy web exclusives in addition to their work for the print edition. The Hive also has nurtured up-and-coming reporters like Emily Jane Fox and Tina Nguyen, whose Trump Grill piece put her on the map. With more than 1.4 million readers since Trump’s retaliatory tweet last month, it was The Hive’s top-performing story of 2016. In November (peak election-season), The Hive accounted for about 6 million out of a record 20 million total web visitors that month, according to Vanity Fair. Along with two sister verticals — HWD (entertainment) and Vanities (celebs, royals, etc.) — it also helped notch up web revenues by 74 percent last year, a spokeswoman said, with blue-chip advertisers like BMW, IBM and Goldman Sachs signing up to get a digital piece of Vanity Fair’s high-net-worth readership. “It was profitable from the day we pressed the button,” said Carter. “There was a period where we just completely thought we were f--ked and that the best thing was to realize how f--ked we were, and the business at hand was to get un-f--ked. And we did get un-f--ked, both by a vibrant [events] business … and then through The Hive, which is the essence of the magazine but – boom! boom! boom! – in a daily form.” What next? An expansion of The Hive, for starters, with plans to add more editors and reporters to the current staff of about 10. As for Carter himself, he said his contract is up sometime this spring, but he was coy when asked if he plans to renew. “I don’t know, we’ll see.” (Suspense!) Of course it’s hard to imagine Carter not being the editor shepherding Vanity Fair’s coverage of the Trump administration. “Assuming he lasts four years, it’s a very attractive proposition,” he said. “Anybody who’s a part of the press,” Carter continued, “if they’re not worried about the next four years, they’re not paying attention. It’s gonna be a bumpy road. … But you might as well just hang up your spurs if you’re intimidated by this stuff. He’s gonna have problems on his hands that are bigger than a review of one of his restaurants.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Joe Pompeo jpompeo@politico.com @joepompeo This story tagged under: Media Media Stories More on POLITICO Media Media Footer - Intro Row Dropdown Links U.S. Edition Europe Edition POLITICO Media Links States New York Florida New Jersey California Massachusetts Illinois Newsletters Morning Media Playbook POLITICO New York Playbook POLITICO Florida Playbook POLITICO New Jersey Playbook POLITICO California Playbook POLITICO Massachusetts Playbook POLITICO Illinois Playbook News POLITICO Home POLITICO Magazine POLITICO New York Magazine 2016 Elections POLITICO Events Contact Advertise POLITICO Pro About us Contact Press Privacy policy Terms and conditions Multimedia Video Off Message Series What Works Women Rule POLITICO Caucus Agenda © 2017 POLITICO LLC Terms of Service Privacy Policy

PrintCommentRecommend (-) By Chris Higgins | 01-18-17 | 06:00 AM | Email Article  Transdigm manufactures products for electronic, fluid, power, and motion control onboard aircraft. It also supplies products used for cabin structures, lighting, laminates, pallets, and a host of other applications. The B737, B777, B787, A320, and A330/340 aircraft account for a combined 30% of sales. In the defense business, aircraft include the A400M and C-130. About the Author Chris Higgins is an equity analyst for Morningstar. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists Transdigm’s business reflects its private equity roots--the company had its initial public offering in 2006--and its units typically operate autonomously. The company also uses significant financial leverage, relying on a stream of aftermarket business to generate predictable cash flows. Management is a serial acquirer, aiming to improve operations at acquired firms and optimize the capital structure. Transdigm’s moat rests on switching costs and intangible assets. Its aerospace products meet Federal Aviation Administration certification requirements and must also pass a separate aircraft manufacturer qualification process. Aftermarket sales, which account for over 75% of profitability, are particularly sticky. Transdigm enjoys the highest margins of any company in our aerospace coverage, translating into impressive returns on invested capital. It reports financials through power and control and airframe segments but in practice manages its business through 32 units. For fiscal 2016, we expect the firm to generate roughly 70% of sales from commercial customers--airlines and parts distributors (39% of total 2016 sales) and aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus (32% of 2016 sales) for equipment sales--and 30% from defense customers. Transdigm generated excess returns every year over the past decade, and we expect it to continue to do so. We do foresee revenue and profit growth slowing from the blistering pace over the past decade due to scale effects and the niche aerospace markets in which the firm hunts for acquisitions. Still, we think long-term investors will be well served holding the name. Wide Moat From Intellectual Property Transdigm’s wide economic moat rests on intangible assets in the form of intellectual property on its products, particularly in the aftermarket where this IP effectively blocks competitors. In addition, switching costs emanate from the inclusion of Transdigm parts in an aircraft’s design by plane manufacturers and through FAA certification of these parts. Finally, the low overall dollar value of the company’s parts, versus the high cost of failure for aircraft, reinforces these switching costs. Transdigm’s moat has resulted in returns on invested capital above the cost of capital even when including goodwill (roughly 50% of total assets) sitting on the balance sheet. This ROIC performance results in solid pricing power in the market, something the company maintained even during the last economic downturn. We forecast ROIC including goodwill to average 13.8% from fiscal 2017 to 2021. However, if we strip out the company’s acquisitions in 2016 and the unannounced future acquisitions that we model, we arrive at an average annual ROIC of around 18% over the next five years. We’re nearly certain that Transdigm will earn excess returns for the next 10 years, and we expect returns above the cost of capital to continue even past this time period. The company seeks to reinforce its moat by maintaining a significant exposure to the aerospace and defense aftermarket, a large portfolio of proprietary products, and a sole-source position on most products. The aftermarket, which stood at roughly 55% of fiscal 2016 sales, includes spare and repair part sales primarily to airlines and parts distributors. Switching costs in the aftermarket remain high because of the high cost of an aircraft failure as well as the costs and time associated with recertifying an aircraft with the introduction of new parts. Moreover, high proprietary content via IP makes it difficult for competitors to copy Transdigm’s products or even service them, as they do not have access to the technical data. Because of this IP and captive aftermarket, we estimate sole-source contracts--where Transdigm is the only company available to perform the work--will account for about 80% of revenue in fiscal 2017. Although EBITDA margins in the aftermarket are predictably high, we estimate equipment sales still generate EBITDA margins of 25%-30%. This is impressive, particularly considering that engine manufacturers like Rolls-Royce and Safran realize similar aftermarket margins but sell their equipment at a loss. Transdigm’s economic moat also rests on the rigorous aerospace supplier selection and qualification process, which takes place when an aircraft manufacturer like Boeing or Airbus designs a new aircraft. The desire of aircraft manufacturers to freeze their designs and reduce complexity in their final assembly lines means that design changes requiring new suppliers are rarely pursued once design freeze occurs several years before start of production. We particularly think switching costs for aircraft producers remain high during the critical initial production ramp-up that demands steep reductions in unit recurring costs. On mature programs--once production has stabilized--aircraft manufacturers can be more apt to make design changes and/or change suppliers. FAA certification represents another intangible asset that Transdigm, like many other aerospace companies, enjoys. Once the FAA certifies an aircraft, it also certifies the bill of materials for the aircraft, which includes Transdigm’s parts. This effectively creates switching costs for Transdigm since a customer trying to recertify an aircraft with new parts would need to expend a significant amount of time and resources. In addition, a new entrant wanting to certify a part and offer it to Transdigm’s customers would find this strategy uneconomical without immediately having significant scale, as most parts sell for a low dollar amount but would require a fairly costly and lengthy certification process. The dollar amount of Transdigm’s products as a percentage of aircraft value also sets the company apart from other aerospace players of its size and reinforces the company’s switching costs. Only 10% of commercial aftermarket revenue comes from parts with total annual sales above $2 million, which means that Transdigm remains a relatively small supplier to its customers and that customers typically don’t change suppliers due to price increases. This also serves to partially insulate Transdigm from Parts Manufacturer Approval products, which are non-OEM spare parts but certified by the FAA for use onboard aircraft. The economics for these PMA parts typically work best for high-volume, low-priced parts. While Transdigm’s business remains focused on lower-priced parts, these parts are not typically high volume, as evidence by their low total annual sales levels. Boeing did include Transdigm in its recent partnering for success initiative that sought price concessions from suppliers. In any event, the low value of Transdigm’s parts, coupled with the high cost of failure for commercial and defense aircraft, means that customers are often reluctant to change suppliers due to price increases. This feature of the business came through in a pronounced way during the most recent downturn, when the company managed to move prices up on spares and repair parts in the commercial aftermarket even in the face of weak air traffic demand and belt-tightening at airlines. Exposed to Both Commercial and Military Markets Transdigm’s business is chiefly exposed to the health of the commercial aerospace market and, to a lesser degree, defense spending and military operations tempo. Transdigm’s commercial equipment sales (31% of revenue) follow aircraft manufacturing, which is driven by global economic growth. The company’s larger commercial aerospace aftermarket business (36% of revenue) typically tracks global revenue passenger kilometers, and after the financial crisis, this metric has been running at over 5% growth. During the last downturn, RPK year-over-year growth went negative, but Transdigm retained its pricing power thanks to its moat. Defense accounts for roughly 33% of sales and tracks with U.S. defense spending and demand for spares linked to operations. Transdigm is also modestly exposed to the business jet and commercial helicopter markets, which combined account for about 15% of sales. Weak oil and other commodity prices have been driving demand down in the business jet (high-net-worth individuals) and rotorcraft (oil and gas exploration) markets. Transdigm’s acquisition machine may not continue at the pace we have seen over the past decade. While we think overpaying for targets is unlikely, we do have concerns around the availability of viable targets and the potential for deals to be blocked on antitrust grounds. The former concern stems from the restrictive but value-creating criteria Transdigm uses for targets: low-dollar-value aerospace components, high aftermarket content, and significant IP. Antitrust concerns already materialized once in 2012. While no other antitrust issues have surfaced and Transdigm continues to close deals, we believe there are both natural and regulatory limits to Transdigm’s strategy. Stewardship Is Exemplary We rate the company’s stewardship of shareholder capital as Exemplary. Management remains focused on investing in and acquiring aerospace products with high aftermarket content and intellectual property behind them. It applies a three-prong strategy to optimize its businesses: capturing profitable new business, achieving year-over-year cost improvements, and pursuing value-based pricing. While this all sounds a bit motherhood and apple pie, the relentless focus of management on these pillars year in and year out impresses us. We think Transdigm’s culture, born out of nearly 15 years under private ownership, seeks to disrupt the principal-agent problems inherent with public companies. Management maintains a large stake in the business, with more than 10% of the common shares outstanding. The company’s compensation philosophy emphasizes equity awards and attempts to constrain the cash component of executive pay to amounts below industry norms. Stock options only vest if management increases the company’s intrinsic equity value (EBITDA times a multiple less net debt) by 17.5% annually.

File Photo The search cost about A$200 million ($150 million), mostly paid by Malaysia, and had already been extended twice. Sydney, Jan 18:   Australia said on Wednesday it was not ruling out a future underwater search for a missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet as families of those on board criticised the decision to suspend the hunt after three fruitless years. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777,disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. “I don't rule out a future underwater search by any stretch,” Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester told reporters in Melbourne, a day after Australia, Malaysia and China called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean. The search cost about A$200 million ($150 million), mostly paid by Malaysia, and had already been extended twice. But the three countries involved have been reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane's final resting place. A recommendation from investigators last month to look to the north of the 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq mile) area that has been the focus of search efforts was rejected by Australia and Malaysia as too imprecise. Chester said cost had not been the determining factor to halt the search, but he said restarting it would require “credible new information which leads to a specific location”. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Wednesday expressed “deep regret” that the plane had not been found, but reaffirmed the agreement between Malaysia, Australia and China to stop looking. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. No clues Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014.

About 30 relatives of victims gathered at a monthly meeting with Malaysian Airlines officials in Beijing on Wednesday to protest against the end of the search. Relatives told Reuters the airline invited four representatives to go to Malaysia and discuss the decision but they had rejected the offer. Dan Shuqin, 63, whose sister was on the flight, said authorities had been “playing tricks” for three years.“Can four family members speak for all 140 family members?” she asked.

An airline spokeswoman said its Post Accident Office was inconstant contact with family members, but did not give any further details. On Tuesday, Jiang Hui, whose mother was on board the flight,told Reuters he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended. There was also anger on social media at the news.“Didn't they say they would never end the search? What the hell happened?” wrote one user on China's Weibo service. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane.

Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage New York, Jan 18 (IANS) NASA is considering to acquire two seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecrafts to transport crews for missions in 2017 and 2018 to the International Space Station (ISS), media reported. NASA is considering to buy Soyuz seats, through an arrangement with Boeing, because no other vehicles are currently capable of transporting one crew member in 2017, one crew member in 2018, and three additional seats in 2019, Spacenews reported on Wednesday. Boeing had obtained the rights to the seats from Soyuz manufacturer RSC Energia. The two seats in 2017 and 2018 became available to the other ISS partners after Russia decided to vacate them as a cost-saving measure. Buying these seats for 2017 and 2018 missions will increase US crew size on the ISS from three to four and maximise ISS science utilisation. Although the space agency has contracts with two US commercial companies -- Orbital ATK and SpaceX -- for transporting crew to the ISS, their vehicles are still in the developmental stage and can begin fully operational crew flights to the ISS by 2019. NASA is considering to tap Boeing for the launch, return and rescue of US or US-designated astronauts and associated services. The services BASA wants to hire are for the launch of US crew members to the ISS for planned six-month missions, on-orbit rescue services for the duration of six-month missions, provision of emergency rescue services and medical support, thei9r return to the Earth, and post-flight medical support, among others. --IANS sku/na/vt (This story has not been edited by economictimes.com and is auto–generated from a syndicated feed we subscribe to.)

PHOTO: REUTERS SYDNEY: The Australian government said on Wednesday it was not ruling out a future underwater search for a missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet as families of those on board criticised the decision to suspend the hunt after three fruitless years. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. “I don’t rule out a future underwater search by any stretch,” Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester told reporters in Melbourne, a day after Australia, Malaysia and China officially called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean. Australia, Malaysia, China halt MH370 underwater search The search cost around USD $150 million, mostly paid by Malaysia, and has already been extended twice. But the three countries involved have been reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane’s final resting place. A recommendation from investigators last month to look to the north of the 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq mile) area that has been the focus of search efforts was rejected by Australia and Malaysia as too imprecise. Chester said cost had not been the determining factor to halt the search, but he said restarting it would require “credible new information which leads to a specific location”. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Wednesday expressed “deep regret” that the plane had not been found, but reaffirmed the agreement between Malaysia, Australia and China to stop looking. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. NO CLUES Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometres out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which led the hunt for the plane, said authorities are confident it is not in the area that has been searched. ATSB chief commissioner Greg Hood said “residual search activity,” including satellite and drift analysis would continue until the end of February. MH370 plunged rapidly, wing flap not out for landing: new report But quitting the underwater search drew a swift and angry reaction from relatives of those on board, who had called for the project to be expanded. In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended. There was also anger on social media at the news. “Didn’t they say they would never end the search? What the hell happened?” wrote one user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane.

Shows Good Morning America Good Morning America World News Tonight World News Tonight Nightline Nightline 20/20 20/20 This Week This Week Live Watch Pence Promises Big Investment in Infrastructure By jonathan lemire and catherine lucey, associated press NEW YORK  Jan 17, 2017, 10:01 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email Vice President-elect Mike Pence pledged to a group of mayors that the Trump administration will make a serious investment in infrastructure, and he told diplomats that Trump and his incoming team share "a commitment to engage with all of the world." Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill, and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports while campaigning, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump also made his first trip to Washington in weeks on Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump flew in for a black-tie dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The Chairman's Global Dinner drew nearly 150 diplomats and ambassadors, well-heeled donors, soon-to-be White House staffers and Cabinet picks. "We have great respect for your countries. We have great respect for our world," Trump told the group after he was introduced by Pence, who assured that the future president was willing to engage with the world, despite his "America First" mantra. "I'm not sure that the national media here in America completely understands the president-elect. I can assure you that the world will," Pence said, adding that Trump "will be a president who puts America first, but we will work every day with nations around the world to advance the peace and prosperity of our allies and our friends across the world." The president-elect is expected to return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he'll offer "insurance for everybody." Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide "universal access." European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana made his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening. ——— Associated Press writers Julie Pace and Jill Colvin in Washington and Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report. ——— Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire 0 Shares Email Star Comments Pence Promises Big Investment in Infrastructure " Trump Pushes Voter Fraud Claim Citing Fringe Blogger " Trump Orders Suspension of All Refugees, Immigrants From Some Muslim Nations " Trump Called National Park Service Upset Over Inauguration Crowd Retweet " Trump, Mexico's President Speak by Phone " Trump Says He'll Give Christian Refugees Priority to Enter US " TRANSCRIPT: ABC News Anchor David Muir Speaks With President Trump " Sunday on ‘This Week’: Sean Spicer, Sen.

    Home About Antiwar.com Donate Blog US Casualties Contact Latest News Trump the Disruptor He’s shaking things up – and looking out for America first by Justin Raimondo, January 18, 2017 Print This | Share This If the New York Times is to be believed – a problematic proposition – then it looks as if Trump Derangement Syndrome has gone international. In a front page article headlined “As Trump Era Dawns, A Sense of Uncertainty Grips the World,” we are told: “The Germans are angry. The Chinese are downright furious. Leaders of NATO are nervous, while their counterparts at the European Union are alarmed.” Oh heavens-to-Betsy, whatever shall we do? So what’s the source of this latest Trumpanic? It’s an interview with Tory mandarin Michael Gove and Kai Diekmann, a former editor of the German newspaper Bild, in which the President-elect reiterates what he’s been saying to the American people for the past year, and on the basis of which he won the election: US foreign policy is going to change, and in a big way. However, to Times reporter Steve Erlanger, this all comes as a big revelation, evidence that “Trump has again focused his penchant for disruption on the rest of the world.” Oh, the poor babies! Perhaps they need to find a safe space in which to park themselves for the next four-to-eight years. This being the Times, there’s the requisite Russia-baiting: “No one knows where exactly he is headed – except that the one country he is not criticizing is Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. For now. And that he is an enthusiastic cheerleader of Brexit and an unaffiliated Britain. For now.” If this reads like a paragraph torn out of one of the Hillary Clinton campaign’s strategy memos, well then consider the source. And speaking of the source, what exactly did Trump say in this supposedly “disruptive” interview that has the Powers That Be in such a tizzy? They ask him about Brexit, and he endorses it, as he has in the past. They ask him if he’d vote for Angela Merkel in the upcoming German elections, and he demurs: “I don’t know who she’s running against.” Besides which, isn’t it a bit unseemly for an American President-elect to endorse a candidate for office in a foreign country? It surely would be in bad taste if the situation were reversed. They press him on Merkel’s open invitation to the entire nation of Syria to emigrate to Germany: was it “insane,” as he said during the campaign? Or has he changed his mind for some reason? He reiterates his often-stated view that “it was a big mistake for Germany,” and then broadens out his answer to include an analysis of the regional chaos caused by the administration of George W. Bush, whom he doesn’t mention by name but it’s clear where he places the blame: “Look, this whole thing should never have happened. Iraq should not have been attacked in the first place, all right? It was one of the worst decisions, possibly the worst decision ever made in the history of our country. We’ve unleashed – it’s like throwing rocks into a beehive. It’s one of the great messes of all time. I looked at something, uh, I’m not allowed to show you because it’s classified – but, I just looked at Afghanistan and you look at the Taliban – and you take a look at every, every year its more, more, more, you know they have the different colours – and you say, you know – what’s going on?” Those pathetic Republican “foreign policy experts” who are now complaining about being on an “enemies list” kept by the Trump transition team deserve to be on that list: they, after all, were the architects of the ongoing disaster described by Trump, and he clearly doesn’t care to reward failure. This is precisely why the GOP foreign policy Establishment campaigned so hard against him: that these losers are now locked out of the administration is good news indeed. More good news: Trump is taking direct and very public aim at their patrons, the Military-Industrial Complex that Dwight David Eisenhower so presciently warned us against. Even as he pledges to upgrade the US military, the President-elect clearly knows who his enemies are: “Boeing and Lockheed Martin are you know big contractors for this country and we have an F-35 program that has been very, very severely over budget and behind schedule. Hundreds of billions of dollars over budget and seven years behind schedule. And, uh, they got to shape up.” Employees of both Boeing and Lockheed-Martin gave record amounts to the Clinton campaign: indeed, the entire industry went for Hillary in a big way. Asked about his top priority as commander-in-chief, Trump had one word to say: “ISIS.” Asked how he’d deal with ISIS, he demurred. Yet it isn’t at all hard to imagine what his strategy will be: he’s not saying we should “get along with Russia” because he’s a secret Putinite, as our crazed conspiracy theorists would have it. Clearly he means to enlist Russia’s support in what he envisions as a short but effective campaign to eliminate ISIS entirely, at least when it comes to the Syrian “Caliphate.” After all, Russia is already in Syria in a big way: and Trump’s hostility to the Obama administration’s campaign to overthrow Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad indicates he’s likely to align with both Syria and Russia to restore some sort of order to the region. As to what degree he’ll farm out this task to the Russians and the Syrians, we’ll see. We’ll also see how “quick” this joint campaign will be: history does not bode well, in any case. Yet it’s clear he wants to minimize our involvement. This segues into what is the most controversial part of the interview: “Q: Talking about Russia, you know that Angela Merkel understands Putin very well because he is fluent in German, she is fluent in Russian, and they have known each other for a long time – but who would you trust more, Angela Merkel or Vladimir Putin? “Trump: Well, I start off trusting both – but let’s see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.” Oh, how the “experts” and the political class went ballistic over that one! How dare Trump equate our “ally” Germany with our evil “adversary,” the perfidious Putin! And yet the reality is that neither Germany nor Russia is inherently either friend or foe: they are simply actors on the world stage whose relations to the US are based entirely on what is in America’s interests. As George Washington warned in his Farewell Address: “[N]othing is more essential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others, should be excluded; and that, in place of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated.” Trump’s “realist” value-free characterization of our relations with the leaders of both Germany and Russia represents a return to the foreign policy of the Founders, from which we have strayed to our great detriment. It is, as Trump proclaimed so often during the campaign, a foreign policy that puts America first. As he’s being interrogated by a Brit and a German, much of the interview deals with Europe, and specifically policy toward Russia. Asked if he can “understand why eastern Europeans fear Putin and Russia,” he says “Sure, oh sure,” and then goes very quickly into a critique of NATO, which he says is “obsolete.” It’s obvious he thinks the fears of the east Europeans are vastly overblown, as indeed they are. Trump complains that “the countries aren’t paying their fair share. So we’re supposed to protect countries but a lot of these countries aren’t paying what they’re supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States. With that being said, NATO is very important to me.” Yes, but how important is “very important” in TrumpWorld? Europe’s welfare cases shudder as they contemplate the answer. Gove avers that “Britain is paying,” and Trump agrees, but says: “There’s five countries that are paying what they’re supposed to. Five. It’s not much, from twenty-two.” And as Trump no doubt realizes, the costs of NATO involve more than money: we are obligated to defend twenty-two countries in case they are attacked. That’s twenty-two tripwires that could set off a major war: the price of that is incalculable. Is it worth it? Trump clearly has his doubts, and it’s this that has the Euro-weenies in an uproar. After all, they’ve been coasting along on Uncle Sam’s dime for all these years, financing extensive welfare programs for their own citizens as well as a horde of migrants: the idea that the gravy train is going to dry up has them up in arms. And of course the issue of NATO is really about the Russian question – is Putin really intent on annexing his “near abroad” and re-establishing the Soviet empire? This nonsensical fantasy, based on nothing but rejuvenated cold war hysteria, is clearly doubted by Trump and his advisors. So when he’s asked if he supports the continuation of European sanctions against Russia, Trump replies: “Well, I think you know – people have to get together and people have to do what they have to do in terms of being fair. OK? They have sanctions on Russia – let’s see if we can make some good deals with Russia. For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that’s part of it. But you do have sanctions and Russia’s hurting very badly right now because of sanctions, but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit.” In short: sanctions can be ended as part of a grand bargain with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons arsenals on both sides and guarantee European security. Ambitious? – Yes. Praiseworthy? – Certainly. Can he do it? Only by overcoming the War Party’s opposition in Congress, led by Mad John McCain and joined by the now-Russophobic war-crazed Democrats out to obstruct anything and everything Trump does, even at the cost of world peace. It’s absolutely wonderful how Trump’s offhand remarks rub the commentariat the wrong way, especially because what he says is indisputable. Asked which number he dials if he wants to talk to Europe – a riff off a remark by Henry Kissinger – he names Merkel on the grounds that “you look at the European Union and it’s Germany. Basically a vehicle for Germany. That’s why I thought the UK was so smart in getting out.” Zing! Poor Angela Merkel – she can’t get no respect! Elaborating his view of the EU, Trump averred: “People, countries want their own identity and the UK wanted its own identity but, I do believe this, if they hadn’t been forced to take in all of the refugees, so many, with all the problems that it, you know, entails, I think that you wouldn’t have a Brexit. It probably could have worked out but, this was the final straw, this was the final straw that broke the camel’s back. “I think people want, people want their own identity, so if you ask me, others, I believe others will leave.” We can’t forget that the interviewers are Europeans who have been sucking at the American teat since the end of World War II, as one of the final questions makes all too clear: “Your policy platform of America First implies you’re happy to see the rest of the world suffer. Do you?” Spoken like a true dependent, and yet Trump lit right into them with the unvarnished truth: “I don’t want it to be a disruption – I love the world, I want the world to be good but we can’t go – I mean look at what’s happening to our country – we are $20 trillion [in debt] – we don’t know what we’re doing – our military is weak – we’re in wars that never end, we’re in Afghanistan now 17 years … it’s the longest war we’ve ever been in.” Endless wars, endless payments to feckless “allies,” endless hectoring by these ungrateful wretches who accuse us of wanting to “see the rest of the world suffer” – Trump would put an end to all this, and I have no doubt that the American people support him wholeheartedly. Shall we take a poll on the popularity of the US bearing the brunt of Europe’s “defense” against an enemy that disappeared in 1989? Shall we have a national referendum on the prospect of going to war over whether Montenegro – a nation the size of the metropolitan New York area – shall have a “pro-Western” government? If you wonder why our “intelligence community” is waging open warfare against the forty-fifth  President of these United States, you have only to look at this interview. He is challenging the “liberal” international order which has paid out liberal amounts of moolah and unearned prestige to a whole class of government contractors, thinktank poobahs, useless spooks, and their ancillary business enterprises for decades. Without this “international order,” we’re told, the world will be plunged into “uncertainty,” if not complete chaos. This is a lie. The only uncertainty that Trump’s America First foreign policy imposes is uncertainty as to where the war profiteers’ next meal ticket is coming from. And that, dear reader, is a cause not for panic but for celebration. NOTES IN THE MARGIN You can check out my Twitter feed by going here.

RickR35 I wouldn’t assume that now somehow the US is going to take some leading role in Syria. ISIS needs to be squeezed from both ends: Syria and Iraq. Let Russia & Co. take care of ISIS in Syria and the US better get it’s stuff together and get on ISIS in Iraq, not to mention looking into ISIS finances and who’s providing them with material support. That is an important questions about the war profiteers’ next meal ticket. If Trump manages to bring the West to its sense then no doubt the death-destruction&deficit industry will go back to ruining developing countries. Mike Ehling I agree with what you say, Justin, but only with what you say. There’s also that which you don’t talk about. And that’s the “pivot to Asia.” Does Trump want to get out of Europe just so he can get into Asia? The whole Taiwan snafu, for example. I wonder what your thoughts are on this. Sarastro92 Correct. Relations with China are being entirely mishandled. Opening up the Two China issue is really, really counter-productive Mark Thomason There is more than one way to mishandle our China relationship. Obama mishandled in one way, and Trump is starting on another. We can avoid picking fights as part of an encirclement strategy, get cooperation on some things like Korean nukes, and still stand up for our own trading interests. The South China Sea is to China what the Caribbean is to the US. We need not be on the wrong side of another Cuban Missile Crisis. China does not want a nuclear North Korea, but they also don’t want the US on the Yalu nor a flood of millions of desperate refugees. We can make a deal on that. South Korea wants to be safe, not just militarized. On trade, China is now reforming its own economy, to put more emphasis on internal consumption, as the next stage in its evolution. That is what we want them to do anyway, so again we can work this out if we try. Sarastro92 You’re reading my mind… I totally agree on each and every point.. The US needs to negotiate a Global Condominium with key powers in which Uni-Polar hegemony is renounced and spheres of influence are recognized. And with that comes areas of security and cooperation that are defined… Access to resources is important, secure shipping lanes etc… science, technology and cultural sharing etc… Self-determination etc. Time to end the Great Games… This would mean the US focuses on internal growth and trade with traditional allies in Western Europe and Japan, but more or less remains self-reliant on Western partners in the Americas. Amicable relations and military withdrawal from overseas bases follows… Bianca We do not know if this is being “mishandled”. You can do one of the following. Find the written Foreign Policy Strategy, available since April 2016, or you can rely on snippets of information, and read tea leaves, while speculating on the greater meaning of the same. I urge people to find the document, it was a speech. If I take the document, it states clearly that US will not do regime changes, or promote revolutions. It will not be in the business of administering the nonexistent universal human rights. It is against the globalism, meaning that the fundamental unit of all international relations is nation-state. To the extent that nation-states enter into any regional or international arrangement for their benefit, that is their business. But US will not deal with any such organizations, or trade-treaties that come in the shape of institutions with their own legislative and judiciary powers. Trump is just dispensing with hypocrisy. US has sold billions of dollars worth of weapons, but a president elect cannot take a phone call from Taiwan? Trump said that we have two issues with China, one is currency valuation and the other intellectual property rights. He is really not yet revealing his cards, but one can be very sure that two things will be on agenda, one is trade deficit, and the other the islands in the Pacific. Trade deficit — will require a delicate negotiations, but China can be very flexible there. In turn, China wants to protect the free navigation through the Malacca Straights, and the whole brouhaha is about this. With US giving up Obama’s aggressive posture, China may be talked into a great deal of flexibility., After all, Obama aggressiveness with the Pivot to Pacific, caused the drama in the first place. Now that the Pivot has no more takers — with Philippines and Vietnam bowing out of the conflict posturing, US has no legs to stand on. And China knows it. That whole circus with the Court of Arbitration was such a fiasco, simply ignored by ASEAN — after UN invested so much political capital to bring it about. Let us not read too much into process. What will HAVE to happen is for Trump and the Republican Congress to stop subsidizing IMPORTS, that destroys domestic production. That will be the most difficult thing to achieve with China, as it still relies on exports to US by US companies in China. The issue is not the one of PROTECTIONISM as it is often being labeled. It is the issue of SUSTAINABILITY, the term banded about, but wholly misunderstood. It is not sustainable to produce food stuffs thousands of miles away from the consumer, if such goods can be produced in the country. And even then, what can be produced locally and regionally makes more sense then managing complex supply chains, spending more energy, polluting the environment, and generally opting for foods that can be processed to withstand the process, rather then those that are healthier. Back to sustainability. Sustainability lies in defining the needs of the localities and regions for the goods to be consumed by the region — and in the process utilize optimally the land, resources, and human capacity. Clearly, what needs to be purchased elsewhere, will be. This is not protectionism, but an ecologically and economically balanced approach to the cycle of production/consumption. As the balance changes, so will the scale tip in favor of either less or more imports. But to view trade ONLY in by one measure, the lowest cost of the unit of produced — excluding all other costs of such trade, is PRIMITIVE. There are many other built in costs to the mindless globalism. It affects the human potential, as it almost eliminates a whole range of human activity from many regions, limiting the education and innovation, while often destroying viability of whole communities. This is why the process of globalism that is viewed ONLY from the prism of trade based on the unit cost of goods, is failing. It does not deliver any quick adjustments to the mindless change, nor it is obvious how to compensate. It is akin to saying that your house should remain open to all that need food and shelter, and will be compensated for by every person being able to do the same. Yet, in reality, while some are urged to keep their doors open, others have found many elegant ways to appear just as open, but define the access to their premises by rules they create. And only some people are allowed to get compensated for the losses in such arrangement, others are supposed to double up on the policy, until they become destitute. Trump will thus have much to do with China, and the end result may be good for China as well. It has already started to develop internal markets, and focusing on the mutually beneficial projects within the Silk Road strategy. It is harmonizing its interests within Eurasian region. But it will take time, and Trump does not have much of it. Some kind of deal will have to be struck, as US will no longer just allow the system to be tilted towards imports. And China will have to adjust, seeking whatever favorable terms it can procure. I think that one must give Trump a bit more time, to see how he intends to pursue Asian policies, past the wreck of Pivot to Pacific. FiendlyNeighbourhoodTerrorist Trump will do enough if he just stops interfering in Syria. ISIS – and even more importantly, al Nusra, which is now a de facto American ally – can be eradicated by Russia, Syria, and Iraq, (along with Hizbollah and Iranian help) as long as America disengages completely. The Saudi Barbarian scumlords and il Duce Erdogan won’t do a thing without American backing – they only supported the jihadi cannibals in Syria all these years in the hope and belief that Killary would continue Obama’s policies when she came to power, if not join in with them to invade Syria. If Trump just withdraws all American help, you’ll see the headchoppers in Riyadh and the monster in Ankara roll over and beg for mercy in two days flat. Mark Thomason The US spent years manufacturing this catastrophe in Syria. To walk away from it now is not the same thing as not doing that in the first place. The sunk costs fallacy remains a fallacy. This is not an argument for more intervention, as in “we’ve come this far.” However, the manner of our leaving much deal with our having been there and done that. We must undo some of our own mistakes, regime change dogam, ISIS, and al Qaeda high on that list. We must take steps now to cut them off from our allies. We must agree with our erstwhile enemies in a peace deal, and that means accepting Assad as lesser evil compared to total insanity. FiendlyNeighbourhoodTerrorist Al Nusra and al Sham are in a fight to the death in Idlib right now. The problem will probably take care of itself. terrytheboxer Speaking of erdogan…. http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/12/08/donald-trump-s-huge-conflict-of-interest-in-turkey.html Even before the president-elect has entered office, his projects in Turkey have been the subject of serious controversy, and illustrated how his business ties abroad could be affected by foreign actors. During the presidential campaign, Trump’s proposal for a Muslim ban led Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to call in June for the businessman’s name to be removed from the towers—in essence, threatening the revenue source Trump gets from licensing his name there. But Trump defended Erdogan a month later, saying the U.S. shouldn’t criticize the Turkish strongman for his crackdown after a failed coup—and there has been no mention of taking Trump’s name off the tower since. Elaine Supkis Turkey is now a Russia ally. Since the aborted CIA coup, Erdogan has turned on NATO entirely. Turkey is now doing military actions with Russia openly. TerryTheBoxer “Trump’s proposal for a Muslim ban led Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to call in June for the businessman’s name to be removed from the towers” Look at the month (June) mentioned. Pre-coup. Trying to blame the CIA for Erdogan blackmailing Trump’s business is a bit of a stretch. tom The military/industrial complex will decide Trump’s fate. If he curtails their lucrative government contracts because of a more diplomatic peaceful stance in the world, he is entering JFK territory! Even General(President) Eisenhower warned against the “undue influence” of the MIC in his farewell address to the nation(1960). It’s time to cut out the phony lie-based wars and upgrade not only American infrastructure but also the system of military subcontracting that relies on the lies that fuel American wars of aggression. longlance Don’t Europeans get about 6 weeks paid vacation every year? They are really “suffering”. Ray Shelton One question for Justin… You said, and I quote, ” …isn’t it a bit unseemly for an American President-elect to endorse a candidate for office in a foreign country? It surely would be in bad taste if the situation were reversed.” How come you didn’t find it in bad taste when Putin went out of his way to endorse Trump? I used to admire your insightfulness and have been reading your articles for years with great interest. But this time around, the way you have downplayed Trump’s cluelessness about foreign affairs (abundantly displayed during his campaign), while giving him credit for being so wise on foreign policy, boggles the mind. This guy didn’t even know the difference between the Kurds and the Kuds Force, for cryin out loud! And here you are deifying him before he’s even started. To me it looks like Trump is just flying by the seat of his pants. I will be happy if he succeeds in doing even 10% of the things he talks about. But, unlike you, I prefer to wait until he DEMONSTRATES some foreign policy smarts before putting a halo around his head. Remember, governing is a lot different from campaigning…as any experienced leader will tell you. TheVavil There would be a collective sigh of relief in a large proportion of the population in Europe if the U.S. left NATO and would just stop interfering in our regional politics. Take all your intelligence assets in our press and governments and just fuck off. Europe has been effectively bullied into this ridiculous situation with our neighbours on the continent, precisely because your government is filled with warmongering lunatics and our governments are filled with sniveling idiots who only ask of the US president “how high”. If NATO died it would be a good day for everyone in Europe and the US. The idea that Europeans are freeloading, are being defended by the glorious US against the threat of… the threat of what exactly? A made up threat, manufactured by Washington and it’s poodles in Europe. The reason some NATO member states are not “paying their fair share” is because they see no reason to, there is no threat from Russia to us in Europe. There is a threat to us from US intervention in Europe. For too long there has been a general consensus to “just let them get on with it, let them piss away their money if they want to pretend they are saving western democracy from those pesky Ruskies.” Now the stakes are being raised because someone, or a group of people in the US really, really want a war with Russia, before they die. They don’t like being told they are making foreign policy mistakes. They don’t like being told no. They are not fulfilling their obligations to their foreign paymasters, you know the ones that blew up the Towers, the ones that support ISIS. So please. please, leave NATO, let it die. All it would take is for the US to leave and the whole shitty mess would collapse. Lets call for a proper coalition of the willing and wipe ISIS from the face of the Earth, then maybe we can all turn and look to the Gulf with open eyes. Bianca Yes, but keep in mind that those sniveling idiots are elected by the very same Europeans that have been fully aware that those elites were sniveling while keeping power, screwing their own population, while feeding them garbage information all along. And most actually until today, many still believe their MSM narratives. All Europeans — there are honorable exceptions — from the beginning of the lunacy, post -cold war drunken ball of butchering Yugoslavia — believed the crap. They believed that Serbs, who were butchered in Croatia — were evil, and the head–chopping Bosnian Moslems were victims, and the upstanding Albanian crime gangs — freedom loving democrats. Well, nothing has been solved yet, and the region in controlled chaos. Kosovo as crazy as ever, while NATO from the day of “liberation” of Kosovo, has been paying for guarding Christian monasteries and churches, just the most significant ones — 24/7/365 for years. I would like to see Trump’s face when he sees the bill. And this is in the country that US “liberated”, then gave it independence contrary to UN Resolution 1244, and has defended all its criminality ever since, including paying for a military base there, and God knows how much for annually to prop up the failed state. And the crap never ends, as ISIS has moved into the region like a virus, and spread in Kosovo and Bosnia. Never mind their fancy local names — their cult logic and their Wahhabi sponsors, is what identifies them. This is just one European example. The same with Ukraine. What prompted former German Foreign Minister to show up on the platform on Maidan, to urge the mobs on. What on earth was he, and a large bunch of other European morons doing there? Just because the elected president objected to the terms of European deal — he had to go? And by armed thugs, Europe along with US, sponsored and armed? I know, you can say that there is precious little people can do in the face of EU machine, and NATO machine. And it is TRUE, that starting with Clinton administration — the pressure on Europe has been to follow US orders. And, yes, it is true that European populace is figuring this out — that as great as EU idea may sound on paper, it has become a tool for control of European governments, and that voters have zero decision making control. And even less control over ACCOUNTABILITY of those bureaucrats. While you are justified to be angry with US policies, it is important to remember that European public was part and parcel of allowing its elites to slavishly follow. This may end. Partially because European populace is waking, and partially because these kinds of statements coming from Trump — are rich indeed. US just changes its policy, and the sniveling followers will have to fend for themselves. MvGuy Nice stuff Bianca… You sure got their number… Sure wish someone would tell us taxpayers, How did Afghanistan becum NATO’s whipping boy for the nine 11 op, in which Saudi supplied the pilots AND the financing.. What did Afghanistan supply that Sarasota didn’t…. See madcowprod.com Yeah…. the Euros are an easy mark for those quid pro quo $$$$$$ from Washington… Probaby cleverly arrange by our would’hv been Secretary of State under the almost Clinton Presidency: Victoria Nuland. One more notch on her gun. TheVavil I cannot disagree with a word you have written. I came here (Antiwar.com) in the 90’s looking for some decent info on what was happening in the Balkans, the curtain began to be pulled back for me at that moment. I, honestly do hope that some change is coming. bob balkas Serbia captured by aug ’90 about 27% of croatia without a shot being fired or one serb killed in croatia. About 70% of bosnia was taken without much resistance by panserbs in just a few weeks; while killing some islamists and catholics and expelling about 1mn bosnians. Whole of kosovo was also taken in just one day in ’89. Jonathan Gress It is difficult to determine how much European politicians are free riding off American defense precisely because the US has committed to defending Europe, giving Europe no incentive to provide for its own defense, whether or not Russia is a genuine threat. The US should leave NATO and let Europe fend for itself. Then European leaders will have to be honest and if they really believe they need to defend themselves against Russia, they will have to divert resources from their generous welfare states. Alternatively, maybe they will admit that Russia was never really a threat and will continue to spend the bulk of their tax revenues on welfare rather than defense. Unhiddenness a private Disqus account fuck off Jonathan Gress What? Hank “Iraq should not have been attacked in the first place, all right? It was one of the worst decisions, possibly the worst decision ever made in the history of our country.” “Worst decisions”? What decision? The attack on Iraq was going to happen regardless of the facts and anyone who thinks or speaks otherwise is either trying to cement phony history or is clueless! There was NO reason to attack Iraq and it was obvious to ANYONE who did honest research without “cherry-picking” intelligence for the case to attack! Decision? It was cold calculated mass murder for the benefit of Israel and all those who were responsible should have been tried for war crimes years ago! El Degüello “Oh, the poor babies! Perhaps they need to find a safe space in which to park themselves for the next four-to-eight years.” Somebody please send these whiners a case of diaper pins. bob balkas Underrated, overmaligned, overfeared, overhated, undermined Trump gonna be a very busy man. Working 12 hours a day, there will be no time for golf or talking to press/media. Can you believe that? A president fearless of media, congress, Merkel but careless about Montenegro, Moldava, Mauritania, Mozambique… Mork I only hope he shows a thicker skin when dealing in foreign policy then he has when people Stateside criticize him and he feels the need to take to Twitter in order to complain. This particular arena is the only one where I’ll give Trump any credence whatsoever, foreign policy re: NATO, and about funding questionable groups in the ME. And don’t forget Eisenhower was only able to warn us about the impending MIC because he nurtured it in its nascent years. How many regime changes did the CIA at least try to pull off from ’52 through ’60? Sarastro92 So far so good. But in confirmation hearings his cabinet often repudiated Trump’s policy suggestions… Hetro Amidst the TDS (Justin’s trump derangement syndrome) from a) the Neocon Establishment and b) the Hysterical Left, is how Trump has changed (matured?) since the campaign. Is decent leadership, to some extent, emerging? At least there is this chance versus blanket demonizing. We will have to see if his plutocracy is better or worse than the previous just ousted. terrytheboxer Dont worry , trump has surrounded himself with THE BEST PEOPLE!!! When President-elect Donald J. Trump offered Rick Perry the job of energy secretary five weeks ago, Mr. Perry gladly accepted, believing he was taking on a role as a global ambassador for the American oil and gas industry that he had long championed in his home state. In the days after, Mr. Perry, the former Texas governor, discovered that he would be no such thing — that in fact, if confirmed by the Senate, he would become the steward of a vast national security complex he knew almost nothing about, caring for the most fearsome weapons on the planet, the United States’ nuclear arsenal. Two-thirds of the agency’s annual $30 billion budget is devoted to maintaining, refurbishing and keeping safe the nation’s nuclear stockpile; thwarting nuclear proliferation; cleaning up and rebuilding an aging constellation of nuclear production facilities; and overseeing national laboratories that are considered the crown jewels of government science. “If you asked him on that first day he said yes, he would have said, ‘I want to be an advocate for energy,’” said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised Mr. Perry’s 2016 presidential campaign and worked on the Trump transition’s Energy Department team in its early days. “If you asked him now, he’d say, ‘I’m serious about the challenges facing the nuclear complex.’ It’s been a learning curve.” Mr. Perry, who once called for the elimination of the Energy Department, will begin the confirmation process Thursday with a hearing before the Senate Energy Committee. If approved by the Senate, he will take over from a secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, who was chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology physics department and directed the linear accelerator at M.I.T.’s Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Before Mr. Moniz, the job belonged to Steven Chu, a physicist who won a Nobel Prize. PhantomPlanet That the deep state would act with such desperation is not surprising — their fortunes are tied to a permanent state of war or preparations for war. But I am constantly appalled by my colleagues’ hysterical Russia-Trump-baiting (I work at a university). These are people who see themselves as smart, “high information” voters, and yet they zealously regurgitate every Orwellian piece of claptrap that the MSM throws at them. Their hatred and fear of Trump is so great, they have made themselves into the crudest sort of McCarthyite caricatures, who seem to prefer the prospect of WWIII over a President Trump. Mark Thomason “constantly appalled by my colleagues’ hysterical Russia-Trump-baiting” They really believed they had it in the bag, a 95% chance of winning. The shock was profound. They also believed their own campaign talk, of Trump as monster so Hillary is automatically lesser evil and the only choice. The combination has produced as especially virulent case of the Stages of Grief. Denial = illegitimate, popular vote count. Anger = Russia is coming and he’s insane. Bargaining = recounts, re-running the election, lobbying the Electoral College, and now impeachment We are a long way from the end of that process, but it will end more quickly once Trump is in office and outrage porn is howling at the moon rather than lobbying the current Administration to do something last minute. TerryTheBoxer Oh yeah, Trump is really sticking it to the MIC! What with the coming increase in military spending https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=trump+military+budget …and then there’s this… Donald Trump plans on displaying the United States military’s strength when he becomes president by having troops march in parades. “Being a great president has to do with a lot of things, but one of them is being a great cheerleader for the country,” Trump told the Washington Post in an interview published Wednesday morning. “And we’re going to show the people as we build up our military, we’re going to display our military.” “That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we’re going to be showing our military,” he continued. Trump made the comments while talking about his campaign and its slogan, “Make America Great Again.” He revealed an option for a slogan for his 2020 re-election campaign to the Washington Post. Mark Thomason Yes. All exactly as I see it. In addition, enraging those foreigners could be a first step to changing from the mistakes of the neocons and liberal interventionists of W and Hillary. Germany has reduced its Army to one division, and that one has no spare parts or training funds, its vehicles being largely unserviceable. Germany’s air force is no better. The UK is little better, nor is France. The rest of NATO never had much anyway. The US liked being dominant, confident it could do it alone. Those countries found that good enough, if not ideal. They don’t want to hear the truth, not in the US DC Bubble, and not in the EU. Personally, I think US engagement in NATO helps ensure no European wars are possible among NATO powers, who in the recent past have behaved with frank insanity. I think it also helps keep unity in other matters, in the same way the UN was *meant to* encourage cooperation. I don’t think picking fights with Russia or expanding NATO serves those purposes, but having it at all is still useful in the old way of “keeping the US in, Russia out, and Germany down.” Pingback: Trump the Disruptor | IowaDawg's Very Own Blawg() comrade hermit Here we go again.

The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. “I don’t rule out a future underwater search by any stretch,” Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester told reporters in Melbourne, a day after Australia, Malaysia and China officially called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean. The search cost around A$200 million ($150 million), mostly paid by Malaysia, and has already been extended twice. But the three countries involved have been reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane’s final resting place. A recommendation from investigators last month to look to the north of the 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq mile) area that has been the focus of search efforts was rejected by Australia and Malaysia as too imprecise. Chester said cost had not been the determining factor to halt the search, but he said restarting it would require “credible new information which leads to a specific location”. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Wednesday expressed “deep regret” that the plane had not been found, but reaffirmed the agreement between Malaysia, Australia and China to stop looking. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. NO CLUES Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometres out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which led the hunt for the plane, said authorities are confident it is not in the area that has been searched. ATSB chief commissioner Greg Hood said “residual search activity,” including satellite and drift analysis would continue until the end of February. But quitting the underwater search drew a swift and angry reaction from relatives of those on board, who had called for the project to be expanded. In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended. There was also anger on social media at the news. “Didn’t they say they would never end the search? What the hell happened?” wrote one user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. © Thomson Reuters 2017 Leave a comment Click here to cancel reply.

Trump has offered views on U.S. relations with Asia that could indicate radical shifts in long-standing policy toward the region. From opposing free trade agreements to confronting China and questioning Japan-South Korea alliances, he appears set to be charting a course far different from previous administrations.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill, and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports while campaigning, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump also made his first trip to Washington in weeks on Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump flew in for a black-tie dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The Chairman's Global Dinner drew nearly 150 diplomats and ambassadors, well-heeled donors, soon-to-be White House staffers and Cabinet picks. "We have great respect for your countries. We have great respect for our world," Trump told the group after he was introduced by Pence, who assured that the future president was willing to engage with the world, despite his "America First" mantra. "I'm not sure that the national media here in America completely understands the president-elect. I can assure you that the world will," Pence said, adding that Trump "will be a president who puts America first, but we will work every day with nations around the world to advance the peace and prosperity of our allies and our friends across the world." The president-elect is expected to return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he'll offer "insurance for everybody." Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide "universal access." European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana made his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening. --- Associated Press writers Julie Pace and Jill Colvin in Washington and Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report.

EN BM 中文 தமிழ் News Videos VOX Sign in Expiry date: Renew subscription Edit profile Sign out Subscribe Advertise Latest Kini Roundup KiniGuide Malaysians Kini Yoursay Opinions Letters Kini Lens Popular Tags Australia says suspended MH370 search could resume in future mh370 comments     Tom Westbrook, Reuters     Published 2017-01-18 11:09:00     Updated 2017-01-18 12:20:10 Tom Westbrook, Reuters More The Australian government said today it was not ruling out a future underwater search for a missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet as families of those on board criticized the decision to suspend the hunt after three fruitless years. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. "I don't rule out a future underwater search by any stretch," Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester told reporters in Melbourne, a day after Australia, Malaysia and China officially called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean. The search cost around A$200 million (US$150 million), mostly paid by Malaysia, and has already been extended twice. But the three countries involved have been reluctant to keep looking without new evidence about the plane's final resting place. A recommendation from investigators last month to look to the north of the 120,000 sq km area that has been the focus of search efforts was rejected by Australia and Malaysia as too imprecise. Chester said cost had not been the determining factor to halt the search, but he said restarting it would require "credible new information which leads to a specific location". Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull today expressed "deep regret" that the plane had not been found, but reaffirmed the agreement between Malaysia, Australia and China to stop looking. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment. No clues Flight MH370 lost contact over the Gulf of Thailand in the early hours of March 8, 2014. Subsequent analysis of radar and satellite contacts suggested someone on board may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of kilometres out over the Indian Ocean. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which led the hunt for the plane, said authorities are confident it is not in the area that has been searched. ATSB chief commissioner Greg Hood said "residual search activity," including satellite and drift analysis would continue until the end of February. But quitting the underwater search drew a swift and angry reaction from relatives of those on board, who had called for the project to be expanded. In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt "disappointed, helpless and angry" because the search had been ended. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. - Reuters For more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: Subscribe now mh370 Most Read Most Read Most Commented VOX KINI Related Reports mh370 'Underwater search' for MH370 suspended 2017-01-17 14:25:00 Investigators recommend extending search for missing MH370 2016-12-20 10:32:00 Investigators begin final sweep of MH370 search area 2016-12-14 17:44:00 Chinese families lose appeal to stay court proceedings in MH370 lawsuit 2016-12-09 16:02:00 Frustrated relatives scour Madagascar beach for MH370 clues 2016-12-09 08:52:00 Mkini Dotcom Sdn.

But quitting the underwater search drew a swift and angry reaction from relatives of those on board, who had called for the hunt to be expanded. Most of the passengers were from China. About 30 relatives of victims gathered at a monthly meeting with Malaysian Airlines officials in Beijing on Wednesday to protest against the end of the search. Relatives told Reuters the airline invited four representatives to go to Malaysia and discuss the decision but they had rejected the offer. Dan Shuqin, 63, whose sister was on the flight, said authorities had been "playing tricks" for three years. "Can four family members speak for all 140 family members?" she asked. Instead, the relatives called for Malaysian authorities to hold a meeting with the families in China. An airline spokeswoman said its Post Accident Office was in constant contact with family members, but did not give any further details. On Tuesday, Jiang Hui, whose mother was on board the flight, told Reuters he felt "disappointed, helpless and angry" because the search had been ended. There was also anger on social media at the news. "Didn't they say they would never end the search? What the hell happened?" wrote one user on China's Weibo service. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane.

Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether the plane was hijacked and whether it was under the control of anyone when it finally ran out of fuel. The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which led the hunt, said authorities were confident it was not in the area that has been searched. ATSB chief commissioner Greg Hood said "residual search activity", including satellite and drift analysis would continue until the end of February. But quitting the underwater search drew a swift and angry reaction from relatives of those on board, who had called for the hunt to be expanded. Most of the passengers were from China. About 30 relatives of victims gathered at a monthly meeting with Malaysian Airlines officials in Beijing on Wednesday to protest against the end of the search. Relatives told Reuters the airline invited four representatives to go to Malaysia and discuss the decision but they had rejected the offer. Dan Shuqin, 63, whose sister was on the flight, said authorities had been "playing tricks" for three years. "Can four family members speak for all 140 family members?" she asked. Instead, the relatives called for Malaysian authorities to hold a meeting with the families in China. An airline spokeswoman said its Post Accident Office was in constant contact with family members, but did not give any further details. On Tuesday, Jiang Hui, whose mother was on board the flight, told Reuters he felt "disappointed, helpless and angry" because the search had been ended. There was also anger on social media at the news. "Didn't they say they would never end the search? What the hell happened?" wrote one user on China's Weibo service. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane.

(Reuters) - Boeing Co.’s chief executive said on Tuesday that he and President-elect Donald Trump “made progress” on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft, and suggesting a deal could be struck soon. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg’s visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump’s efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors. It also showed Boeing’s adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy. Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled. Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established. Trump also last month asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company to price a contract for Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the “excellent conversation” with Trump could lead to a deal “in the very near term.” “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. “That’s going to lead to substantial cost reductions.” On fighter jets, he said, “we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably.” Muilenburg praised Trump’s approach to negotiations. “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business,” he said, noting that as the U.S.’s top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. “If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest,” he said. “We’re proud to take on that mission, and I think Mr Trump’s engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country.” “I appreciate the teamwork approach on this – I think it’s the right way to do business.” Boeing’s stock was down 0.6 percent at $157.87 in afternoon trading.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo byJabin Botsford Jabin Botsford, The Washington Post .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... NEW YORK – Exactly one week after becoming president-elect, Donald Trump stepped outside his namesake fortress here for the first time. He ventured just five blocks, to dinner at the 21 Club – a dark-mahogany-and-red-leather-banquette throwback, where model airplanes and sports memorabilia hang from the ceiling, and jackets are de rigueur for men. The vintage haunt, where Trump dined with family members, feels like home. The waiters know his preferred table (No. 14, which Frank Sinatra and Richard M. Nixon also used) and his regular order (the $36 burger, well done, with fries). So it has been for the president-elect, who has retreated to one comfortable, familiar refuge after another – his soaring Manhattan tower, his white leather-upholstered Boeing jet, his lush golf courses, his opulent beachside castle. Advertisement Continue reading Trump is a man isolated, increasingly cocooned away from the voters who lifted him to his seemingly improbable victory. He favors his own people and his own places, creating the veneer of accessibility – his tweets reach millions, and he still answers his cellphone – while placing himself in almost entirely habitual settings. He spends most of his days in Trump Tower, with few close friends and few meaningful one-on-one interactions beyond the family members, advisers and loyalists who are whisked by gold-colored elevator to his 26th-floor office for private audiences. Trump rarely leaves, not even for a breath of fresh air; nor does he encounter many people he does not already know or who do not work for him. Yet Trump remains omnipresent in American life, constantly communicating with the public via Twitter and media interviews without the varnish of news releases or the protection of handlers. Whether it is Meryl Streep’s remarks about him or the question of Russian hacking, no topic is too mundane or charged for him to lend his voice to it. And he answers his personal cellphone, something that acquaintances and colleagues speak of in almost reverential terms. As he prepares to enter the White House, Trump is resisting his advisers’ efforts to take away his cellphone or at least restrict his use of it, said one person close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of private conversations. They worry about national security; he worries about losing touch. When Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) needs to reach Trump, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman does not have to go through an aide or schedule a meeting. He said he simply dials Trump’s cellphone directly, and the president-elect answers, even though Corker’s number registers as “No Caller ID.” “I’ve never seen anything relative to access like this. Unbelievable,” Corker told reporters recently. “I don’t think there’s likely been a White House like this, maybe ever, but certainly in modern history.” In many ways, Trump seems most comfortable communicating at a slight remove, with a stage or a screen – television, Twitter, phone – serving as the intermediary between him and the public. Such tools are both his megaphone and his shield, allowing him to blast out a message undiluted with little risk. “He sees the power of mass communication, which goes through screens, and he recognizes its importance,” said Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and the chief executive of the website Newsmax Media. “He’s clearly studied the art of it and developed an online and TV persona that’s very powerful. If you look, he’s very much impressed by people who are on TV or come across well on TV, because he thinks it’s such critical marketing.” Advertisement Continue reading Trump has shunned some of the traditional photo ops that his predecessors have orchestrated to demonstrate compassion and forge a connection with everyday Americans. He spent Veterans Day in November not laying a wreath at a memorial site, as President-elect Barack Obama did in 2008 to pay tribute to fallen soldiers, but staying inside Trump Tower (even though New York’s historic parade was marching right outside along Fifth Avenue). On Thanksgiving and Christmas, he celebrated in private with family members and friends, making no public appearances at military bases or homeless shelters or soup kitchens. “A lot of what you see by previous presidents are platitudes: ‘I’m going to go and pretend I’m supportive of a particular entity and serve food at a soup kitchen,’ ” said Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager of Trump’s. “Donald Trump wants to bring jobs back so we don’t have soup kitchens. He has not been a person to do staged events for the sake of doing staged events.” Trump’s duality – his wariness of those not in his trusted orbit, yet his insatiable desire for constant contact and feedback – has posed challenges for his advisers and could ultimately leave him detached from everyday voters. He does not use email and rarely surfs the Internet, meaning that telephone calls, television appearances or physical proximity are the best ways to reach him. As his three successive campaign managers quickly learned, whoever controls the flow of information to Trump controls the man – at least as much as he can be contained. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who was a trusted campaign adviser to Trump, said he expects the new president’s relationship with Congress to be a mix of salesmanship and accessibility. “Trump will be a larger figure who’s more aloof and more distant but whose weight and effectiveness is so great he will clearly be a dominating figure,” Gingrich said. “He’ll bounce back and forth between the two worlds. When he comes into the congressional world, he’ll be very effective on the personal level.” But, Gingrich added, “On another level he’ll be very distant, and you’ll see him by tweet and you’ll see him on ‘Fox and Friends.’ “ Advertisement Continue reading Trump’s distance, friends say, stems in part from a certain insularity, with the developer turned politician preferring his own properties, stocked with his own people. Ruddy, who is a member of the private Mar-a-Lago club and whose Newsmax is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., said he has lived in the area for two decades, yet he can count on one hand the number of times he has seen Trump outside of his private Florida retreats. “He’s an old-shoe type of guy – he likes to be in his comfort zone, which are his golf clubs and his homes,” Ruddy said. “He likes people he’s comfortable with and likes, and if he doesn’t feel comfortable around you, he’s not going to be inviting you around.” Trump has gone out to eat only a few times since the election – twice to the 21 Club and once to Jean Georges at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, where the president-elect dined on frog legs and prime sirloin with adversary-turned-job-applicant Mitt Romney. For Trump, like President Obama, the links – whether at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J., or Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., near his beloved Mar-a-Lago – are personal sanctuaries. In either place, he is most at ease. He wears boxy “Make America Great Again” caps and open-collar shirts, unwinding with friends over rounds in the morning and then retreating to the clubhouses for casual lunches. “He’s always playing golf courses that bear his name,” sportswriter Michael Bamberger said. “The golf cart has his name on it. The water bottle has his name on it. If the course is crowded, groups will move to the side for him. . . . When he gets to the dining room, the waitress is right there. Membership has its privileges, but ownership has a lot more privileges.” Bamberger, who has closely studied Trump’s golf habits for years, said the president-elect is deeply knowledgeable about the sport and plays it well. And he uses his time at the golf course to forge bonds and size people up. “He’s a very social creature, a gregarious creature, and golf gives him an opportunity to do that,” he said. One of Trump’s preferred methods of charming, however, is the telephone, which he uses to receive advice and pepper his callers with questions well into the night. Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Trump, likened him to a mix of former presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (with his ability to woo and cajole) and Nixon (with his late-night tendencies). Advertisement Continue reading “He is like LBJ,” Stone said. “He loves the telephone. He loves calling people. He really does have a very good manner with people. He can be very likable on the phone.” As Trump hurries to solidify his Cabinet, he has been known to call his nominees unprompted just to check in, asking which senators he ought to lobby to help them win confirmation. “Who do you need me to call? Who do I need to call?” Trump asked one nominee, according to someone familiar with the conversation. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s choice for secretary of state, cited his prospective boss’s almost constant availability during his Senate confirmation hearing when asked how he would handle an impromptu Trump tweet that undermines his own diplomatic efforts. “I have his cellphone number,” the former ExxonMobil chief said. “And he’s promised me he’ll answer.” “And,” added Tillerson, “he does.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Trump might take national victory tour – Nov 13, 2016 Amid signs of transition trouble, Trump huddles with Pence – Nov 15, 2016 A brand boost?

X Underwater search for flight MH370 called off Countries end nearly three-year search for Malaysia Airlines jet carrying 239 people Tue, Jan 17, 2017, 18:07 An officer on an Australian air force P-3 Orion during the search for flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean. Photograph: Rob Griffith/AP         The deep-sea search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 ended on Tuesday without any trace being found of the plane that vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board, the three countries involved in the search said. The location of flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the airline, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. “Despite every effort using the best science available ... the search has not been able to locate the aircraft,” Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. “The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.” The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday after scouring the 120,000sq km area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the $145 million search if the aircraft was not found or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators’ recommendation to shift the search further north, saying no new evidence had emerged to support that. Since the crash there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked, or whether all aboard perished and the aircraft was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the aircraft’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. Inescapable duty A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement that investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. “In our view extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” Voice 370 said. ADVERTISEMENT Most of the passengers were from China. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been “thorough and comprehensive”, and it “stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search”. “MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light, and the aircraft would eventually be located,” it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on the aircraft, said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000sq km. “If money is a concern, prioritise within this area,” she said. Helpless and angry In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended “purely due to a funding shortage”. “The 370 incident is the most important thing in my life,” he said, referring to the flight number. The only confirmed traces of the aircraft have been three pieces of debris washed up on the island country of Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the aircraft. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro, has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American. – Reuters       Topics: Malaysia Airlines Australia Beijing China Kuala Lumpur Malaysia Mauritius Mozambique Reunion South Africa Tanzania Read More Serbia wants to annex part of Kosovo, president claims Ukraine urges Donald Trump to maintain tough line on Russia Theresa May to signal hard Brexit in keynote speech Istanbul nightclub attack suspect ‘has been captured’ UK exit from customs union threatens return of Border Trump plans to replace Obamacare with ‘insurance for everybody’ Trump considers removing press corps from the White House The value in Theresa May’s narrow vision and plodding virtues Hillary Clinton to suffer peculiar torture at Trump inauguration Gambians flee to Senegal fearing war over Barrow inauguration Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times US Donald Trump tells Theresa May he is ‘100% behind Nato’ Opinion Why Trump needs to hit the brakes on his trade plans Golf Tiger Woods’ comeback ends in a missed cut at Torrey Pines Politics Ireland encouraged to recognise state of Palestine ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest World Pence fires up anti-abortion activists in Washington march 23:37 Trump signs executive order implemeting ‘extreme vetting’ 22:41 Donald Trump tells Theresa May he is ‘100% behind Nato’ 20:46 Gambian man’s drowning in Venetian canal prompts questions 19:49 Close to 1,000 migrants rescued from leaky vessels in Mediterranean 19:48 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in News 1 Catholic priest from Co Clare marries long-time boyfriend 2 Driver with 483 convictions gets 18 months for killing teenager 3 French election to be showdown between Macron and Le Pen 4 My life on the Luggala Estate: ‘A slight otherwhere’ 5 Donald Trump tells Theresa May he is ‘100% behind Nato’ Never miss a story.

We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.” More About: Trump and Manufacturing Mark Wilson, Hulton Archive, Getty Images Advertisement Boeing Co. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he “made some great progress” in face-to-face talks with Donald Trump on the president-elect’s demand to hold down costs on the next-generation version of Air Force One. In addition to Boeing’s contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced fighter jet. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.” Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” although no specific reductions have yet been announced. Popular Now Apple and the Battle for American Manufacturing Trump Announces Manufacturing Jobs Initiative Does Your Company Standardize with Purpose? “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business,” Muilenburg said after their meeting Tuesday. “We’re on the same page here.” Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, its CEO touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest U.S. exporter supports: “You want manufacturing jobs — aerospace is the place to invest. We’re proud to take on that mission.” Trump’s public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens,” Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.” More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn’t the only defense contractor that’s felt the fury of Trump’s tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for “out of control costs” on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for more than 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered Jan. 11. Trump also called on Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet,” referring to the company’s F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. For more news, notes and analysis about how President-elect Donald Trump and his administration could affect manufacturing, stay right here on IW.com and check out the IW Daily Newsletter, too, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning After the president-elect’s criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs “significantly” on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems Plc, a key subcontractor on the program. “Over a period there’s no question we’ve been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period,” Carr said in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday from Davos. “We respect that and we’ll work towards a contribution towards that.” At the time of Trump’s tweet about Air Force One, it wasn’t immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer said in an interview that the president-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, “he’s heard these big numbers,” Frank Kendall said in an interview. “Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They’re not contract values, necessarily. “The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion — the 747s we’re buying — so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means. We’re still negotiating with Boeing on that.” Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. “His general interest in reducing costs is terrific — his focus on that is good,” Kendall said. “But there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specific.” By Tony Capaccio, Toluse Olorunnipa and Julie Johnsson, with assistance from Kevin Cirilli and Benjamin Katz.

And once they ask for a price reduction, most of us put on our cost reduction hats and find a way to give it to them while maintaining margins.

By Richard Tomkins   |   Jan. 12, 2017 at 12:13 PM Follow @upi Comments PATUXENT, Md., Jan. 12 (UPI) -- The U.S. Navy has accepted its 50th P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance and anti-submarine aircraft from Boeing. The plane, which will be part of an eventual fleet of 117 Poseidon aircraft, was delivered at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Fla., earlier this month, U.S. Naval Air Systems Command reported. "I'd like to formally thank the team, including PMA-290, Boeing and our entire P-8A industry team, as we deliver the 50th P-8A Poseidon early and under budget," said Capt. Tony Rossi, the Navy's program manager for Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft. "This milestone demonstrates outstanding work ethic, professionalism and dedication to the fleet. "The P-8A is special. This is the first time a Navy combat aircraft was built from the ground up on a commercial production line. We've leveraged commercial expertise and experience, and a highly reliable airframe, the 737, which has reduced production time and overall production costs." The P-8A Poseidon is replacing the Navy's aging P-3 Orion. It features an electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turret and increased acoustic processing capability with 64 passive sonobuoys, 32 multi-static sonobuoys and concurrent passive and active processing.

REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo The deep-sea search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 ended on Tuesday without any trace being found of the plane that vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board, the three countries involved in the search said. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. “Despite every effort using the best science available … the search has not been able to locate the aircraft,” Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. “The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.” The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 120,000-sq-km (46,000-sq-mile) area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the $145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked.  Australia last month dismissed an investigators’ recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that.  Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked – or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water.  Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. “In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” Voice 370 said.  Most of the passengers were from China. TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. <a href='http://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a165bcc8&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'> <img src='http://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=20&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a165bcc8' border='0' alt='' /> </a> <a href='http://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af6a1a93&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'> <img src='http://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=21&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=af6a1a93' border='0' alt='' /> </a> Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been “thorough and comprehensive” and it “stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search”. “MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located,” it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing.  Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. “If money is a concern, prioritise within this area,” Nathan said.  In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended “purely due to a funding shortage”. “The 370 incident is the most important thing in my life,” he said, referring to the flight number. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania.  As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American.

Trump first criticized the presidential aircraft program on his Twitter feed Dec. 6 for costs “out of control, more than $4 billion and called for the cancellation of the contract to build two new 747-8 airplanes. The meeting also covered Boeing’s efforts to use commercial best practices in military aircraft programs through “streamlining the process (and) streamlining certification, Muilenberg said in remarks to the pool at Trump Tower aired on CNBC. “All that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost. I’m pleased with the progress there. Similarly on fighters, we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will… provide the best capability for our warfighters most affordably,” Muilenberg added. This meeting came four days after Trump met with Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson to discuss the F-35 fighter jet program’s costs. Trump said in a Dec. 22 Twitter post he asked Boeing to price out a comparable version of its F-18 Super Hornet combat plane to the F-35. Shares in Boeing were down $1.07 to $157.76 as of 1 p.m. Eastern time, while Lockheed’s stock was lower $0.38 to $254.15.

Trump last month blasted the proposed cost to replace the aging fleet of presidential aircraft. He met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg last month and again Tuesday in Trump Tower. Muilenerg said they were working to “to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features” and “all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost.” He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming, though he did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag.

The F-35B fighter jet undergoes flight testing from the amphibious assault ship America. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Samantha Masunaga and Aaron GreggContact Reporter For the second time in a few weeks, an aerospace giant emerged from a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump with news that the cost of a big-ticket program could be cut. It was the latest sign that defense contractors may have to play a new game when it comes to contract negotiations. On Friday, Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters the Bethesda-based defense giant is close to a new contract deal that would cut the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and also create jobs. The fifth-generation fighter jet has frequently been targeted by Trump, most recently in a new conference Wednesday, when the president-elect slammed the program for being “way, way behind schedule” and “many billions of dollars over budget.” "We had the opportunity to talk to [president-elect Trump] about the F-35 program and I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price," Hewson said. Her meeting followed a similar one with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in December, after which he told reporters that the company would build the next generation of Air Force One jets for less than $4 billion — a price tag Trump had slammed in a tweet earlier that month. Such meetings between executives and the president-elect could set a new precedent, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group. “It’s clearly his style,” he said. Hewson also said Lockheed Martin would create 1,800 new jobs related to the program in Fort Worth as part of the new contract deal. Lockheed Martin estimates the program accounts for 38,900 jobs in Texas, and the plane's supply chain touches 45 states. Lockheed shares climbed nearly 1% Friday on the news. In recent months, the president-elect has not been shy about taking to social media to criticize or heap praise on individual companies and military programs. A Dec. 6 tweet bashed Chicago-based Boeing for what he referred to as the "out of control" cost of the Air Force One presidential airplane. Weeks later he turned in Boeing's favor at the expense of Lockheed, tweeting that he had asked the company to "price out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet" because of the F-35's high costs. He also briefly brought up the F-35 in a Wednesday press conference intended to clarify his business conflicts, saying he would "do some big things" with the program and find a way to both trim costs and improve the plane itself. Voices on both sides of the political aisle have criticized the F-35 program's cost long before Trump took up the issue. The 15-year-old program has been beset by various delays and has never flown in combat. Each plane costs more than $100 million, though Lockheed and analysts expect the price will fall as the program matures and as more planes are built. “Regardless of how many you buy” of any weapons program, “the development costs are going to be about the same,” said Mark Gunzinger, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. “So you could spread it out over many, or you could spread it out over a few.” Still, Trump's pick for Defense secretary, James Mattis, told lawmakers the president-elect remains a supporter of program. "Many of our allies have bet their air superiority on the F-35 program, and it bonds us tightly together with them," he said during a hearing on his nomination last week. "The president-elect has talked about the cost of [the F-35] but he has in no way shown a lack of support for the program. He just wants the best bang for the buck." Masunaga is a Times staff writer. Gregg writes for the Washington Post.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      Boeing Co.'s chief executive said on Tuesday that he and President-elect Donald Trump "made progress" on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft, and suggesting a deal could be struck soon. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump's efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors. It also showed Boeing's adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy. Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled. Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established. Trump also last month asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company to price a contract for Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the "excellent conversation" with Trump could lead to a deal "in the very near term." "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices," Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. "That's going to lead to substantial cost reductions." On fighter jets, he said, "we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably." Muilenburg praised Trump's approach to negotiations. "I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business," he said, noting that as the U.S.' top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. "If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest," he said. "We're proud to take on that mission and I think Mr Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country." "I appreciate the teamwork approach on this - I think it's the right way to do business." Boeing's stock was down 0.6 percent at $157.87 in afternoon trade. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith 1/2 left right Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of The Boeing Company, arrives at Trump Tower in New York City, U.S. January 17, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith 2/2 By Alwyn Scott and Doina Chiacu Boeing Co's chief executive said on Tuesday that he and President-elect Donald Trump "made progress" on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft, and suggesting a deal could be struck soon. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump's efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors. It also showed Boeing's adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy. Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled. Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established. Trump also last month asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company to price a contract for Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the "excellent conversation" with Trump could lead to a deal "in the very near term." "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices," Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. "That's going to lead to substantial cost reductions." On fighter jets, he said, "we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably." Muilenburg praised Trump's approach to negotiations. "I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business," he said, noting that as the U.S.' top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. "If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest," he said. "We're proud to take on that mission and I think Mr Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country." "I appreciate the teamwork approach on this - I think it's the right way to do business." Boeing's stock was down 0.6 percent at $157.87 in afternoon trade.

Prosecutors will not pursue Bridgegate charges against New Jersey governor New Jersey prosecutors on Friday said they would not pursue criminal misconduct charges against Governor Chris Christie in connection with the "Bridgegate" scandal. Trump has 'friendly' call with Mexican leader but he demands change WASHINGTON The presidents of the United States and Mexico spoke by phone on Friday after relations between the neighboring countries frayed further over Donald Trump's border wall plan, with the U.S. leader calling the talk friendly but still demanding reworked trade and other ties.

Australia last month dismissed an investigators' recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that.Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked - or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean.A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. "In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China.TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate.Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been "thorough and comprehensive" and it "stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search". "MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located," it said.Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search.Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility.Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. "If money is a concern, prioritise within this area," Nathan said. In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt "disappointed, helpless and angry" because the search had been ended "purely due to a funding shortage"."The 370 incident is the most important thing in my life," he said, referring to the flight number.The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane.The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found.A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment.Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American.

(ATVI) Stock Looks to Rack Up Gains Trade of the Day: Oracle Corporation (ORCL) Stock on Cloud 9 Recent Posts: Dow Jones Industrial Average Continues the Climb Trade of the Day: Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock Building Up to More Gains Trade of the Day: Commercial Metals Company (CMC) Is on the Road to more Gains View All Posts Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) — On Nov. 10 I suggested the purchase of Boeing at $145 with a target of $175. On Dec. 13, it achieved $160 and, along with the market, is currently consolidating its gains. The consolidation pattern suggests that another breakout for this, the world’s largest manufacturer of commercial jets, is likely. And, as noted in my Nov. 10 Trade of the Day, BA stock is also the second largest maker of military weapons. Despite a supposed “dispute” with the new administration over the manufacture of Air Force One, things are still looking good for BA. Standard & Poor’s has raised their EPS estimate to $9.56 in 2017, up from $7.42 in 2016, noting that over the next several years, commercial aircraft demand is strong, with 787 and 737 production ramps. Cash returns to investors should rise due to stock repurchases and dividends. S&P’s 12-month target for BA is $172 based on 18X their 2018 EPS. Boeing’s trend is decidedly bullish, with “ramp-ups” from the low last January at $105 to its current consolidation. The stock, as noted on the chart, is in a consolidation channel from $155 to $160. A break from the resistance line at $160 should result in a 20-point run to $180 spurred on by new commercial and defense orders as well as further clarification of returns from the F-35 program. Moreover, BA pays a dividend of $5.68 for a dividend yield of 3.6%, which should attract those seeking long-term dividends from an investment-grade equity.

Cooper could have worked at Portland-area tech firm, scientists say Print Email Kale Williams | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Kale Williams | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 16, 2017 at 3:59 PM, updated January 16, 2017 at 4:05 PM comments "A lot of people think 'You'll never catch the guy,' but this is the closest we've been in a long time." A group of amateur scientists claim they may have narrowed the suspect pool in a case that has stymied the experts for decades. The infamous case of D.B. Cooper and the nation's only unsolved skyjacking has left investigators befuddled since a parachuted Cooper leapt from a Boeing 727 headed to Seattle from Portland on Nov. 24, 1971. But a team of "Citizen Sleuths" say that evidence they've uncovered could mean that Dan Cooper, the name used when the culprit bought his one-way ticket with cash, was in fact an employee of some sort of aerospace engineering firm. The crucial pieces of newly uncovered evidence: thousands of microscopic particles on a $3 clip-on necktie from JC Penney. "All of these particles are too small to be seen with the naked eye, but modern science can now track them to their source," the group wrote on their website. "These particles through their shape and composition can tell a story." If you are one of the few who are unfamiliar with the saga of D.B. Cooper, here's the short version: On that fateful day in 1971, a man calling himself Dan Cooper purchased a one-way ticket from Portland to Seattle on Northwest Orient Airlines. He hijacked the plane, demanded $200,000 in ransom money, and having received it during a stopover in Seattle, jumped from the aircraft wearing nothing but a business suit and a parachute somewhere over the forests of southwest Washington. He wasn't wearing a full suit, the amateur investigators claim. A clip-on tie remained on seat 18E, where Cooper was seated. "Of all the possible things for him to leave on the plane, the tie was incredibly fortunate for this investigation," the Citizen Sleuths wrote. Namely because a necktie is one of the few articles of clothing that rarely, if ever, gets washed. The accumulation of particles can paint a picture of where the tie has been and the person who was wearing it. "Each of those particles comes from something and somewhere and can tell a story if the proper instruments like electron microscopes are used," the group wrote. The particles in question -- Cerium, Strontium sulfide and pure titanium -- are of note because because of how rare they are, lead investigator Tom Kaye told King 5 News in Seattle. "These are what they call rare earth elements. They're used in very narrow fields, for very specific things," he said. Of particular interest was the pure titanium. The mineral was widely used in aircraft manufacturing in the early 1970s, but titanium used in airplanes was almost always mixed with other metals, which ruled out Boeing, the region's largest aerospace manufacturer. Beyond that, metalworkers rarely wear ties to work, so Cooper would've had to have been a manager or an engineer. Given the other particles present, Kaye said the tie was likely in a plant that manufactured cathode ray tubes, which are vacuum tubes often used in televisions, computers and radar screens. A look at the tie under blacklight. The circles represent areas where particles were taken from the tie.Courtesy/Citizen Sleuths  The advanced analysis of the particles was made possible after the Travel Channel's "Expedition Unknown" show became interested in the group's work. The show funded a more in-depth examination by McCrone Associates, which specializes in particle analysis and lead Kaye and his team to identify a two firms in the Portland area that fit the bill -- Teledyn and Tektronix. Without the official capacity of the FBI, no one is quick to turn over personnel records, however. That's where Kaye is hoping the public will step in. Given the information his team has uncovered, he's hoping that someone who worked in this type of manufacturing in the correct timeframe will come forward. "We've narrowed down the field of potential Cooper suspects from millions of people in the United States to a very narrow group of people," he said. "A lot of people think 'You'll never catch the guy,' but this is the closest we've been in a long time." If you think you've got a lead on who the culprit might be, Kaye asked that you get in touch. --   Kale Williams kwilliams@oregonian.com 503-294-4048 @sfkale What do Portland city employees make?

The F-35B fighter jet undergoes flight testing from the amphibious assault ship America. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Samantha Masunaga and Aaron GreggContact Reporter For the second time in a few weeks, an aerospace giant emerged from a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump with news that the cost of a big-ticket program could be cut. It was the latest sign that defense contractors may have to play a new game when it comes to contract negotiations. On Friday, Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters the Bethesda-based defense giant is close to a new contract deal that would cut the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and also create jobs. The fifth-generation fighter jet has frequently been targeted by Trump, most recently in a new conference Wednesday, when the president-elect slammed the program for being “way, way behind schedule” and “many billions of dollars over budget.” "We had the opportunity to talk to [president-elect Trump] about the F-35 program and I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price," Hewson said. Her meeting followed a similar one with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in December, after which he told reporters that the company would build the next generation of Air Force One jets for less than $4 billion — a price tag Trump had slammed in a tweet earlier that month. Such meetings between executives and the president-elect could set a new precedent, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group. “It’s clearly his style,” he said. Hewson also said Lockheed Martin would create 1,800 new jobs related to the program in Fort Worth as part of the new contract deal. Lockheed Martin estimates the program accounts for 38,900 jobs in Texas, and the plane's supply chain touches 45 states. Lockheed shares climbed nearly 1% Friday on the news. In recent months, the president-elect has not been shy about taking to social media to criticize or heap praise on individual companies and military programs. A Dec. 6 tweet bashed Chicago-based Boeing for what he referred to as the "out of control" cost of the Air Force One presidential airplane. Weeks later he turned in Boeing's favor at the expense of Lockheed, tweeting that he had asked the company to "price out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet" because of the F-35's high costs. He also briefly brought up the F-35 in a Wednesday press conference intended to clarify his business conflicts, saying he would "do some big things" with the program and find a way to both trim costs and improve the plane itself. Voices on both sides of the political aisle have criticized the F-35 program's cost long before Trump took up the issue. The 15-year-old program has been beset by various delays and has never flown in combat. Each plane costs more than $100 million, though Lockheed and analysts expect the price will fall as the program matures and as more planes are built. “Regardless of how many you buy” of any weapons program, “the development costs are going to be about the same,” said Mark Gunzinger, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. “So you could spread it out over many, or you could spread it out over a few.” Still, Trump's pick for Defense secretary, James Mattis, told lawmakers the president-elect remains a supporter of program. "Many of our allies have bet their air superiority on the F-35 program, and it bonds us tightly together with them," he said during a hearing on his nomination last week. "The president-elect has talked about the cost of [the F-35] but he has in no way shown a lack of support for the program. He just wants the best bang for the buck." Masunaga is a Times staff writer. Gregg writes for the Washington Post.

The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. "Despite every effort using the best science available ... the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. "The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness." The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 120,000-sq-km area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the US$145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators' recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked - or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. "In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China. Traces A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokesperson did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been "thorough and comprehensive" and it "stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search". "MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located," it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. "If money is a concern, prioritise within this area," Nathan said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American. - Reuters For more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: Subscribe now mh370 Most Read Most Read Most Commented VOX KINI Related Reports mh370 M'sia to hold tripartite meeting on MH370 search direction 2016-12-22 08:41:00 M'sia says decision on extending search fo MH370 yet to be decided 2016-12-20 15:49:00 Investigators recommend extending search for missing MH370 2016-12-20 10:32:00 Investigators begin final sweep of MH370 search area 2016-12-14 17:44:00 Last search boat for missing flight MH370 sets sail 2016-12-13 14:18:00 Mkini Dotcom Sdn.

That’s what happens.” (An addendum from Trump: “Under the border adjustment concept, if somebody is making a motorcycle or a plane in our country, they’re getting a credit for the plane they make before they send it over to wherever it’s going. And you don’t need that plus lower taxes and everything else. And it’s too complicated. They get credit on some parts and not other parts. Where was the part made? I don’t want that. I just want it nice and simple.”) Story Continued Below Border adjustment backers have hoped they could win over Trump, who campaigned against recent trade deals and has hinted at wanting import tariffs, with a plan meant to incentivize exports. Among Trump’s problems with the idea: He thinks the dollar, which would need to appreciate to ease the sting on retailers and other importers, is already too strong. That doesn’t, however, mean that House Republicans will back down — because it’s hard to replace that roughly $1.2 trillion that a border adjustment framework raises. "Unfortunately our current tax code is not only complex, it favors Chinese steel over American steel, Mexican beef and autos over American beef and autos, and foreign oil over American oil. It's time to tax imports and exports equally in America, and end the 'Made in America' tax,” House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said in response to Trump’s comments. WHERE ARE THE EXPORTERS? In addition to not hearing much from Trump, anyone who’s been closely watching the tax reform debate in recent months has heard an awful lot from the industries and companies that would lose under the House GOP’s border adjustment plan — retailers, the Koch brothers and lots of others who rely heavily on imports. What you haven’t heard, at least publicly, is much of anything at all from the potential winners, including big-time exporters like Boeing, Caterpillar and General Electric. (Pro Tax’s Brian Faler reported recently that large exporters might never pay taxes again under a border adjustment plan.) Interest groups and lobbyists are hearing that an exporter coalition supporting the House GOP’s destination-based cash-flow tax is in the works, though details are pretty sparse right now. To some on K Street, there’s still plenty of time to get a coalition up and running, and have an impact on the tax reform debate. Others fear it might be too late, given the criticism that Brady and supporters of border adjustability have absorbed. But why have those with so much to gain been so quiet up to now? For starters, it’s just natural that the likely losers would be making more of a public commotion, and big exporters and other would-be winners have let top tax writers and their staff quietly know how they feel on the issue. You also have to ask: how helpful would it be in this current populist climate for big-name corporations to loudly advocate for a policy that would be so helpful to their own bottom line? And finally, brand-name exporters are already in major business advocacy groups, but those organizations have a mix of companies that both support and oppose border adjustability. Boeing, Caterpillar and GE are all members of the Business Roundtable, but so are Walmart and Target. Those three corporate titans also have a presence on the National Association of Manufacturers’ board of directors — but so does Koch Companies. In any event, Brady didn’t sound too concerned, at least publicly, when asked about the supporters’ silence late last week. “Opponents always get out of the gates early. Supporters tend to come at a different pace,” Brady said, noting that he’d asked for constructive feedback from opponents and remained confident that people would come around on border adjustments. “We’re working with everybody at this point, pro and con.” Y'ALL COME: Things might look a bit bumpy for tax reform right now, but there’s also this from the WSJ: “Companies are increasingly exploring the economics of moving production to the U.S., as an overhaul of the U.S. tax code looms and President-elect Donald Trump calls out their peers for expanding abroad.” Companies mentioned include Fitbit and Taylor Guitars. AFTER THAT HOLIDAY WEEKEND, we’ve now arrived at the final Tuesday in the Obama presidency. It’s also 124 years since a Committee of Safety, comprised of business leaders and planters backed by the American government, deposed Queen Liliuokalani, the last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii. What’s happening out there? Email: bbecker@politico.com,teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, kodonnell@politico.com. Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @katyodonnell_ , @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax. ALSO OF NOTE: Trump, in a separate, rather broad interview with The Washington Post over the weekend, is sticking to a plan to get the corporate tax rate “as close to 15 percent as we can,” as Pro Tax’s Toby Eckert reports. Funnily enough, given his comments to the WSJ, Trump also said that he thought “we’re getting very close” on a tax measure. “It’ll probably be 15 to 20 percent for corporations. For individuals, probably lower. Great middle-class tax cuts,” he added. ** A message from Americans for Tax Reform: Obamacare imposes more than one trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000) in higher taxes on middle class families including taxes on Health Savings Accounts, taxes on families with high medical bills, taxes on medical innovation, and taxes on health insurance. True repeal of Obamacare means repealing ALL Obamacare taxes. ** BUT WAIT … : There’s no reason to stop there with the potential tax reform obstacles. Entitlement reform might be an under-the-radar hurdle for a tax overhaul, but POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports it might soon be front and center. House Republicans will have to pass a second budget in the coming months to get a crack at using reconciliation for tax reform. Rank-and-file Republicans just went along with a budget that didn’t balance in exchange for the opportunity to take down Obamacare. But those lawmakers, who by and large have backed Speaker Paul Ryan’s entitlement reforms in previous budgets, don’t sound like they’ll be so forgiving next time. They’re hoping Ryan can convince President-elect Donald Trump, who has called the House GOP efforts on entitlements “political suicide,” to get on board with big changes to Medicare. But as Rachael put it, if that issue is “left unresolved, it threatens to sink tax reform, a top priority for both men.” ALSO REMEMBER: How much time Republicans spend dealing with the Affordable Care Act will undoubtedly have an effect on their tax reform efforts. And recent developments suggest the GOP might face a slog on Obamacare — POLITICO's Burgess Everett and Jennifer Haberkorn reported over the weekend that Trump’s saying he wants “insurance for everybody” is pretty tough to reconcile with his own choice for Health and Human Services secretary, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who didn’t make universal coverage a goal of his legislation. Then there’s this, via CNN: “Price last year purchased shares in a medical device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics concerns.” INTERNATIONAL UPDATE ON SECOND THOUGHT: Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister and a well-known disciplinarian on fiscal issues, might be changing his tune on tax cuts, The Wall Street Journal reports. Schäuble said any tax cuts would have to come after September’s national election in Germany, assuming the Christian Democrats and Chancellor Angela Merkel are victorious, and would be for both businesses and individuals. The Journal called Schäuble’s comments a “stark shift in priorities,” but also noted that a host of other industrial countries have moved to cut their corporate tax in recent years and that governments might have more breathing room after moving to crack down on offshore tax gaming. STATE NEWS THE STATES AS A LABORATORY: If tax cuts have been the experiment, the results in states like Indiana, Kansas and Oklahoma haven’t been promising, the Associated Press reports. Comparing state budgets and the federal budget is far from apples-to-apples of course, but the AP notes that one common thread is policymakers often face forces beyond their control in both. “A recent Associated Press survey found that more than half of the states — 33 — are currently dealing with a budget shortfall or expect to confront one in the coming fiscal year. Experts say state economic growth has been slower than expected, with revenue in some places failing to meet projections or keep up with rising spending needs,” The AP added. A PICKLE FOR CUOMO: Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York is trying to cast himself as a national progressive figure while at the same time governing more as a centrist at home. That means that the looming expiration of a millionaires’ tax — almost 9 percent on household income over $2 million a year, or individual income in excess of $1 million — could cause the governor some political problems, the WSJ reported. So far, Cuomo has said he might be willing to continue the tax, but won’t commit either way. His next budget, expected Tuesday, could offer some clues, but there’s a reason state political analysts are saying things like: “The politics is that Andrew Cuomo wants to have his cake and eat it too, as we all do.” QUICK LINKS Poll: Most people still want to see Trump’s tax returns. AP: General Motors to announce $1 billion investment to keep or create 1,000 new jobs. Angela Merkel says she’ll fight for free trade, after Trump’s latest border tax comments. IMF foresees boost in U.S. economic growth after Trump victory. Financial Times editorial: House GOP tax reform plan deserves “serious consideration,” but other options are “simpler, less disruptive and less likely to start a trade war.” CNBC’s Larry Kudlow might be too free market on trade to be the chairman of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal and Chile pleads guilty to tax evasion, becoming the latest soccer star enmeshed in a tax mess. DID YOU KNOW? Akebono, born in Hawaii, was the first sumo wrestler not born in Japan to be awarded the sport’s highest rank — yokozuna. ** A message from Americans for Tax Reform: Obamacare includes nearly 20 new or higher taxes that hit middle class families, raise the cost of healthcare, and reduce access to care. The law imposes a tax on employer provided care, a tax on innovative medicines and other treatments, a tax for failing to buy government-mandated insurance, a new tax on health insurance, a tax on medical devices, taxes on Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts and even a tax hike on Americans facing high medical bills. In total, these taxes exceed one trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000) over a decade. The Obamacare repeal process is moving forward. Many members of Congress campaigned on lower taxes and reducing the federal government’s involvement in healthcare. They can fulfill both campaign promises by repealing all of Obamacare’s $1,000,000,000,000 in higher taxes. True repeal of Obamacare means repealing ALL Obamacare taxes. ** « View Archives Authors: Bernie Becker bbecker@politico.com About The Author Bernie Becker is a tax reporter for POLITICO Pro, where he is primarily responsible for writing the Morning Tax tipsheet.

The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. "Despite every effort using the best science available ... the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. "The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness." The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 46,000-sq-mile area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the $145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators' recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked — or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. "In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China. TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines said the hunt had been "thorough and comprehensive" and it "stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search." "MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located," it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometers. "If money is a concern, prioritize within this area," Nathan said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American. NYC, in your inbox.

The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. “Despite every effort using the best science available … the search has not been able to locate the aircraft,” Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. “The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.” The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 120,000-sq-km (46,000-sq-mile) area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the $145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators’ recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that.Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked – or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. “In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China. TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been “thorough and comprehensive” and it “stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search“MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located,” it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. “If money is a concern, prioritise within this area,” Nathan said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania.As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment.Twelve of the 239 on board were crew.

AFPBloomberg A file photo of a mural of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane in a back-alley in Shah Alam. Photo: AFP Kuala Lumpur: The underwater search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was called off on Tuesday, leaving unsolved one of the most enduring mysteries of the aviation age. The Boeing Co. 777 aircraft disappeared on 8 March 2014, on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. According to satellite data, the jet headed south over the Indian Ocean for about six hours before plummeting into the water at up to 25,000 feet a minute. A file photo of a flight officer using binoculars at an observers window on a Royal Australian Air Force P-3 Orion during the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in Southern Indian Ocean, Australia. Photo: AP Here are the key dates in the disappearance of the plane and its 239 passengers and crew. •Flight 370 departs Kuala Lumpur at 12:41am, bound for Beijing. It vanishes from Malaysian civilian radar at 1:30am. A search and rescue operation is launched in waters east of peninsula Malaysia. • Malaysia’s air force chief says the plane may have turned back towards Kuala Lumpur for no apparent reason, citing radar data. In the coming days, the search area expands to the west of the Malaysian peninsula and the air force confirms the blip on its radar was indeed MH370. • The hunt spreads far south to the Indian Ocean after the White House cites “new information” that the jet may have flown on after losing contact. • Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announces that the plane appeared to have flown for hours, veering sharply off-route at roughly the same time that its communications system and transponder were manually switched off. • Satellite data suggests the jet’s last known location was somewhere along one of two huge arcs stretching north into Central Asia and south into the Indian Ocean. • With more than two dozen countries now involved in the search, the pilot and co-pilot, both Malaysians, come under scrutiny. FBI experts examine the hard drive on a flight simulator in Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah’s home, but find nothing suspicious. • A US-supplied “black box” detector begins scanning the suspected crash zone. No signals are detected within the locator beacons’ one-month battery life. A file photo taken on 30 March, 2014 shows Australian navy ship Ocean Shield as it lies docked at naval base HMAS Stirling while being fitted with a towed pinger locator to aid in her roll in the search for missing MH370 in Perth, Australia. Photo: AP • Australia announces the search area will be expanded across a huge swathe of ocean. The focus shifts for several months to mapping the uncharted seafloor before searching can resume. • A Malaysia-contracted vessel resumes the sonar search of the seabed for debris. Three specialised Dutch search ships join the effort. • Malaysia’s government declares MH370’s passengers and crew “presumed dead”, angering next of kin who demand proof. • Malaysia, Australia, and China say the oceanic search area for flight MH370 will double in size to 120,000 square kilometres (46,300 square miles). They later say the area will not be further expanded without credible new leads. • New Malaysia Airlines CEO Christoph Mueller says the carrier is “technically bankrupt”. The company begins to slash 6,000 jobs. • A piece of aircraft debris is found by a beachcomber on the shores of the French island of La Reunion in the Indian Ocean and sent to France for analysis. A file photo taken on 29 July shows police carrying a piece of debris from an unidentified aircraft found in the coastal area of Saint-Andre de la Reunion, in the east of the French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion. Photo: AFP Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak later says experts analysing the debris have “conclusively confirmed” it is from MH370. • France says it will launch new searches by air, land and sea from Reunion island to hunt for more possible MH370 wreckage. • MH370 relatives begin filing a slew of lawsuits over the plane’s disappearance. A file photo taken on 29 July, 2016 shows a family member of a passenger aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 reacts during a protest outside the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing. The hat reads “Pray for MH370”. Photo: Reuters. • Malaysia confirms a piece of aircraft found off Tanzania in June is from MH370. A month later a piece of wing found in Mauritius is confirmed as having come from the plane. Other pieces of debris that turn up on various Indian Ocean shorelines are believed to be from the aircraft, although none is confirmed. • A new report finds Flight MH370 was likely out of control when it plunged into the ocean with its wing flaps not prepared for landing, casting doubt on theories a pilot was still in charge. • Fed up MH370 relatives travel to Madagascar to search for debris themselves. • An expert report says the wreckage of MH370 is almost certainly not in the Indian Ocean search zone, and may be further north. Australia and Malaysia say the report does not offer strong enough evidence to expand the search zone. The search is suspended.

My brother loved life, he loved his lifestyle, period.” Malaysia Airlines flight MH370: underwater search called off Read more Zaharie is the focus of several theories on how the Boeing 777 disappeared in the early morning of 8 March 2014. Authorities called off the search on Tuesday. A week after it vanished, the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, said military radar tracking revealed an unplanned route “consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane” before it went down, implying there was no accident. Since then, the case for the ”rogue pilot” theory has been repeatedly asserted as an explanation for why the passenger jet took an erratic course around Malaysia and flew south for several hours before smashing into the Indian Ocean. Several veteran pilots and aviation experts have added their voices to a scenario in which the most likely culprit was Zaharie, who was from Penang. They point to data showing radio contact and radar transponder transmissions were cut while the plane appeared to still be under human control. Suspicion around Zaharie’s role was deepened further when the Australian agency in charge of the search announced last summer that the captain’s home-built flight simulator had been used to plot a course to the southern Indian Ocean. “They have a right to their own views, just like I have to mine,” said Sakinab. But she has argued that 53-year-old Zaharie, nicknamed Ari by his family, was a generous and kind man with a warm sense of humour. In a commemorative note about her brother, Sakinab described a man with a “passion for life, for family and above all for flying”, who married his childhood sweetheart, had two sons, a daughter and a grandson. “I want the world to know here is a loving man who will stop at nothing to render help when it is needed,” she wrote. She described his compassion for other people, exemplified when he took family members on holiday or helped fix up their houses with his DIY skills. “My home and the homes of my sisters and brothers are not short of the things that remind us of him every day; framed pictures, leaking windows now repaired, a fish pond levelled up and nicely tiled, a new TV installed,” Sakinab wrote. Zaharie, she said, had a strong sense for loyalty towards his employer, Malaysia Airlines, which funded his dream to become a commercial pilot. He held an “unblemished flying record”, she said, after flying 18,000 hours since he joined the carrier in 1981. She told the Guardian the official investigation had been at best a “lackadaisical” effort and at worst a “huge fabrication”. “You see they have the state-of-the-art technology at their disposal. They have all the modern apparatus at their bidding. Boeing is by their side. Almost three years now … what have they got to show?” That 239 people can go missing in monitored airspace has baffled and alarmed the public, and Sakinab herself suspects foul play in one of aviation’s greatest unsolved mysteries. “Don’t forget the cargo,” she added, without elaborating. “However can a huge 777 just disappear from the surface of the earth?” The official investigation, led by Malaysia, Australia and China – the country where the vast majority of the passengers were from – does not back the pilot hijacking theory as the most likely scenario. Australia’s Transport Safety Bureau, the body that led the search operations in the southern Indian Ocean, has maintained an assessment it made in July 2014 that a rogue pilot is not their primary cause. The “best fit” based on the available evidence, they argued, was that there was a “hypoxia event” in which the aircraft was not properly pressurised and the pilots were deprived of an adequate oxygen supply. Hypoxia leads to extreme disorientation and even unconsciousness or death. It could result, the ATSB said, in a loss of radio communications, a long period without any manoeuvring of the aircraft, a steadily maintained cruise altitude while on autopilot and an eventual fuel exhaustion and dive. This is backed up by an investigation by Malaysian police that found no evidence that Zaharie or his 27-year-old co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, had any personal, medical or financial stresses. Their information was based on interviews with family members, including Sakinab. Many other prominent observers since then have dismissed the rogue pilot theory. However, until the black box is found intact with the jet, speculation will remain while Zaharie’s family grieves and searches for answers. His wife and children, who have never spoken to the media, are distraught, Sakinab says. “Sad is an understatement,” she said. “No one can even begin to make out our feelings about MH370 and our beloved brother being accused of ill intent.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here.

REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SYDNEY: The deep-sea search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 ended on Tuesday without any trace being found of the plane that vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board, the three countries involved in the search said. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. "Despite every effort using the best science available ... the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. "The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness." The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 120,000-sq-km (46,000-sq-mile) area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the US$145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators' recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked - or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. "In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China. TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been "thorough and comprehensive" and it "stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search". "MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located," it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. "If money is a concern, prioritise within this area," Nathan said. In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt "disappointed, helpless and angry" because the search had been ended "purely due to a funding shortage". "The 370 incident is the most important thing in my life," he said, referring to the flight number. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American.

Flyadeal, which is set to start services in mid-2017, is aiming to operate a fleet of up to 50 narrow-body jets by 2020 and Saleh Al Jasser, the director general of the state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, said last year Flyadeal would operate leased Airbus or Boeing jets. Airbus’ Middle East managing director Fouad Attar said Flyadeal would operate six of his planes. He was speaking on the sidelines of a news conference in Riyadh announcing an 80 aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia’s only operating low-cost airline, flynas. An Airbus spokesman later confirmed the aircraft type and leasing arrangements for Flyadeal. The current model A320s are being leased through an undisclosed leasor and delivery starts in the second half of the year, the spokesman said, adding that no further deals had been done with Flyadeal beyond the six aircraft. Saudi Arabian Airlines did not immediately respond a request for comment. An Airbus A320neo, the latest version of the jet, was displayed at Flyadeal’s launch in April 2016. The Airbus spokesman also confirmed Saudi start-up SaudiGulf Airlines, which recently started operations, has taken delivery of the four current model A320s it ordered. * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Southwest Airlines beats profit forecasts on fare price hike Raytheon hit as F-35 missile maker’s sales slow Ryanair targets Lufthansa’s Frankfurt hub to increase services Qantas relaunches Beijing route after eight-year gap MOST VIEWED Business | All Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet UAE and India pledge to boost bilateral trade by 60% London-based renewables investment adviser to open Dubai office Emirates slashes fares on routes to US, rekindling Open Skies tension UAE military contingent participates in India’s Republic Day parade Etihad Airways to deploy new Dreamliners on Levant and Far East routes Language of money best left to the present Singapore Airlines replaces Boeing 777 on two-stop route Airbus ‘in danger’ as Brexit trigger looms Owning cars, watches or art – directly or via a fund – is an investing option More Most Viewed ‘Ninety bodies found’ at Libyan ISIL camp bombed by US Matchmaking advertising billboards taken down in Dubai Life lessons: ‘My mother is British ... but I am 100 per cent Emirati’ Top Gear cast in Dubai for two-day shoot Emirati and Indian musicians release song to celebrate their countries’ friendship - video Trump changes his mind on Nato Burj Khalifa and Adnoc tower light up in colours of Indian flag Crowds cheer on Ironman 70.3 Dubai competitors and Ironkids Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet US businessman arrested after anti-Muslim tirade at JFK More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: Trump and Iraq’s oil Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent Municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Uncertain times in UAE football as China flexes its financial muscle Christo cancels Arkansas project and will now focus on Abu Dhabi’s The Mastaba About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Probably not. But if an old jumbo jet can look this fancy, we might be convinced. 8 ways to save money on your house bills Architect David Hertz has turned a scrap Boeing 747 jumbo jet into a snazzy mansion in the hills of Malibu, California. The plane-turned-mansion is the new home of Francie Rehwald, who interviewed twelve architects before picking David Hertz. She spent 15 years searching for the perfect bit of land for her custom home, which she wanted to have curves and ‘feminine shapes’. (Picture: Caters News) Francie ended up in Malibu, and set to work on creating her dream home. She fell in love with the idea of incorporating plane wings into her home. ‘I wanted something that was feminine,’ Francie said. ‘You might not think wings are feminine, but once they were detached from the place they really come into their own. ‘They have such subtle curves.’ David Hertz started to work on building a wing when it struck him – why build a house to look like plane wings, when you could make a house out of plane wings? (Picture: Caters News) He used two wings from a scrap Boeing and two tail fins, which were transported to the hills by helicopter. They had to close five roads just to get the wings there, and extreme care had to be taken not to drop them. More: Property This enormous mansion worth millions was sold to a charity for £1 7 things you only realise when you're buying your first home Kentish Town is the best place to live in London and here are 11 reasons why Francie also had to seek permission from 17 government agencies to build the home, as from the sky it looks a bit like a plane crash (which could be alarming to planes flying overhead). So, a lot of work went into Francie’s home. Plus millions of pounds. But for her, it’s all entirely worth it. (Picture: Caters News) The mansion now sits across 55 acres, has the feminine curves Francie wanted, and is pretty snazzy – with massive windows revealing views of lush surrounding mountains. ‘No one had ever built anything like this before,’ said Francie. ‘There were a lot of surprises that brought the cost up, but it’s just beautiful. ‘Every day is a complete and utter joy and I feel so lucky.’ MORE: Peaceful photos show what it’s like to live in a houseboat on the River Thames MORE: Alexander McQueen’s £8.5 million mansion goes on the market MORE: This incredible two-bedroom houseboat with a spiral staircase could be all yours (for £1.5 million) The Fix The daily lifestyle email from Metro.co.uk.

Flyadeal, which is set to start services in mid-2017, is aiming to operate a fleet of up to 50 narrow body jets by 2020 and Saleh al-Jasser, director general of state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, said last year Flyadeal would operate leased Airbus or Boeing jets. Airbus’s Middle East Managing Director Fouad Attar told Reuters Flyadeal would operate six of his planes. He was speaking on the sidelines of a news conference in Riyadh announcing an 80 aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia’s only operating low-cost airline, flynas. An Airbus spokesman later confirmed to Reuters by phone the aircraft type and leasing arrangements for Flyadeal. The current model A320s are being leased through an undisclosed leasor and delivery starts in the second half of the year, the spokesman said, adding that no further deals had been done with Flyadeal beyond the six aircraft. Saudi Arabian Airlines did not immediately respond an to emailed request for comment. An Airbus A320neo, the latest version of the jet, was displayed at Flyadeal’s launch in April 2016. The Airbus spokesman also confirmed Saudi start-up SaudiGulf Airlines, which recently started operations, has taken delivery of the four current model A320s it ordered.

Pic/AP Bishkek: A Turkish cargo jet crashed near Kyrgyzstan’s Manas airport yesterday, killing at least 37 people, most of them residents of a village struck by the Boeing 747 as it tried to land in dense fog, Kyrgyz officials said. According to the airport administration, the plane was supposed to make a stopover in Manas on its way from Hong Kong to Istanbul. It crashed when trying to land in poor visibility at 7.31 am (0131 GMT). The doomed plane ploughed on for a few hundred metres through the Dachi Suu village, home to hundreds of families, shattering into pieces and damaging dozens of buildings. Initial estimates put the death toll from the crash at 37, said Kyrgyzstan’s emergencies ministry. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev announced that Tuesday would be a national day of mourning.

By YaronSteinbuch A Turkish cargo plane trying to land in dense fog crashed Monday morning near Kyrgyzstan’s main airport, killing 37 people — including entire families of a village struck by the jet, authorities said. The ACT Airlines Boeing 747 crashed just outside the Manas airport, south of the capital Bishkek, on its way from Hong Kong to Istanbul, airport officials told Reuters. “According to preliminary information, the plane crashed due to a pilot error,” Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev said on state TV, Agence France-Presse reported. Russian broadcaster NTV said: “The pilot tried to make a second landing attempt but failed to climb.” The aircraft plowed on for a few hundred yards through the Dacha-Suu village, home to hundreds of families, shattering into pieces and destroying buildings. The victims included 12 children, officials said. A 9-year-old boy who ran home from school found that his entire family was killed in the disaster, the Mirror of the UK reported. The torn-off tail assembly ended up upside down — lodged into a one-story house — and twisted pieces of the mangled jet were strewn across a football field-sized area of the devastated village. Injured victim Baktygul Kubatova told AKIpress that his house collapsed as his family slept. “I was worrying about my children, that they could die,” he said, The Sun reported. “I woke up after I saw something red in the window. I had no time to realize what happened. … With fear, I covered my son with my hand to protect him from the ruins. My daughter received injuries, as she was sleeping near the window, while me and my son were sleeping on the floor.” Tajikan, who identified herself only by her first name, told AFP she heard a roar and felt what felt like an earthquake. “Many people were sleeping, everything around was burning. One of the parts of the aircraft fell on our neighbor’s house. She and her whole family died,” the pensioner said. Meanwhile, local media reported that looters plundered through the village — with one man held by police for stealing two kettles, the Mirror reported. ACT Airlines said in a statement that it was “deeply saddened” by the crash of its Boeing 747-400, noting that “the cause of the accident is unknown.” Boeing extended its “deepest condolences” over the crash and offered to assist Kyrgyz authorities with the investigation, AFP reported. Bishkek transportation official Marat Amankulovso said the jet was approaching the runway from the east, The Sun reported. “At the landing it didn’t come down on the runway, flew over it, its fuselage touched the fence and after that it crashed,” he said. “It is hard to say whether the fog affected the situation. We are told that all the standards were met, and that planes were landing in the same conditions earlier.” The captain was identified as Ibrahum Gurcan Diranci, a former military pilot in Turkey, the paper reported. He was previously involved in an emergency landing of an ACT Airlines plane at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan in 2010. A landing gear fault caused by poor maintenance was blamed in the incident. Prime Minister Sooronbai Jeenbekov was heading a government commission to investigate the Monday crash and the country’s state prosecutor also opened a probe. President Almazbek Atambayev canceled his visit to China to return to Bishkek, according to Kyrgyz media. This story was first published on NYPost.com.

Cooper Mystery - DB Cooper Full view DB Cooper (Wikimedia) New Evidence Found In 45-Year-Old D.B. Cooper Mystery    Hillary Luehring-Jones January 16, 2017January 16, 2017January 16, 2017Daily Digest, News, News Feed > FBI investigators have found new evidence in the now 45-year-old case of the missing robber D.B. Cooper. FBI AMATEURS FIND NEW EVIDENCE IN D.B. COOPER CASE On Thanksgiving Eve 1971, Cooper boarded a flight from Portland to Seattle, told a flight attendant he had a bomb in his suitcase, and demanded $200,000 and four parachutes. The plane landed, the FBI delivered on his demands, and the plane took off again. Cooper jumped from the back of the plane into the freezing night and was never seen again. The FBI have never solved the case and Cooper is still missing, if he survived the jump. Today, a band of amateur scientists chosen by the FBI have been researching the case and came across a new set of clues. After analysis it has been concluded that the necktie Cooper wore and left behind contained more than 100,000 particles, including cerium, strontium sulfide and pure titanium. “These are what they call rare earth elements. They’re used in very narrow fields, for very specific things,” said Tom Kaye, the lead researcher for Citizen Sleuths. At that time in 1971, these elements were rarely around, but they were being used for Boeing’s supersonic transport plane that was being developed by the government in the 60s and 70s. This leads them to believe that Cooper was tied to the Puget Sound aerospace industry. Given that the particles were found on a necktie leads the researchers to believe that he was a Boeing employee but not one running the machines. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines],” said Kaye. “He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants.” Boeing was apparently developing radar screens, which used some of the elements found on the tie. Citizen Sleuths is asking the public for help, especially old-timers who might know what the elements could have been used for in the early 70s. “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say, ‘Oh my gosh. I know what that means having those particles on the tie,'” Kaye said. Tipsters can use the “contact” tab on the Citizen Sleuth website with any information.

In pursuit of its goal to power every flight at Sea-Tac with sustainable aviation biofuel, Sea-Tac is among the first airports in North America to work with aviation, energy and research partners to systematically evaluate all aspects to developing a commercial-scale program from scratch. The study evaluated more than 30 sites around Washington State that could potentially support the receipt, blending, storage, and delivery infrastructure required to supply Sea-Tac Airport with up to 50 million gallons per year of sustainable alternative aviation fuel (also referred to as aviation biofuel). Potential sites were evaluated both for the ability to accommodate near-term (12-18 months) supplies of five million gallons per year and long-term (2-10 years) supplies of more than 50 million gallons per year. In pursuing an integrated aviation biofuels supply chain, sites were selected based on the capacity to accommodate delivery of unblended biofuel by pipe, rail, barge, and/or truck, and were evaluated based on land use, zoning, and environmental considerations. The most-feasible sites were determined based on the construction costs of the needed infrastructure, environmental constraints, permitting and planning, and other contingences to help determine an overall score and final recommendation. • A small biofuel receiving and blending facility at the Sea-Tac Airport Fuel Farm is the most cost-effective solution in the short term; • The Anacortes-area refineries are the most cost-effective options for large volumes of aviation biofuel over the long term due to their access to marine, rail, truck, and the Olympic Pipeline; and • The Phillips 66/Olympic Pipeline Company sites in Renton also showed potential to accommodate receipt and blending facilities for moderate-to-large biofuel volumes over the long term.

REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File PhotoMore JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's upgraded ballistic missile shield became operational on Wednesday, in a "Star Wars"-like extension of its capabilities to outer space where incoming missiles can be safely destroyed. The Defence Ministry said the U.S.-funded Arrow 3 system, jointly developed by state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries and U.S. firm Boeing Co. , was handed over the Israeli Air Force. The Arrow 3, together with the Arrow 2, which has been operational since 2000, would "significantly reduce the possibilities of ballistic missiles" hitting Israel, the ministry said in a statement. The Arrow 2 is designed to intercept projectiles high and low within the atmosphere. Arrow 3 missiles will fly into space, where their warheads detach to become "kamikaze" satellites that track and slam into their targets. Such high-altitude shoot-downs are meant to safely destroy incoming nuclear, biological or chemical missiles. Israel has frequently voiced concern about a ballistic missile threat posed by its arch-foe, Iran. The United States has its own system for intercepting ballistic missiles in space, Aegis. Arrow serves as the top tier of an integrated Israeli shield built up to withstand various potential missile or rocket salvoes. The bottom tier is the already-deployed short-range Iron Dome interceptor, which was used extensively with high success rates in a 2014 Gaza war against Hamas militants. Another Israeli system called David's Sling is being developed to shoot down mid-range, lower-altitude missiles, such as those in the arsenal of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, a Lebanese group which last fought a war with Israel in 2006.
