Airlines around the world use Boeing for its dependability and first-class style. From the cheapest of flights to luxury liners, Boeing has proven itself to be a world class manufacturer for anything regarding air travel. They’re also famous for developing unique aircrafts that cater to the vibes of their customers. During the Star Wars hype of last year, for example, Boeing developed a set of limited edition jets modeled on droids from the famous intergalactic saga. The planes copied features of the droids BB-8 and R2-D2 on the exterior, and the on-board experience was even better with Star Wars paraphernalia and movies playing in each cabin. Once again, Boeing has listened to the requests of their customers and has responded with a potentially improved in-flight experience. According to a patent filing published last week, Boeing wants to offer projections of clouds and stars on cabin walls and ceilings for their customers’ viewing pleasure. If granted, the patent will allow the airline company to be the only jet that can project images onto a jet’s interior surfaces. They plan to feature images of a beautiful blue skies with fluffy clouds floating around during the day. At night, they’ll project stars and constellations. The projection will move lazily along as if the images were being viewed in real time. “Projection lighting is simply one of many technologies we are exploring to see if it can bring advances in both airline economics and passenger experience,” a Boeing spokesman said in the filing. “In theory, airlines could use lighting enhancements on the walls and bulkheads to display information about destinations or to project scenes that get passengers thinking about where they’re going.” This is all part of a movement in airlines all over the world to make the user experience better for everyone. Most notably, airlines have been working on improving their mood lighting. Through numerous tests and surveys it was discovered that the harsh fluorescents of a typical aircraft make the user experience far more unpleasant. It leads to disgruntled customers and poorer ratings. As a direct result of these findings, Boeing has been looking for ways to increase the mood lighting in their aircrafts without driving up the cost of production. When jets cost less to produce, it’s much cheaper for people to fly, helping to keep the airline service an accessible and affordable commodity. Boeing believes that their projection system will help to achieve the lower production costs. Though the initial startup installation will be higher than a traditional lighting system, it will be incredibly easy and affordable to run and maintain. Additionally, it will be much cheaper than installing a customized lighting feature within each seat. The ratings will go up for Boeing’s aircrafts without hiking their bottom line. If Boeing’s patent is successful and other aircraft manufacturers don’t find loopholes in the patent, the manufacturer could be one of the most coveted producers in the industry. As they cut costs while improving the customer experience, they’ll be able to maintain incredibly low fares and produce more competitive pricing in the industry.

Boeing says it will support a Moroccan plan to build up its aerospace manufacturing sector, encouraging suppliers to set up or expand here. With a high-quality but cheap workforce, Morocco's aerospace sector has developed rapidly over the past decade. King Mohammed VI oversaw the signing Tuesday in Tangiers. Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Raymond Conner says, "We and our suppliers must reduce costs and improve quality in order to win in the marketplace." Moroccan Industry Minister Hafid El Alamy says Morocco hopes to bring 120 Boeing suppliers here. Jobs and the economy will be a key issue in upcoming Moroccan legislative elections.

The upgrade from a single aisle Airbus A321 aircraft will cater to strong demand to and from the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, offering guests more seats on a wide-body aircraft. Together with the other daily Riyadh service operated by a Boeing 777, Etihad Airways will have more than 8,700 weekly seats on the route. Flight EY317 will be operated with a B787, departing Abu Dhabi at 10:15 hrs, arriving into Riyadh at 11:15 hrs. The return flight EY318 departs Riyadh at 16:25 hrs, arriving into Abu Dhabi at 19:10 hrs. The flights will provide optimal timings for guests in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, and convenient connections to and from destinations across key markets in Europe, Indian subcontinent, Asia and Australia. The 299-seat aircraft, configured in two classes, offers award-winning cabin interiors with 28 seats in Business and 271 in Economy. Guests will be able to experience the airline’s renowned Business Studio on board. The seat, which provides guests with direct aisle access, is also equipped with an in-seat massage and air cushion control system. Business Class guests using the service can choose from three main courses, with further dine-on-demand options available. There are also specialized services onboard, including a Food & Beverage Manager in the premium cabin, multi-national cabin crew and Flying Nannies, who are able to provide support to parents travelling with young children. For B787 Economy Class passengers, the airline’s commitment to providing the best guest experiences is showcased by its ‘Smart Seats’. They have been designed to provide additional comfort through simple design features such as a ‘fixed wing’ headrest, extra seat width and individual TV monitors. Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE equipment for its B787 inflight entertainment system. Mobile connectivity with access to onboard Wi-Fi and seven satellite channels of live TV are also available. Kevin Knight, Etihad Airways Chief Strategy and Planning Officer, said: “The Boeing 787 is playing a key role in Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion with routes carefully selected on which to deploy this unique aircraft. We are delighted that Riyadh will soon join our 787 cities giving guests a different experience to and from Abu Dhabi, and with convenient connections to destinations across our diverse worldwide network. “The aircraft also provides significantly more cargo capacity to facilitate the movement of a greater number of goods to and from the Saudi capital. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a very important market for Etihad Airways, supporting our global expansion since the launch of services 13 years ago. Our commitment to the Saudi market has grown since we began flying to Riyadh in 2004, steadily increasing our presence to the current 63 flights each week to and from four Saudi cities.” On the Riyadh route alone, Etihad Airways has flown more than 2.5 million guests since 2004. Etihad Airways’ flights to Riyadh, Jeddah, Madinah and Dammam are complemented by Saudi codeshare partner flynas, whose dedicated services between Abu Dhabi and both Riyadh and Jeddah provide travellers with even more choice. Riyadh becomes Etihad Airways’ newest B787 destination this year following the induction of the aircraft on flights to Perth, Dusseldorf and Shanghai, with Abu Dhabi – Johannesburg set to become a Dreamliner route on 1 November. Etihad Airways’ current fleet of nine B787s also operates to Singapore, Washington DC, Brisbane and Zurich. — SG TAGS Etihad Airways B787 SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleExcuse me Next articleAleppo hospitals overwhelmed by wounded Sadiq Hussain NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,486,011FansLike 41,110FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Deterrent for non-recurrence Nov 18, 2016 Sexual harassment Nov 18, 2016 Women in Riyadh feel more at ease without niqab Nov 18, 2016 American couple ruin stereotypes about Saudis Nov 18, 2016 Saudi Arabia set to reinforce its climate change commitments Nov 18, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

The Memorandum of Understanding outlining the project, signed by Morocco's Minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and the Digital Economy Moulay Hafid Elalamy and Boeing Vice Chairman Raymond L. Conner, comes just days before Boeing is set to host the third annual US-Morocco Trade & Investment Forum in Seattle on October 3. The conference brings US business leaders together with Moroccan officials to learn about investment opportunities in the Kingdom. "The Moroccan aeronautics industry has seen, thanks to [the vision of King Mohammed VI], huge growth these last few years. The sector has multiplied by six in 10 years and today boasts 121 companies," said Mr. Elalamy at the signing ceremony, which was chaired by King Mohammed VI in Tangier. "Through our business in Casablanca, we have already seen with our own eyes the unique opportunities offered by Morocco to aeronautics subcontractors in terms of cost effectiveness, all while producing quality products," said Mr. Conner at the event. Boeing has had a presence in Morocco since at least 2001, when the company became a co-founder of Morocco Aero-Technical Interconnect Systems (MATIS) Aerospace, which produces parts and engines for Boeing jets and employs 850 people in Casablanca. Boeing is also the preferred manufacturer for Moroccan national airline Royal Air Maroc, which earlier this month launched thrice-weekly non-stop flights between Washington Dulles International Airport and Casablanca on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The new aerospace ecosystem will further cement Boeing's presence in Morocco by bringing suppliers to the country, building factories, and streamlining the manufacturing platform. Boeing has also agreed to train the local workforce to meet demands for skilled labor. In a call on aerospace opportunities in Morocco organized on Monday by the State Department's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, US Ambassador to Morocco Dwight L. Bush said, "With a strategic geographic location and historic ties at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, and its pursuit of integrated supply-chains and entrepreneurial opportunities, Morocco has developed into an important regional player in supplying the aircraft industry for Europe, the Americas, and around the world." Walter Siouffi, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Morocco, noted on the call, "I think what's impressing us the most about Morocco is the forward planning and thinking that the government has been embarking on as far back as the early part of 2000. And part of that thinking was that Morocco, given its proximity to Europe, after analyzing the competitive advantages it has in terms of logistics, distance, free trade agreements, labor, etc, figured out really early on that it could be an important part of the supply chain to companies in the aerospace [and other] sectors." In recent years, Morocco has successfully positioned itself as a gateway for US companies to African and European markets, and through aggressive economic reforms has become a top destination for foreign direct investment in Africa. Earlier this year, the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index named Morocco among the 50 most innovative economies in the world, and one of just two such in Africa. The results echoed the findings of many industry reports of recent years. KPMG International and Oxford Economics' 2015 Change Readiness Index (CRI) ranked Morocco as the most "change-ready" country in the Maghreb, with particularly positive results in the category of "enterprise capability." The World Bank's Doing Business 2016 ranked Morocco first out of 20 MENA countries for "ease of starting a business" and placed it sixth overall in the region for "ease of doing business." The Moroccan American Center for Policy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. This material is distributed by the Moroccan American Center for Policy on behalf of the Government of Morocco. Additional information is available at the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.

King Mohammed VI oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding in the northern port city of Tangiers to establish an industrial zone where up to 120 Boeing suppliers and sub-contractors could operate. "This is a very important strategic project as we move into a new aeronautical era in Morocco," Industry Minister Moulay Hafi Elalamy told AFP. Morocco's Industry Minister Moulay Hafi Elalamy said the Boeing industrial zone could create up to 8,700 jobs ©Paul J. Richards (AFP/File) Morocco has unveiled several large-scale industrial projects in recent years, with the Tangiers region among the fastest growing. French carmaker Renault in April signed deals to invest more than $1 billion (900 million euros) and create 50,000 jobs in the North African country. Morocco was badly affected by the financial crisis in Europe, its top trade partner, and has struggled to contain a ballooning public deficit. The authorities have strenuously promoted the country as a bridge between Africa and the West, in a bid to encourage foreign investment and trade. "The Moroccan aeronautical industry has seen important growth in recent years," said Elalamy. "The sector has grown six-fold in just 10 years and there are now 121 firms." Some of the largest manufacturers are already present in the country, contributing to a sector that employs about 10,000 people and has a turnover of $1 billion per year. Elalamy said the Boeing industrial zone could create up to 8,700 jobs. Morocco's gateway linking Europe, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, Tangiers has experienced unprecedented development in recent years, including a new airport and deep-water port.

King Mohammed VI oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding in the northern port city of Tangiers to establish an industrial zone where up to 120 Boeing suppliers and sub-contractors could operate. "This is a very important strategic project as we move into a new aeronautical era in Morocco," Industry Minister Moulay Hafi Elalamy told AFP. Morocco has unveiled several large-scale industrial projects in recent years, with the Tangiers region among the fastest growing. French carmaker Renault in April signed deals to invest more than $1 billion (900 million euros) and create 50,000 jobs in the North African country. Morocco was badly affected by the financial crisis in Europe, its top trade partner, and has struggled to contain a ballooning public deficit. The authorities have strenuously promoted the country as a bridge between Africa and the West, in a bid to encourage foreign investment and trade. "The Moroccan aeronautical industry has seen important growth in recent years," said Elalamy. "The sector has grown six-fold in just 10 years and there are now 121 firms." Some of the largest manufacturers are already present in the country, contributing to a sector that employs about 10,000 people and has a turnover of $1 billion per year. Elalamy said the Boeing industrial zone could create up to 8,700 jobs. Morocco's gateway linking Europe, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, Tangiers has experienced unprecedented development in recent years, including a new airport and deep-water port.

King Mohammed VI Chairs Signing Ceremony to Establish Boeing Industrial Ecosystem in Morocco By Morocco World News - September 27, 2016 , 2:18 pm Tangiers – The Setting up of a Boeing ecosystem, a new sign of confidence for Morocco at the international level. King Mohammed VI, chaired, on Tuesday at the Royal Palace in Tangiers, the signing ceremony of a draft agreement for the establishment of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco, a structuring project that will allow the Moroccan aviation industry to improve its position significantly at the international level. This major project, which is a partnership between Morocco and Boeing, the world leader in aerospace technology, will give structure to an ecosystem composed of suppliers and organize a sourcing platform based in Morocco. This ecosystem will generate an additional annual turnover from exports of one billion dollars, allow the setting up of 120 Boeing suppliers and create 8,700 new specialized jobs. To cover the training needs of its ecosystem, dedicated training programs specially designed by Boeing will be implemented. At the beginning of the ceremony, a documentary movie was screened highlighting development witnessed by the aviation sector, one of Morocco’s global businesses, in recent years, as part of the Industrial Acceleration Plan, launched on April 2, 2014. On this occasion, minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, gave a speech before the Sovereign, in which he presented the main outlines of this project, which is a strong signal to the industrial world, confirming to operators the real capabilities of Morocco, especially in the most complex and high value-added sectors. “The Moroccan aviation industry has witnessed, under Your enlightened vision, significant growth in recent years. The sector was multiplied by 6 in 10 years and has now 121 actors,” said Elalamy, noting that the Kingdom, which is ranked 15th in terms of investments in the aviation sector, was able to be among the few countries operating in this area. Recalling the fact that a “locomotive” ecosystem reinforces the efficiency and attractiveness of the sector, while creating a virtuous circle of prosperity within the national economy, Elalamy said that Boeing industrial ecosystem will be a “real boost” to the aviation sector, like Renault and PSA ecosystems to the automotive industry. President of Boeing “Commercial Airplanes” has, for his part, lauded the strategic vision of HM the King which enabled Morocco to invest in the high-tech aerospace industry. “Boeing is proud of the trusting relationship we had with Morocco and its aviation industry for nearly 50 years”, he said, adding that the “Kingdom offers unique opportunities that will benefit Boeing and our extended supply chain.” “We are signing a significant agreement to enable more foreign investment and development of the aerospace industry here,” he noted, underlining that “we have collaborated with the government to develop an integrated industrial program of incentives to bring more Boeing suppliers to Morocco. Boeing will also be an advisor to the government’s plan for a new vocational and educational training institute. This will provide a pipeline of skilled workers for the aerospace jobs of tomorrow, he affirmed. Afterwards, the King chaired the signing ceremony of a draft agreement between the State of Morocco and aircraft manufacturer “Boeing” concerning the setting up of an ecosystem for aircraft parts manufacturing. The draft agreement was inked by Moulay Hafid Elalamy and Raymond L. Conner. The King, then, decorated Raymond L. Conner. with the Alawite Wissam of Exceptional Rank (Grand Sash).   Join the Conversation. What do you think?

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Sep 27, 2016 at 11:35AM While the stock market has surged to record highs in 2016, shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) have been held down by widespread worries about slowing aircraft demand. Indeed, with the end of September quickly approaching, Boeing is less than halfway to its full-year goal for aircraft orders. Boeing vs. S&P 500 2016 Stock Performance, data by YCharts. Order activity for the 777 widebody family has been particularly disappointing this year. Moreover, the backlog for this cash cow is disappearing quickly, which makes the task of finding new orders especially pressing. Fortunately, Boeing moved closer to finalizing two important 777 orders last week. 777 sales in focus Over the next several years, Boeing will transition from the 777 to the next-generation 777X. However, the 777X won't arrive until 2020, and production of that new model won't fully ramp up until a couple of years later. Boeing must sell enough 777s to bridge the gap until 777X production reaches full speed. However, the fact that the current-generation 777 is about to be supplanted by a new model makes that quite challenging. In January, Boeing announced plans to cut 777 production from 8.3 per month to seven per month at the beginning of 2017 to cope with the resulting order slowdown. Boeing is having trouble keeping its 777 factory busy. Image source: Boeing. To continue at that rate through the model transition, Boeing has said that it needs to garner 40-50 777 orders per year for the next few years. Increasingly, many analysts think that Boeing will have to slash 777 production even further. The reason? Boeing has logged just eight net orders for the 777 so far in 2016. Thus, Boeing desperately needs to finalize more orders in the next few months. New order from Saudi Arabia Last Friday, Saudi Arabian Airlines -- also known as Saudia -- announced plans to acquire 63 new aircraft: 28 widebodies from Boeing and 35 narrowbodies from Airbus. The Boeing order includes 15 777-300ERs, as well as 13 787 Dreamliners. Saudia already operates more than four dozen 777s, including 24 777-300ERs. The new planes for this important Boeing customer will most likely be used for a combination of growth plus replacement of aging 747 jumbo jets. Boeing hasn't officially announced the Saudia deal yet. However, it doesn't face any major obstacles to wrapping up this vital order. Some progress on Iran? Two days before the Saudia order announcement, Boeing got some good news about its pending order from Iran Air, as the U.S. Treasury Department approved export licenses for 80 Boeing planes. This gets Boeing one step closer to finalizing a tentative deal that includes 15 777-300ERs. However, the Iran aircraft sale is far from being a done deal. The U.S. rapprochement with Iran that would enable Boeing to do business with Iranian companies has been viciously opposed by nearly all of the Republican Party. If Hillary Clinton wins the upcoming presidential election, there is a good chance that Boeing will be able to finalize the Iran Air order later this year. (That said, lining up financing remains a significant obstacle.) On the other hand, if Donald Trump wins, his administration would likely slap tougher sanctions on Iran and force Boeing to drop the deal. Boeing needs these deals On paper, Boeing looks like it is miles away from meeting its 2016 order target for the 777. But if it can finalize the Saudia and Iran Air orders before year-end, it will have brought in 38 net orders for the current-generation 777: close to the goal of 40-50 net orders. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg has hinted that if the company can't close more 777 sales by the end of the year, it will have to make deeper production cuts (i.e., below the planned seven-per-month rate). That would represent a significant drag on earnings and cash flow. Boeing's chances of avoiding -- or at least delaying -- these potential production cuts look a lot better than they did a week ago. Moreover, Boeing still has three months left in the year to pursue additional 777 sales and (hopefully) solidify its production plans. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

This workhorse of commercial aviation accounts for one of every three commercial flights, and there are around 2,000 of them in the air at any given time. Every one of those planes rolled out of Boeing’s Renton Production Facility, where workers build a 737 in just nine days. The factory, near Seattle, pump them out at the rate of 42 per month, and Boeing claims the 1.1-million-square-foot facility is most efficient airplane factory in the world. Boeing faces fierce competition from arch rival Airbus. The 737 is the best-selling jet ever, with more than 9,000 delivered since its introduction in 1967, but the Airbus A320 is no slouch. The company has delivered about 6,700 of them since the airliner entered service in 1984.

Information Agency Main Page Politics Economy War Kyiv Society World Pictures Videos Opinions Publications For subscribers Services Press Room Monitoring Image bank Products Advertising Archive Feedback Contact OpinionNew frontier of Russian lies Author: Roman Tsymbaliuk Politics 15:30, 27 September 2016 The tragedy the world witnessed July 17, 2014, has changed dramatically the nature of Russian aggression in Ukraine. On this day, a Malaysian Boeing was downed from the sky over Donbas. Nearly 300 people were killed in that horrific crash. Before that day, many European powers chose not to really notice what was going on in the east of Ukraine in favor of their economic ties with Moscow. But the death of EU citizens on board that plane forced many European governments to change their approach to the situation. Politicians were just forced to open his eyes. Sanctions were imposed against Russia (and they are still enforced to this day) and almost the entire civilized world started helping Ukraine. Many people, especially in Russia, are trying to erase from memory the events in Donbas back in those hot days. At the time, the Kremlin, after an almost bloodless occupation of Crimea, was obsessed with the destruction of the Ukrainian state, toying with the idea of a mythical "Novorossiya". To implement this idea, thousands of soldiers and officers "voluntarily" left for “vacations” but still drove their officially assigned armored vehicles to seize the Ukrainian land. That is how the Kremlin explained hundreds of freshly-dug  graves in different parts of their vast country. Ukraine was returning Russian "volunteers" home. In various shapes. However, officially abandoning the version of Ukrainian stealth aircraft, the Russian Ministry of Defense provided yet another piece of "irrefutable evidence" of the attack of the Ukrainian military against MH17 Back in the day, there were almost daily reports of Ukraine’s losses – downed warplanes and helicopters, which used to halt the advance of Russia’s “strayed” Russian convoys of military equipment. Two years ago, Putin explained that military equipment to be used in such a conflict is "always somewhere around", while anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as the Russian uniform, can obviously be purchased "in any military outlet". It is no surprise that on July 17, 2014, Russia's state news agencies, like TASS, referring to militants who occupied parts of Donbas, proudly reported the downing of yet another Ukrainian An-26. When it turned out that it’s a passenger jet that had been hit, Russian propaganda started producing at warp speed different versions of the incident and developing conspiracy theories. Brainwash masterminds came up with the Spanish ground control officer “Carlos”, who allegedly navigated MH17 from the tower and personally “saw” (in binoculars?) two fighter jets approaching with Ukrainian tridents on their wings. A similar vision - in the form of two vulture-jets allegedly attacking a civilian plane – stood in the eyes many militants and other "eye-witnesses" who elaborated to the Russian media on what they had personally seen (!) happening at some 10k altitude. There was also a "secret witness", whose testimony had to drop all charges against Russia, shifting the blame on the Ukrainian hero – an actual combat pilot Vladyslav Voloshin. But when it turned out that the Su-25, at which the Kremlin pointed fingers, was simply unable to hit targets at such altitudes due to its technical characteristics, the Russian "analysts" thought of nothing better reclassifying  the “killer jet” to a Su-27. On July 21, 2014, Head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff General Kartapalov was speaking confidently at a presentation held at the Daily operations control center of Russia’s Aerospace Forces Russia on the causes of the MH17 tragedy. The slides showed the alleged movement Ukrainian Buk-M1 air defense systems. Then it was also stated that the Russian air monitoring means spotted a Su-25 belonging to the Ukrainian Air Force just 5 km from the Boeing. "Why was the warplane flying on air path designed for civil aviation almost simultaneously and at the same altitude with a passenger aircraft? I would like to hear an answer to this question," the Russian general said, with apparent concern in his voice. More than two years after that event, the answer was voiced in the same briefing room. It turned out that there had been no Captain Voloshin, piloting his Su-25 in dangerous proximity to the Boeing. Just as there has been no Su-27. On the eve of the release of the results of an official Dutch investigation, scheduled for September 28, the "Empire" has decided to go for a pre-emptive strike, unexpectedly releasing details of their radars and reporting that there had been no airborne side objects near the Malaysian aircraft before its disintegration. More than two years after that event, the answer was voiced in the same briefing room. It turned out that there had been no Captain Voloshin, piloting his Su-25 in dangerous proximity to the Boeing. Just as there has been no Su-27 However, having officially abandoned the version of the Ukrainian stealth aircraft, the Russian Ministry of Defense provided yet another piece of "irrefutable evidence" of the attack of the Ukrainian military against MH17. Now the only version of a Buk missile launch is in the works, in order to be closer to the results of the Dutch investigation. It turns out that the Russian radars saw the entire air situation, to the last detail, but only in the occupied part of Donbas. And especially, in the area of the village of Snizhne, where, the Buk missile launch site was located, according to an international investigation. Head of the Russia’s radio technical troops of the Aerospace Forces of Russia General Koban said that had the missile been fired from the areas of Donetsk region beyond the Ukrainian government control, Russian radars would have recorded such fact. Apparently, that’s the very radar that “saw” the Ukrainian Su-25 two years ago... To be more convincing, the General even told how the "eyes" of the Russian army monitor a much smaller object loitering along the Russian-Ukrainian border – a Russian drone Orlan-10. He claimed that if such a small object was identified, the Russians would have never missed a missile launch from the bordering part of the seized Donbas. But there’s another thing regarding these Orlan UAVs. As soon as the Ukrainian military manage to shoot them down, this hi-tech miracle of the Russian aeronautic industry automatically "goes on vacation" (just like the Russian troops going into Ukraine since 2014), while Russian "partners" once again pretend that the UAV is not theirs, and they have nothing to do with it. Thus, the Russian Ministry of Defense, or rather, the Ministry of Misinformation has reached another frontier of lies. As soon as the evidence has been collected of the insolvency of their earlier tales of Ukrainian aircraft, they jump over to the version of a Ukrainian Buk. Thus, the Russian Ministry of Defense, or rather, the Ministry of Misinformation has reached another frontier of lies Later, when the investigators call by name the whole crew of the Russian Buk, strayed in Donbas, the Russian Defense Ministry will come up with some new excuse. And it looks like it will continue indefinitely. Or until what is happening in eastern Ukraine is also called by its proper name. Until the wandering of the Russian troops in the Ukrainian lands is officially recognized as invasion.

The upgrade from a single aisle Airbus A321 aircraft will cater to strong demand to and from the capital of Saudi Arabia, offering guests more seats on a wide-body aircraft. Together with the other daily Riyadh service operated by a Boeing 777, Etihad Airways will have more than 8,700 weekly seats on the route. Flight EY317 will be operated with a B787, departing Abu Dhabi at 10:15 hrs, arriving into Riyadh at 11:15 hrs. The return flight EY318 departs Riyadh at 16:25 hrs, arriving into Abu Dhabi at 19:10 hrs. The flights will provide optimal timings for guests in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, and convenient connections to and from destinations across key markets in Europe, Indian subcontinent, Asia and Australia. The 299-seat aircraft, configured in two classes, offers award-winning cabin interiors with 28 seats in Business and 271 in Economy. Guests will be able to experience the airline’s renowned Business Studio on board. The seat, which provides guests with direct aisle access, is also equipped with an in-seat massage and air cushion control system. Business Class guests using the service can choose from three main courses, with further dine-on-demand options available. There are also specialised services onboard, including a Food & Beverage Manager in the premium cabin, multi-national cabin crew and Flying Nannies, who are able to provide support to parents travelling with young children. For B787 Economy Class passengers, the airline’s commitment to providing the best guest experiences is showcased by its ‘Smart Seats’. They have been designed to provide additional comfort through simple design features such as a ‘fixed wing’ headrest, extra seat width and individual TV monitors. Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE equipment for its B787 inflight entertainment system. Mobile connectivity with access to onboard wi-fi and seven satellite channels of live TV are also available. Kevin Knight, Etihad Airways chief strategy and planning officer, said: “The Boeing 787 is playing a key role in Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion with routes carefully selected on which to deploy this unique aircraft. We are delighted that Riyadh will soon join our 787 cities giving guests a different experience to and from Abu Dhabi, and with convenient connections to destinations across our diverse worldwide network. “The aircraft also provides significantly more cargo capacity to facilitate the movement of a greater number of goods to and from the Saudi capital. Saudi Arabia is a very important market for Etihad Airways, supporting our global expansion since the launch of services 13 years ago. Our commitment to the Saudi market has grown since we began flying to Riyadh in 2004, steadily increasing our presence to the current 63 flights each week to and from four Saudi cities.” On the Riyadh route alone, Etihad Airways has flown more than 2.5 million guests since 2004. Etihad Airways’ flights to Riyadh, Jeddah, Madinah and Dammam are complemented by Saudi codeshare partner flynas, whose dedicated services between Abu Dhabi and both Riyadh and Jeddah provide travellers with even more choice. Riyadh becomes Etihad Airways’ newest B787 destination this year following the induction of the aircraft on flights to Perth, Dusseldorf and Shanghai, with Abu Dhabi – Johannesburg set to become a Dreamliner route on 1 November. Etihad Airways’ current fleet of nine B787s also operates to Singapore, Washington DC, Brisbane and Zurich. - TradeArabia News Service   Tags: Etihad | Saudi | Dreamliner | Riyadh | Arabia | B787 | Abu | Dhabi | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Turkish Airlines to fly thrice to Cuba, Venezuela AirBaltic lowers checked-in baggage charges UAE National Day celebrations at Al Maryah Island Ramada Downtown Dubai launches new anniversary promotion Premier Inn ME deploys Ideas solutions for revenue growth SR Technics opens training centre in Abu Dhabi Dutch chef wins Etihad's 'Taste The World' title Dubai Miracle Garden all set to 'bloom' this winter ME airlines to spend $345bn to boost capacity Emirates offers LinkedIn Learning courses on ice Sharjah’s Al Bait Hotel $27m revamp on track WTM London 2016 most successful edition in event history Etihad, Hong Kong Airlines expand codeshare New executive chef for Alila Jabal Akhdar Rotana launches second hotel in Amman Etihad, Airbus to develop A380 MRO services Boeing to consolidate defence and space sites Hala Arjaan by Rotana wins top accolade Premier Inn Dubai Ibn Battuta Mall gains popularity among visitors Oman Air celebrates national day with free upgrades DoubleTree Hilton Riyadh moves ahead with Saudisation plan Dubai 'committed to global aviation growth' Omran keen on developing sultanate's hospitality sector Fairmont Nile City, Cairo receives two top awards Conrad Makkah to implement eco-friendly measures Dubai voted world’s 'Best Airport for Layovers' SPG offers members new points earning opportunity Booming’ business travel industry key to ibtm china success Casa Mia appoints new restaurant manager Gulf Air increases Hyderabad flights Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

They have been designed to provide additional comfort through simple design features such as a ‘fixed wing’ headrest, extra seat width and individual TV monitors. Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE equipment for its B787 inflight entertainment system. Mobile connectivity with access to onboard Wi-Fi and seven satellite channels of live TV are also available. Kevin Knight, Etihad Airways Chief Strategy and Planning Officer, said: “The Boeing 787 is playing a key role in Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion with routes carefully selected on which to deploy this unique aircraft. We are delighted that Riyadh will soon join our 787 cities giving guests a different experience to and from Abu Dhabi, and with convenient connections to destinations across our diverse worldwide network. “The aircraft also provides significantly more cargo capacity to facilitate the movement of a greater number of goods to and from the Saudi capital. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a very important market for Etihad Airways, supporting our global expansion since the launch of services 13 years ago. Our commitment to the Saudi market has grown since we began flying to Riyadh in 2004, steadily increasing our presence to the current 63 flights each week to and from four Saudi cities.” On the Riyadh route alone, Etihad Airways has flown more than 2.5 million guests since 2004. Etihad Airways’ flights to Riyadh, Jeddah, Madinah and Dammam are complemented by Saudi codeshare partner flynas, whose dedicated services between Abu Dhabi and both Riyadh and Jeddah provide travellers with even more choice. Riyadh becomes Etihad Airways’ newest B787 destination this year following the induction of the aircraft on flights to Perth, Dusseldorf and Shanghai, with Abu Dhabi – Johannesburg set to become a Dreamliner route on 1 November. Etihad Airways’ current fleet of nine B787s also operates to Singapore, Washington DC, Brisbane and Zurich.

The country’s Liberal government promised during last year’s election that it would launch an open competition to replace Canada’s CF-18 fighter aircraft. It pledged not to buy Lockheed Martin’s F-35 jets, as the previous Conservative government had planned to do, calling them expensive and unnecessary. While the government has yet to release details on such a competition, it requested data this summer from five companies that have fighter aircraft in production or planned production, including Lockheed and Boeing, which wants Canada to buy its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. The government sought up-to-date information on areas including capabilities and economic benefits. "The focus on data was very clear, very strong," said Marc Allen, the president of Boeing International, the unit which handles Boeing’s strategy and operations outside the United States. "It gave all of the suppliers a chance to set down in black and white what it is their platform does." Since then, Boeing has been engaged in a "ping-pong" set of questions and answers with the government, said Mr Allen. The defence minister Harjit Sajjan has said the government foresees a growing capability gap in the 2020s and that there is an urgent need to replace the CF-18s. "They know it’s imperative to solve that capability gap," said Mr Allen. "They are moving in a way that says they understand that." Mr Allen said ordinarily it can take multiple years from when an order is placed to when jets are delivered. The other potential fighter jet suppliers are Saab, Dassault Aviation, and the Eurofighter consortium , which includes Airbus. As Boeing campaigns to win the contract, it is citing the work opportunities that would be available to Canadian firms across the country if the federal government were to purchase the Super Hornet. Mr Allen did not rule out giving work to the struggling plane maker Bombardier, noting that Boeing always works with its competitors. "We’re not going to rule out anybody from the perspective of who would be a good partner," he said. Boeing earlier this month formally challenged a decision by the Danish government to pick the F-35 fighter jet over the Super Hornet, citing a flawed evaluation process. Mr Allen said that was a very particular circumstance and that Canada’s process was calibrated to ensure an accurate analysis. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Lockheed wins $6bn F-35 fighter jet deal – and it is not happy ‘All’s well that ends well’ as Canada and EU finally sign trade agreement Lockheed targets higher profits amid soaring helicopter sales Airbus fury as Poland scraps helicopters deal and gives Lockheed $3.5bn order instead More Aviation Supercars can now travel in style from Dubai with Emirates Skywheels US regional airline Republic set to fly out of bankruptcy soon Bombardier’s passenger jet woes spur high-cost refinancing Brazil approves Qatar Airways’ stake purchase in Chile-based Latam Airlines MOST VIEWED Business | All Standard Chartered cuts 150 jobs in the UAE, may lay off more by year-end Dubai expats group shows the way to managing a property portfolio What happens if Dubai tenant stays in property without signing new contract on expiry?

Radical 'Vigilant' tiltrotor drone can transform between helicopter and plane Bell says radical new craft could be in service by 2023  Will 'combine the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing aircraft'  By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 17:35 EST, 26 September 2016 | Updated: 17:53 EST, 26 September 2016 e-mail 25 shares 4 View comments Bell has unveiled a radical new tiltrotor drone that could be launched from warships to carry out attacks automatically. Called the V-247 Vigilant, Bell says it will 'combine the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft'. It boasts the craft could be in service by 2023, and is able to take off from anywhere - even a dangerous ship's deck.  Scroll down for video  Called the V-247 Vigilant,Bell says it will 'combine the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft'. VIGILANT SPECS   Single engine tiltrotor unmanned aerial system  250 knots cruise speed; 180 knots endurance speed; >300 knots at maximum continuous power Combat range: 450 nautical miles mission radius Time on station: 11 hours  Can hold a combination of fuel, armament, and sensors, up to 13,000 pounds  Air-to-air refueling  'The Bell V-247 Vigilant is the next leap in innovation making the future of aviation a reality today – it's a testament to the power and versatility of tiltrotor flight,' said Mitch Snyder, president and CEO at Bell Helicopter.  'The unmanned tiltrotor is the latest example of how we are changing the way the world flies, taking our customers into the dynamic world of next-generation aircraft.'  The aviation giant says the UAS is designed to provide 'unmatched long-endurance persistent expeditionary and surveillance capability and lethal reach, as well as runway independence to operate successfully in maritime environments and locations without secure runway availability.' The bays on the Bell V-247 Vigilant are designed to carry high definition sensors, fuel, sonar buoys, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) modules, 360-degree surface radar modules, an MK-50 torpedo or Hellfire or JAGM missiles optimally.  With its signature blade fold wing stow design, it will fit inside a DDG hangar space, and two can be loaded on a C-17 aircraft.  'Leveraging lessons learned from our extensive history and experience with tiltrotors, we have found the best available solution to fulfill the Marine Corps need for a Group 5 UAS,' said Vince Tobin, vice president, advanced tiltrotor systems at Bell Helicopter.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Billionaire space battle takes to Twitter: Jeff Bezos takes...

The aviation giant says the UAS is designed to provide 'unmatched long-endurance persistent expeditionary and surveillance capability and lethal reach, as well as runway independence to operate successfully in maritime environments and locations without secure runway availability.' Two teams - Sikorsky-Boeing with their Defiant, and Bell Helicopter-Lockheed Martin with their V280, are also vying for the lucractive contract to create a manned version of the  'supercopter'. Both are set to take off for the first time next year in the final stage of the battle to replace the Black Hawk.   The Bell Helicopter design, which is called the V-280 Valor, is an advanced tilt-rotor design that is based upon technology similar to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey  The Sikorsky-Boeing entry, called the SB-1 Defiant, is a compound helicopter design with co-axial rotors and a pusher-propeller COMPETITORS AT A GLANCE  The Sikorsky-Boeing entry, called the SB-1 Defiant, is a compound helicopter design with co-axial rotors and a pusher-propeller.   The Bell Helicopter design, which is called the V-280 Valor, is an advanced tilt-rotor design that is based upon technology similar to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey.  The new tilt-rotor is smaller, faster and much more manoeuvrable than the Osprey and has a top speed of over 300 knots. The two prototype aircraft will be built and flown as part of a project called the Joint Multi Role Technology Demonstrator Air Vehicle, which will then inform the Army's Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program to replace the long-serving Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64E Apache. The FVL program will also inform the US Navy's MH-XX program to replace the MH-60 Seahawk. Bell revealed this week it believes it's entrant could enter service in 2024.  'There's no real technology that needs to be further developed for us to be able to design and develop an aircraft that meets those requirements,' said Vince Tobin, Bell's vice president of advanced tiltrotor systems, according to DefenceOne.  'Our big push now is that, after we fly this and prove out that we can build this aircraft, that we are ready to go into engineering and manufacturing development.' The Sikorsky-Boeing team is also hoping to fly in 2017, said Doug Shidler, Sikorsky's program director for its Joint Multi-Role tech demonstrator. 'The intent of the JMR TD effort is to maximize the knowledge gain and risk reduction toward an anticipated Future Vertical Lift acquisition program,' said Dan Bailey, the Army's JMR/FVL program director when the two finalists were announced.  Two other teams led by Karem Aircraft and AVX Aircraft were not selected for continued development, but the service is still interested in their technologies. 'The Army will seek to continue technology development efforts with those teams based on resources and opportunities,' the service said. The Sikorsky-Boeing entry, called the SB-1 Defiant, is a compound helicopter design with co-axial rotors and a pusher-propeller.   The Bell Helicopter design, which is called the V-280 Valor, is an advanced tilt-rotor design that is based upon technology similar to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey.  The new tilt-rotor is smaller, faster and much more manoeuvrable than the Osprey and has a top speed of over 300 knots. The Future Vertical Lift (FVL) is a program to develop a family of military helicopters for the United States Armed Forces.  The Bell Helicopter design, which is called the V-280 Valor, is an advanced tilt-rotor design that is based upon technology similar to the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey. The Bell V280 program completed its final design and risk review period in August, and construction has already begun. Four different sizes of aircraft are to be developed, and they will  share common hardware such as sensors, avionics, engines, and weapons.  It will eventually lead to replacements for the Army's UH-60 Black Hawk, AH-64 Apache, CH-47 Chinook, and OH-58 Kiowa helicopters. The precursor for FVL is the Joint Multi-Role (JMR) helicopter program, which will provide technology demonstrations planned for 2017.  Chris Gehler, director of Bell Helicopter's advanced tilt-rotor systems, said the V280 program completed its final design and risk review period in August. Spirit Aerosystems has completed building the fuselage in Wichita, Kansas, and shipped it to Amarillo just before AUSA. 'This is real. The aircraft is coming together now,' Gehler told Defense News.  more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Seabed 'lifts' out of the water following NZ earthquake Watch video Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Watch video New Zealand earthquake transforms road into cliff Watch video Good pup!

The design will have a cruise speed of 250 kn (290 mph; 460 km/h), but less range due to using the 'old' T55 engine.  The SB-1 will be quick and nimble, with fast acceleration and deceleration, side-to-side movement, and hovering with the tail up and nose down. The Defiant demonstrator will be powered by the Honeywell T55, which powers the CH-47 Chinook. It will be slightly modified to better operate at slower speeds down to 85% rpm. 'We've got all kinds of pieces and parts, different technologies and things that are yielding today and starting to flow to Amarillo.' 'About this time next year,' he said, the aircraft will look ready to fly and the team will be running pre-flight checks, ground runs, shake tests and other reliability activities. The U.S. Army-led Joint Multi-Role Demonstrator (JMR-TD) program is the science and technology precursor to the Department of Defense's Future Vertical Lift program expected to replace 2,000 to 4,000 medium-class utility and attack helicopters.  The U.S. Army and Department of Defense are seeking leap-ahead capabilities and have identified a speed of 230+ knots as a key discriminating capability.  The U.S. Army's current helicopter fleet cruises at 140 knots.  BELL HELICOPTER/LOCKHEED MARTIN'S V280  more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Seabed 'lifts' out of the water following NZ earthquake Watch video Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Watch video New Zealand earthquake transforms road into cliff Watch video Good pup!

(Stephen Mally/The Gazette) George C. Ford The Gazette More stories from George Sep 26, 2016 at 3:43 pm | Print View CEDAR RAPIDS — Rockwell Collins has been awarded a contract to provide touch-screen flight displays for all five flight deck displays on the new Boeing 777X jetliner. It will mark the first time a commercial air transport aircraft will be equipped with this type of flight displays. The displays are expected to make the flight deck more intuitive for pilots and more efficient for flight operations. The 777X touch screen flight displays will be multi-touch, allowing two pilots can touch the same screen at the same time. The touch screens also will employ resistive technology, requiring a firm touch to avoid unintentional interaction with the displays. The bezel or frame surrounding the displays will provide bracing features for operating the aircraft during turbulence. As Boeing’s display supplier on all of its next-generation aircraft, including the 777X, 787 Dreamliner, 737 MAX and the 747-8, Rockwell Collins is providing a common graphical foundation for pilots across all the aircraft. The Cedar Rapids avionics, communications and information management systems provider was the first to certify touch screen primary flight displays for commercial aviation on a business aircraft. Boeing has 300 orders and commitments for the 777X, with first deliveries planned for 2020. Rockwell Collins previously was awarded contracts to provide weather radar, select flight controls, a secure server router and optional dual head-up guidance system for the Boeing 777X.

(AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) SEATTLE (AP) — Five people were killed in a shooting this weekend at a Macy’s store in a mall north of Seattle. Authorities do not plan to make their identities public until Tuesday, but details about four of the victims have been reported by some of their employers and Washington state media. Here’s what is known about them: ___ SARAI LARA The 16-year-old high school sophomore was the youngest victim of the gunman who opened fire in the department store in the small city of Burlington. Lara survived cancer and was told by her doctor that she was doing well, her mother, Evangelina Lara, told The Seattle Times (https://goo.gl/YMQvxk ) through a translator. The family has Mexican roots, and Sarai Lara was proud of her heritage, her mother said. She had a wide network of friends at school and helped at home, caring for her 5-year-old sister. Born in Mount Vernon just south of Burlington, the teen was described by her mother as bright, all smiles and her “right hand” at home. “It’s not fair what happened to her,” Evangelina Lara said. ___ CHUCK EAGAN Eagan was set to retire next year after working for decades as a maintenance worker for Boeing Co., his aunt Carol Thrush told The Associated Press. Boeing said in a statement that “we are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleague.” Eagan worked for 41 years at the company’s commercial airplanes division in Everett, Boeing said. Thrush described Eagan, 61, as kind and generous with a beautiful smile. Her parents raised him in the tiny town of Unity in southeastern Oregon before they moved to the Seattle area when he was about 11. “He traveled with Boeing all over the world, doing repairs on airplanes,” said Thrush, 77. “He was an all-around great guy.” Thrush said her nephew told her that Eagan and his wife were eating dinner and shopping at the mall. They had made their way to Macy’s when the shooter opened fire. The couple ran, but Eagan’s wife fell down as she was trying to get away. Eagan was shot as he helped her, Thrush said. Eagan had two daughters and three grandchildren. ___ BELINDA GALDE Galde, 64, was a longtime probation officer with the Snohomish County District Court who dedicated her life to helping those “who stumbled along the way in life,” her colleagues said. In a statement, the court called Galde “a devoted and esteemed public servant.” She started working there in 1989. “She was an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her co-workers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live,” the court said. ___ SHAYLA MARTIN Shayla Martin, 52, of Mount Vernon, was working in the cosmetics department when the gunman opened fire, her older sister Karen Van Horn told The Daily Herald (https://goo.gl/PPA9ef ). Van Horn, who works at the newspaper, said her family received official word Sunday that Martin was among the dead. Officials said a body with Martin’s work name tag was found at the scene, Van Horn said. Martin was an avid reader, regularly devouring two or three books a week, said Van Horn, who described her sister as classy, sweet and independent.   Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Google Tumblr More Send to Kindle LinkedIn Pocket Like this: Like Loading...

Win McNamee/Getty Images The conventional wisdom about Donald Trump is that on the debate stage and off, he’s unpredictable — so unpredictable that Martin O’Malley, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, told the Atlantic’s James Fallows that Trump is like “a monkey with a machine gun.” But the truth is that Trump’s 11 primary debates predicted his performance in the first presidential debate on September 26. In every debate appearance so far, he’s used a handful of tricks that, when they worked, did so because they aren’t the way politicians usually act. Trump approaches every debate like the world’s most high-stakes reality TV show, and the part he’s playing isn’t that of a US president, but of a winner. Trump creates catchphrases. He crafts narratives about heroes and villains. He sprinkles in commentary and asides to the audience. He stirs up interpersonal drama. And he appeared to firmly believe — like the reality TV contestants we love to hate — that he was the star of the show. It worked in the primaries, where he was able to stand out from the crowd, steamrolling opponents and flustering fact-checkers. But the same tactics that carried him to the Republican nomination faltered when Trump was confronted with a single opponent. He couldn’t fade into the background when the discussion turned to policy. He couldn’t rely on the fact that, eventually, the moderators would have to move on to someone else. Even worse, the fact that his reactions are repetitive and predictable made him easy to bait. To fare better against Hillary Clinton in Sunday’s second debate and in the third debate on October 19, Trump might have to develop some new tricks. But it appears to be difficult to him to abandon the formulas that got him this far. 1) Catchphrases: Trump speaks in memorable but meaningless three-word slogans Politicians have talking points. Reality TV stars, and Trump, have catchphrases. By now, you know his: “Build the wall.” “Bring jobs back.” “Take the oil.” “We don’t have a country.” “Make America great again.” At debates and at rallies, Trump returned to those themes like a band being asked to play “Freebird,” never straying too far from his greatest hits. Despite his reputation for being a man who would say just about anything on the debate stage, during the 11 primary debates he attended, he did the opposite. He strung the same catchphrases and stock vocabulary together into short, punchy, grammatically and syntactically unlikely sentences that were the opposite of political rhetoric. For example, here’s his closing statement from the fifth primary debate, in Las Vegas: I'm the most solid person up here. I built a tremendous company, and all I want to do is make America great again. I don't want our country to be taken away from us, and that's what's happening. The policies that we've suffered under other presidents have been a disaster for our country. We want to make America great again. During the primaries, Trump stuck out onstage because he didn’t sound like anyone else, and because his signature catchphrases stuck in your head. This was particularly true in the largest debates, when no one got much time to talk and other candidates’ answers tended to blend together. His penchant for short, simple, punchy sentences, though, contrasts with Clinton as well. The first presidential debate stayed away from some of Trump’s signature issues, particularly immigration. But Trump still responded, when possible, in his signature style: Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs. Those aren’t all the same stock phrases Trump had previously used. But they rely on the same three-word rhythm. And when Trump could use a catchphrase or two, he seized on the opportunity, as when he was asked about crime: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country. The problem is that in longer debates, Trump can’t only rely on catchphrases — and Clinton may very well embrace the contrast in their styles. 2) Mythmaking: Trump turns tough policy questions into simple stories Most politicians take a story about a specific example and then pivot to using that narrative to enforce a broader point. This is what Hillary Clinton was Trump does the opposite. He takes a broader point and boils it down to a specific story told in comic book terms about good and evil. Trump knows that people watch reality TV for the same reason they love sports and fairy tales. The easiest story to follow is a simple morality tale about heroes and villains. So when Trump was supposed to be selling a policy, he’d instead tell a story. Here’s his response during the sixth primary debate, in South Carolina, to the accusation that he was out of touch with conservative values because he was a New Yorker — something he’d already answered concisely by pointing out that William F. Buckley lived in Manhattan: When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it. And the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. Though 9/11 turned into a story about heroes, mostly Trump’s stories from the primary debates were about villains. ISIS was cutting off heads and drowning people in metal cages. The families of the 9/11 attackers were tipped off before the fact and flew home (which did not happen). During the first presidential debate, his penchant for storytelling was most on display when discussing crime. Trump was asked how to heal the racial divide in America. Instead of reflecting on the question, he started telling stories about cities where things were going wrong: In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Particularly during the primary debates, Trump often wasn’t telling true stories. But the truth didn’t seem to matter so much as whether the story felt true. They have what Stephen Colbert calls “truthiness” or sociologist Arlie Hochschild calls the “deep story” — the stories are a way of explaining the world that feels true to Trump’s supporters. The story is a parable that’s meant to communicate a larger point — to his fans, fact-checking it is like asking the prodigal son’s father to show proof that he really killed the fatted calf. 3) The Gish Gallop: Trump’s endless parade of falsehoods The Gish Gallop, named after a believer in creationism, is a debate technique when you cite so much “evidence” that is misleading or wrong that your opponent can’t correct all of it and still make any of his or her own points. Trump is a master of this technique, and amplifies it by being unwilling to give an inch when challenged. During the fifth primary debate, nearly every substantive answer he gave included a wildly false claim: Trump claimed that people are “pouring across the Southern border.” (Border crossings dropped dramatically during the recession and have stayed at near-record lows since.) He alleged that among Syrian refugees and migrants, “tens of thousands of people” had “cellphones with ISIS flags on them.” (This came from a Norwegian newspaper report that an unspecified number of photos of executions and ISIS flags were found on migrants’ phones; the Norwegian police pointed out there might be benign reasons to have them, such as bearing witness to what they’d seen.) He claimed “numerous people … knew what was going on” before the San Bernardino attacks and that “they saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor, ammunition all over the place.” (There is no evidence this was true.) He claimed that before 9/11, “friends, family, girlfriends, were sent back … they knew what was going on. They went home and they wanted to watch their boyfriends on television.” (None of the hijackers even had family in the US before the attacks; this is an utterly false story.) And he repeated a falsehood he’s told many times since then: “I was totally against going into Iraq because you're going to destabilize the Middle East. I called it. I called it very strongly.” (Trump supported the Iraq War.) These falsehoods often go unchallenged. But even when they don’t, Trump utterly refuses to back down, as in this bizarre exchange from the third primary debate over whether he really persuaded CNBC to shorten its running time: TRUMP: Let me give you one quick example. These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours. I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30-second ad. I went out and said, it's ridiculous… Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here. Not bad. JOHN HARWOOD: Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours. Sen. Rubio? TRUMP: That's not right. That is absolutely not right. You know that. That is not right. As PolitiFact explained, CNBC had planned for two hours of debate time, plus commercial breaks; the Trump and Carson campaigns demanded it be two hours including commercials, a marginal difference. But when Trump is challenged on his facts, he never backs down or even admits he’s exaggerating. During the first presidential debate, this was the technique Trump used when he was pressed on why he’d continued to publicly doubt whether Obama was born in the United States: But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce. This is a bizarre melange of insinuations and falsehoods. Clinton and her 2008 campaign were not involved in accusing Obama of having been born abroad. Blumenthal reportedly mentioned the rumor to someone at the McClatchy news service, but he did not “send a reporter” to check it out. Debunking all of this, though, would have taken up considerable time, and so most of it was allowed to stand. 4) Drama: How Trump riled up antagonists It wasn’t just policy questions that Trump reduced to heroes and villains. The debate stage, too, became a place for him to pick out an antagonist and engage in a dominance ritual with him (it was always a “him”), straining to shout him down or humiliate him. The sole point of many of these displays seemed to be to get attention. Often, they devolved into shouting matches over who was talking, as during the fifth debate: TRUMP: Am I talking or are you talking, Jeb? BUSH: I'm talking right now. I'm talking. TRUMP: You can go back. You're not talking. You interrupted me. BUSH: September 30, you said… TRUMP: Are you going to apologize, Jeb? No. Am I allowed to finish? Trump would also pick out one or two antagonists during any given debate — always some combination of Bush, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz — to try to take down. The point wasn’t to get them to concede a policy point to him, but to establish that Trump was the one who should be allowed to talk. Trump used personal insults and accusations of interrupting. He turned attacks against him; at the 11th Republican debate on Fox News, when Rubio criticized Trump University as a scam and a fraud, Trump retorted, “He scammed the people of Florida. He scammed people. He doesn't vote. He doesn't show up for the US Senate. He doesn't vote. He scammed the people. He defrauded the people of Florida.” Usually, nobody came out of these exchanges looking good. But Trump figured out that, in primary debates as on reality TV, the cameras love the contestant who knows how to get attention. And Trump is great at getting attention. Early in the first presidential debate, Trump was able to pull Clinton into some of these exchanges — and the first one ended badly for her: TRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to... CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald... TRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it. CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state... TRUMP: Excuse me. CLINTON: And I have done a lot... TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. CLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion. “That is your opinion” is not, shall we say, a stinging comeback. As the debate went on, Clinton got pulled into fewer of these exchanges. Perhaps she realized that it’s very hard to win one head-to-head against Trump — and that both candidates involved just end up looking worse. 5) Running commentary: Trump lets the voters peek behind the curtain At nearly every primary debate, Trump would turn to what he considered the ultimate source of authority: his poll numbers. But this was part of a larger pattern of providing running commentary on the race, his opponents’ strategies, and sometimes his own — as if, having participated in the drama on the main stage, he was now filming the talking head segment where he turns to the camera for an interview about what just happened. Citing his poll numbers, which he did constantly, is part of this — appealing to what he considers the ultimate arbiter, popularity, to sum up his standings. But Trump also provides more running meta-commentary on the process of running for president, hinting that he’s letting the audience in on a big secret. For example, during the 10th primary debate, after he said that insurance executives didn’t like his proposal to repeal Obamacare in favor of letting insurers sell across state lines: I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He's not laughing so much anymore. Hi. Even if Trump is lying about everything else, his honesty about his own cynicism can come off as refreshing. But it’s another way that, as a showman, he understands how to get the public’s attention. During the first presidential debate, Trump didn’t rely as much on this strategy, perhaps because the polls haven’t been favorable to him. 6) Filibusters: Trump runs out the clock before he has to give details Politicians are experts at not answering the question they were asked. The classic move is to call it a “very good question” and pivot to a somewhat related subject on which they can speak more expertly. Trump’s version of this is a bit different, because he doesn’t seem to care if he sounds expert at all, so long as he’s eating up the clock and making it less likely that he’ll be pressed for details. During the primary debates, he often would ramble enough to fill up nearly all the time he was allotted, then throw out a catchphrase or generalization. From the second primary debate: JAKE TAPPER: What would you do right now if you were president, to get the Russians out of Syria? TRUMP: So, number one, they have to respect you. He has absolutely no respect for President Obama. Zero. Syria’s a mess. You look at what’s going on with ISIS in there, now think of this: we’re fighting ISIS. ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants. I would talk to him. I would get along with him. I believe — and I may be wrong, in which case I’d probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with. We don’t get along with China. We don’t get along with the heads of Mexico. We don’t get along with anybody, and yet, at the same time, they rip us left and right. They take advantage of us economically and every other way. We get along with nobody. I will get along, I think, with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable — stable world. This is the strategy Trump turned to when he was asked about cybersecurity during the first presidential debate. In the answer to a question and follow-up from moderator Lester Holt, he referred to the issue as “the cyber,” referenced his preteen son, suggested “someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds” could have hacked into the Democratic National Committee, and mentioned how many generals and admirals had endorsed him. He did not answer the question of who is behind the growing trend of cyber attacks, or suggest how he would fight it. And although moderators, at both the primary debates and on September 26, pressed Trump to actually answer the question, eventually, they had to give up and move on. These word-salad answers are not victories for Trump. But they play off his cast-iron resistance to embarrassment. Trump seems to think that as long as he’s talking, he’s winning. 7) Egomania: Trump only cares when the conversation is about him Donald Trump never appears to doubt that he’s the main attraction, the center of attention in every room he’s in. During the primary debates, this translated to Trump engaging quickly if he were personally named or insulted but fading into the background — and often appearing not to pay attention at all — when candidates turned to other topics. During the fourth debate in Milwaukee, several candidates had a spirited exchange about budgetary policy. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio scuffled over whether Rubio’s proposed child tax credit was conservative, then went on to debate military spending. Cruz piggybacked on Rubio’s point — that defending the US through military spending was a necessity — to name the programs he’d like to eliminate, and Carly Fiorina spoke up for zero-based budgeting. It was a dense, interesting conversation that exposed real differences among the candidates. Trump didn’t try to cut into it until he was called on, and then gave a vague answer that suggested he was paying the bare minimum of attention: “We all have a different tax plan. Some I don’t totally agree with. One thing we understand, each one of those tax plans is better than the mess that we have right now.” Trump not paying attention went beyond fading into the background. In Miami, at the final debate, Rubio went after Trump for saying he could save Social Security by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, correctly pointing out the math on that was ludicrous. In a minute-long answer, Rubio said Trump’s numbers “don’t add up” or “won’t add up” three times. CNN’s Dana Bash then turned to Trump, and he appeared to have missed the entire exchange: BASH: Sen. Rubio says that your numbers don't add up. What's your response, Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Well, I don't know if he's saying that. Trump doesn’t seem to be joking; he doesn’t pause to wait for audience reaction. And it fits with his pattern of rarely responding to what other candidates have said unless they mention him by name. But Trump could count on a few certainties in those early debates: The conversation would have to move on. He could run out the clock with filibusters, give vague answers, and be confident that he’d face at most one or two follow-up questions. He would find an opponent willing to rise to his bait, participating in his version of testosterone-laden drama. If the debate turned to policy, he could fade into the background. In the first matchup with Clinton, these strategies didn’t work nearly as well. His attention and focus frayed after 30 minutes of intense back-and-forth, and there was no way for him to fade into the background. He was expected to answer a question beyond simply giving catchphrases. And his attempts to start personal fights with Clinton backfired as often as they succeeded. If Trump is going to perform better in the second and third debates, his track record so far suggests his usual tricks won’t be enough. Was this article helpful?

The airline’s last Boeing 747 commercial flight is scheduled for a round trip from Hong Kong to Haneda Airport in Tokyo on September 30. After the plane returns from Japan, Cathay’s 747 fleet will be officially replaced by the Boeing 777-300ER, which is slightly smaller but with more economical twin-jet engines. Hong Kong says farewell to giant of aviation The Boeing 747, dubbed the “queen of the skies”, is recognised as one of the most important inventions of the 20th century, making long-haul travel affordable for passengers. The double-decker jet can carry more than 400 passengers and has a flight range of 7,260 nautical miles compared to about 189 passengers and 5,750 miles by its predecessor, the Boeing 707. But current aviation trends seem to favour lighter and more economical jets. Tony Britton, an aircraft project manager at Cathay, said the company now flies to smaller airports, so ultra-large aircraft are no longer suitable. Britton added that the number of flights by the new 777s would be increased. “We now have five flights to London. We prefer connectivity and frequency now,” he said. Cathay has been retiring 747 passenger jets since 2005. But Britton said 23 freighter versions of the 747s will stay in service with the newest model expected to serve the company’s air freight business for another 25 years. Boeing is about to emerge a huge winner from China’s online shopping boom The retired 747s will be sent to the United States and United Kingdom to be disassembled with valuable components recycled. Cathay owned up to 25 such passenger jets in the early 2000s. Inflight service manager Monica Tong, who began her flight attendant career on a 747, said the plane also contributed to her profession. She benefitted from Cathay’s expansion as the arrival of the 747s in 1979 helped the airline quadruple its annual passenger volumes by 1995. “It was my dream to go beyond Asia and travel the world, and it was thanks to the 747 that I was able to do so,” Tong said. Her favourite memory of the 747 is its spiral staircase, which connected the two decks. “I remember kids used to play rock-paper-scissors on the stairs,” Tong said. “The winner of each round went up a step, and kids competed to get to the upper deck.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Cathay to retire 747 fleet as time flies   Most Popular Viewed 1 Barred Hong Kong localists vow to keep fighting after High Court decision 2 Game changes in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council after ban of two localist lawmakers 3 Dream of owning a home is over for most young Hong Kong people 4 Tycoon Joseph Lau reveals details of breakup with ex-girlfriend in full-page newspaper announcement 5 Joseph Lau slams ‘greedy’ ex-girlfriend in video interview, confirms he wrote newspaper statement about breakup Shared 1 Barred Hong Kong localists vow to keep fighting after High Court decision 2 Tycoon Joseph Lau reveals details of breakup with ex-girlfriend in full-page newspaper announcement 3 Joseph Lau slams ‘greedy’ ex-girlfriend in video interview, confirms he wrote newspaper statement about breakup 4 Dream of owning a home is over for most young Hong Kong people 5 Hong Kong’s disqualified localist pair vow to appeal and seek injunction to stop their Legco seats being declared vacant Commented 1 Independence advocates are putting Hong Kong on a dangerous path, former Jockey Club chairman warns 2 Watch: Local soccer fans chant ‘We are Hong Kong!’ during China national anthem before EAFF game against North Korea 3 A moment of madness: Hong Kong defenders go to sleep and concede soft goal in defeat by North Korea 4 Will China’s plan to get everyone in the country exercising make an impact on Hong Kong? 5 Take that Trump!

Avcorp announced the deal earlier this week. The contracts are for a variety of components – doors, panels and spoilers – for Boeing’s 737 MAX and 777X passenger jets. Avcorp, which is headquartered in Delta, has fabrication plants in Ontario and Los Angeles. The company has not yet decided where the bulk of the new work will be done. “Some of the work will certainly be done in Delta,” said Peter George, who was named CEO in 2014 as part of a management reorganisation. “I think we’ll make a final decision later this year on selecting the manufacturing sites for the majority of the contract that has just been announced. We will definitely have to add people to the company to execute these orders over the coming years.” Avcorp employs a total of 700 people, half of whom work in Delta. On large orders like the Boeing contract, the company typically takes several months in development before it starts production. George points out that large contracts like the newest one with Boeing are often extended with future orders. “What we’ve announced is just the firm contracted period, but it’s been customary for us to extend those contracts over and over again, especially with Boeing.” The Boeing contract isn’t the only large one that Avcorp has won in recent years. It also won a C$500 million (US 379.7 million) contract a few years ago to make components for the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35 stealth fighter. There is some question, however, whether Canadian aerospace companies like Avcorp will continue to receive orders on the F-35 project if the federal government decides not to go with the F-35 as a replacement for Canada’s aging CF-18 fighter jets. Initially, the Trudeau government announced it was considering buying the F/A-18 Super Hornet, which is made by Boeing. George said the aerospace industry wants to see the decision base on an open competition. “I think there’s a consensus in Canadian aerospace that the best thing for Canada, because there’s so many factors to be considered, is just an open and competitive process,” George said.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Beijing to interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy, senior adviser confirms 2 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election 3 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers 4 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 5 Xi Jinping warns Communist Party would be ‘overthrown’ if Taiwan’s independence push left unchecked Shared 1 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 2 Beijing to interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy, senior adviser confirms 3 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 4 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers 5 The C-word: why Hong Kong localists have offended all Chinese Commented 1 Hong Kong oath-taking saga shows ugly side of city’s colonial legacy 2 Beijing to interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy, senior adviser confirms 3 Xi Jinping warns Communist Party would be ‘overthrown’ if Taiwan’s independence push left unchecked 4 Lock them up: localist thugs have brought things to a new low with their mindless violence 5 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers Promotions Your FREE copy of Home Essentials 2017 now!

Authorities do not plan to make their identities public until Tuesday, but details about three of the victims have been reported by Washington state media. Here's what is known about them: ___ SARAI LARA: A security guard working at the Cascade Mall places flowers at a makeshift memorial on Sunday, Sept. 25, 2016, in Burlington, Wash., to the five victims killed in a shooting at the mall on Friday. The 20-year-old man suspected of killing the five people with a rifle at a Macy's makeup counter had a string of run-ins with the law in recent years, including charges he assaulted his stepfather. (AP Photo/Stephen Brashear) The 16-year-old high school sophomore was the youngest victim of the gunman who opened fire in department store in the small city of Burlington. Born in Mount Vernon just south of Burlington, Lara was described by her mother Evangelina as bright, all smiles and her mother's "right hand" at home for the family. The teen survived cancer and was told by her doctor that she was doing well, Evangelina Lara told The Seattle Times( https://goo.gl/YMQvxk) through a translator. The family has Mexican roots, and Sarai Lara was proud of her heritage, her mother said. She had a wide network of friends at school and helped at home, caring for year 5-year-old sister. "It's not fair what happened to her," Evangelina Lara said. ___ CHUCK EAGAN: Eagan was a longtime Boeing Co. maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, his aunt, Carol Thrush told ( http://bit.ly/2cYDJn0 ) The Seattle Times. She said Eagan and his wife were out for a dinner and shopping at the mall. They had made their way to Macy's when the shooter opened fire. Thrush said Eagan and his wife ran, but his wife fell down as she was trying to get away. Eagan was shot as he helped his wife, Thrush said. Thrush said Eagan had two daughters and three grandchildren. He planned to retire from Boeing next year and hoped to travel. ___ BELINDA GALDE: Galde, 64, was a longtime probation officer with the Skagit County District Court. The court in a statement described Galde as "an amazingly kind and caring individual who was much adored by her friends, her coworkers and the thousands of probationers who she helped find a better way to live."

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton prepare to take the stage Monday for the first of three debates before the election, RealClearPolitics spoke with two veterans of the Republican primary about their impressions after having faced Trump in that setting. Michael Steel, a former senior adviser to Jeb Bush, and Frank Sadler, Carly Fiorina’s campaign manager, pointed to Trump’s debating style — confident, if vague on details — as his greatest asset. “I think it’s a combination of skills honed over his years as an entertainer — a combination of bravado and shamelessness,” said Steel. They agreed Trump has an unusually good ear for sound bites and confrontations that will capture the media’s attention, often to his advantage. Meanwhile, they noted his uncanny ability to dodge details, or even his own past statements, without consequence. Both were struck by a moment during the second GOP presidential primary debate, hosted by CNN at the Ronald Reagan Library, when conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump what his priority would be among the nuclear triad, meaning would he beef up the land, sea, and air missiles that can deliver nuclear warheads. Trump, apparently unfamiliar with the term, spoke for a few minutes about nuclear proliferation and the Iraq War, before concluding: “Nuclear is just the power — the devastation is very important to me." A response like that might have been damning for another candidate, but it did not stick to Trump — foreshadowing fundamental challenges on the debate stage for his GOP rivals, and now Clinton.  Michael Steel, former senior adviser to Jeb Bush: [Trump] managed to come up with words that sort of formed sentences, but [when] asked a very specific policy-based question, an important one, he had no response. He managed to string together words. He never gets that deer-in-the-headlights look, even when he clearly does not know what he’s talking about. I don’t remember him ever being flummoxed. At the North Charleston debate, he had an answer on Boeing and trade jobs that showed some preparation [Boeing is a major employer in South Carolina and there have been tensions over an attempt to unionize the workers. Trump said in the debate that these jobs could move to China.] It’s an obvious attack given the huge Boeing plant right up the road from that venue, that these are good-paying SC jobs that you’re essentially going to throw away. And he had a response about Boeing now having to do manufacturing in China. And what he said wasn’t accurate, but it had a kernel of truth to it and was based on a relatively recent news story, which suggested to me he was doing some kind of traditional debate prep, in the sense that that was an obvious attack given the location and he had a factual-ish response. Secretary Clinton needs to be prepared for Trump to say things that are wildly factually inaccurate. I think she needs to be prepared for the fact that he is most dangerous when he is on the defensive. If she feels like she lands a blow or is scoring points, that’s when they need to be most worried about him launching a personal attack or saying something outlandish. [A debate moderator needs to have] a big personality, because in addition to being completely fluid on the facts, [Trump’s] perfectly happy to walk over you. He’s got a lot of skills of an entertainer, of a television personality, that make it very difficult for traditional candidates to debate him. He hates being told he’s wrong, he hates being challenged factually or those kind of things, but I don’t recall him ever losing his temper. He’ll roll his eyes, he’ll interrupt, he’ll talk over people. Those are a lot of things that would not traditionally be considered presidential, but I don’t remember him hurting himself that badly. People expect him to be undisciplined, and I don’t recall him ever really having a bad moment like that. Trump does his worst when there’s that consistent focus on him. A strong, well-informed moderator and a single opponent is probably a much worse format for Donald Trump. Frank Sadler, former campaign manager for Carly Fiorina: Hugh Hewitt asked Donald Trump about the nuclear triad, which had a very specific answer to it. Trump doesn’t know the answer and gives his made-for-TV answer, and a lot of the people watching think it’s completely great. I know Hugh Hewitt knows the answer to the question. And I do remember feeling like, if that had been Mitt Romney and he had said that, things would have been a lot different. I was like, wow, that’s not the right answer, Hugh Hewitt knows it’s not the right answer, and yet it didn’t seem to matter at the moment. If the goal is, let’s really understand how these folks are going to tackle policy in the administration, if that’s really what you want, to get somehow a deeper dive into what they think about policy, then I think you probably have to handle the debate differently than if it were Mitt Romney there or John McCain. The expectation is that, yeah, Donald Trump is going to say something that probably isn’t politically correct, or sexist, or was a little off the cuff, but [viewers seem to let him off the hook and tell themselves] that’s not really what he means, he’s just not as articulate. With Mitt Romney, everything was scripted, so anytime he misspoke it was a much bigger deal. Absolutely to his credit, [Trump] has a very good grasp of how to handle the spotlight, how to handle the media. I don’t mean that in a condescending way to the media, but he’s very gifted at understanding how to take advantage of those moments. It’s different than how other people have done it, and he’s very astute at that. If the debate is not about diving deep into policy, really getting in the weeds on this stuff, I do think this is set up much better for Donald Trump than it is for [Clinton]. It’s weird to use this word, but he is authentic. You are seeing who he is, right? Take it or leave it, it is what it is. Hillary has been immersed in the policy world for 30 years. She’s incredibly studied. She knows this stuff. She’s brilliant when it comes to policy. I don’t agree with her policy stances, but I absolutely think that she’s given serious thought over the years to policy. If the debate is about how you make one policy decision over another, that’s fine, she’ll be great. I don’t suspect that’s what this is, and so this is about relating to the voter.

Samsung will issue a global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone as soon as this weekend after its investigation on explosion claims found batteries were at fault, according to South Korea's Yonhap News. (AP Photo/ahn Young-joon) Samsung's Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from iPhones to Tesla cars to Boeing jetliners. Blame chemistry and the fact that the batteries we rely on for everyday life are prone to leaking and even bursting into flame if damaged, defective or exposed to excessive heat. That's because lithium-ion batteries store a lot of energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls. If something happens to those separators, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. Samsung hasn't specified exactly what caused the fires that led to therecall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s Thursday beyond calling it a "battery cell issue ." Still, lithium batteries are so ubiquitous that ordinary users of phones and computers shouldn't worry. Research suggests that you're more likely to get hurt by a kitchen grease fire or a drunk driver than the battery powering your iPhone, Kindle or laptop. "It's not like we live in a world where people's smartphones spontaneously combust," said Ramon Llamas, research manager of research firm IDC's mobile phones team. He said owners of Galaxy Note 7s should err on the side of caution and contact Samsung for a replacement that doesn't run the same risk. Here's a look at other notable incidents when lithium batteries by themselves or in electronics have caused problems. ON AIRPLANES There have been dozens of aircraft fires caused by lithium batteries, so many that the batteries are no longer welcome as cargo on passenger flights. In one of the most recent incidents, a Fiji Airways Boeing 737 was preparing for takeoff from Melbourne, Australia, when smoke was discovered coming from the cargo bay. The plane was evacuated and the cargo unloaded. The source of the fire turned out to be lithium-ion batteries in a passenger's checked bags. Hoverboards and e-cigarettes are banned from flights for the same reason. TESLA In August, a Tesla electric car caught fire during a promotional tour in southwest France. Tesla said in a statement that it is "working with the authorities to establish the facts" about the fire. The driver was quoted in local newspaper Sud Ouest as saying he answered a Facebook ad offering test drives of the Model S sedan. The driver said he saw smoke, and the three people aboard got out before seeing it catch fire. Tesla hasn't officially found fault with the battery. But in 2013 , it faced questions when several Model S sedans caught fire after road debris damaged their batteries. Tesla wound up strengthening the battery shield on new and existing cars. HOVERBOARDS Hoverboards, or self-balancing scooters, have been linked with at least 99 electrical fires in the U.S., according to the the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Hoverboards might be more susceptible than other products to battery fires because they come under more duress than other electronic devices like computers. Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers dumped the products after videos of burning hoverboards went viral. But they reopened sales this year after passing new fire-safety tests. COMPUTER BATTERIES In June HP recalled nearly 50,000 HP, Compaq, HP ProBook, HP ENVY, Compaq Presario, and HP Pavilion computers after seven reports of battery packs overheating, melting or charring, including four reports of property damage totaling about $4,000.

With biofuel potential limited and emissions rising, the need for industry to act is urgent. Hopes rest on a global UN carbon offset scheme to be negotiated at the ICAO summit this week - but critics remain unconvinced There have been around 2,500 flights powered by biofuels, while aviation emissions are expected to quadruple by 2050. Photograph: Jeffrey Milstein/Gatwick Airport/PA John Vidal Tuesday 27 September 2016 06.24 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close When a South Africa Airways scheduled flight flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town last month, it carried nearly 300 passengers. Neither the passengers or the pilots would have noticed any difference between that flight and any other. But instead of the usual petroleum-based jet fuel, the plane was burning thousands of litres of a clear liquid derived from the oil of nicotine-free tobacco plants grown by farmers on acres of under-used land in the country’s Limpopo province. Boeing, KLM, South African Airways, the Dutch government and others who partnered in the trial were cock-a-hoop with the results, which came as part of something called Project Solaris. It appeared that the fuel was not only efficient, but it was also more or less “sustainable”, because it did not take up farmland needed to grow food or lead to deforestation or ecological problems. “It showed that a low-carbon aviation biofuel could be be grown that will not affect the environment and could reward farmers,” said Joost Van Lier, a director of South African Sunchem biofuel development, one of the project’s partners. The tobacco fuel used was much more expensive than regular jet fuel, but because many airlines have committed to reducing CO2 emissions and substituting biofuels for some of their jet fuel by 2020, Project Solaris hopes to ramp up the acreage of tobacco grown to eventually produce millions of litres of the fuel in other southern African countries such as Malawi. So far, there have been around 2,500 successful flights fuelled by biofuels. In March, United Airlines became the first US airline to use biofuel for regularly scheduled commercial flights from Los Angeles airport, and in June Alaska Airlines flew commercial flights using biofuel based on isobutanol produced from corn. “Oslo airport now supplies airlines with alternative fuels for regular daily flights. Los Angeles is following and we expect John F Kennedy and other New York airports to stream from 2019,” said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, a coalition of aviation industry companies. But despite successful tests and trials with different crops and waste streams, is there any hope in the forseeable future of aviation biofuels taking off on the scale needed to make even the slightest dent in the 300bn litres of jet fuel used worldwide every year? Worldwide, flights produced nearly 800m tonnes of CO2 in 2015, or up to 5% of all CO2 emissions. “No credible scenarios exist for large-scale production of biofuels at present,” said Carlos Calvo Ambel, an energy analyst with Brussels-based watchdog group Transport & Environment. “So far, only a handful of companies produce renewable jet fuel on a commercial scale, and a single airport , Oslo, is set up to provide it.” International aviation and shipping werenot mentioned in the Paris agreement, so it is unclear how their rapidly growing emissions are to be addressed. But the need for the industry to adopt a global scheme is seen as urgent if there is any hope of meeting the Paris agreement’s aspiration of holding temperature rises to 1.5C. As it is, the current industry projections expect aviation emissions to quadruple, potentially to account for 22% of global emissions by 2050. Instead of relying on biofuels, governments are pinning their hopes on a UN global carbon offset scheme. This is to be negotiated this week in Montreal when 191 governments meet for the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) summit. A draft scheme is backed by US, Canada, Mexico, EU countries including the UK, and Singapore. According to Transport & Environment, the US wants the new deal to cover as many countries as possible. “Its strategy has been to weaken the agreement’s environmental effectiveness so as to attract more states. China is pursuing a similar strategy, and it has yet to commit itself to signing up,” it said. But there are grave reservations among NGOs that an offset scheme, which could see other industrial sectors cutting emissions to allow aviation to continue growing, is not ambitious enough and may not even work. The proposal in the draft text released earlier this month defines a voluntary “pilot and implementation” period from 2021-27 after which countries would have to join in. “One of the discussions in Montreal will be whether to include Redd [Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation] offsets [offsets based on avoiding deforestation] in ICAO’s offsetting scheme. As a way of addressing climate change, offsetting flying against the carbon stored in forests would be insane,” says Chris Lang, editor of Redd Monitor which has analysed UN proposals to reduce forestry emissions with a similar offset scheme. “Not only would such a scheme allow the aviation sector to continue expanding and to continue burning fossil fuels, it would rely on carbon being stored in forests. Yet as climate change worsens, the risk of these forests burning and returning the carbon to the atmosphere is increasing,” he said. The offsetting scheme, which hopes to stabilise aviation emissions at 2020 levels, is strongly defended by Michael Gill, director of the Aviation Transport Action Group (ATAG), an industry coalition. “Offsetting is not a new concept,” he says. “Indeed, a large number of airlines already offer offsetting to passengers on a voluntary basis. What the industry does need is certainty, with a clear set of metrics defined before the scheme commences and consistently applied throughout its lifetime.” Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said: “I am optimistic that we are on the brink of a historic agreement—a first for an industry sector at the global level. The aviation industry would have preferred a more ambitious timeline than is currently outlined.” Critics are not convinced. The International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), the only civil society body accredited to observe the aviation proceedings, has strong reservations about the proposed market-based scheme because it would rely on a system of “voluntary, unguaranteed participation with weak environmental safeguards”. “The new proposed text would allow nations participating ... to opt out with only six months’ notice, raising serious concerns about the durability of the programme,” said the ICSA in a letter to EU commissioners. The coalition also fears that if the offsets used to achieve the goal of the UN scheme are also credited to other climate goals, emissions will increase while countries and airlines appear to meet their pledges. Instead they want to see ambitious states and regions allowed to go further in reducing their emissions and clear language introduced to avoid double counting. The environmental coalition prefers an expansion of the EU emissions trading system (ETS), which controversially included aviation for 10 months in 2012. The scheme involved the EU imposing a cap on carbon dioxide emissions for all planes arriving or departing from EU airports, while allowing airlines to buy and sell “pollution credits” , rewarding low carbon-emitting aviation. But the EU froze the scheme in November 2012 after the ICAO said it would take global action on emissions from planes. “The EU stopped the clock on its own ETS to give ICAO time to develop an environmentally meaningful measure, not a voluntary scheme which postpones serious action for a decade or more. Europe should be proud of setting the global benchmark, and never replace it with something inferior that is open to bogus offset programmes,” said Andrew Murphy, aviation policy officer at Transport & Environment.

Source: IHS/Gareth Jennings Boeing and Korean Air have signed a memorandum of agreement (MoA) to co-develop an armed unmanned variant of the MD 500 Little Bird light attack and observation helicopter for the Republic of Korea Army (RoKA) and the international market. The MoA, which was signed in South Korea on 21 September, will see Boeing provide Korean Air with technical support for flight control and other data, and for test evaluations. Korean Air Aerospace Division (KAL-ASD) first showcased a prototype of its unmanned Little Bird at the Seoul International Aerospace and Defence Exhibition (ADEX) 2015. Known as the Korean Air Unmanned System - Vertical Helicopter (KUS-VH), this platform was built as a demonstrator for the RoKA. At that event, IHS Jane's was told by a KAL-ASD official that the first flight would take place in 2016, although no news of such an event has yet been released. Boeing's involvement in the programme stems from it being the successor company to the Little Bird's original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Hughes Helicopters. Boeing has already developed its own H-6U Unmanned Little Bird (ULB), which it will no doubt use to help inform KAL-ASD's efforts. This MoA follows a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that Boeing and KAL-ASD signed in 2013 to convert an undisclosed number of the RoKA's MD 500 helicopters into unarmed unmanned platforms. The RoKA is thought to have 175 manned MD 500 helicopters still in service (130 MD 500s in the observation role and 45 BGM-71 TOW missile-equipped Defender platforms in the light attack role) that were licence-built for it in the 1970s by KAL-ASD. As the licence builder for the type, KAL-ASD has the proprietary knowledge and skill sets necessary to convert these ageing helicopters into unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). KAL-ASD has previously told IHS Jane's that a request for proposals for a MD 500 and Bell AH-1 Cobra helicopter replacement for the RoKA is expected in late 2016/early 2017, with the selected platform due to enter service in about 2022.

Sidelining the need for Wi-Fi, the system instead uses a chip that interfaces with mobile phones and enables passengers to interface with amenities, such as controlling overhead lights, beaming requests to flight attendants and shopping from their phones. According to Boeing: “If there’s a problem, the cabin device could automatically inform maintenance personnel on the ground so it can be repaired immediately after touchdown. It also could provide cabin crew with information about frequent fliers, including exact seat location and their preferences, which would help provide customized customer service. Additionally, the crew could monitor lavatory status and passenger orders or control cabin lighting.” The system would be separate from the plane’s cockpit and entertainment platforms, and the aviation’s cyber-security team has encouraged other airlines to embrace ‘smart cabin’ features and concepts to further differentiate them from competitors. Such innovations underscore the reality that we will be interacting with planes in new ways over the coming years. More frequently, airlines are introducing self-service screens and mobile-centric hardware, all of which suggest that we will see a greater amount of automation. These changes  will directly impact our expectations of airline personnel.

The cost-plus-fixed-free contracts are for risk reduction activities, concepts refinement, and trade space requirements development in preparation for the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the programme, according to the announcement. Both deals cover work through October 2017. USN officials have said the new aircraft will be optimised for two missions: tanking and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Single-mission high-endurance ISR aircraft and tankers typically have unique airframes, but officials have said that they are looking into the industry to demonstrate the design's "sweet spot" for conducting both missions. MQ-25 is the successor to the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) programme, which was focused on the ISR and strike missions. Want to read more?

Saidi is not just any hojat al-Islam, a Shiite clerical rank just below that of ayatollah, but the supreme leader’s representative to the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Summary⎙ Print Just back from New York, President Hassan Rouhani has been harshly reminded that engagement with the United States should not go beyond the nuclear deal. Meanwhile, Iran releases a detained Iranian-Canadian professor. Author Misha Zand Posted September 26, 2016 In an interview with the IRGC-linked Fars News Agency on Sept. 24, Saidi said, “Under the cover of the JCPOA, the country’s government was pursuing the straightening out of relations with the United States. The Americans’ intention with the negotiations was also beyond solving the nuclear issue, but the supreme leader prevented the Americans from gaining more points.” These comments come only days after Rouhani welcomed American companies at a Sept. 22 news conference in New York, where he said, “The nuclear deal has paved the ground for all foreign investors and companies to invest in Iran.” This is not the first time Rouhani has tried to build on the July 2015 nuclear deal. In February, he announced his government’s economic plans for a “second JCPOA” that would include international “reconciliation.” That statement did not please the supreme leader, either. In the Sept. 24 interview with Fars News, Saidi specifically underlined that talks with the United States should at all times stay within the framework of the nuclear deal, saying that broader diplomatic engagement “is one of the red lines that we cannot cross,” and adding, “This issue goes back to the cornerstones of the revolution.” Rouhani’s Sept. 20-22 visit to New York was also marked by extensive coverage in the Iranian media of the breaking news that the US Treasury finally issued licenses to Boeing and Airbus, permitting the sale of passenger airplanes to Iran. The Boeing deal is the largest business agreement between Iran and the United States since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. The positive reactions to the aircraft deals were inevitable in the pro-reform Iranian newspapers over the weekend. Speaking to the Reformist Shargh Daily on Sept. 24, Abbas Akhoundi, the minister of roads and urban development, praised the Boeing and Airbus deals and said, “This means that we finally after four decades can regain our share of the [aviation industry] in the global market.” In contrast, news outlets close to hard-liners downplayed the aviation deals, which are authorized under the nuclear deal. Adopting a skeptical position on Sept. 24, the hard-line Vatan-e Emrooz criticized the United States for not delivering its part of the nuclear agreement on time, as it has been months since preliminary understandings with Airbus and Boeing were announced. Other conservative outlets such as Kayhan Daily took it further and demanded Sept. 26 that the United States provide compensation for the delay. Saidi also remarked on the Boeing deal in his Sept. 24 interview with the IRGC-linked Fars News Agency, saying, “I am worried that they will send a few Boeing airplanes here and while a group of people take pictures with them, their minds will get sidetracked and they will start thinking that the JCPOA has been a success.” In other news, Homa Hoodfar, an Iranian-Canadian academic who was imprisoned earlier this year on security charges, has been released on humanitarian grounds. Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghassemi announced Sept. 26 that she has returned to Canada through Oman. The release comes after Canadian Foreign Minister Stephane Dion’s Sept. 21 meeting with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit in New York. It was the first meeting held at the ministerial level since Ottawa severed relations with Tehran in 2012.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber) Boeing exec says Canada looking at data in fighter jet purchase By Leah Schnurr Reuters Sep 26, 2016 (…) An F/A-18 Super Hornet sits on the flight deck of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman, off the coast of Florida, Sunday, Sept. 20, 2009. The ship was participating in a Joint Task Force Exercise in preparation for deployment to Afghanistan. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) OTTAWA • Canada is assessing data from bidders to replace its aging fleet of fighter jets, a Boeing Co. executive said on Monday. The country's Liberal government promised during last year's election that it would launch an open competition to replace Canada's CF-18 fighter aircraft. It pledged not to buy Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-35 jets, as the previous Conservative government had planned to do, calling them expensive and unnecessary. While the government has yet to release details on such a competition, it requested data this summer from five companies that have fighter aircraft in production or planned production, including Lockheed and Boeing, which wants Canada to buy its St. Louis-made F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. The government sought up-to-date information on areas including capabilities and economic benefits. "The focus on data was very clear, very strong," said Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, the unit which handles Boeing's strategy and operations outside the United States. "It gave all of the suppliers a chance to set down in black and white what it is their platform does." Since then, Boeing has been engaged in a "ping-pong" set of questions and answers with the government, said Allen. Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan has said the government foresees a growing capability gap in the 2020s and that there is an urgent need to replace the CF-18s. "They know it's imperative to solve that capability gap," said Allen. "They are moving in a way that says they understand that." Allen said ordinarily it can take multiple years from when an order is placed to when jets are delivered.

Check our People in Business See how St. Louis stocks are faring The other potential fighter jet suppliers are Saab AB, Dassault Aviation SA, and the Eurofighter consortium, which includes Airbus Group. As Boeing campaigns to win the contract, it is citing the work opportunities that would be available to Canadian firms across the country if the federal government were to purchase the Super Hornet. Allen did not rule out giving work to struggling planemaker Bombardier Inc., noting that Boeing always works with its competitors. "We're not going to rule out anybody from the perspective of who would be a good partner," he said. Boeing earlier this month formally challenged a decision by the Danish government to pick the F-35 fighter jet over the Super Hornet, citing a flawed evaluation process. Allen said that was a very particular circumstance and that Canada's process was calibrated to ensure an accurate analysis.  Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

By Isaac Arnsdorf and Seung Min Kim 09/26/16 06:28 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Saudi Arabia is mounting a last-ditch campaign to scuttle legislation allowing families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue the kingdom — and they're enlisting major American companies to make an economic case against the bill. General Electric, Dow Chemical, Boeing and Chevron are among the corporate titans that have weighed in against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, which passed both chambers unanimously and was vetoed on Friday, according to people familiar with the effort. The companies are acting quietly to avoid the perception of opposing victims of terrorism, but they're responding to Saudi arguments that their own corporate assets in the kingdom could be at risk if the law takes effect. Story Continued Below Meanwhile, Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader who now co-leads Squire Patton Boggs' lobbying group, e-mailed Senate legislative directors on Monday warning that the bill could lead other countries to withdraw their assets from the United States and retaliate with laws allowing claims against American government actions. "Many foreign entities have long-standing, intimate relations with U.S. financial institutions that they would undoubtedly unwind, to the further detriment of the U.S. economy," reads one of the attachments, obtained by POLITICO. "American corporations with interests abroad may be at risk of retaliation, a possibility recently expressed by GE and Dow." Still, the Saudis and their agents face a significant uphill battle, with lawmakers loath to take a vote against victims of the 9/11 attacks right before an election. There was little public opposition to the bill as it made its way through the Capitol, and even now, efforts to tweak the bill haven't caught much traction. Senate to vote Wednesday on override of Saudi 9/11 bill By Seung Min Kim Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Monday that the Senate will vote Wednesday on a motion to override President Barack Obama's veto, and if override advocates are successful there, the House will take the same vote Thursday or Friday, a House Republican leadership aide said. But even if Obama receives the first veto override of his presidency, the story won't end there: the Saudis will seek a new bill to scale back the law in the lame-duck session or in the next session, after lawmakers are relieved from the heat of the campaign, people familiar with the plans said. "It's Washington at its finest," one of the people said. While the White House has emphasized national security to justify rejecting the bill, enlisting business interests could prove influential with lawmakers representing places where the companies have significant economic footprints. Companies could lose favored access to the Saudi market and see their own assets subject to seizure in lawsuits, just as Saudi holdings in the U.S. would be, people familiar with the situation said. "While I understand that the sponsors are well-intentioned, the bill potentially could have serious consequences for our country's critical relationships in the Middle East and with the rest of the world," GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt wrote in a Sept. 22 letter to McConnell obtained by POLITICO. "The bill is not balanced, sets a dangerous precedent, and has real potential to destabilize bilateral relationships and the global economy." In May GE committed to investing $3 billion in Saudi water, energy, aviation and digital projects, part of the country's push to diversify its economy from oil. One source familiar with Boeing's effort said the company wrote in the letter that the victims’ families deserve justice but argued that the economic consequences of the bill were important to consider. The letter warned of potential job losses, the source said. Dow Chemical is also lobbying against the bill, people familiar with the campaign said. Opposition bubbles in Congress to Saudi 9/11 bill By Seung Min Kim Dow has several facilities in Saudi Arabia and Boeing this year sent its first 787 jet to Saudi Arabian Airlines. Chevron, which has an oil field and chemical plants in the kingdom, reported lobbying on the bill last quarter, disclosure show. Several financial firms are also monitoring the legislation but not taking a stand on it. The Saudis are now spending more than $250,000 a month fighting the bill, retaining powerhouses Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Glover Park Group, Sphere Consulting and Squire Patton Boggs. Besides working with companies invested in Saudi Arabia, the lobbyists are directly contacting lawmakers, placing opinion articles and seeking support from think tank scholars. GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bob Corker of Tennessee are trying to hammer out a compromise that would soften the bill, bringing it in line with previously proposed versions rather than keeping the harsher language that just passed. A proposed amendment obtained by POLITICO — an effort that one person said was led primarily by Graham — suggests restoring an exemption for discretionary government actions, which the document says would prevent American interference in foreign countries' internal policies and vice versa. A Graham spokesman declined to comment on the language. Graham, who had voiced concerns about the legislation, said in an interview last week that discussions to address those issues were "not at the level I would appreciate." "We'll see," Graham said then. "Time will tell." GE declined to comment beyond Immelt's letter. Dow, Boeing, Chevron and the Saudi embassy didn't answer requests for comment.

Fly-by-wire refers to the electronic, semi-automatic system for controlling aircraft that replaces manual pilot controls. The Airbus A320 was the first fly-by-wire airliner to enter commercial service and the system has since been used on its newer planes, including the A330, superjumbo A380 and the latest airliner in the sky, the A350. Airbus Four of the world's largest airliners take off on spectacular formation flight.

Airbus family flight: A380, A350, A330 and A320. The A320 and A330 are among the most popular planes with airlines around the world. But despite initial success, the double-decker A380 superjumbo has struggled to sell in recent years. A greater success story has been the new A350 – Airbus' rival to the Boeing Dreamliner. Like the 787 Dreamliner, the A350 is also a lightweight aircraft. The A350 uses a combination of materials, including plastic reinforced by carbon fibre, along with titanium and aluminium alloys. More than 70 per cent of the aircraft is made of lightweight materials, helping airlines save on fuel. Sign up for the Two Minutes of Stuff newsletter Qatar Airways and Thai Airways are among the carriers flying the A350, while Qantas has indicated it is considering an ultra-long-range new version of the plane for its fleet in the future.

Photo / Getty Images The aviation industry is supporting a United Nations proposal to limit pollution from international flights even though the measure may cost companies US$24 billion (NZ$33 billion) annually. Trade groups representing United Continental Holdings, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. The outcome is far from certain. The deal has backing from at least 60 nations, including the US and most of Europe. Yet in recent days China, which had previously expressed support for the accord, issued a joint proposal along with Russia and India pushing to change key elements of the proposal. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 per cent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. "We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." Continued below. Related Content Mood of the Boardroom: Inequality big problem for NZ: Air NZ chief Jennifer Aniston's new friend aboard Emirates UN: Nations to work together on terrorism threat to air travel To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimates the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 per cent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it's an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy. We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change. Michael Gill, Air Transport Action Group "It's peanuts," said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. "It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it's a massive green-washing exercise." Nonetheless, supporters of the accord say it's a critical piece of the effort to stave off erratic floods, droughts and other dire impacts of global warming. In addition to the US and Europe, the agreement has garnered pledges of support from the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Singapore and dozens of others nations responsible for most aviation emissions. "The Paris Agreement alone won't solve the climate crisis," President Barack Obama said in September during a joint appearance with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when both leaders expressed support for the aviation accord. On the eve of the talks, however, China proposed broad changes to the accord through a joint statement with India and Russia, pushing to make airlines in the US and other wealthy nations responsible for offsetting the majority of emissions. The three nations argued that the current proposal would unfairly punish growing airlines in developing nations and drive them into bankruptcy. India and Russia have consistently been critical of the global aviation emissions deal. It is unclear whether the proposed changes mark a shift in China's overall position. This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry. Violeta Bulc, EU Transport Commissioner The push for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU's authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalize the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization. More than 2,000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organization's largest assembly ever. Environmentalists say the accord hinges on whether it can draw enough nations to participate during the initial voluntary phase to cover 80 to 90 per cent of emissions. Several countries with fast-growing aviation sectors -- including Brazil and India -- have indicated they would wait until the deal becomes mandatory in 2027. They argue the accord would impose an inappropriate economic burden on developing countries trying to grow their aviation sectors. "The interests of poor and developing countries should be taken on board," India's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told The Times of India in August. Officials continue to debate how to balance responsibility between large airlines that emit most emissions and small, growing carriers from developing nations. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and other industry leaders to initially subsidize the growth of smaller carriers. Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The US has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. A key issue will ultimately be determining what types of offsets are permitted. Verifying the ecological integrity of such credits can be notoriously difficult. Negotiators are unlikely to finalize those details until after an initial deal is reached. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would push to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. "This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry," Bulc said during a Sept. 21 media briefing. "I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow. It is a critical time for action."

The suspect, identified as Arcan Cetin, was arrested Saturday evening as he walked along a street in Oak Harbor. Cetin will be turned over to the Skagit County Sheriff's Office, according to Island County authorities. Cetin was identified as a suspect from tips and after police examined surveillance video from the Burlington mall and saw a car connected to him, Mount Vernon Police Department Lt. Chris Cammock said during a news conference late Saturday night. Skagit County authorities alerted the Island County Sheriff's Office, which arrested Cetin around 6:30 p.m., he said. Cammock said Cetin has not been charged. He will be booked into the Skagit County Jail, he said. He is expected to appear in Skagit County District Court on Monday. A man who answered the door at the home of Cetin's parents declined to comment on Saturday. Skagit County court records show Cetin has a criminal record that included three domestic-violence assault charges in both Burlington and Island County, with the victim identified as Cetin's stepfather. He also was arrested for drunken driving. Island County District Court records show that Cetin was told by a judge on Dec. 29 that he was not to possess a firearm. However, Cetin's stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was "going through a hard time" and that he couldn't help him with the order in place. Cetin's Facebook page says he was a 2015 graduate of Oak Harbor High School. A couple years ago, Marty Baldwin said he allowed the suspected gunman, who was homeless at the time, to move in with him and his wife. But Baldwin kicked him out a few months later after learning the younger man was using and selling drugs, he said Baldwin said he called 911 Friday night after recognizing the man he knew as "Frankie" on TV. Neighbors Jay Young and David Cole watched as police converged outside their apartment building Saturday and took the suspected gunman into custody on the sidewalk. "It was all cordial, would be the way to put it. From what I saw, it was textbook," said Cole of the arrest. "It didn't look like he did anything but obey the orders of the officers." Both men said once they saw the suspect, they recognized him from the mall surveillance photos. "I'm just glad they caught him," Young said. As police conducted the search that led to the arrest of Cetin, friends and family members mourned five people killed during the shooting rampage Friday night. Sarai Lara was the youngest of the victims, at 16. The Mount Vernon High School sophomore had survived cancer as a young girl, and was a happy, responsible, driven student, her mother said Saturday evening. Evangelina Lara said she was shopping at the mall with Sarai and her younger sister, but they split up to different stores. Sarai went to Macy's looking for pants, her mother said through a translator. News of the shooting spread through the mall, and Lara tried to get to her daughter but was blocked from Macy's. The next seven hours were filled with anxiety and dread, she said, until it was confirmed at 2 a.m. Saturday that her daughter was dead. She said nobody in the family had recognized the shooter in photos handed out by police. A family member identified Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother as victims of the shooting but declined further comment. KIRO identified the mother as Beatrice Dotson, 95. Another victim is believed by her family to be Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old from Mount Vernon who worked as a make-up artist at Macy's. Martin's sister, Karen Van Horn, declined to talk Saturday evening. "We're really having a tough time right now," Van Horn said in a brief phone call. Van Horn, an employee at The Herald in Everett, told that newspaper that family members hadn't heard an official confirmation that she was among the victims, but a witness told them that her sister was among the dead. Van Horn described her younger sister as an avid reader who was both classy and practical. "She was so sweet," Van Horn told The Herald. "She was just very independent. She wanted to make her own way. She didn't want to rely on anyone else." Another victim was Chuck Eagan, a longtime Boeing maintenance worker from Lake Stevens, said his aunt, Carol Thrush. She said Eagan and his wife were out for a dinner and shopping at the mall, and they had made their way to Macy's when the shooter opened fire. Thrush said Eagan and his wife began running, but his wife fell down as she was trying to get away. As Eagan helped his wife, he was shot, Thrush said. Thrush said Eagan, who had two daughters, was planning to retire from Boeing next year with hopes of doing some traveling. "He was just a wonderful person," Thrush said. About 50 people gathered at Central United Methodist Church in Sedro-Woolley Saturday evening to offer up prayers. At one point in the service, Pastor Cody Natland lit a candle for each of the five victims, then invited congregants to call out prayers to the people they were thinking about. "To the parents of the (young) victim and the parents of the shooter," one woman said. "To law enforcement and our first responders," said another. "To the students at the high school on Monday," a third woman said. "The small community of Darrington that lost two folks last night," a man said. Police said the suspect appeared to be a Hispanic male in his late teens to mid-20s with a close-shaved haircut. He used a long gun similar to a hunting rifle, Francis said. However, according to the Cetin's father's Facebook page, Cetin was born in Turkey. His father met and married Cetin's mother in Turkey and the family settled in Oak Harbor, according to the Facebook page. Cammock said he is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. "I don't know what his motivations were," said Cammock, commander of the Skagit Multi-Agency Response Team (SMART), said at a Saturday morning news conference. "But I certainly intend to find out." Cammock is leading the investigation of the shootings; Burlington's police department requested help from SMART due to the magnitude of the crime, he said. Cammock said the suspect walked into the mall apparently unarmed shortly before 7 p.m. and returned about 10 minutes later with a rifle. A rifle was recovered by police at the scene, he said. He did not disclose the caliber. Cammock, speaking at the Saturday night news conference, said detectives began receiving tips earlier in the day that pointed to Cetin. They also reviewed surveillance video and saw the vehicle that led to Cetin. Cammock said detectives do not know whether Cetin had a connection with any of the victims. Taleia Thurman, 23, called her mother from a bathroom inside Kay Jewelers, where Taleia and three co-workers hid amidst Friday night's gunfire. One of the coworkers had seen the gunman and sprinted from a kiosk into the store to warn the others, Kim Thurman said, recounting her daughter's story Saturday. "It was nerve wracking. They locked themselves in the bathroom -- they didn't even have time to roll the doors down," Thurman recounted. After the gunfire ended, Thurman cautioned her daughter to wait for police to arrive. "It was a security guard that came and got them and ushered them outside. She didn't have her keys, her purse or anything," Thurman said. Taleia was able to catch a ride to Lynnwood, where her mother met her and drove her home to Seattle. "She was an emotional wreck" and "just melted" when she saw her mother and got in her car, Thurman said. On Saturday, Thurman drove her daughter to the mall to retrieve her car, explaining Taleia's manager was allowed inside the mall to gather employees' personal belongings. "It was very emotional ... When we got up here, the bodies were still in the mall. Imagine those families," she said, her eyes welling with tears. "I'm just thankful I'm not one of the ones" who lost a family member. Skagit County Coroner Hayley Thompson began removing the victims' bodies from the mall Saturday afternoon. Burlington mayor Steve Sexton said the "the city of Burlington has probably changed forever, but I don't think our way of life needs to change," while speaking about the Cascade Mall shooting. (Jessica Lee / The Seattle Times) Family members who suspected their loved ones may be among the dead were sequestered Saturday with mental-health volunteers at His Place Community Church, which is about a block from the south end of Cascade Mall, which will re-open Monday. The church, acting as a family resource center, was packed Friday night as friends and relatives gathered to learn what scant information was being released, said Bill Overby, a volunteer with Skagit County's Department of Emergency Management. "These are very abnormal circumstances in a normal community with normal people and their reactions reflect that," Overby said of those who worried as they waited to hear about their loved ones. "There's a lot of uncertainty. People are obviously very concerned but there's not a lot of answers (yet), which is common." He said it was best to avoid speculation or wild guesses because to do otherwise "revictimizes everyone involved." The police investigation is proceeding deliberately, "but it needs to to get it right," Overby said. Lacey Shoemaker, the disaster program manager for the Northwest Washington chapter of the Red Cross, said five disaster mental-health volunteers were dispatched to Burlington Friday night and continue to work with families impacted by the mass shooting. Support officers also are on scene to "assist in the emotional care of the community," she said. Shoemaker said the community of about 8,400 is pulling together, with restaurants, churches and other organizations providing food and lending support any way they can. "It's hit the community on a very emotional level. It's a very small, tight-knit community. It's just kind of unbelievable something like this would happen here," she said. "I think there's a lot of mixed emotions ... It's weird when it happens in your own back yard. It digs a little deeper." Assistant Pastor Nick Harris was graceful in declining any praise for opening his church to the community. "I'm just the guy with the key. It's God's house so it's here for everybody," he said. At a vigil for the victims Saturday morning at Maiben Park in Burlington, Kelly Couture recalled what she heard as she left the mall's Target store Friday night. "Just sirens and people were yelling and running out of the building," Couture said. "It was kind of, like, chaotic. The amount of sirens and the amount of police cars was insane." Joanne Burkholder's experience was more frightening. "Security came into the room and said we need to evacuate immediately, and so we got into the hallway and there was, like, tons of people out there," she said at the vigil. "People were panicking, screaming down the hallway. We were terrified so we went outside and there was lots of security locking down the place." A 14-year-old girl named Christina said Saturday she was getting her nails done in a salon on the other side of the mall from the Macy's when the shooting occurred. She and her cousin, along with others in the salon, hid in a back room for about 10 minutes before fleeing the mall to an Applebee's restaurant nearby. "We just saw a whole bunch of people running out," she said, her voice trembling. "One of the workers said she saw him (the shooter) pass by. We all got freaked out and ran into the little back room they had. Then a cop came and escorted us out." Christina added, "I go there pretty much every weekend. It's just so strange that at a small mall like this, that would happen." Cammock asked members of the public to continue to stay away from the shopping mall. Map of the Cascade Mall area: Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton said the city's "thoughts and prayers go out to the families" of the victims. "There are people waking up this morning and their lives are changed forever," Sexton said. "The city of Burlington is changed forever." The mayor called the shooting a senseless act, saying "the world came knocking on our doorstep and it came to our little community here." "Our support goes with them (law enforcement and investigators), to help them ... bring the son of a bitch to justice who did this to our community. Our community comes together in times of tragedy." The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent a team to help local law enforcement with the investigation, spokeswoman Ayn Dietrich-William said. Washington State Patrol Sgt. Mark Francis gives an update about the victims of a shooting at the Cascade Mall in Burlington on September 23, 2016. (Rick Lund and Dean Rutz / The Seattle Times) Macy's on Saturday morning released this statement on its Facebook page: "We are devastated by the tragic events that occurred last night at Cascade Mall. Our hearts are with our Burlington store, the families and loved ones of the victims, and the entire community. We are working closely with local law enforcement authorities as the investigation continues to unfold. They will be providing updates as the situation develops." Cascade Mall had a similar message on its website: "We are deeply saddened by the tragic event that occurred Friday evening. Our prayers and condolences are with the victims and their families."

U.S. environmental regulators are moving to limit emissions from aircraft, ruling that jet engine exhaust is endangering human health by warming the planet. The Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday that it will use its authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate aircraft emissions. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) The aviation industry is supporting a United Nations proposal to limit pollution from international flights even though the measure may cost companies $24 billion annually. Trade groups representing United Continental Holdings, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. The outcome is far from certain. The deal has backing from at least 60 nations, including the U.S. and most of Europe. Yet in recent days China, which had previously expressed support for the accord, issued a joint proposal along with Russia and India pushing to change key elements of the proposal. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. "We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimates the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 percent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it's an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy "It's peanuts," said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. "It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it's a massive green-washing exercise." Nonetheless, supporters of the accord say it's a critical piece of the effort to stave off erratic floods, droughts and other dire impacts of global warming. In addition to the U.S. and Europe, the agreement has garnered pledges of support from the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Singapore and dozens of others nations responsible for most aviation emissions. "The Paris Agreement alone won't solve the climate crisis," President Barack Obama said in September during a joint appearance with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when both leaders expressed support for the aviation accord. On the eve of the talks, however, China proposed broad changes to the accord through a joint statement with India and Russia, pushing to make airlines in the U.S. and other wealthy nations responsible for offsetting the majority of emissions. The three nations argued that the current proposal would unfairly punish growing airlines in developing nations and drive them into bankruptcy. India and Russia have consistently been critical of the global aviation emissions deal. It is unclear whether the proposed changes mark a shift in China's overall position. The push for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU's authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalize the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization. More than 2,000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organization's largest assembly ever.

Check our People in Business See how St. Louis stocks are faring Environmentalists say the accord hinges on whether it can draw enough nations to participate during the initial voluntary phase to cover 80 to 90 percent of emissions. Several countries with fast-growing aviation sectors -- including Brazil and India -- have indicated they would wait until the deal becomes mandatory in 2027. They argue the accord would impose an inappropriate economic burden on developing countries trying to grow their aviation sectors. "The interests of poor and developing countries should be taken on board," India's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told The Times of India in August. Officials continue to debate how to balance responsibility between large airlines that emit most emissions and small, growing carriers from developing nations. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines Inc., Deutsche Lufthansa AG and other industry leaders to initially subsidize the growth of smaller carriers. Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The U.S. has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. A key issue will ultimately be determining what types of offsets are permitted. Verifying the ecological integrity of such credits can be notoriously difficult. Negotiators are unlikely to finalize those details until after an initial deal is reached. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would push to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. "This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry," Bulc said during a Sept. 21 media briefing. "I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow. It is a critical time for action." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business. Get twice-daily updates on what the St. Louis business community is talking about.

Ukraine and the West insist pro-Russian rebels blew the Boeing 777 jet out of the sky over war-torn east Ukraine on July 17, 2014, with a missile system likely supplied by Moscow. An international inquiry concluded last October that a Russian-made BUK missile fired from a zone held by pro-Russian separatists brought down the aircraft, but stopped short of saying who was responsible for killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. Russia and the rebels have consistently denied any role in downing the plane, releasing a series of sometimes contradictory claims that critics say are intended to confuse the issue. At a specially arranged briefing on Monday, Russia's defence ministry released what it claimed were radar images showing that no missile fired from rebel-held territory in the east could have hit the plane. "The fact that Ukraine has not yet released information from the radar station suggests that the location from which the missile was launched -- if it was a BUK -- was in territory controlled by the Ukrainian armed forces," Russian army commander Andrei Koban said. "If the Malaysian Boeing was hit by a missile launched from any area located east of the crash site, it would have been detected by Russia's primary radar," Koban said, without explaining why Russian radar did not cover the areas west of the passenger jet's flight path. The radar footage released by Russia on Monday appeared to directly contradict earlier claims by Moscow, made in the immediate aftermath of the incident, that a Ukrainian jet was spotted close to the doomed airliner. Initial results from a Dutch-led criminal probe into the downing of flight MH17 are due to be revealed on Wednesday. Investigators from the Netherlands -- where the majority of the passengers came from -- have said the results should shed more light on the type of missile used and exactly where it was fired from. The downing of flight MH17 ratcheted up international tensions over the conflict in Ukraine that started in April 2014 after pro-Russian gunmen took over towns in the country's industrial east, and has since claimed some 9,600 lives. The tragedy saw the European Union slap tougher sanctions on Russia -- blamed by the West for being behind the rebellion -- and the punitive measures remain in place as the fighting drags on.

At a specially arranged briefing today, Russia’s defence ministry released what it claimed were radar images showing that no missile fired from rebel-held territory in the east could have hit the plane.  “The fact that Ukraine has not yet released information from the radar station suggests that the location from which the missile was launched — if it was a BUK — was in territory controlled by the Ukrainian armed forces,” Russian army commander Andrei Koban said. “If the Malaysian Boeing was hit by a missile launched from any area located east of the crash site, it would have been detected by Russia’s primary radar,” Koban said, without explaining why Russian radar did not cover the areas west of the passenger jet’s flight path. The radar footage released by Russia today appeared to directly contradict earlier claims by Moscow, made in the immediate aftermath of the incident, that a Ukrainian jet was spotted close to the doomed airliner. Initial results from a Dutch-led criminal probe into the downing of flight MH17 are due to be revealed on Wednesday. Investigators from the Netherlands — where the majority of the passengers came from — have said the results should shed more light on the type of missile used and exactly where it was fired from.  The downing of flight MH17 ratcheted up international tensions over the conflict in Ukraine that started in April 2014 after pro-Russian gunmen took over towns in the country’s industrial east, and has since claimed some 9,600 lives. The tragedy saw the European Union slap tougher sanctions on Russia — blamed by the West for being behind the rebellion — and the punitive measures remain in place as the fighting drags on. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts Cops detain Bersih 2.0 chairman, committee member ahead of rally More arrests on Bersih 5 eve, Maria and Mandeep may miss rally, Red Shirts leader missing Police road diversions in KL from 7am Now, DAP MP arrested for sedition, taken to Seremban High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts Rafizi sentenced to 18 months’ jail, might lose MP seat Do Malaysians trust the news they read?

For about a decade before the crisis industrial-manufacturing businesses had to adapt to new technologies, invest in equipment in order to improve factory performance, and achieving new global standards. After 2008 these companies were left with substantial liabilities and a global recession putting pressure on sluggish efforts in growth. Cemtrex Inc (NASDAQ: CETX), 3M Co (NYSE: MMM), General Electric (NYSE: GE), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) A report by PWC indicates that industrial-manufacturing business is back to a similar environment at which it was before the crisis. Once again technological transformation is required to operate at new global standards - The Internet of Things, augmented reality, and 3D printing are all innovations that have already changed industrial-manufacturing technical operations. As a result smaller companies like Cemtrex Inc (NASDAQ: CETX) have focused their attention to technical changes. Cemtrex is a diversified industrial and manufacturing company. The Company operates in a range of business segments and provides solutions to manufacturing industries. Through its Electronics Manufacturing Services group the company provides end-to-end electronic manufacturing services including product design and sustaining engineering services, systems integration, testing services and assembled electronic products. Cemtrex Inc. (CETX) has been very active in expanding their operations overseas. Earlier this month the company announced that it has fully integrated with the recently acquired Periscope, an electronics manufacturing company located in Paderborn, Germany. With the integration complete, Cemtrex secured a broader base and larger market share in the Eurozone and claims that it has become among the top 20 EMS companies in Germany. Cemtrex Inc. (CETX) Chairman and CEO, Saagar Govil, commented, "In a very short period of time, the combination of our existing German operation and Periscope has revealed tremendous synergies for us. ROB Cemtrex is now exceeding our earlier expectations, as evidenced by our record recent contract wins, including with a very large automotive industry supplier. Our opportunities in the Eurozone are bright and we have high expectations for our growing company." Shares of the company are up 148% from its 52-week low earlier in the year. Meanwhile, large companies are investing heavily in technologies. 3M Co (NYSE: MMM) is a popular technology company with an industrial segment that serves markets, such as automotive equipment, electronics, paper and printing, packaging, food and beverage, and construction. 3M has recently announced the development of a new patent pending technology for 3D Printing of fluorinated polymers, which are an integral material in numerous manufacturing processes. The fluorinated polymers are known for high durability, resistance to various chemicals and high temperatures. General Electric (NYSE: GE) is also making aggressive moves to embrace 3D printing for faster production. Earlier this month GE announced the acquisition of two 3D printing companies, the total value of which was $1.4 billion. Edward Herderick, additive technologies leader at GE's corporate supply chain and operations business explained why the adapting of 3D printers is beneficial, "We can make components in no-fail industries that are repeatable, affordable and comparable to traditional industries… Every additive machine is like a foundry." Over the last year both Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) proved that it is not only possible, but also actually practical to use augmented reality technology for manufacturing. Both companies used augmented reality glasses to build jets. The glasses displayed educational software that provided real-time visuals during the plane's assembly, as well as helping to ensure that every part on the plane was correctly put in its place.

This is not only the first long haul route originating in Xiamen with an end point in the United States, but also the first direct international service between Shenzhen and the U.S. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410761 The service will be handled by a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with three flights per week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The flight numbers are MF845 and MF846. Xiamen Airlines chairman and general manager Che Shanglun said, "The launch of the Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is an important reflection of the results of the meeting between Chinese and American leaders in 2015. On the heels of these events, a Fuzhou-New York and a Xiamen-LA service will also be initiated, making air travel, and, by consequence, exchanges between the two countries much easier." The Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is the sixth long haul and the first American route that Xiamen Airlines has launched. The existing services including Xiamen-Amsterdam, Fuzhou-Sydney, Xiamen-Sydney, Xiamen-Melbourne and Xiamen-Vancouver. The newly opened Seattle service is Xiamen Airlines' first long haul route with a stop at a city outside of the Fujian province. To complete the build out of a network that extends beyond Seattle, Xiamen Airlines has signed a partnership agreement with Alaska Airlines that enables passengers traveling to Seattle via Xiamen Airlines, to fly onward to 61 major and secondary destinations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico by connecting to an Alaska Airlines flight in Seattle. The launch of the route marks the first time the Xiamen Airlines fleet has had a chance to visit the home of their "birth", as Seattle, where Boeing is located, is where each member of the 165-strong fleet of aircraft was manufactured and first saw the light of day. As a loyal client of Boeing Co., Xiamen Airlines operates the largest all-Boeing aircraft fleet in China. Over the past 3 decades, Xiamen Airlines has taken delivery of hundreds of brand new Boeing airliners and, due to the low cost advantage of an all-Boeing fleet, Xiamen Airlines has continuously shown a profit for 29 years, the longest period of reporting uninterrupted profits in Chinese civil aviation history.

Trade groups representing United Continental Holdings, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning on Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programmes. “We recognise that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change,” said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. “The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible.” To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavours. Airlines estimates the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 percent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it’s an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticise the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy “It’s peanuts,” said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. “It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it’s a massive green-washing exercise.” Outcome uncertain Nonetheless, supporters of the accord say it’s a critical piece of the effort to stave off erratic floods, droughts and other dire impacts of global warming. The agreement has garnered pledges of support from at least 60 nations responsible for most aviation emissions, including the US, China, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and a majority of European countries. “The Paris Agreement alone won’t solve the climate crisis,” US President Barack Obama said in September during a joint appearance with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when both leaders expressed support for the aviation accord. The push for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU’s authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalise the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation. More than 2 000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organisation’s largest assembly ever. Success is far from certain. Environmentalists say the accord hinges on whether it can draw enough nations to participate during the initial voluntary phase to cover 80 to 90 percent of emissions. Several countries with fast-growing aviation sectors - including Brazil and India - have indicated they would wait until the deal becomes mandatory in 2027. They argue the accord would impose an inappropriate economic burden on developing countries trying to grow their aviation sectors. “The interests of poor and developing countries should be taken on board,” India’s environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told The Times of India in August. Officials continue to debate how to balance responsibility between large airlines that emit most emissions and small, growing carriers from developing nations. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and other industry leaders to initially subsidise the growth of smaller carriers. Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The US has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. Integrity of offsets A key issue will ultimately be determining what types of offsets are permitted. Verifying the ecological integrity of such credits can be notoriously difficult. Negotiators are unlikely to finalise those details until after an initial deal is reached. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would push to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. “This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry,” Bulc said during a September 21 media briefing. “I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow. It is a critical time for action.” * With assistance from Ewa Krukowska and Mathew Carr BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

Boeing and Lockheed will also refine concepts and develop trade space models to support requirements generation ahead of the MQ-25 program’s engineering and manufacturing development phase, the Defense Department said Friday. The two companies are scheduled to complete work in October 2017.

Trade groups representing United Continental Holdings Inc., Boeing Co. and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. The outcome is far from certain. The deal has backing from at least 60 nations, including the U.S. and most of Europe. Yet in recent days China, which had previously expressed support for the accord, issued a joint proposal along with Russia and India pushing to change key elements of the proposal. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. “We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change,” said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. “The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible.” To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimates the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 percent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it’s an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy “It’s peanuts,” said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. “It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it’s a massive green-washing exercise.” Outcome Uncertain Nonetheless, supporters of the accord say it’s a critical piece of the effort to stave off erratic floods, droughts and other dire impacts of global warming. In addition to the U.S. and Europe, the agreement has garnered pledges of support from the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Singapore and dozens of others nations responsible for most aviation emissions. “The Paris Agreement alone won’t solve the climate crisis,” U.S. President Barack Obama said in September during a joint appearance with Chinese President Xi Jinping, when both leaders expressed support for the aviation accord. On the eve of the talks, however, China proposed broad changes to the accord through a joint statement with India and Russia, pushing to make airlines in the U.S. and other wealthy nations responsible for offsetting the majority of emissions. The three nations argued that the current proposal would unfairly punish growing airlines in developing nations and drive them into bankruptcy. India and Russia have consistently been critical of the global aviation emissions deal. It is unclear whether the proposed changes mark a shift in China’s overall position. International Effort The push for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU’s authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalize the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization. More than 2,000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organization’s largest assembly ever. Environmentalists say the accord hinges on whether it can draw enough nations to participate during the initial voluntary phase to cover 80 to 90 percent of emissions. Several countries with fast-growing aviation sectors -- including Brazil and India -- have indicated they would wait until the deal becomes mandatory in 2027. They argue the accord would impose an inappropriate economic burden on developing countries trying to grow their aviation sectors. Achieving Balance “The interests of poor and developing countries should be taken on board,” India’s environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told The Times of India in August. Officials continue to debate how to balance responsibility between large airlines that emit most emissions and small, growing carriers from developing nations. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines Inc., Deutsche Lufthansa AG and other industry leaders to initially subsidize the growth of smaller carriers.  Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The U.S. has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. Integrity of Offsets A key issue will ultimately be determining what types of offsets are permitted. Verifying the ecological integrity of such credits can be notoriously difficult. Negotiators are unlikely to finalize those details until after an initial deal is reached. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would push to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. “This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry,” Bulc said during a Sept. 21 media briefing. “I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow. It is a critical time for action.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio September 27, 2016 Lawmakers balk at replacing aging EC-130Hs with smaller Gulfstream G550s without open competition. Last year, the U.S. Air Force tried to retire most of its EC-130 Compass Call spy planes, worn from years of flying over Iraq and Afghanistan. Now service officials say replacements are needed urgently — so urgently that they must write a no-bid contract for 10 aircraft whose price tag could top $1.6 billion. Not so fast, says Congress. “[T]he Air Force’s proposal to recapitalize the EC-130H Compass Call aircraft using a sole source purchase of ten business class aircraft would not give us any confidence that the Air Force is achieving the maximum value for the American taxpayer,” reads a Senate Armed Services Committee report on the 2017 defense authorization bill. Built in the 1980s, the 14 Compass Call aircraft are Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes packed with special computer equipment and a spiderweb-like antenna that allows the crew to eavesdrop on and attack enemy communications. The planes have been heavily used in the post-9/11 counterinsurgency campaigns. Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. But instead of replacing the Compass Calls with new C-130s, the Air Force wants to take a different approach: installing the special electronics on a Gulfstream G550 business jet, according to Pentagon sources and congressional documents. The service would call this new spy plane the EC-37B. It’s unclear whether the EC-130’s 13-member crew and electronic suite would fit inside the smaller Gulfstream. But more immediately disturbing to lawmakers is the Air Force’s plan to offer a no-bid, sole-source contract to an EC-37B team that includes Gulfstream, which makes the jets, and BAE Systems, which handles the electronic gear. Air Force officials told lawmakers that the Gulfstream is the “only option that does not require development and/or certification work,” according to a House report on the 2017 defense authorization bill. Officials also said the shift from C-130 to G550 is driven by unspecified foreign threats, and the increased cost of maintaining old aircraft. “The threat has evolved and we need to get started to be able to provide that capability, which is critical to the combatant commanders,” Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, the Air Force’s military deputy for acquisition, said at an Air Force Association conference outside Washington last week. “We actually have letters of support from two of the combatant commanders showing how critical this capability is, and we need to do it expeditiously.” The Air Force has asked Congress for $165.7 million to buy and convert a Gulfstream G550 into a Compass Call starting in 2017. (The service already has a small fleet of G550 business jets to fly senior Pentagon officials around the globe.) The request was not included in the Air Force’s 2017 budget request to Congress in February, but was submitted to lawmakers separately in a “technical adjustment” letter, according to a House report. A new, unmodified Gulfstream G550 costs just over $61 million, according to Aviation Week, which means the 10-aircraft purchase would send more than $600 million to Gulfstream, the business jet arm of General Dynamics. Gulfstream has built special intelligence versions of the G550 for foreign governments, including Israel. Even more money, about $100 million per plane, would go to BAE Systems, which would install specialized electronics equipment designed for the C-130 into the smaller Gulfstream. General Dynamics is “aggressively lobbying” for about 14 new EC-37B aircraft to extend G550 production, defense consultant Jim McAleese wrote in an Aug. 24 note to investors. Some lawmakers, as well as officials with competing defense companies, say that buying Gulfstream G550 aircraft through a no-bid contract will prejudice future competitions. The Air Force is looking to modernize other fleets of intelligence planes, based on Boeing 707 jetliners built in the 1960s and 1970s. “[A]llowing this sole source award to proceed could potentially prejudice source selections for other Air Force recapitalization programs, such as the program to replace the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft,” the Senate report reads. Northrop Grumman, which made the current E-8C JSTARS planes, is working with Gulfstream to offer a new JSTARS aircraft based on a G550. Boeing has offered a larger 737 and Lockheed Martin has teamed up with business jet-maker Bombardier. At the Air Force Association conference last week, Boeing showed off a model of its Compass Call version of the 737 commercial jetliner. Company executives point out that a G550 cannot refuel in flight, as do the EC-130H and the P-8, a submarine-hunting 737 flown by the Navy. Some experts argue the Air Force needs a comprehensive plan to buy new intelligence planes — like the RC-135 Rivet Joint and E-3 AWACS — before rushing to start the Compass Call shift to a Gulfstream. Despite its purported urgency, the Air Force plan would implement the Compass Call replacement much more slowly than projects of similar importance. The Air Force wants to buy one new G550 from Gulfstream annually for a decade, using money currently slated for EC-130H maintenance and upgrades, Bunch said. When the Air Force has an urgent operational need, it typically works to buy equipment through a secretive acquisition office known as Big Safari. When the service raced to get a fleet of small intelligence planes into battle in 2008, Big Safari purchased a handful of used and new King Air 350 turboprops. The planes reached the battlefield in less than a year, a remarkable feat for a Pentagon acquisition system that sometimes takes decades. “Almost any time that you can do a competition, we really think that the military ends up getting better weapon systems,” Mandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project On Government Oversight, said of the Compass Call plan. “We always think that you have to be very cautious when you’re going to waive those kinds of requirements, particularly it’s not very expeditious to fulfill the requirement over 10 years.” This isn’t the first time the Air Force has taken fire for looking to no-bid contracts in an attempt to circumvent the slow Pentagon acquisition process. In 2010, it wanted to buy 93 Black Hawk helicopters, valued at about $1 billion from Sikorsky to replace old UH-1 Huey helicopters that patrol far-flung ICBM bases. The move was eventually quashed in favor of competition, but the Air Force has yet to buy new helicopters. For now, the Compass Call project is in a holding pattern, as the Air Force waits for lawmakers in the House and Senate to iron out a unified version of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. Bunch said the Air Force is waiting for lawmakers to provide direction before proceeding. “What I really want as the military acquisition individual is give me the max flexibility that I can to use the acquisition authorities that we have whether that is full-and-open competition or that is less-than full-and-open competition so that we can do this in an expeditious manner,” Bunch said. The Senate version of the authorization bill restricts funding for the effort while the House version encourage the Air Force speed up plans to shift to the Gulfstream aircraft. The White House has backed the Air Force plan, arguing that the “Air Force requires the flexibility to employ appropriate contracting authorities as allowed by law, including the exemptions to full and open competition in order to efficiently and effectively execute” the shift to move from the EC-130H to the EC-37B.

(WWLP) – Starting Wednesday, you will be able to fly directly from Bradley International Airport to Dublin, Ireland. Irish carrier Aer Lingus has been planning the daily direct flights since they made the announcement last year. Aer Lingus Boeing 757s will carry 12 business class and 165 economy class passengers to Ireland, along with some cargo, in six to seven-hour flights. If you are traveling to Ireland, however, you must take into account the time difference; they are five hours ahead of us. Passengers whose ultimate destination isn’t the Emerald Isle may connect from Dublin to about 28 other European cities. Wednesday’s first flight will be a big milestone for Bradley, which hasn’t hosted transatlantic flights since 2009, when service to Amsterdam was discontinued. Aer Lingus to begin direct flights from Bradley to Dublin The pricing for tickets from Bradley to Dublin is similar to flights leaving from Boston or New York; with booking a last-second ticket costing about $1,400. There are some benefits to flying out of Bradley, however. You will only have to go through customs in Dublin. Once you get off your return flight at Bradley, you can go home without waiting in line. The service to Ireland will also have economic benefits for western Massachusetts; bringing international travelers closer to our area. “The opportunities that we have here for jobs are increasing, so those connections to other countries are going to be ever increasing and more important as we build those connections for business,” said Rick Sullivan, President of the Western Massachusetts Economic Development Council. Currently, the only international flights operating out of Bradley travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. 22News reporter David McKay will be on Wednesday’s first flight to Ireland. Over the next several days, he will have a look at who is going to be using these flights, and where they will be going once they are in Ireland.

This research report titled 'Global Aeroderivative Gas Turbine Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This report also covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global aeroderivative gas turbine market. Increasing demand for aeroderivative gas turbines from the aerospace and marine sectors as well as the replacement of coal-fired power plants by natural gas-based gas turbine power plants are contributing to the growth of the market. Heavy investments to continuously improve the efficiency and durability of gas turbines are also contributing to the market growth. Manufacturers are focusing on developing high-efficiency gas turbines by decreasing fuel costs. These costs account for a major portion of the overall operation cost, as well as the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of gas turbines, to make the most on the growing trend of natural gas-based power generation. Anju Ajaykumar, a lead analyst at Technavio, specializing in tools and components research, says, "Increase in demand for commercial aircraft, particularly from APAC, due to rising air passenger traffic will contribute to the upsurge in demand for aeroderivative gas turbines. The US and Europe-based commercial aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing and Airbus, are expected to benefit from the increasing demand from APAC."

Based on end user, the report categorizes the global aeroderivative gas turbine market into the following segments: Mobility Power generation Oil and gas Others Global aeroderivative gas turbine market by end-user 2015 (% share) Mobility 39.09% Power generation 29.21% Oil and gas 27.18% Others 4.52% Source: Technavio The top three end-user segments for the global aeroderivative gas turbine market are as follows: Mobility sector The mobility segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.10% during the forecast period. The mobility segment primarily consists of aeronautic and marine applications of gas turbines, and is considered to be the major end-user segment in the market. This development is attributed to the significant rise in demand for air travel, resulting in the addition of aviation fleets worldwide, corresponding to growth levels of about 5%. The naval applications of aeroderivative gas turbines are expected to be dominated by GE's LM2500 gas turbine, an aero derivative of the CF6 prominent for commercial transport aircraft, in terms of production value. During 2016-2029, it is projected that GE will build 267 LM2500s for naval ships. GE is expected to be followed by Rolls-Royce with a market share of approximately 46% during the forecast period. Rolls-Royce's high efficiency MT30 gas turbine competes neck to neck against the LM2500 in power class. The turbine has been also evaluated by the U.S. Navy to power the DDG 51 Arleigh Burke class Destroyers. Power generation The power generation segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.2% during the forecast period. "With rising demand for global power and cleaner solutions, aeroderivative gas turbines are increasingly being used for power generation. APAC countries such as China and India should significantly contribute to the growth of the segment with a large number of ongoing power generation projects in these regions," adds Anju One of the most important factors impacting the growth of this market is the cost of power generation across different regions. Fuel cost plays a vital role in determining generation cost. Natural gas is the primary fuel used in aeroderivative gas turbines. Another important factor impacting the segment is the CO2 emission allowance price. The shift of power generation from coal-based power plants to natural gas-fired gas turbine power plants is highly viable with the CO2 emission allowance priced at 28 pounds/ton CO2. Oil and gas sector The oil and gas segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.40% during the forecast period. The oil and gas industry, including all segments of the value chain, such as the upstream, midstream, and downstream, uses gas turbines for power generation. The midstream and downstream segments are likely to drive the global gas turbine market in the coming years. In the upstream segment, gas turbines have been historically used in areas of high-volume gas production. Production facilities in the Middle East and North America, which usually have a basic gas processing plant, rely on gas turbine-driven captive power plants to power equipment. The midstream segment has seen the most significant growth in the use of gas turbines in the oil and gas sector. The emergence of natural gas pipelines for the provision of energy security has ushered an era of cross-country and multi-country pipelines. The downstream segment has used gas turbines for decades and the association is projected to grow. Power requirements of refineries of any magnitude are extensive. The most critical aspect of this power demand is the necessity for reliable power, as refineries have critical hot oil and steam systems that require uninterruptible power. The top vendors highlighted by Technavio's research analysts in this report are: GE Mitsubishi Hitachi Siemens Vericor Zorya Browse Related Reports: Global Gas Turbine Market 2016-2020 Global Wind Turbine Components Market 2016-2020 Global Bearing Ball Market 2016-2020 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

S7 Group, the owner of Russia’s S7 Airlines, agreed to buy the floating rocket platform Sea Launch from a group of investors and aims to restore its operations after a more than two-year hiatus, the family-owned company said. S7 Group co-founder Vladislav Filev described the deal as an “admission ticket” into the aerospace industry. Vladislav Filev in Moscow. Photographer: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg “Why are we doing it? Just because it’s beautiful,” Filev said in an interview in Moscow before heading to Guadalajara, Mexico, to sign the deal. S7 faces significant challenges in trying to revive Sea Launch, which was created by Russian, Ukrainian, Norwegian companies and Boeing Co. of the U.S. in 1995. Its operations were suspended in 2014 amid Russia’s conflict with Ukraine, which supplied Zenith rockets to the project. The business remains prone to accidents like a recent SpaceX explosion. Chapter 11 Sea Launch Co., which operated the project, filed for Chapter 11 U.S. bankruptcy protection in 2009, two years after one of its rockets blew up. When it emerged in 2010 its assets were transferred to new entities under the control of RSC Energia, an aerospace company whose biggest shareholder is the Russian government. Boeing no longer has a stake and has sued Energia and its Ukrainian former partner, seeking $356 million that the U.S. aerospace company says it is owed, according to a regulatory filing. Filev didn’t provide a value for the transaction to acquire the Sea Launch brand and assets from investors linked to RSC Energia. Two people familiar with situation, who declined to be identified as the information is not public, said the price is about $100 million. The project may also require additional investment, including building a new rocket if Ukraine won’t restore the supply, Filev said. S7 Group has no debt and will pay cash, Filev said. The company is controlled by Filev’s family and generated revenue of more than $1.3 billion last year. The airline operates 66 Boeing and Airbus Group SE jets and serves 145 routes in 27 countries. When talk of a possible deal for Sea Launch surfaced over the summer, news reports in Russia compared Filev, 53, to SpaceX and Tesla Motors Inc. founder Musk. Filev, who has been in the aviation business for more than two decades, aims to join a group of entrepreneurs, including Musk and Blue Origin and Amazon.com Inc. founder Bezos, who are driving investment in the space business. Russia Sanctions Filev said economic sanctions against Russia, which have contributed to a weak ruble, could help Sea Launch in its quest for profitability. “I think we will be highly competitive, as 80 percent of the costs are in rubles,” he said. S7 signed the contract with Energia on Tuesday, ensuring that it will help to re-start the project, Russian airline said in the statement. The agreement also cover development of the transport infrastructure in space, it said. Energia’s CEO Vladimir Solntsev said that S7 may invest $150 million into the project and that he is sure that it will be successful, Tass newswires reported from the press conference in Guadalajara. The deal on Sea Launch is subject to approval from the U.S. State Department because the launches have been operated from a command point in Los Angeles. A review could take six to nine months, Filev said. After that S7 Group will need about 18 months to restart launches, he said, though that could take longer if S7 needs to build its own rocket. Sea Launch sent nearly three-dozen rockets into space from 1999 through 2014, using a Pacific Ocean platform near the equator. It will be able to handle 50 to 70 launches in the next 15 years without modernization, Filev said. “There is a multi-year waiting list for launches, so we believe that our service will be in demand,” Filev said, adding that he would devote most of his time to Sea Launch.

But he doesn’t have the money to get to Mars alone. So today he must either announce a substantial financial partner or woo one, in the face of a very recent SpaceX rocket explosion. There's one agency Musk needs to win over, and it already has its own Mars plans Ambitious space projects are glamorous, but this event isn’t really for you and me. (We are useful only insofar as we provide politicians with evidence of public enthusiasm.) This isn’t a phone, or a new app, or new headphones — it’s not a consumer product at all. Rockets are far too expensive; space colonies are more expensive still. If Musk doesn’t announce financial backing, it means the presentation is meant to convince someone — probably NASA — to fund him. But this is an extraordinarily awkward time to try to win over money, since one of his rockets blew up earlier this month. Musk’s SpaceX has relied on being a low-cost, reliable alternative to other aerospace companies, like the United Launch Alliance. SpaceX’s biggest customer is NASA, and the company is set to shuttle astronauts to the ISS in late 2017 or early 2018. But here’s the rub: Musk is announcing his Mars plans well before he’s successfully launched a single human being to space, and immediately in the wake of a launch-pad accident. He has an unnervingly ambitious schedule for the first human mission to Mars, he’s said nothing about how much it will cost or who’s paying, and there’s been no mention of any partnerships with space agencies or suppliers for material. The goal of Musk’s speech today, then, is to show current and future customers — especially NASA — that he’s for real. It may also be to woo potential partners for a Mars mission. Neither ESA nor Roscosmos have hinted at any Mars interest, though it’s theoretically possible one or both agencies might decide on a collaborative mission. But their budgets are a fraction the size of NASA’s. So absent any funding announcement today, there’s one agency that Musk needs to win over, and it already has its own Mars plans. Musk has already announced an ambitious schedule that he almost certainly won’t stick to, in order to create the political pressure needed to force NASA’s funding. Without NASA or some other deep-pocketed benefactor, he’s sunk. There are three things he must show in his presentation: that he can meet deadlines; that his rockets are reliable; and that Mars, not the Moon, should be our goal. NASA/JPL-Caltech Deadline dysfunction Musk has relied heavily on NASA’s goodwill in building his business. So he needs to prove, today, that he can follow through on his big promises. The problem is his mouth writes checks his company can’t cash — like promising in 2011 he’ll get people into space in just three years. NASA has almost certainly been influenced by what SpaceX has promised to do. When US President Barack Obama canceled the proposed replacement to the Space Shuttle — NASA’s project to return to the Moon — Musk praised the development. Maybe SpaceX wasn’t the deciding factor in killing the program, but Musk’s feelings were unequivocal. Musk is not very good at deadlinesThe US has been hitching rides from Russia, and despite the Commercial Crew program, which contracted with SpaceX (as well as Boeing) in 2014, no Americans have gone to space on an American vehicle since the Space Shuttle was retired. NASA bet on the SpaceX at least in part because of Musk’s extravagant promises. As part of the program, SpaceX was meant to begin ferrying astronauts to the ISS by 2017; now that will likely slip to late 2018. NASA gambled heavily on SpaceX and is, presumably, now feeling the effects of that wager: the delays. So when Musk shoots off his mouth, it has real consequences for the space industry. The government frequently cites Musk’s big talk when it talks about what NASA should do. But even Musk can’t live up to his own promises — and there are significant effects on our space programs because of it. In fact, longtime SpaceX watchers know that Musk is not very good with deadlines. We’ll start with his 2011 promise: he told Marketplace that he’d put humans in space in three years. It is now five years later, and — it bears repeating — not a single person has flown aboard a SpaceX rocket. That same year, Musk told The Wall Street Journal that his best-case scenario was to put people on Mars by 2021 (his worst case scenario was between 2026 and 2031). Earlier this year, he said he was planning to put people on Mars by 2025. Not one person has flown aboard a SpaceX rocketIt’s not just SpaceX, either. Musk has this whole other company, Tesla, which sells cars. Tesla’s Model S was announced in June 2008, and production was planned for 2010. Model S production actually began two years later, in 2012. Then there’s the Model X — introduced in February 2012, it was initially scheduled for production in early 2014; deliveries started in September 2015. These blown deadlines matter because Musk and SpaceX — in all likelihood — aren’t rich enough to finance these Mars trips alone. SpaceX convinced NASA to throw millions of dollars in contracts at it, and has used that money to develop some of the technology we expect to see Musk present today. So Musk must win over someone, probably the US government, in order to pay for his colonization fantasies. And NASA’s the best candidate for getting Mars money: there’s zero business reason to go to Mars, and no known profit incentive. But NASA has already experienced what working with SpaceX is like — it knows Musk can’t hit his target dates. It’s not like NASA doesn’t blow deadlines too, but it’s something else for a very vocal contractor to be unreliable. Reliable rockets There have been two major explosions of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets with their payloads attached. On September 1st, a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Florida, while it was being fueled. The fireball was caused by a "breached helium system," the company said. It’s not the first Falcon 9 mishap, and not the first problem with the helium system. In June 2015, another Falcon 9 experienced an unplanned disintegration while it was ferrying cargo to the International Space Station, due to the failure of a strut holding down the helium tanks. By way of comparison, the United Launch Alliance’s Altas V has a much better launch record — only one flight out of more than four dozen has malfunctioned. ULA is more expensive than SpaceX, though, so Musk has been able to win bids. Now ULA is essentially arguing that buying rockets on the cheap is more expensive in the long run. Since two of SpaceX’s rockets have disintegrated with their payloads attached, that should "serve as a reminder of the complexity and hazards intrinsic to space launch services," ULA’s CEO Tony Bruno argued in a letter to Pentagon officials that was leaked to The Washington Post. ULA has complained before that the Pentagon is thinking too much about doing business on the cheap. "This strategy defies both law and logic and puts hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and Warfighter mission needs unnecessarily at risk," he wrote in the letter leaked to the Post. Mars, not the Moon Musk’s Mars dream is not likely to be cheap, which is why he needs NASA. The realest of the real talk is that no one knows how much a humans-on-Mars mission costs. NASA’s robotic programs, which are decidedly cheaper, began around 2000, and have cost about $700 million a year for the last 15 years. Old estimates — from 1989  — suggested humans on Mars might cost $450 billion. Last year, The Houston Chronicle said the cost would be between $200 billion and $400 billion; Space News pegged that price much higher, at $1.5 trillion. Musk isn’t short on money, but his money isn’t long enough to get him to Mars. NASA's Mars program has been called a "time-wasting distraction"Right now, NASA will be acting as a consultant on initial SpaceX missions, but it plans to scale down its role as the program continues, Spaceflight Now reports. That’s because NASA has its own Mars ambitions, and on a far more reasonable timeframe. The space agency plans to send people to the vicinity of Mars sometime in the 2030s. It’s even building its own rocket, the Space Launch System. It’s not impossible the SLS will be canceled, as other NASA projects have been — at a hearing in February, the space agency was chastised by a Congressional committee for not having defined-enough goals. The Mars program was also called a "time-wasting distraction." A few witnesses suggested that NASA rethink its approach or focus on the Moon. If NASA’s Mars plans are canceled, that’s another opportunity for Musk — unless the agency is instructed by a new sitting president to focus on the Moon. So if Musk doesn’t announce funding today, he’s betting big on NASA’s future moves, and hoping that going back to the Moon won’t get much traction. And while SpaceX has dropped a cool $1.5 million (as of 2014) on lobbying Washington, his recent Falcon 9 woes, along with his deadline dysfunction, may dampen enthusiasm for his plans. So don’t get swept up in the simulations of our technofuture on Mars; to make this work, Musk needs money. Either he needs to announce a source of financing, or impress one with the presentation. Because if there’s no money, there’s no Mars — no matter how fabulous SpaceX’s rocket design is.

(Photo: Mike Siegel / TNS) Mount Vernon, Wash. — A man charged with five counts of first-degree premeditated murder in the shooting deaths of five people at a Washington state mall shared an early dinner with his stepfather then told him he was headed to his job at a gym. Instead, police say, Arcan Cetin headed to the Cascade Mall in Burlington, pulled a Ruger rifle from his trunk and opened fire in a Macy’s department store, instantly killing three women and a teenage girl and critically wounding a man who died hours later. As the small city an hour north of Seattle struggled to make sense of the carnage, an unsettling portrait emerged of the man authorities say was the shooter. Cetin, 20, of Oak Harbor has a criminal record dating back at least two years and was charged last year with assaulting his stepfather, who said his stepson suffered from mental illness. One of Cetin’s neighbors at an apartment complex said he unnerved her so much that she kept a stun gun near her front door. On Monday, Cetin expressed no emotion when asked by a judge if he understood his rights. Bail was set at $2 million and his lawyer said nothing about his client in court and did not speak with reporters. “It’s a terrible tragedy for the community but having lived here my whole life, I believe the community is strong enough. It will recover,” said Rich Weyrich, Skagit County prosecutor. “It’s going to take a long time, but we will recover.” After his arrest, Cetin admitted to detectives that he was the man captured on security video carrying a Ruger rifle inside the mall, “and he did bring the rifle into Macy’s and shot all five victims,” court documents released ahead of Monday’s hearing said. Cetin left the rifle with a 25-round magazine on a cosmetics counter before fleeing, the documents said. The victims ranged in age from a 16-year-old girl to a woman in her 90s and included a probation officer and a Boeing maintenance worker. Authorities have not revealed any details about a motive, but Cetin’s stepfather David Marshall told reporters after the hearing that his stepson “has mental health issues.” He did not elaborate. The court documents painted a picture of Cetin’s stepfather and mother trying to help their son as he seemed to unravel. Cetin came to the U.S. from Turkey and is a permanent legal resident, authorities have said. Cetin faced charges last year in an assault on his stepfather after he caught Cetin smoking marijuana inside the house, according to court records. Cetin was told by a judge last December not to possess a gun, but his stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was “going through a hard time,” the records said. Cetin had been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and has taken unspecified medications in the past, the records show. He eventually moved out of his parents’ home and the stepfather told detectives after the shooting that he and his wife had helped Cetin with his rent. Cetin said his father bought him a laptop and his mother visited him regularly at his new apartment. She last saw him Wednesday, and his stepfather shared a meal with him in the late afternoon Friday, the documents said. Less than three hours later, surveillance video shows Cetin entering the mall from a fast-food restaurant, walking through the shopping center and leaving through the Macy’s women’s department exit, police said. He then moved his car closer to the Macy’s entrance and took a rifle out of the car’s trunk, the documents said. Cameras in Macy’s show him entering through the same women’s department — this time with the rifle. In the span of a minute, Cetin killed a teenage girl near some clothing racks and then walked to the cosmetics counter where he shot a man and three women, the documents said. He was arrested nearly 24 hours later in Oak Harbor, about 30 miles from the mall. Cetin’s stepfather told detectives that his Ruger rifle and .22-caliber ammunition were missing, documents said. Police interviewed the suspect’s former girlfriend and said Sunday she has an employment history at Macy’s, but not at the Burlington Mall location. They did not identify her. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Port of Seattle Commissioner Fred Felleman and Xiamen Chairman Che Shanglun took part in the ribbon cutting and toast to Xiamen by the Boeing Company. Port of Seattle CEO Ted Fick Economic and Commercial Counsellor from Consulate General of China in San Francisco Yang Yihang and other guests attended. This is not only the first long haul route originating in Xiamen with an end point in the United States, but also the first direct international service between Shenzhen and the U.S.. The service will be handled by a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with three flights per week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Xiamen Airlines chairman and general manager Che Shanglun said, "The launch of the Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is an important reflection of the results of the meeting between Chinese and American leaders in 2015. On the heels of these events, a Fuzhou-New York and a Xiamen-LA service will also be initiated, making air travel, and, by consequence, exchanges between the two countries much easier." The Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is the sixth long-haul and first American route that Xiamen Airlines has launched. Existing services include Xiamen-Amsterdam, Fuzhou-Sydney, Xiamen-Sydney, Xiamen-Melbourne and Xiamen-Vancouver routes. The newly opened Seattle service is Xiamen Airlines' first long-haul route with a stop at a city outside of Fujian province. To complete the build out of a network that extends beyond Seattle, Xiamen Airlines has signed a partnership agreement with Alaska Airlines that enables passengers traveling to Seattle via Xiamen Airlines to fly onward to 61 major and secondary destinations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The launch of the route marks the first time the Xiamen Airlines fleet has had a chance to visit the home of their "birth", as Seattle, where Boeing is located, is where each member of the 165-strong fleet of aircraft was manufactured and first saw the light of day. As a loyal client of Boeing, Xiamen Airlines operates the largest all-Boeing aircraft fleet in China. Over the past three decades, Xiamen Airlines has taken delivery of hundreds of brand new Boeing airliners and, due to the cost advantage of an all-Boeing fleet, Xiamen Airlines has continuously shown a profit for 29 years, the longest period of reporting uninterrupted profits in Chinese civil aviation history.

A joint effort between DARPA and the USAF, the program looks to develop and demonstrate critical technologies to enable an effective and affordable air-launched hypersonic cruise missile. Lockheed will undergo a research project for the program and follows a recent $147 million award for DARPA’s Boost Glide program. Northrop Grumman’s MQ-4C Triton has been cleared for low-rate initial production, the first piece of the production and deployment phase of the UAV. 68 Tritons are expected to be fielded, with the first to be deployed in 2017. The Triton will operate as a forward-deployed, land-based, autonomously operated system that provides persistent ISR within a range of 2,000 nautical miles using a multi-sensor mission payload including maritime radar, Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR), Electronic Support Measures (ESM), Automatic Identification System (AIS), and basic communications relay. Contracts worth $43 million each have been doled out to Lockheed Martin and Boeing in order “to conduct risk reduction activities in support of the MQ-25 unmanned carrier aviation air system.” Both companies are expected to complete their work on the UAV by October 2017. Now known as the Stingray program, the UAV integrates the first operational, carrier-based, catapult-launched drone and will provide long-endurance ISR and organic refueling capabilities for the carrier air wing. Middle East &North Africa The UK government has blocked EU attempts to establish an independent international inquiry into the ongoing war in Yemen, sparking accusations that London is putting its multi-billion arms deals with Saudi Arabia first. A proposal by the Netherlands was submitted to the UN last Friday which, if successful, would have seen the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva investigate alleged war crimes committed by the Saudi-led coalition and opposing Houthi militants. Brexiter and UK Foreign secretary Boris Johnson last week rejected the need for such an inquiry, arguing that the UK was “using a very, very wide variety of information sources about what is happening to acquaint ourselves with the details” about Yemen. Oskosh will provide 1,543 medium tactical vehicles in a foreign military sales contract awarded by the US Army. Valued at $378 million, the vehicles will be delivered to the governments of Somalia, Cameroon, and Iraq. The deal also covers the provision of three 78-gallon armor B-Kit corrosion prevention compound for vehicles to ship outside of the continental United States. Europe Heckler & Koch’s 5.56mm 416 F assault rifle has won a Europe-wide competition run by France as part of its Future Individual Weapon program. The rifle will replace the domestically-produced FAMAS rifle, with deliveries to commence next year and continue over a ten-year period. Chambered for the NATO caliber 5.56mm cartridge, the rifle has the ability to fire rifle grenades and can be fitted with a 40mm grenade launcher to increase its firepower. Asia Pacific Nine types of missiles have been tested by the South Korean military this year, however, only five of the missiles actually hit their targets, indicating a drop in accuracy over previous years. As a result, opposition lawmakers have used the accuracy drop to hammer the government over concerns with the proficiency of the country’s aged computerized command and control system as well as guided missile systems. Some of the missiles that failed to make the grade include the indigenous SSM-700K anti-ship missile and Raytheon’s RIM-66 anti-air missile. An upgraded Mirage 2000 fighter operated by the Indian Air Force has successfully test-fired the Mica air-to-air missile. The MBDA made missile system was recently acquired from France and follows a $2.4 billion deal to upgrade the IAF’s fleet of 51 Mirage fighters. Once completed all of the fighters will be of the Mirage 2000-5 Mark 2 variant, which boasts new radar systems, a new weapon suite, missiles, electronic warfare system and modern electronic warfare.

Related News/Archive Samsung Note 7 recall to cost at least $5.3 billion 1 Month Ago Yahoo hack could reopen $4.8 billion Verizon deal 1 Month Ago Yelp now features Florida restaurants' health inspections and owners say it may cost them business 22 Hours Ago Trade groups representing United Continental, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks starting today, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. "We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, enginemakers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord starts in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimate the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 percent of projected revenue. If the U.N.-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it's an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy. "It's peanuts," said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. Officials plan to finalize the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the U.N.'s International Civil Aviation Organization.

This follows news of its partnership last week with Boeing to install the first touch screens in the cockpits of next-generation airliners. Twitter saw its stock drop about half a percent after the bell. Rumors continue to swirl about its acquisition. In addition to Apple, Facebook, Disney and Salesforce being named as potential buyers, sources told CNBC that Microsoft is also interested in the social media giant. Shares of Kite Pharma spiked 16 percent after announcing positive results from its new drug, KTE-C19, showing 47 percent complete remission rate for patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Juno Therapeutics, which also develops immunotherapies, saw its stock grow 9 percent in sympathy with the Kite Pharma news. Mylan continued its fall today after the bell, trending downward about half a percent.

Crunch Network 3D printing is revolutionizing roadways as well as airplanes Posted Sep 26, 2016 by Charles Harrington 0 SHARES Next Story You can use encrypted chat app Signal on desktop now Charles Harrington Crunch Network Contributor Charles L. “Chuck” Harrington is chairman and CEO of Parsons, a Pasadena-based technology-driven engineering services firm with more than 70 years of experience in the engineering, construction, technical and professional services industries. How to join the network Much anticipation has been built around the future of the automotive and aerospace industries in the wake of recent advancements in 3D-printing technologies. But what’s often overlooked is the way 3D printing can also revolutionize the transportation infrastructure industry. Take for example the new technologies Stratasys demonstrated for the first time at the 2016 International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago. One of the company’s new technologies is an “Infinite-Build” system that’s designed to print parts on a vertical plane, essentially making it possible to print parts of virtually any size. While the “Infinite-Build” technology is primarily aimed at the aerospace and automotive industries — as evidenced by the partnerships Boeing and Ford have both formed with Stratasys — the concept could also transform the infrastructure industry, especially when you consider bridges require much longer parts to construct than, say, a car or plane. Still, much more research and development must be completed before we can realistically expect to “print” any bridges with additive manufacturing. One particular challenge is figuring out how to embrace these advancements in technology and evolve them to include the materials required for large-scale structures. Specifically, we must determine how to accommodate concrete and steel, the basic materials we use to construct roads and bridges. Today’s infrastructure challenge lies in bridging today’s needs with tomorrow’s possibilities. We are already starting to see new variations of concrete being developed, which perhaps could be more amenable to 3D-printing capabilities. Indeed, a type of concrete that cures instantly — and has the strength and stiffness required to meet bridge design codes without rebar — will be key. I had the opportunity to learn from a student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo of a 3D printer that printed in chocolate. The biggest challenge that had to be solved was instantaneous hardening or curing. Although different curing processes, it reinforces the point that “where there’s a will, there’s a way.” The benefits 3D printing could bring to the infrastructure industry are too significant to be overlooked, especially when roughly 75 percent of the infrastructure — our roads, bridges and tunnels — in the United States will either need to be renovated or rebuilt in their entirety by 2035, according to the Rockefeller Foundation. Today’s infrastructure challenge lies in bridging today’s needs with tomorrow’s possibilities. If utilized well, additive manufacturing would improve precision and quality control while reducing waste, costs and congestion during infrastructure construction projects. Think about the number of traffic lanes that are often closed during large-scale construction projects to accommodate the movement of massive construction materials. With 3D printing, you would be able to go on site and print large-scale structural components of transportation infrastructure in more confined spaces. This would translate to less interruption to commuters.

That’s because additive manufacturing makes it possible to use no more than the exact amount of materials necessary per project. Plus, whatever surplus of raw materials is left over could then be used for another construction project. Safety is another major potential benefit of using 3D printing to build infrastructure. On sites that are particularly difficult to access, autonomous 3D printing would ideally eliminate the need to have work crews situated in precarious positions during construction. That alone is a significant benefit. There is tremendous potential for 3D printing to revolutionize the way our infrastructure is built in the future. But in order to achieve this potential, there must be collaboration and further innovation of the engineering, construction, materials, technology and financial industries — in addition to leadership of federal, provincial and local governments.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst) In February 2016, China declared in its National Congress that there will be a battle for growth. This battle will consist of nation states fighting for global market share. As nations align themselves with the Eastern Eurasian cycle or the Western Trans-Atlantic cycle, the global playing field is changing into a full-scale economic competition. Recession and Disruption The global marketplace is shrinking. The transactions of the past are changing, as they are increasingly demanding better price, faster delivery, advanced quality, supportive aftermarket services, increased customer satisfaction, increasing shareholder returns, and more capable employees. The pressures on business to adapt are becoming intolerable. A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Oct. 15, 2014. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Training demands increase daily as obsolescence within the business and the marketplace haunts the CEO at every turn. A head in the sand approach doesn’t work anymore. Threat levels increase daily with hydra-headed disruption coming from all directions. Small nimble competitors are appearing from all directions, and startups with little or no experience are taking on global corporations from nowhere and fighting for an efficient transaction. Related Coverage Central Banks Are Close to Centralizing Everything The Only Sure Conclusion About the G-20 Summit The G-20’s Display of Irrelevance As the market shrinks, so does the need for employment. Employees can find themselves without a job overnight. This then leads to recession as buying power evaporates and large numbers of people find themselves without a stable income. This anger at the changing world economy leads to frustration and guilt, which turn to voter apathy, lethargy in leadership, and demands for change. This is why Donald Trump, the insurgent candidate, gained the Republican Party nomination. Battle for Growth In preparing for a battle for growth, China is getting ready for something that hasn’t appeared in the last 250 years. What the Chinese like to call the Dragon environment. All economies around the world are going to fight for growth in a decreasing transactional environment. Take TATA steel in the U.K. as an example of what the future will bring. The Chinese are clearly fighting an industrial war here. Dumped Chinese steel exports at ridiculously low prices are meant to kill any possibility of doing business with other companies. A Chinese works in a steel market in Yichang in central China’s Hubei Province, on April 25, 2016. (Chinatopix via AP) Because of the need to shore up shareholder value, there is constant pressure to cut costs. Any wrong move by a company competing with the Chinese may result in a loss in stock ratio, leading to a greater calamity of the share price falling. This is what the Chinese are hoping for. Related Coverage Globalization’s Toll—Tata Steel’s Expansion Dream Britain’s Steel Industry: Decline Isn’t Just Down to Tata China to Accelerate Steel Dumping in 2016 Once the Chinese sell to distributors at prices marked down because of excess inventory in the Chinese marketplace, they will be looking to either shrink down their competition or eliminate it completely. This will allow ease of entry into the market at a later date. Customers will have no choice but to buy from China because there won’t be any other competitors. The British know that when Tata steel closes down in the current crisis, imports of steel will have to be taken from outside the country. This then becomes something completely different, a matter of national security. Why? Because it takes decades to build up the infrastructure of an efficient steel industry, and once the foundation of these industries go, they never come back. This Has Happened Before You don’t have to go back too long to see these effects. The electronics industry in Silicon Valley, the motorcycle industry in the U.K., the automotive industry of Detroit, the aircraft industry and Boeing plant in Seattle, the textile mills of the past, the record industry of California. People speak of these changes as positive news, as if these jobs will go and better ones will come. Maybe. But these plants will not come back. Related Coverage China Could Control the Global Internet After Oct. 1 China Wants to Control What You Watch When Japan industrialized, it became a threat to the established U.S. brands in the 70s. The rest of the Asian economic tigers followed them in household goods production and automotive industry dominance. This time however, the situation is different. The sheer size of the industrial giant stalking the world’s market place makes us quake in our boots. This is not Japan who follows our rules, or other competitors who play by the rules. This is China, which has dominated the world economy for 18 out of the last 20 centuries. They are returning to the number one spot, and they intend to make the world in their own image, just like the Japanese and Germans have tried to do before them with their respective drives for manufacturing dominance over the world economy. The Battle for the Transaction Indeed, disruption has always happened throughout history, whether in scientific, military, innovative, or social ways. Disruption is just another word for change. The key thing to remember about disruption is that it is based upon two concepts, defense and attack of the existing transaction. The speed of the transaction in agriculture, manufacturing, and services is increasing. It’s not on-time delivery that matters any more, it’s now emotional delivery or instant delivery that matters. Can I get what I want with the swipe of my phone? Can I place one finger in the air and have a taxi turn up to take me where I need to go? Related Coverage Shadow Banking Increases the Risk of Another Global Financial Crisis China Calls on Credit Default Swaps to Spread the Pain Uber’s Next Disruption: Self-Driving Taxis Disruption means one thing, can you attack a competitor’s transaction and compete with them on the elements of the exchange of goods and services? This is what Uber, AirBnB, and the Chinese steel industry are doing now. They are disrupting the flow of finance from the customer to the supplier—in its basic form they are attacking supply and demand. You do this by analyzing exactly what makes up a transaction in its basic form and then you out qualify that transaction using whatever weapons in your arsenal you have designed, purchased, assembled, and created from scratch. Overnight, competitors are disrupted using the basic attack strategy of a better transaction. Everyone in the marketplace is thinking about it right now. General view of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) building in Beijing, China, on Jan. 13, 2016. (VCG via Getty Images) It’s open season among nation states as well. In a recent infamous battle between America and China, Britain was in the center. America wanted Britain not to join the AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a Chinese initiative that competes with the U.S.-dominated World Bank and International Monetary Fund), but Britain ignored the warnings and went ahead and joined anyway. And then Western nations followed them. The customers and countries flocked to the AIIB because they need to be involved in the economic development of Eurasia. Related Coverage Back to Square One: Why the Financial System Needs to Reset Understanding the Financial System Essentially, Britain disrupted the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund by joining AIIB, which took the wind right out of the sails of the two previous banking flagships. So suddenly, the IMF and WB found that they were disrupted and had to change the way they operate in order to survive. If they don’t change the way they do business and become competitive, they could easily lose out to entire countries, regions, and even continents as they become increasingly irrelevant to the smarter competitors who have attacked their previous nation of transactions with more value, capability and reach to the populations they intend to supply. The British people followed suit and voted for Brexit, reinforcing the employment independence of the British people and Britain’s own preparation for the battle for growth. Preparing for Battle So how do you prepare for battle in such an uncertain and unpredictable world, where a competitor can spring up from anywhere? Where a trusted ally will just abandon you in the blink of an eye? When time has no boundaries and time to prepare doesn’t exist anymore? What do you do when there are absolutely no geographic boundaries to business and no interests except short term interest because of the enormous pressure balance sheets and uncertainty brings in the marketplace? This is a very difficult proposition for every lawmaker, CEO, or shop floor employee who has pressures hanging over their head that they simply have not seen before. Each country, corporation, and enterprise will have to create their own plan to adapt to the world of disruption, depletion, and the rise of unrestricted warfare which everybody in the world is facing right now.

It is 'projected to enter service in the mid-2020s, building to a fleet of 100 aircraft.'  Scroll down for video  The US Air Force on Friday unveiled the first image of its next-generation bomber that will replace antique B-52s first developed during the Cold War. The all-black plane has a distinctive, zigzagging shape and a low profile designed to make it hard to spot on radar  WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT B-21 - The Air Force planning to introduce the aircraft in mid-2020s. -The all-black plane has a distinctive, zigzagging shape and a low profile designed to make it hard to spot on radar.  - The bomber was previously known as the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) - The latest name, B-21, recognises the aircraft as the military’s first bomber of the 21st century, - It is designed to be launch from the continental US and deliver airstrikes on any location in the world.  - While the new plane's specific capabilities are highly secret, it likely will be equipped with high-tech communications gear. -It will replace Air Force B-52 bombers, which have been flying for more than half a century - It will also eventually the B-1 bombers, when they retire sometime in the 2040s. The name was ultimately selected by James and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Dave Goldfein after a panel composed of staff from AFGSC and Headquarters Air Force determined the top-ranked selections from more than 2,100 unique naming submissions.  'The B-21 is intended to operate in both conventional and nuclear roles, with the capability of penetrating and surviving in advanced air defense environments,' The Air Force said. 'It will be capable of operation by an onboard crew or piloted remotely.'  Earlier this year the US Air Force unveiled the first image of its new stealth bomber when Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James provided the world with the first glimpse of the project using an artist's rendering. The rendering bears more than a passing resemblance to the Air Force's B-2 bomber, which is also made by Northrop Grumman.  However the new document reveals it may not be that accurate. 'The released rendering shows a flying-wing design not dissimilar to the B-2, although simpler in shape.  'It resembles early proposed designs that later evolved into the B-2.' The report also outlines the craft,s unmanned capabilities, saying 'Initial B-21s will be manned, with unmanned operation possible several years after initial operational capability (IOC).' Nuclear qualification will also take two years or so after IOC, the report says. It is designed to be launch from the continental US and deliver airstrikes on any location in the world.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Oxygen has been disappearing from the Earth’s atmosphere for...

Share this article Share 135 shares At an earlier event in Orlando, James revealed the plane - previously known as the Long Range Strike Bomber - would be called the B-21 until a new name has been agreed on, and she invited air crews to help. The designation B-21 recognises the aircraft as the military’s first bomber of the 21st century. 'This aircraft represents the future for our Airmen, and (their) voice is important to this process,' James told the Air Force Association's Air Warfare Symposium. The new bomber is a high Air Force priority because the oldest ones in its fleet — the venerable B-52s — have far outlived their expected service life. Even the newest — the B-2 stealth bombers (pictured) — having been flying for more than two decades The program has been shrouded in secrecy since its inception for fear of revealing military secrets to potential enemies. The military also wanted to avoid giving the losing bidders any details before their formal protest was rejected last week. The Air Force wants 100 of the warplanes, which will replace the ageing B-52s and the B-1 bombers that first saw action in the 1980s. Industry news reports say that while the new plane's specific capabilities are highly secret, it likely will be equipped with high-tech communications gear and other electronics that would allow it to perform a variety of missions, not just dropping bombs.  The new bomber is a high Air Force priority because the oldest ones in its fleet — the venerable B-52s — have far outlived their expected service life. Even the newest — the B-2 stealth bombers — having been flying for more than two decades.  A third bomber, the B-1, is used heavily for conventional strikes, but no longer is certified for nuclear missions. The Pentagon in October announced Northrop as the winner of the contract to build the bomber in a decades-long program that will likely end up costing in excess of $100 billion.  But work on the new plane was delayed for months while federal auditors reviewed a protest by Boeing and its key supplier, Lockheed Martin. Boeing has now told senior U.S. Air Force leaders that it will not take further legal action challenging the contract, Reuters said, citing two sources familiar with the decision. The B-21 bomber will replace Air Force B-52 bombers, which have been flying for more than half a century. Pictured is the B-52 Stratofortress entered service in the 1950s A pilot and co-pilot of a B-52 bomber in an image taken in 1972. These bombers are not out of date at the Air Force is looking to replace them with 100 B-21 bombers The Air Force, under pressure from lawmakers and retired Air Force officers, has promised to release more information about the new plane in March. And the program has now survived the legal protest process, it still faces hurdles in Congress. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain on Thursday said he would block the Air Force's use of a cost-plus type of contract for the long-range bomber since it holds the government responsible for cost overruns. The Air Force says that only the engineering and development phase of the program, valued at $21.4 billion, is structured as a cost-plus contract with incentive fees. Analysts say the program will be worth around $80 billion in total, providing a boon to Northrop and its key suppliers, but the Air Force has said only that it expects to pay $511 million per plane. John Michael Loh, a retired four-star U.S. Air Force general, has urged the Air Force to name Northrop's suppliers to shore up support in Congress, and avoid a re-run of the B-2 bomber program, which was scaled back from 132 planes to just 21, which drove the price of each plane sharply higher.  THE HISTORY OF THE B-2 BOMBER  The first operational aircraft, christened Spirit of Missouri, was delivered to Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, where the fleet is based, on 17 December 1993. Twenty one aircraft were built in the original B-2 fleet.  The B-2 has demonstrated its capabilities in several combat scenarios, including Operation Allied Force in Kosovo; Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and most recently, in Libya, during Operation Odyssey Dawn. The B-2 is the only U.S. aircraft that combines long range, large payload and stealth in a single platform, giving it the ability to project air power anywhere in the world.  It can fly 6,000 nautical miles unrefueled and 10,000 nautical miles with just one aerial refueling. The Air Force said it will buy 100 of the new bombers at a newly calculated average cost of $511 million each. Pictured is the a B-2A bomber from the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri With its ability to carry more than 20 tons of conventional and nuclear ordnance and deliver it precisely under any weather conditions, the B-2 also has the ability to change the outcome of a conflict with a single mission.  Today, the fleet consists of 20 aircraft, following the loss, in February 2008, of the Spirit of Kansas, which crashed while taking off from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, the only such incident in the B-2's more than 20 years of operation.  Nineteen B-2s are currently based at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., home of the 509th Bomb Wing, while one aircraft is assigned to flight testing at Edwards AFB, California to validate software and weapon systems upgrades. The idea is that the latest B-21 bomber, which is still on the drawing board will replace Air Force B-52 bombers, which have been flying for more than half a century. It will also eventually the B-1 bombers, when they retire sometime in the 2040s.

The event will take place during World Standards Week (WSW), a series of meetings and celebrations hosted annually by the Institute, coordinator of the U.S. voluntary standardization system. All ANSI members and interested stakeholders from government, industry, business, consumer groups, and academia are encouraged to attend and share their perspectives and expertise on integral industry news and updates that influence the standardization communities domestically and globally. The highly anticipated event will include ANSI's Annual Business Meeting luncheon, during which the Institute's president and CEO and Board chair will present updates on ANSI's recent activities, accomplishments, and strategic direction.  The day-long forum is free for all ANSI members, and will feature the following moderated panel sessions: "Drones and Unmanned Vehicles: Coming to a Standards Meeting Near You," will focus on how standards can alleviate the challenges related to technologies associated with drones, unmanned aircraft systems, and unmanned vehicles, as consumer demand for these systems rises. Panel representatives from the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), SAE International, and the U.S. Department of Transportation will participate, with more panelists to be confirmed. "Changing Landscape: How Will Standards and Conformance Look in 10 Years?" will explore how the standards development and conformity assessment environment will continue to evolve over the next decade, how to engage new stakeholders, and how standards and conformance programs will change. Moderated by a representative of The Boeing Company, the panel will feature the chairs of ANSI's Government Member Forum, (GMF), Company Member Forum (CMF), Organizational Member Forum (OMF), and the Consumer Interest Forum (CIF). "What is the True Impact of Standardization? A New Report from the International Trade Administration (ITA)," will investigate the relationship between standards and technical regulations and goods trade, as a recent report found that standards and global technical regulations potentially affect 93 percent of global exports and 92 percent of U.S. exports. Experts from ITA will walk ANSI members through the paper and its key findings in this informative presentation. "Services Initiative: Reaching New Sectors" will cover updates on ANSI's Board Task Group (BTG) on services standards, which focuses on five sectors: food safety, retail, transportation, recycling and waste management, and amusement and entertainment, with representatives from the American Dental Association, Inteleos, and additional panelists to be confirmed. "China Standardization Reform" will offer the latest insights on the overhaul of China's standardization system, which may have significant implications for U.S. stakeholders, particularly industry. Speakers are set to include representatives from the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), with a moderator from Corning Incorporated. The full agenda with speaker information is available here. The JMF meeting and Annual Business Meeting luncheon will be held at the FHI Conference Center, Washington, DC. The event will take place on Tuesday, October 26, from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., including lunch. Registration is required by October 14, 2016, and is available via the ANSI WSW web page. World Standards Week, to be held this year on October 24-28, 2016, is an annual event where members of the standards and conformity assessment community come together in the spirit of cooperation and collaboration.

KING 6:24 PM. CDT September 26, 2016 Family members confirm Sarai Lara, 16, was killed in the Cascade Mall shootings in Burlington, Wash. (Photo: KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST BURLINGTON, Wash. -- The Skagit County coroner is expected to release more information about the five people killed in the Cascade Mall shooting on Tuesday, but KING 5 is learning more details about the victims. Family members say Sarai Lara, a 16-year-old Mount Vernon High School sophomore and cancer survivor, died when the gunman opened fire on Friday. Her mother and father were in the mall but did not go with her to Macy's, where the shooting happened. Family members confirm Sarai Lara, 16, was killed in the Cascade Mall shootings in Burlington, Wash.   (Photo: KING) "She was just a really beautiful lady. She was just really sweet to everybody," said Salvador Lara Jr., Sarai's brother. "She was a very caring young lady. She didn't deserve this." Her mother says her daughter survived cancer, and just last week her doctor told her everything was fine. She says she's saddened that her daughter had to die this way. She had also just applied for a job at Denny's and was going to start working to support the family. "She had a second chance to live her life. I guess God didn't let her live too long," said Salvador. "I have no words to express my feelings right now. I'm just speechless." Sarai's parents say they haven't seen their daughter's body yet and are desperate to hear from investigators. Probation officer and daughter among victims Belinda Galde and Beatrice Dotson, a mother and daughter, both died in the cosmetics section of the Macy's department store where the shooting occurred. Authorities say Galde was a probation officer. The Snohomish County District Court in a statement identified Belinda Galde as an employee with the court since 1989, reports the Associated Press. The statement says the 64-year-old Galde "was an amazingly kind and caring individual" who helped thousands of probationers find a better way to live. Macy's employee a 'giving, graceful and caring' soul  Other victims were Shayla Martin, 52, a Macy's employee, and Chuck Eagan, a Boeing employee who was just about to retire. Martin's daughter Tanya Young said Martin was a loving grandmother and mother, who always put others before herself. "My mother was the most giving, graceful and caring souls," Young wrote in an email. "Everyone that knew her was touched by her light. She was intelligent and full of class." Boeing employee 'sacrificed himself to save his wife' Chuck Eagan and his wife began running when the shooter opened fire. His wife slipped and fell. Eagan stopped to help her, but was shot. "Pam was able to roll under a table and hide at some point. I understand the gunman walked past her but didn't see her," said Allen Hicks of Marysville, a friend of Eagan. "He sacrificed himself to save his wife. That's the kind of person he was," Hicks added. "The hard part was picturing him around any act of violence, because that wasn't him." Hicks said Eagan made interiors for Boeing airplanes and spent 25 years at the aerospace company. "He talks slow. And a lot of times we'd be, come on Chuck. Get on with the story, get on with the story. But they were great stories," said Hicks. "I'm glad he came into my life and I knew him." Hicks worries about Eagan's wife, who was not hurt in the shooting. "I cannot imagine what she's going through...I don't want her to go through survivors guilt." Friends say Chuck Eagan died trying to protect his wife during the Cascade Mall shooting.

His Place Church, where survivors were reunited with their loved ones after the shooting, also held a vigil for the victims Saturday. Attendees prayed for the victims and connected with other community members seeking support. Community members in Skagit County gathered Saturday at Maiben Park to grieve and support one another. Organizers called it "Skagit Strong." “When people come together and share their hearts it relieves that stress,” said Patty, a "Skagit Strong" organizer. There will be a Light Up the Boulevard candlelight vigil Monday, Sept. 26 at 7 p.m. to remember the victims. It will be in the Cascade Mall parking lot between Applebee's and Johnny Carino's.

Xiamen Airlines Rolls Out New Service: Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle Xiamen Airlines Rolls Out New Service: Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle ICT Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 26/09/2016 15:02 XIAMEN, SHENZHEN, China and SEATTLE, Sept. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Xiamen Airlines launched its Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service on Sept. 26 th, creating an air bridge connecting two of China's major special economic zones and an economic heavyweight on the U.S. West Coast. This is not only the first long haul route originating in Xiamen with an end point in the United States, but also the first direct international service between Shenzhen and the U.S. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410761 The service will be handled by a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with three flights per week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The flight numbers are MF845 and MF846. Xiamen Airlines chairman and general manager Che Shanglun said, "The launch of the Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is an important reflection of the results of the meeting between Chinese and American leaders in 2015. On the heels of these events, a Fuzhou-New York and a Xiamen-LA service will also be initiated, making air travel, and, by consequence, exchanges between the two countries much easier." The Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is the sixth long haul and the first American route that Xiamen Airlines has launched. The existing services including Xiamen-Amsterdam, Fuzhou-Sydney, Xiamen-Sydney, Xiamen-Melbourne and Xiamen-Vancouver. The newly opened Seattle service is Xiamen Airlines' first long haul route with a stop at a city outside of the Fujianprovince. To complete the build out of a network that extends beyond Seattle, Xiamen Airlines has signed a partnership agreement with Alaska Airlines that enables passengers traveling to Seattle via Xiamen Airlines, to fly onward to 61 major and secondary destinations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico by connecting to an Alaska Airlines flight in Seattle. The launch of the route marks the first time the Xiamen Airlines fleet has had a chance to visit the home of their "birth", as Seattle, where Boeing is located, is where each member of the 165-strong fleet of aircraft was manufactured and first saw the light of day. As a loyal client of Boeing Co., Xiamen Airlines operates the largest all-Boeing aircraft fleet in China. Over the past 3 decades, Xiamen Airlines has taken delivery of hundreds of brand new Boeing airliners and, due to the low cost advantage of an all-Boeing fleet, Xiamen Airlines has continuously shown a profit for 29 years, the longest period of reporting uninterrupted profits in Chinese civil aviation history.

Lifestyle Why phones, electronic devices can’t be used on board aircraft. September 26, 2016 0 122 Author: sunnewsonline Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Ever wonder why do airlines advise passengers to turn off all mobile phones and all electronic appliances prior to aircraft taking off and landing, and sometimes even while it is at a cruising altitude? I know you have as this is one question that almost any curious first time flyer on an aircraft or even regular flyers would like to get an answer to.   Sometimes you are still fiddling with the phone trying to make the last call or send perhaps a last SMS to a close friend or family members. It could be to alert that you are about to depart and to get the other person at the other end informed so that they can pick you up once you arrive. It could even be, particularly for those with a phobia to fly, a call for a prayer of supplication for a safe flight. Then from nowhere, comes the warning; it’s a voice from the aircraft public address systems.  “Please turn off your phones and any other electronic device”. For years, frequent flyers have complained about the inability to use their electronic devices on planes. Several people have questioned why they can’t make phone call from their cell phone during a flight? The reasons This reason has its basis in both practical applications of science and in the law. Cell phones and wireless devices such as laptops emit active transmissions on the electromagnetic spectrum, also found in devices that include phones, radios and Wi-Fi networks. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has the  jurisdiction over the use of electronic devices on airplanes and it has banned the use of electronic devices on planes for fear that the electromagnetic interference associated with their use could affect the delicately calibrated and critically important instruments used to help the pilot fly the plane. Had an electronic device given off a strong enough signal, it could have negative impact on the aircraft navigational equipment, garbled radio transmissions, or otherwise interfered with the plane’s instruments. Anyone who has ever set a mobile phone near a radio or television speaker and heard the effects which alters the sounds from the speaker will readily appreciate and understand the reason for this concern. Imagine what that sort of interference multiplied by the dozens or hundreds of passengers on a particular aircraft  all using electronic devices at the same time could amount to. It would be a real catastrophe. It could compromise the aircraft safety. American aircraft manufacturer, Boeing also investigated several cases in the 1990s where aircraft crews reported that laptop computers or gaming devices caused autopilot disconnects, uncommanded airplane rolls or instrument display malfunctions. Ban on Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Last Tuesday, Nigeria joined the United States of America, Australia, and other European countries to ban the use or even the charging of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 mobile phones on any airborne aircraft in the country. It will be recalled that Samsung has recalled over 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 devices it manufactured recently citing several reported cases of overheating and outright explosion by users. “ NCAA has directed passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft,” said the NCAA. . “In addition, these phones must not be stowed away in any checked-in baggage and importantly, all airlines are hereby advised to emphasize the prohibition of this devices on board during passenger briefings by the Cabin Crew,” the statement added. The saying that to be forewarned is to be fore warmed comes it handy here. If you are a passenger on an airline and are asked to turn off the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 or any electronic device for any reason, whether you believe it to be valid or not, please comply. Indeed, your compliance will ensure the safety of your flight and will also save you from facing serious  criminal charges from the NCAA. The same weight of the law applies to anyone caught smoking on board an aircraft. Domestic airlines to save N26.5bn annually from import duty waivers Domestic airline operators in Nigeria now have some reasons to smile as the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) has commenced the implementation of a new Federal Government duty free policy on imported aircraft parts. With the absence of a functional Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility as well as any aircraft spares manufacturing firm, Nigerian airlines rely entirely on importation of component parts of aircraft which have to be routinely changed in line with manufacturers specifications. The parts don’t come cheap either. The Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) usually charge five percent duty on any aircraft imported into the country, as well as aircraft spares, engines, and other accessories.. And in recent months, operators have cited the huge cost of sourcing for foreign exchange (forex) to import these parts into the country as one of the reasons hurting the fortunes of the local airline industry. In response to their plea, the government in July this year granted an import duty waiver on imported aircraft parts and spares to commercial airline operators to ease their operations. Two months later, operators said the NCS had failed to implement the policy. Operators like First Nation had even cited their inability to get the NCS grant in waivers to import critical engine components into the country on time as part of reasons for delaying the maintenance work on one of its aircraft. Customs had cited the ambiguity in the policy and the fact that it had a automated software  that captures all imported items and their duty value and that it needed some time to re-programme its software to capture the waivers for commercial airline spares. Spokesman for the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Mr. Yakubu Dati, however said last week that the Minister of State for Aviation, Mr. Hadi Sirika, had waded into the issue and that Customs had now commenced the implementation of the policy. “This policy would save Nigerian domestic airlines that were paying at least 5 per cent import duty on every spare part, about N26.5 billion per annum,” said Dati. “This means the era of Customs holding on to airlines’ spare parts has become a thing of the past. One of the gains is that downtime will reduce because an airline can import an engine and within a day clear it with Customs and on the second day mount it on the aircraft and start operations, ” said one industry official.

The agreement is part of Maersk’s Carbon Pact Challenge, an initiative under which the ocean carrier and its customers work together to drive down emissions and reduce the environmental impact of shipping. As part of their agreement, Agility and Maersk will look for ways to cut emissions by shipping cargo on more fuel efficient ships, optimising shipping networks and routes, they said, and other steps to reduce CO2 emissions such as working on how to integrate CO2 emission indicators into the regular business information flow and procurement of ocean shipping. "Responsible companies are looking for innovative, commercially viable ways to reduce the impact of their business on the environment," said Cas Pouderoyen, the Agility senior vice president for Global Ocean Freight. "In Maersk, we have one of the most creative and committed partners in the shipping industry. Our Carbon Pact partnership with them will benefit Agility customers and the planet." The International Maritime Organisation says ocean shipping accounts for 10 per cent of global CO2 emissions for transport. Road vehicles (73 per cent) and air transport (12 per cent) are the top sources of the greenhouse gas. In a bid to address the aviation industry’s emissions, leading airlines are supporting a United Nations proposal to limit pollution from international flights – even though the measure may eventually cost companies US$24 billion annually. Trade groups representing United Continental, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning on Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. The industry was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global airline routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programmes. "We recognise that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, the executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimates the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9bn by 2035, or 1.8 per cent of projected revenue. If the UN-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. The bid for a global emissions deal rose to the top of the aviation agenda in 2012, after the European Union said it would require airlines to buy carbon permits for all flights in and out of Europe. That triggered outcry from China, Egypt, Brazil and other nations that argued the measure was beyond the EU’s authority. Europe agreed to suspend its effort and allow nations to negotiate an international deal. Officials plan to finalise the agreement during the talks that begin this week, hosted by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation. More than 2,000 delegates are expected to attend, making it the organisation’s largest assembly ever. Success is far from certain. The current proposal calls for Delta Air Lines, Deutsche Lufthansa and other industry leaders to initially subsidise the growth of smaller carriers. Over time, all airlines would be responsible for offsetting their own emissions growth. The United States has pushed for that transition to happen as soon as possible. Brazil and other developing nations have argued for it to happen slowly. European Union Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said the 28-nation block would strive to ensure credits are certified by the United Nations. "This will be the first-ever global carbon-reduction deal for a single industry," Ms Bulc said. "I hope that we can encourage other sectors to follow.

The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry.

Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it's an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy “It's peanuts,” said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. “It gets them off the hook.

Korea Threat Grows Anthony Capaccio ACapaccio September 25, 2016 — 7:00 PM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp North Korea's Nukes Keep Getting Stronger Test to shoot down dummy missile expected in first quarter Next U.S. president will see if troubled system is improving Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp The Pentagon’s next test of its ground-based system to destroy missiles aimed at the U.S. is tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2017, providing the new president evidence of whether the troubled program could stop the nuclear weapons North Korea threatens to launch. With North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un escalating his efforts to develop warheads and missiles capable of hitting the U.S. -- along with his vows to use them -- a test failure would confront the next administration with difficult decisions about a system that the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has estimated will cost at least $39 billion. The planned test in early 2017 to shoot down a dummy target replicating the threat from an intercontinental ballistic missile will be the first since a successful interception in June 2014. And that, in turn, was the first success since a test in 2008, which was followed by two failures in 2010 and an extensive effort to fix flaws with the interceptor’s warhead. The next test of the Ground-Based Interceptor system managed by Boeing Co. will take advantage of major improvements to the hit-to-kill warhead built by Raytheon Co. and an improved booster from Orbital ATK Inc., Chris Johnson, spokesman for the Defense Department’s Missile Defense Agency, said in an e-mail. Real-World Threat It’s also the first time the U.S. will attempt an intercept using all of the system’s sensors and communications against a target representing the real-world threat that would be posed by an ICBM, Johnson said. The Missile Defense Agency is working closely with Pentagon testers and the intelligence community “to ensure the threat is accurately represented to the extent possible,” but “target details are classified,” Army Major Roger Cabiness, a spokesman for Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department’s director of operational testing, said in an e-mail. “The reliability and availability” of the Ground-Based Interceptors that are already deployed at bases in California and Alaska remain low as the agency “continues to discover new failure modes during testing,” Cabiness said. The U.S. missile defense test will take place in the context of North Korea’s claims that it successfully tested a nuclear device this month that can be placed atop a long-range missile. U.S. Vice Admiral James Syring, head of the Missile Defense Agency, hinted during a budget briefing in February that the target for the defense system’s next test would replicate some projected characteristics of North Korea’s road-mobile KN-08 ICBM. The North Korean missile is thought by Pentagon officials and intelligence analysts to be capable of hitting parts of the U.S. mainland, although it hasn’t been flight-tested. While the test target “would be replicating the expected range and speed of an ICBM,” Syring said at the briefing that “we would be more concerned” with whether it replicates the KN-08. For a look at Clinton, Trump and a Nuclear North Korea, click here. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told an audience in Washington on Sept. 20 that “we have long assessed that the North Koreans have the capability to fit a nuclear weapon in a warhead on a missile.” Clapper singled out the KN-08, “which is judged to be” capable of hitting parts of the U.S. “Neither the North Koreans or we know if these will actually work” because a full missile system with a warhead, or re-entry vehicle, hasn’t been tested, Clapper said. “But in our business we kind of have to assume the worst.” Syring and other U.S. officials also have said the KN-08 is the projected threat that’s driving U.S. plans to increase the number of ground interceptors in Alaska and California to 44 by Dec. 31, 2017. Thirty-four are in silos today. Developing a missile able to destroy a high-flying ICBM is a tougher challenge than repelling incoming short or medium-range tactical missiles, the purpose of the Thaad defense system that the U.S. plans to deploy in South Korea over the objections of China and Russia. Unresolved Issues Questions persist about how well the U.S. system to stop an ICBM would work. The missile defense agency “has demonstrated partial capability” against “small numbers of simple ballistic missile threats launched from North Korea and Iran,” Cabiness, the spokesman for the Pentagon testing office, said in an e-mail. That assessment was based in part on the June 2014 intercept that demonstrated several software fixes and a partially successful non-intercept test this January that showed some improvements with other components. It’s not possible yet to predict the probability of a successful interception, such as an 80 percent confidence level, Cabiness said. Such a quantitative assessment requires “extensive ground testing” supported by accredited “modeling and simulation,” he said. Laura Grego, a missile defense analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in an e-mail that the answers from the testing office raise “the important question: How good is partial? Or as most people would ask, ‘Does it work?’” For example, none of the intercept tests since 2010 have used targets representative of actual threats or complex countermeasures, she said. Since its inception, the system “has destroyed its target fewer than half the 17 times it has been tested, and its record is not improving over time,” she said. Since the 2004 deployment decision, “the system has a three-for-nine record,” said Grego, co-author of a July report titled “Shielded From Oversight: The Disastrous U.S. Approach to Strategic Missile Defense.” Johnson of the Missile Defense Agency said it continues to improve reliability by upgrading interceptors already fielded, by “implementing improvements in new production interceptors,” and by incorporating reliability improvements in future warhead designs. Asked why the next test will come more than two years after the mid-2014 exercise, Johnson said it’s “aligned with availability” of the new warhead and booster designs “after we completed rigorous ground testing on the new and modified components.” The agency “constantly demonstrates and evaluates” the system “by conducting complex war-games, ground tests and advanced computer modeling and simulation,” Johnson said.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Table of contents Syrian Rebels to Get Beefed Up Weaponry | Saab Eyes UK; Hopes to One Day Replace E-3 Sentry | KAI’s KUH-1 Moves to Redesign to Correct Defects Sep 26, 2016 00:59 UTC by Defense Industry Daily staff Americas Maintenance work carried out on USAF JSTARS aircraft by Northrop Grumman, has resulted in four of their fleet being grounded over concerns with the quality of the work. The four planes are being inspected for any possible safety of flight issues on the ground at Robins Air Force Base, GA, home of the 116th Air Control Wing. Assembly of an independent review team is also underway which will be tasked to “inspect and validate quality assurance processes at the contractor’s depot,” according to a service spokesperson. Middle East & North Africa Backers of Syrian rebels fighting the forces of President Bashar al-Assad are to send new types of heavy weapons following the collapse of a week long ceasefire last week. However the new arms, which include Russian-made rocket launchers and artillery, are believed not to represent any major shift in support. The USA, alongside neighboring governments, looking to topple Assad for a more friendly regime have sent military support to militias fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army for the last number of years. Even Islamist and Jihadist groups have often benefited (either directly or indirectly) from Western-backed patronage as the ever shifting ground of alliances and players in the conflict continue to muddy the waters of an increasingly complex conflict. Africa Angola is to receive the first of their refurbished Mi-24P helicopters from Russia later this month. Work completed by manufacturer Russian Helicopters includes rotor blade and tail rotor blade replacements as well as engine, transmission unit and avionics repairs. Sudan, Mali, and Nigeria will also join Angola in receiving refurbished Russian attack helicopters after it was announced at this year’s Africa Aerospace & Defense (AAD) Expo in South Africa. Europe While the UK doesn’t look set to acquire Gripen fighters anytime soon, Saab are keen that their GlobalEye AEW&C platform would be an ideal replacement for the RAF’s current fleet of six Boeing E-3 Sentrys. The company believes that products such as its EyrieEye ER system – or a larger package like the Bombardier Global 6000-based GlobalEye – are still in the running in the UK market, even though London looks set to keep the E-3s operational until 2035. Until then, recent GlobalEye purchaser UAE may provide some operational reviews before the UK decides to go the full monty on GlobalEye. Leonardo-Finmeccanica could have their third consecutive head honcho face jail time as Italian prosecutors request a 16-year jail sentence for Mauro Moretti, the company’s current CEO. While Moretti’s predecessors’ main wrongdoings relate to 2013’s well publicized Indian helicopter bribery scandal (AKA Choppergate), Moretti’s troubles stem from his time as head of Italy’s railways. Prosecutors are looking to find top rail brass culpable for a 2009 crash of a cargo train carrying liquefied gas, which burst into flames and resulted in the deaths of 32 people. You can change your name, but the scandals follow. Asia Pacific Google are unwittingly getting themselves involved in geopolitics quite a lot recently. Following the recent hubbub over the apparent removal of Palestine from Google Maps, Taiwan has requested that the IT giant blur satellite images of their military installations on Taiping Island in the South China Sea. The latest Google Earth images of the island showed four three-pronged structures arranged in a semi-circular fashion on the beach next to an airstrip, unseen on previous images. A company statement states that the request is under review. Meanwhile, China frantically screencaps. It’s back to the drawing board for KAI’s KUH-1 Surion as the Korean-made utility helicopter failed a number of extreme climate tests in the USA. If successful, the testing would have given the Surion an international standard and boosted export chances. Several parts will now be redesigned to rectify the defects found during the testing, which puts the helicopter through very challenging humid and freezing temperatures. Well folks, it’s finally a done deal! France and India’s defense ministers inked contracts for 36 Dassault Rafale fighters on Friday, with pictures of French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and his Indian counterpart, Manohar Parrikar, surfacing on Parrikar’s Twitter account stating “Rafale will significantly improve India’s strike & defence capabilities.” Due to be delivered over the next six years, the Rafales are estimated to be worth $8.7 billion, haggled down from an original figure of $13.47 billion.

Image: SpaceX/Flickr SpaceX Just Announced What Would Be the Largest Rocket of All Time Written by Carl Franzen Managing Editor September 27, 2016 // 02:39 PM EST Copy This URL And you thought you had ambitious plans for yourself this Tuesday. SpaceX founder Elon Musk just announced that he wants build the biggest rocket in the history of the world to take people to Mars. The new rocket would dwarf even the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the moon, the largest so far in history. Musk gave a presentation this afternoon at the International Astronautical Congress, outlining his company's plans to colonize the Red Planet using a new "Interplanetary Transport System" or ITS. But Musk couldn't help but scoop his own announcement: half hour before his talk was supposed to begin, SpaceX posted a theatrical animated video (above) on YouTube showing an absolutely enormous rocket, even by rocket standards. ("Better than any porn," one fawning YouTube commenter opined) Musk also preemptively tweeted the dimensions of this new, yet-to-be built SpaceX rocket as follows: "12m rocket booster diameter, 17m spaceship diameter, 122 m stack height." That's a booster 39 feet in diameter, a spaceship 55 feet in diameter, and a full stack 400 feet high. 12m rocket booster diameter, 17m spaceship diameter, 122 m stack heightElon Musk September 27, 2016 To put that into comparison, the Saturn V rocket that took the first astronauts to the moon measured 111 meters (363 feet) high, and 10 meters (33 feet) in diameter, according to NASA. The tallest active rocket in recent times, the Ares I-X, measures 327 feet tall, according to NASA. United Launch Alliance, a joint-venture rocket company from Boeing and Lockheed Martin, also has an active rocket setup called the Delta IV Heavy, which measures 70.7 meters tall (231 feet), according to Spaceflight Now. And NASA is working a rocket called the Space Launch System that would come close to Musk's planned rocket at 384 feet tall (117 meters), but still fall short of it. Earlier this month, rival tech billionaire turned commercial spaceflight magnate Jeff Bezos (yes, the Amazon CEO) tweeted plans to build a large rocket called the New Glenn. But even the biggest version of that would only measure 313 feet tall, according to the plans Bezos shared. So, Musk's rocket would indeed earn the nickname "BFR" (Big Falcon Rocket or Big Fucking Rocket). Too big to fit out the door of NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) in Kennedy Space Center, Florida? Thankfully not, as the VAB doors are 456 feet high (139 meters). In case youJason Davis September 27, 2016 In his actual talk, Musk said the rocket booster would have 42 "Raptor" engines, a prototype of which SpaceX just tested. The rocket would also be modeled after SpaceX's existing Falcon 9 rocket boosters, but made of a more advanced carbon fiber. "In the longterm, the ships will be even bigger than this," Musk said during his presentation, pointing out he wanted the passenger section to be able to carry 100 people. Musk also said he wanted to make it possible for "anyone who wanted to go" to Mars to be able to get there, and predicted that it would take 40-100 years to establish a Mars colony with a million people. "Obviously it's going to be a challenge to fund this whole endeavor," Musk said, adding he was accumulating his own money expressly to help fund this mission.

The Federal Government recently designated the airline to operate direct flights into Guangzhou, China. It also secured government’s approval to operate flights to Atlanta, Dubai, Johannesburg, Mumbai, among other international routes. Meanwhile, the Chairman of Air Peace, Chief Allen Onyema has urged Chinese investors to take advantage of the huge business opportunities in Nigeria by deepening their investments in the country. Speaking when she led a 20-member delegation to the corporate headquarters of Air Peace in Lagos at the weekend, President of the Overseas Investment Union of China (OIUC), Ms. Pansy Liu said the airline’s partnership is vital in achieving seamless business trips between Nigeria and China. Chairman of Air Peace, Chief Allen Onyema in handshake with the President of Overseas Investment Union of China (OIUC), Ms. Pansy Liu during the visit. She endorsed the quality of Air Peace’s flight operations, affirming that it is the fastest growing airline in Nigeria. Liu pledged to mobilise Chinese investors and aviation regulators to ensure the quick launch of Air Peace’s Enugu-Guangzhou-Enugu routes. Responding to the partnership proposal, Onyema said Air Peace, which recently launched its Lagos-Benin-Lagos and Abuja-Benin-Abuja routes, planned to deploy a Boeing 777 aircraft on the Enugu-Guangzhou-Enugu routes. He assured the Chinese investors, who were on a week-long business tour of Nigeria, that the airline chose a B777 aircraft to make trade trips from Nigeria seamless, safe and comfortable. Air Peace, Onyema said, had retained the services of some of the best facilities in the world for the maintenance of its aircraft because of the premium it placed on the safety and satisfaction of its passengers. The airline, he added, had some of the most qualified and experienced pilots in its employ. “We take issues of safety seriously. It will interest you to know that we have BCT Aviation of UK here in Nigeria to maintain our aircraft 24 hours of the week because of the premium we place on safety. We have the best pilots in this country. Most of our pilots have flown for the big airlines of the world,” Onyema said. He urged Chinese investors to deepen their interests in Nigeria, saying the country has a boundless space for profitable business.

The Federal Government recently designated the airline to operate direct flights into Guangzhou, China. It also secured government’s approval to operate flights to Atlanta, Dubai, Johannesburg, Mumbai, among other international routes. Meanwhile, the Chairman of Air Peace, Chief Allen Onyema has urged Chinese investors to take advantage of the huge business opportunities in Nigeria by deepening their investments in the country. Speaking when she led a 20-member delegation to the corporate headquarters of Air Peace in Lagos at the weekend, President of the Overseas Investment Union of China (OIUC), Ms. Pansy Liu said the airline’s partnership is vital in achieving seamless business trips between Nigeria and China. Chairman of Air Peace, Chief Allen Onyema in handshake with the President of Overseas Investment Union of China (OIUC), Ms. Pansy Liu during the visit. She endorsed the quality of Air Peace’s flight operations, affirming that it is the fastest growing airline in Nigeria. Liu pledged to mobilise Chinese investors and aviation regulators to ensure the quick launch of Air Peace’s Enugu-Guangzhou-Enugu routes. Responding to the partnership proposal, Onyema said Air Peace, which recently launched its Lagos-Benin-Lagos and Abuja-Benin-Abuja routes, planned to deploy a Boeing 777 aircraft on the Enugu-Guangzhou-Enugu routes. He assured the Chinese investors, who were on a week-long business tour of Nigeria, that the airline chose a B777 aircraft to make trade trips from Nigeria seamless, safe and comfortable. Air Peace, Onyema said, had retained the services of some of the best facilities in the world for the maintenance of its aircraft because of the premium it placed on the safety and satisfaction of its passengers. The airline, he added, had some of the most qualified and experienced pilots in its employ. “We take issues of safety seriously. It will interest you to know that we have BCT Aviation of UK here in Nigeria to maintain our aircraft 24 hours of the week because of the premium we place on safety. We have the best pilots in this country. Most of our pilots have flown for the big airlines of the world,” Onyema said. He urged Chinese investors to deepen their interests in Nigeria, saying the country has a boundless space for profitable business.

Officials: Federal money, not county, will fund airport Amanda Renko , arenko@stargazette.com | @SGAmandaR 5:55 p.m. EDT September 27, 2016 A rendering of the proposed new front entrance to the Elmira Corning Regional Airport. (Photo: PROVIDED) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Chemung County's share of the Elmira Corning Regional Airport's extensive renovation project won't come out of county funds, officials said this week. Between $15 million and $16 million in federal funding sources will cover the majority of the $18 million gap left following a $40 million state award received last week, Deputy County Executive Michael Krusen told county legislators at Monday's aviation committee meeting. Passenger facility charges, which are added to the cost of airline tickets, would cover the costs of bonding for the remaining amount, Krusen said. An application filed for the Upstate Airport Economic Development and Revitalization competition states that the award would be paired with funds provided through the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program. AIP grants are used for planning and development of public-use airports. ► RELATED STORY: 5 THINGS: Elmira Corning airport details ► RELATED STORY: Tourism leaders hoping for boost from airport project Excitement about the $58 million renovation — which includes a raised concourse, internal courtyard and expanded boarding area — continued among county officials Monday. Improvements would allow the airport to accommodate larger airplanes like Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s, which will likely become more prevalent at regional airports, said 2nd District Legislator David Manchester, aviation committee chairman. "There's definitely a shortage of pilots on the horizon, and what that probably will do with the workforce pool is force the major (carriers) to absorb the regionals," Manchester said. "It will be larger airplanes that will be fulfilling the tasks — not necessarily flying any more passengers, but because of the pilot's availability, they'll be flying larger planes. This will position us very well to be able to handle the larger airplanes." Larger planes also could  accommodate more passengers, said Director of Aviation Bill Hopper. Flights currently leaving the airport are "going out very full, especially the Allegiant flights," Hopper said. "Those are, I'd say, going out with 90-plus percent enplanement."

(Courtesy UC San Diego Health) New Catheter Lets Doctors See Inside Arteries for the First Time UC San Diego Health first in region to use image-guided, plaque-busting catheter By Michelle Brubaker Cardiologists at Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center at UC San Diego Health are the first in the region to use a new, high-tech catheter that allows them to see inside arteries for the first time — cutting out only the diseased tissue. The new technology is used to remove plaque from clogged arteries, a procedure that can save and improve lives. Cardiologist Dr. Mitul Patel The new image-guided device, Avinger’s Pantheris Lumivascular atherectomy system, allows doctors to see and remove plaque simultaneously during an atherectomy – a minimally invasive procedure that involves cutting plaque away from the artery and clearing it out to restore blood flow. The new technology treats patients suffering from the painful symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD), a condition caused by a build-up of plaque that blocks blood flow in the arteries of the legs and feet, preventing oxygen-rich blood from reaching the extremities. Patients with PAD frequently develop life threatening complications, including heart attack, stroke, and in some severe cases, patients may even face amputation. “Peripheral artery disease greatly impacts quality of life, with patients experiencing cramping, numbness and discoloration of their extremities,” said Dr. Mitul Patel, cardiologist at UC San Diego Health. “This new device is a significant step forward for the treatment of PAD with a more efficient approach for plaque removal and less radiation exposure to the doctor and patient.” X-ray technology was previously used during similar procedures, but those images are not nearly as clear and do not allow visualization inside the blood vessel. The new catheter, with a fiber optic camera the size of a grain of salt on the tip, is fed through a small incision in the groin that does not require full anesthesia. Once inside, the interventional cardiologist is able to see exactly what needs to be removed without damaging the artery wall, which can cause further narrowing. PAD affects nearly 20 million adults in the United States and more than 200 million globally. September is PAD Awareness Month, which has a personal meaning to one of Patel’s patients, who recently underwent an atherectomy at UC San Diego Health with the new catheter. Patel said the patient had severe scar tissue and plaque build-up at a previously treated site in his right leg, limiting blood flow to his calf muscle and his ability to exercise or even walk a short distance. “He was a good candidate for the new image-guided catheter approach. The device allowed for excellent visualization inside his leg artery as we removed only the diseased tissue,” said Patel. Now able to walk several miles with this wife without any limitations, the patient’s quality of life has improved, and with some lifestyle changes, he hopes to manage his PAD and prevent another blockage. Pantheris was approved by the FDA in March 2016. So far, cardiologists at UC San Diego Health have used the new catheter on 10 patients undergoing an atherectomy procedure with successful results. _____________________________ To become a poll worker, applicants must be a U.S citizen and registered to vote in California, or lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States. Poll Workers Needed for Nov. 8 Election Poll workers, especially those who are bilingual in any one of eight specific languages, are needed for the Nov. 8 Presidential General Election. The Registrar’s office is required by federal law to provide bilingual speakers and voting materials to voters who speak Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese. In addition, a survey conducted by the University of California, Berkeley showed a need for speakers of Khmer, Japanese, Korean and Hindi at about 20 precincts across the county so the Registrar’s office is also recruiting poll workers who are bilingual in those languages for the election. To become a poll worker, applicants must be a U.S citizen and registered to vote in California, or lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States. Poll workers must have transportation to their assigned polling location, access to the Internet to take an online training and attend a two-hour class in person. Poll workers receive a stipend ranging from $100 to $175 depending on the assignment and those who are bilingual receive an additional $15 if they are assigned to provide language assistance to voters. Prospective poll workers can apply online at www.sdvote.com. For more information, call (858) 565-5800 or email pollworker@sdcounty.ca.gov. _____________________________ Election Day Voter Registration Comes to California in 2017 Californians will be able to register to vote on election day starting next year after the state’s new voter database was officially certified for use on Monday. The certification of the VoteCal statewide database by Secretary of State Alex Padilla came almost seven months after the technical work was completed, and more than 15 years after a federal law mandated its creation.  Read the Los Angeles Times report _____________________________   A section of the Hazard Center Office Tower Capital Improvements at Hazard Center Office Tower Completed Johnson & Jennings General Contracting has completed capital improvements at Hazard Center Office Tower. The scope of work included expansive lobby renovations on the plaza level and ground floor, new shower, locker and fitness facilities on the ground floor and elevator lobby upgrades throughout the building. Hazard Center Office Tower is a 15-story, Class A office building in the heart of San Diego’s Mission Valley community. The tower is part of the Hazard Center complex which includes retail, restaurants, services and hospitality amenities. Lisa Gualco of PM Realty Group and general manager of Hazard Center oversaw the project. Laura Metcalf and Robin McNees of Hurkes Harris Design Associates provided design services. The Johnson & Jennings project team included Jim Lohnes as project manager, Raul Islas as project superintendent and Renata Cristo as project coordinator. _____________________________ Healthier — If Not Longer — Life GenomeWeb Through comprehensive physicals that include genome sequencing, Craig Venter says his Health Nucleus venture will predict and then catch medical conditions in their earliest stages and thus extend people’s lives, according to the Robb Report, a lifestyle newsletter.   For $25,000, Health Nucleus, which grew out of Venter’s Human Longevity company, will examine customers’ genomes and microbiomes, perform high-tech scans of their brains, hearts, and bodies, as well as analyze their blood. “Our goal is to extend the healthy lifespan, not necessarily the number of years,” Venter notes in a Q&A with the Robb Report. “Death is still inevitable. I’m struggling to accept that.” Through sequencing, he says that people can learn their genetic risk of developing certain diseases and, if they have that information early enough, they can take steps to mitigate that risk. Venter adds that more than a million people in the US are diagnosed with cancer each year, but that those diagnoses often come after patients experience symptoms. He wants to spot tumors earlier, before they spread, when they are easier to treat. “We’re trying to drive a new preventive medicine paradigm,” Venter adds. “We’re not good, as a society, with preventive medicine. We wait for crises, and then we try to respond to them versus trying to predict things and head them off.” _____________________________ SDX Invites Brand Diego Awards Nominations SDX, formerly San Diego Ad Club, is now accepting nominations for its 2016 Brand Diego awards.

According to the White House, $80 million in federal funds will be spent on programs in its Smart Cities Initiative. “If we can re-conceive of our government so that the interactions and the interplay between private sector, nonprofits and government are opened up, and we use technology, data, social media in order to join forces around problems, then there’s no problem that we face in this country that is not soluble,” President Barack Obama said in a statement. The city of Chula Vista will take part in a U.S. Department of Energy program called the “Better Communities Alliance,” which will provide support in tackling energy and climate challenges. Chula Vista is one of more than 30 municipalities and counties taking part in the program, along with more than 25 community and trade organizations. The program is a one-stop shop for cities and counties to plug into DOE and AmeriCorps resources. In California, the cities of Huntington Beach and San Francisco, and counties of Los Angeles and Sonoma, will be part of the alliance. The city of San Diego is among more than 20 cities launching an initiative to ensure responsible and equitable deployment of smart city technologies, according to the White House. The effort, led by the city of New York, aims to provide a common framework to help governments develop and expand policies and procedures related to the internet of things — which refers to network connectivity of appliances and other common objects. The program goals also include ensuring openness and transparency regarding the use of public space or assets for smart city technologies, and advancing public dialogue about how government, the private sector and academia can collaborate to ensure the technologies are used in a way that maximizes public benefit. The cities of Los Angeles, Palo Alto and San Francisco are also taking part in the initiative. _____________________________ Personnel Announcements Scott Norris Joins Point Loma Credit Union Scott Norris Point Loma Credit Union has named Scott Norris as its new vice president, lending.

Cetin is being held under a magistrate's warrant which will give Skagit County prosecutors 30 days to file charges in relation to the Cascade Mall shooting that took place on Friday evening. Five people were killed in the shooting, and Cetin is being held on a $2 million bail. (Brandy Shreve/Skagit Valley Herald via AP) Related Coverage Things to Know about deadly shootings at mall in Washington Police: Washington shooting suspect ‘zombie-like’ at arrest Shooting sows terror at Washington mall; shooter on loose Authorities: 4 dead in shooting at mall north of Seattle MOUNT VERNON, Wash. (AP) — A man charged with five counts of first-degree premeditated murder in the shooting deaths of five people at a Washington state mall shared an early dinner with his stepfather then told him he was headed to his job at a gym. Instead, police say, Arcan Cetin headed to the Cascade Mall in Burlington, pulled a Ruger rifle from his trunk and opened fire in a Macy’s department store, instantly killing three women and a teenage girl and critically wounding a man who died hours later. As the small city an hour north of Seattle struggled to make sense of the carnage, an unsettling portrait emerged of the man authorities say was the shooter. Cetin, 20, of Oak Harbor has a criminal record dating back at least two years and was charged last year with assaulting his stepfather, who said his stepson suffered from mental illness. Related: Things to Know about deadly shootings at mall in Washington One of Cetin’s neighbors at an apartment complex said he unnerved her so much that she kept a stun gun near her front door. On Monday, Cetin expressed no emotion when asked by a judge if he understood his rights. Bail was set at $2 million and his lawyer said nothing about his client in court and did not speak with reporters. “It’s a terrible tragedy for the community but having lived here my whole life, I believe the community is strong enough. It will recover,” said Rich Weyrich, Skagit County prosecutor. “It’s going to take a long time, but we will recover.” After his arrest, Cetin admitted to detectives that he was the man captured on security video carrying a Ruger rifle inside the mall, “and he did bring the rifle into Macy’s and shot all five victims,” court documents released ahead of Monday’s hearing said. Related: Police: Washington shooting suspect ‘zombie-like’ at arrest Cetin left the rifle with a 25-round magazine on a cosmetics counter before fleeing, the documents said. The victims ranged in age from a 16-year-old girl to a woman in her 90s and included a probation officer and a Boeing maintenance worker. Authorities have not revealed any details about a motive, but Cetin’s stepfather David Marshall told reporters after the hearing that his stepson “has mental health issues.” He did not elaborate. The court documents painted a picture of Cetin’s stepfather and mother trying to help their son as he seemed to unravel. Cetin came to the U.S. from Turkey and is a permanent legal resident, authorities have said. Cetin faced charges last year in an assault on his stepfather after he caught Cetin smoking marijuana inside the house, according to court records. Cetin was told by a judge last December not to possess a gun, but his stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was “going through a hard time,” the records said. Cetin had been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and has taken unspecified medications in the past, the records show. He eventually moved out of his parents’ home and the stepfather told detectives after the shooting that he and his wife had helped Cetin with his rent. Cetin said his father bought him a laptop and his mother visited him regularly at his new apartment. She last saw him Wednesday, and his stepfather shared a meal with him in the late afternoon Friday, the documents said. Related: Shooting sows terror at Washington mall; shooter on loose Less than three hours later, surveillance video shows Cetin entering the mall from a fast-food restaurant, walking through the shopping center and leaving through the Macy’s women’s department exit, police said. He then moved his car closer to the Macy’s entrance and took a rifle out of the car’s trunk, the documents said. Cameras in Macy’s show him entering through the same women’s department — this time with the rifle. In the span of a minute, Cetin killed a teenage girl near some clothing racks and then walked to the cosmetics counter where he shot a man and three women, the documents said. He was arrested nearly 24 hours later in Oak Harbor, about 30 miles from the mall. Cetin’s stepfather told detectives that his Ruger rifle and .22-caliber ammunition were missing, documents said. Police interviewed the suspect’s former girlfriend and said Sunday she has an employment history at Macy’s, but not at the Burlington Mall location. They did not identify her. ___ Flaccus reported from Portland.

Walt Disney and Microsoft are the latest companies to be mentioned as possible Twitter suitors. Volkswagen — The Justice Department is evaluating how much it could fine the automaker for its diesel emissions scandal without putting it out of business, according to a Bloomberg report. Kite Pharma — Kite reported upbeat results in a mid-stage clinical trial for its non-Hodgkins lymphoma treatment, with more than 40 percent of patients showing complete remission. American Express — American Express can bar merchants from steering customers toward other cheaper credit cards from competitors like MasterCard and Visa, according to a ruling from a federal appeals court. That ruling reversed a lower court decision that said AmEx had violated antitrust rules. JM Smucker — Credit Suisse downgraded the food producer's stock to "neutral" from "outperform," saying it underestimated the level of reinvestment needed to boost the company's pet food division. Credit Suisse said it also underestimated the hit to sales due to difficult comparisons to last year, when an array of new products were launched. AutoZone — The autoparts retailer was upgraded to "overweight" from "equal-weight" at Morgan Stanley, which pointed to an increase in the number of older vehicles. That traditionally correlates with improved sales of auto parts. Eli Lilly — The drugmaker was raised to "buy" from "neutral" at Goldman Sachs, citing the potential of significant revenue and earnings growth as well as margin expansion due to its diversified late-stage product pipeline. Rockwell Collins — Rockwell Collins is partnering with Stellar Labs to develop a cloud-based flight operations management platform. The news is boosting the avionics maker's stock, several days after it announced that Boeing had selected it to provide touchscreen controls for the 777X aircraft. Boston Scientific — The medical products maker announced the acquisition of EndoChoice Holdings for $8 a share, or $210 million in cash. EndoChoice is a maker of imaging systems and other medical technology devices. FactSet Research Systems — The financial information services provider matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.69 per share, but revenue fell below forecasts. FactSet CEO Phil Snow is highlighting the company's ongoing increase in market share. Carnival Corp. — Carnival is adding to Monday's gains this morning, following the cruise line operator's latest earnings report which saw it both beat Street estimates and raise its full-year forecast. Wells Fargo — The Labor Department launched what it calls a "top-to-bottom" review off all complaints the department has received in recent years. That follows a congressional hearing last week into the controversy surrounding the bank's sales practices and subsequent settlement with the government. Autodesk — The company announced a new 30 million share stock buyback program. The new program is in addition to the 1.5 million shares remaining in the software maker's prior buyback program. Deutsche Bank — The bank's stock remains under pressure, after falling to an all-time low Monday on fears it would have to raise more capital to cover an anticipated $14 billion U.S. fine. The stock slump comes despite reassurances from bank officials that it doesn't anticipate a capital-raising issue and has not asked the German government for any financial assistance. —By CNBC's Peter Schacknow Questions?

But when it came to his specific plans to make things better, Trump came up short and ran into a details-obsessed opponent who shredded the GOP nominee’s tax plan as a retread of tax cuts for the rich that would explode the deficit. “Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton even had a catch-phrase handy to parry Trump’s promises of a rocket-fueled economy: ‘Trumped up trickle down.’ If Trump’s goal on Monday was to put some serious meat behind his promises to ignite a sluggish economy and put Clinton squarely on the defensive on the issue, he only succeeded sporadically. Story Continued Below KEY SALES PITCH — “These kinds of appeals [on trade and growth] have helped Trump draw nearly even in the presidential race and ahead in swing states like Ohio which have suffered the loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs that do not require advanced training. But when it came to laying out specifics for how he would create a renaissance in American manufacturing, Trump ran onto rougher ground. “Pressed by moderator Lester Holt for details on how he would get jobs back, Trump muddled through a digression on China devaluing its currency (it has actually been appreciating) and saying we have to ‘stop them from leaving.’ Exactly how was unclear beyond the imposition of large import taxes that many economists believe would spark damaging and possibly recession-inducing trade wars.” CLINTON’S GOAL — “The Clinton campaign’s hope with these debates is that the remaining pool of undecided voters tempted by the thought of a major course change will look at Trump’s lack of specifics — and Clinton’s command of data and detail — and decide it’s not worth taking the risk” Read more. PUZZLING LINE OF THE NIGHT — Trump let many of Clinton’s assertions go mostly unchallenged, including that he regularly stiffed contractors. But perhaps most surprisingly, he did not deny that he hasn’t paid much of anything in federal taxes for years. Instead Trump only offered: “That makes me smart.” Not clear that undecided voters who dutifully pay all their taxes every year will appreciate that line. Trump had another chance to respond to Clinton’s attack on his taxes and instead only said if he had paid taxes “It would be squandered, too, believe me.” WALL STREET DOG DIDN’T BARK — The phrase “Wall Street” only appeared twice in the debate, both times from Clinton. Early on she said that Republican policies “took their eye off Wall Street.” And later added that Trump “owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks,” during the segment on Trump’s tax returns and potential conflicts of interest. Trump offered nothing about Clinton’s Goldman Sachs speeches or other ties to Wall Street, curious when he is trying to paint Clinton as a crony-capitalist insider. Banking regulation did not come up at all. In fact, the word “bank” only showed up in the segment on Trump’s loans. THE FED DID COME UP as Trump renewed his assault on Janet Yellen: “And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political — by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.” MARKETS SAY CLINTON WON — CNBC’s Evelyn Cheng: “Clinton appears to have edged out her Republican opponent .. in the first presidential debate, based on analysts' take on the market reaction. ‘Early indications suggest Hillary won the debate; at least didn't lose. Futures are higher and the peso is rallying,’ said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. U.S. stock index futures erased losses to trade positive as the debate kicked off. Futures were near session highs as the debate ended, with Dow futures briefly adding more than 100 points” Read more “The U.S. dollar last traded about 1.8 percent weaker against the Mexican peso and was stronger against the yen. The euro-dollar held steady near $1.125. In the last few days, the Mexican peso has hit all-time lows against the U.S. dollar as Trump appeared to gain momentum in election polls” Read more. CLINTON RILES TRUMP — POLITICO’s Shane Goldmacher: “A composed … Clinton got under … Trump’s skin during their high-stakes showdown on Monday night, with the Republican nominee persistently interrupting Clinton as she needled him on his business record, the size of his fortune and his relationship with the truth … [O]nce Clinton taunted Trump on his business record, the billionaire took the bait, and the debate shifted to a rowdy affair. “In an unprecedented moment for presidential politics, the Democratic nominee accused the Republican nominee of racism. ‘He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,’ Clinton said, during an exchange on Trump’s years-long questioning of the American citizenship of President Obama.” Read more. WALL STREET’S TOP CONCERN: 2016 — A new study by Investment Media Solutions of 2,760 investors and financial industry execs “found that the election was the top economic concern … above GDP growth, interest rates, geopolitics and corporate earnings. Fro the study of top concerns: 48 percent the outcome of the American election cycle; 34 percent weak GDP and economic growth in the U.S.; 23 percent terrorism and other geopolitical turmoil; 22 percent interest rates” TARULLO REACT — Cowen’s Jaret Seiberg: “Federal Reserve Board Gov. Daniel Tarullo … proposed changes to the CCAR stress test that we believe will be broadly positive for regional banks by allowing them to increase their capital distributions, including dividend rates. By contrast, the biggest banks will see their CCAR stress testing get tougher. This supports our theme that the policy environment favors regional over mega banks. … “Tarullo said the Federal Reserve will propose exempting banks with under $250 billion of assets from most of the CCAR process. He said this change would be effective for the 2017 test. As Tarullo indicated, this is not a panacea for regional banks. They would still need to do stress testing as the Dodd-Frank stress testing kicks in at $50 billion of assets. And they would still run a CCAR stress test, though it would generally be easier to pass than the current test” Full Tarullo text. HEARING PREP — From ICI’s President & CEO Paul Schott’s prepared testimony before the House Financial Services Committee Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade’s hearing on the Financial Stability Board’s Implications for U.S. Growth and Competitiveness “If this flawed process results in SIFI designation for US funds, the consequences for funds and their millions of investors will be serious indeed. Under existing US law, designated funds would be subjected to inappropriate bank-style regulation” GOOD TUESDAY MORNING — Quite a spirited affair last night.

WHERE IS TRUMP’S BUSINESS SUPPORT? — NYT’s Andrew Ross Sorkin: “Should it come as a surprise that not one chief executive among the Fortune 100 has donated money to Donald Trump’s campaign? That was the news reported by The Wall Street Journal over the weekend after tabulating the latest donation disclosures through August. Mr. Trump’s supporters trumpeted, excuse the pun, the lack of donations from the nation’s largest companies as a badge of honor. Big business, they say, has failed the country, so why would their guy want its support? “But the logic of this argument is backward. Mr. Trump has campaigned as a successful businessman, a brilliant negotiator and someone, as he said in his own words, who can ‘get along with people.’ He has contended that his economic policies will unleash unheard-of levels of growth — as much as 6 percent. He plans to lower corporate taxes, remove regulations and allow companies to repatriate cash held overseas. Together, these policies sound like a C.E.O.’s dream. And yet here we are: Many of the most successful business people in the country refuse to support him — or do business with him, either.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life!

Will you join in that effort? Sanders: “Absolutely, we certainly have seen under Democratic and Republican administrations what Wall Street CEOs have done to our economy. We don’t need more Wall Street CEOs in any administration. We need people in the administration who will stand with working families and the middle class. And I will do everything that I can to see that those are the people appointed in a Clinton administration” React from Jeremy Adler, Communications Director, AR Squared: “Senator Sanders just confirmed that he and Elizabeth Warren intend to harness their left-wing populism to fundamentally re-shape our country’s economy.” CONCERNS SWIRL AROUND DEUTSCHE BANK — WSJ’s Jenny Strasburg and Andrea Thomas: “Intensifying concerns about Deutsche Bank AG’s financial health caused its shares to drop Monday and pushed the company into the awkward position of publicly denying that it had sought help from the German government. Shares of Deutsche Bank, one of the world’s largest banks and a linchpin of Europe’s financial system, tumbled 7.5 percent in European trading, closing at €10.55 ($11.85), their lowest price in decades. “They have slid 53 percent this year, whittling Deutsche Bank’s market value to about $16 billion, roughly the size of regional U.S. lenders like Fifth Third Bancorp and M&T Bank Corp. The concerns — voiced by a number of analysts and investors — center on whether Deutsche Bank would need to raise capital to fortify its precarious finances. The latest source of pressure is the possibility of a multibillion-dollar legal settlement with the U.S. Justice Department” Read more. SAUDIS MAKE ONE LAST PUSH ON JASTA — POLITICO’s Isaac Arnsdorf and Seung Min Kim: “Saudi Arabia is mounting a last-ditch campaign to scuttle legislation allowing victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue the kingdom — and they're enlisting major American companies to make an economic case against the bill. General Electric, Dow Chemical, Boeing and Chevron are among the corporate titans who have weighed in against the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, which passed both chambers unanimously and was vetoed on Friday … “The companies are acting quietly to avoid the perception of opposing victims of terrorism, but they're responding to Saudi arguments that their own corporate assets in the kingdom could be at risk if the law takes effect. Meanwhile, Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader who now co-leads Squire Patton Boggs' lobbying group, e-mailed Senate legislative directors on Monday warning that the bill could lead other countries to withdraw their assets from the United States and retaliate with laws allowing claims against American government actions” Read more. WELLS EMPLOYEES CRY FOUL — NYT’s Stacy Cowley: “At least 5,300 Wells Fargo employees have been fired for ethics violations like setting up illicit accounts without customers’ knowledge to meet sales targets. Now there’s another group of aggrieved Wells Fargo workers: people who say they were fired or demoted for staying honest and falling short of sales goals they say were unrealistic. “That second group of workers, who claim that they played by the rules and were punished for it, are starting to coalesce around two lawsuits that were just filed and that seek class-action status. The first was filed in Los Angeles last week by former Wells Fargo workers who say that while their colleagues created unauthorized accounts to meet cross-selling quotas, they were penalized or terminated for refusing to do the same” Read more. DEBATE FLY AROUND — WSJ’s Laura Meckler, Allison Kite and Colleen McCain Nelson: “Trump’s performance in the first presidential debate on Monday night was likely to bolster his supporters, but risked turning others off, interviews with undecided voters and experts in both parties said. ‘I feel that the way he talks to other people, the way that he addresses other people, can be extremely rude and extremely disrespectful, and I don’t think that’s the temperament we should be looking for in a president,’ said Garrett Thacker, 30 years old, of Galloway, Ohio, who has voted for presidential candidates in both parties. “Scott Ratcliff, 31, a project manager in Phoenix and a Republican, said he isn’t likely to vote for either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, but was more impressed with her. ‘I think my opinions on Trump are pretty much the same,’ Mr. Ratcliff said. ‘I’m impressed by how much better prepared Clinton is for the debate. I think she’s clearly winning, although I don’t agree with what she’s saying.’ MONEY QUOTE — Ben Robinson, 33, a project manager in Houston, said the debate was the heated argument he expected it to be, with Mrs. Clinton keeping her composure better than Mr. Trump. He said he thought Mr. Trump was struggling. ‘He doesn’t seem like the standard political misdirection — not answering the question,’ said Mr. Robinson, an independent. ‘He just seems like he doesn’t have any answers to it.’” Read more. NYT’s Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin: “In a relentlessly antagonistic debate … Trump and … Clinton clashed over trade, the Iraq war, his refusal to release his tax returns and her use of a private email server, with Mr. Trump frequently showing impatience and political inexperience as Mrs. Clinton pushed him to defend his past denigration of women and President Obama.” Read more. FT’s Demetri Sevastopulo, Sam Fleming and Barney Jopson: “The 90-minute debate showcased the two candidates’very different styles. Mr Trump started in a more restrained manner, suggesting that he planned to approach the debate in a less confrontational manner than he employed in the Republican primary debates. Later, however, he grew visibly irritated when Mrs Clinton launched pointed attacks, painting her rival as someone who “stiffed” small business people” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — OBAMA FOCUSES ON ZONING — POLITICO’s Lorraine Woellert: “The Obama administration today is calling on cities and counties to rethink their zoning laws, saying that antiquated rules on construction, housing and land use are contributing to high rents and income inequality, and dragging down the U.S. economy as a whole. City zoning battles usually are fought block by block, and the president's involvement will create friction, particularly among environmental groups and the not-in-my-backyard crowd. “But the White House jawboning is welcome news to many others, including mayors and builders increasingly foiled by community opposition to development. The White House published a ‘toolkit’ of economic evidence and policy fixes to help local political leaders fight back against the NIMBYs that tend to hold sway over municipal zoning meetings” DISTRESSED DEBT INVESTORS BACK CLINTON — Via Debtwire: “An analysis of the top 50 funds, ranked by Prequin based on AUM, shows that the C-Suite of those distressed managers have overwhelmingly thrown their financial support behind Clinton. On the flip side, distressed debt tycoons are overwhelmingly supporting the GOP candidates in the competitive Senate races that will determine control of the chamber” Read more. PERRY CAPITAL SHUTTING DOWN — FT’s Mary Childs: “US hedge fund Perry Capital is shutting down its flagship fund after 28 years in business, one of the biggest names to cut its losses as the industry struggles to make money. … Investors have pulled more than $50bn from the sector this year, according to eVestment data. On average, hedge funds have struggled to generate returns in 2016’s choppy markets, with Hedge Fund Research’s HFRI Asset Weighted Composite index generating just 0.5 per cent through to the end of August. That has stoked investor ire over high fees, especially among public pension groups” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements.

Are they as crazy as they sound? The SpaceX founder has become the face of entrepreneurial space exploration – and ambition. What does the established space science community think of him? Is Musk being overly ambitious? Photograph: David Mcnew/AFP/Getty Images Olivia Solon in San Francisco Tuesday 27 September 2016 07.00 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 28 September 2016 09.51 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 1 month old Entrepreneur Elon Musk has set himself an ambitious timeline for the colonization of Mars. The South Africa-born magnate estimates that his private space company, SpaceX, will launch its first manned mission in 2024 – one decade sooner than Nasa’s ambitions. Musk will grace the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Tuesday, unveiling his plans to send humans to Mars in a keynote talk titled Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species. He will outline what SpaceX deems to be a “good approach” for establishing a city on the red planet. “It’s going to sound pretty crazy,” Musk said when he announced his keynote in April. “So it should at least be entertaining.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Elon Musk reveals how he wants to colonise Mars Despite Musk’s optimism, it’s hard to forget that less than a month ago, SpaceX’s flagship spacecraft exploded before launch – the latest in a series of mishaps for the company. The massive fireball that erupted on 1 September destroyed both the rocket and the Facebook satellite it was carrying as cargo. Elon Musk described the disaster as the company’s “most difficult and complex failure” so far. Elon Musk: launch pad accident ‘most difficult failure' in SpaceX’s history Read more The incident begs the question: is Musk being overly ambitious? Musk’s spiraling ambitions within the space sector are lauded by Silicon Valley, with commentators frequently comparing him to eponymous Iron Man superhero Tony Stark. His nimble, fail-fast approach to building rockets contrasts with the sluggish bureaucracy of government-funded programs, something Musk celebrates, famously telling an interviewer at Fast Company in 2005: “There’s a silly notion that failure’s not an option at Nasa. Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.” However, in the wake of the latest explosion, some are questioning whether SpaceX will be able to reliably deliver cargo supplies to the International Space Station, let alone take people to Mars. Former Nasa administrator Scott Pace, now director of the Space Policy Institute in Washington, thinks the setback could cost SpaceX business. “No doubt SpaceX will fix the problems, but if you’re a customer time is money. This will get customers looking at alternatives. It may give competitors an opening and slow down SpaceX,” he told the New York Times. John Logsdon, former director of the Space Policy Institute, is less concerned. “It’s a setback but not a major one. It’s all part of the normal process of a developing space launch.” Space industry analyst Greg Autry agreed. “It looks like it’s not a major setback for anyone other than the satellite’s owner,” he said. Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize and asteroid-mining company Planetary Resources, knows Elon Musk and SpaceX well. He played down the explosion, calling Falcon 9 “one of the most extraordinary launch vehicles ever designed and built”. “The thing that most people don’t realize is that vehicle is designed and integrated completely vertically inside the company. They understand and own every line of software, every sensor, and they will figure this out and get over this,” he said. SpaceX expects to launch Falcon 9 again as soon as November. Facebook Twitter Pinterest SpaceX test ends in explosion days before planned launch Logsdon, Diamandis and Autry all agree that Musk’s timeline for a 2024 launch for the first manned mission to Mars is optimistic. “History has shown he’s not typically been able to move the world along as fast as he’d like to, but he does move the world along,” Autry said. “Even if he’s off by 50%, it’s still 2028 and before any government is conceiving of doing this,” Diamandis added. SpaceX’s mission sets apart from traditional players within the space sector such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing. “It’s not just a defense contractor, it has a mission and transformative purpose to make the human race a multiplanetary species,” Diamandis said. “There’s a much bigger driver here than just profitability. That’s something the traditional space industry can’t achieve,” he added. “That vision is intoxicating and powerful.” Musk’s long-term vision can cut through the budgetary cycles of different presidencies in a way that Nasa, which is dependent on the White House science budget, can’t. “There’s no Congress to convince, no shareholders to convince. Just him as an individual CEO with a conviction and the personal wealth to fund it,” Diamandis said. As a result, SpaceX has pursued been able to develop technologies such as reusable rockets and methane-fuelled engines required for reaching deep space. “SpaceX is taking a level of risk and driving innovation on their own dime far faster than the government would ever contract for,” explained Diamandis. Such purpose-driven engineering echoes the approach of NASA during the Space Race, when the US government was intent on beating the Soviets to the Moon. However, the US government has since become much more risk averse, said Diamandis. “NASA is a little bit lost in some ways.” That’s not to say that SpaceX hasn’t relied on government funding to get to where it is. “The reality is that SpaceX exists today because NASA gave them a billion dollar contract for the Commercial Crew Program,” Diamandis said.

Instead, police say, Arcan Cetin headed to the Cascade Mall in Burlington, pulled a Ruger rifle from his trunk and opened fire in a Macy's department store, instantly killing three women and a teenage girl and critically wounding a man who died hours later. As the small city an hour north of Seattle struggled to make sense of the carnage, an unsettling portrait emerged of the man authorities say was the shooter. Cetin, 20, of Oak Harbor has a criminal record dating back at least two years and was charged last year with assaulting his stepfather, who said his stepson suffered from mental illness. One of Cetin's neighbours at an apartment complex said he unnerved her so much that she kept a stun gun near her front door. On Monday, Cetin expressed no emotion when asked by a judge if he understood his rights. Bail was set at $2 million and his lawyer said nothing about his client in court and did not speak with reporters. "It's a terrible tragedy for the community but having lived here my whole life, I believe the community is strong enough. It will recover," said Rich Weyrich, Skagit County prosecutor. "It's going to take a long time, but we will recover." After his arrest, Cetin admitted to detectives that he was the man captured on security video carrying a Ruger rifle inside the mall, "and he did bring the rifle into Macy's and shot all five victims," court documents released ahead of Monday's hearing said. Cetin left the rifle with a 25-round magazine on a cosmetics counter before fleeing, the documents said. The victims ranged in age from a 16-year-old girl to a woman in her 90s and included a probation officer and a Boeing maintenance worker. Authorities have not revealed any details about a motive, but Cetin's stepfather David Marshall told reporters after the hearing that his stepson "has mental health issues." He did not elaborate. The court documents painted a picture of Cetin's stepfather and mother trying to help their son as he seemed to unravel. Cetin came to the U.S. from Turkey and is a permanent legal resident, authorities have said. Cetin faced charges last year in an assault on his stepfather after he caught Cetin smoking marijuana inside the house, according to court records. Cetin was told by a judge last December not to possess a gun, but his stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was "going through a hard time," the records said. Cetin had been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and has taken unspecified medications in the past, the records show. He eventually moved out of his parents' home and the stepfather told detectives after the shooting that he and his wife had helped Cetin with his rent. Cetin said his father bought him a laptop and his mother visited him regularly at his new apartment. She last saw him Wednesday, and his stepfather shared a meal with him in the late afternoon Friday, the documents said. Less than three hours later, surveillance video shows Cetin entering the mall from a fast-food restaurant, walking through the shopping centre and leaving through the Macy's women's department exit, police said. He then moved his car closer to the Macy's entrance and took a rifle out of the car's trunk, the documents said. Cameras in Macy's show him entering through the same women's department -- this time with the rifle. In the span of a minute, Cetin killed a teenage girl near some clothing racks and then walked to the cosmetics counter where he shot a man and three women, the documents said. He was arrested nearly 24 hours later in Oak Harbor, about 30 miles from the mall. Cetin's stepfather told detectives that his Ruger rifle and .22-calibre ammunition were missing, documents said. Police interviewed the suspect's former girlfriend and said Sunday she has an employment history at Macy's, but not at the Burlington Mall location. They did not identify her. Flaccus reported from Portland. Associated Press writers Lisa Baumann in Seattle, Phuong Le and Gene Johnson in Seattle; Manuel Valdes in Mount Vernon, Washington; and Kimberlee Kruesi and Keith Ridler in Boise, Idaho, contributed to this report Related Stories Mall shooting suspect had multiple arrests, disputes: court records Photos Arcan Cetin, 20, of Oak Harbor, Wash., is seen in this undated Department of Licensing photo posted by the Washington State Patrol on Twitter.

Picture: Dave Thompson/PA Wire MARTIN FLANAGAN Email 07:56 Tuesday 27 September 2016 2 Have your say The owner of Monarch Airlines is talking with various parties about a potential takeover of the carrier as it flagged up a “significant investment” within days amid fears the 50-year-old airline is teetering close to collapse. Greybull Capital is understood to be in talks with Chinese firm HNA Group, the company behind Hainan Airlines, about a potential deal, with others thought to be waiting in the wings. Monarch was yesterday forced to deny “negative speculation” on social media over the weekend that it is in financial trouble. A spokesman for Luton-based Monarch said: “Our flights are operating as normal, carrying Monarch passengers as scheduled. “To weather tougher market conditions and to fund its ongoing growth, Monarch expects to announce a significant investment from its stakeholders in the coming days.” The company said security concerns and the devaluation of the pound after the UK’s Brexit vote had made market conditions tougher. However, it said that it remained on track to post underlying earnings of more than £40 million for the year to end-October 2016. The firm made a £19.2m pre-tax profit in the year to October 2015 following a £57.3m loss a year earlier, according to accounts filed at Companies House. Greybull, which acquired a controlling stake in Monarch in 2014, is thought to be finalising details of a cash injection over the coming days. Part of the money is expected to go towards helping pay for a new fleet of 30 Boeing MAX 8s. Monarch employs about 2,800 people, and has a strong exposure to Egypt and north Africa. Aviation analyst Alex Macheras said: “Out of all the carriers we have in the UK it wouldn’t surprise me if Monarch were to declare bankruptcy, purely because we’ve known that they’ve been in such a fragile state for so long.” Click here to ‘Like’ The Scotsman Business on Facebook Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

According to charging documents, Cetin admitted to police investigators that he brought a Ruger .22 calibre rifle into the Macy's department store at Cascade Mall in Burlington, about 65 miles (105km) north of Seattle, on Friday evening and fatally shot five people. Skagit County District Attorney Richard Weyrich declined to discuss a motive for the shootings. But a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was nothing to suggest that Cetin had had contact with any known Islamic militants. However, the source said Cetin's motives for the attack were still unclear. Cetin walked into the Macy's shortly before 7pm PDT (0200 GMT), gunning down a 16-year-old girl near a clothing rack, then opening fire on the other four victims in the make-up department before placing the gun on a cosmetics counter and walking out, prosecutors said in the court papers. Representative Rick Larsen said on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday that the slain girl was high school sophomore Sarai Lara, a cancer survivor. Also killed in the attack were Shayla Martin, a 52-year-old Macy's makeup artist, Boeing employee and father of two Chuck Eagan, retired probation officer Belinda Galde, 64, and her 95-year-old mother, Beatrice Dotson, Larsen said. Wearing red and blue jail garb and shackled at the waist, Cetin showed no emotion during Monday's court appearance and spoke only to respond “yes, your honour” several times to the judge. “It's a terrible, terrible thing and a terrible tragedy for the whole community,” Weyrich told reporters after the hearing, adding prosecutors have yet to decide whether to seek the death penalty against Cetin. The attack follows a series of violent outbursts at shopping centres across the United States, including the stabbing of nine people at the Crossroads Centre in Minnesota on 17 September. The FBI has said it considers that attack a "potential act of terrorism." Cetin was taken into custody without incident Saturday evening after police spotted him near his home in Oak Harbour, 30 miles (48 km) southwest of Burlington. According to the charging documents, Cetin initially walked into the mall unarmed, through a Chuck E. Cheese family entertainment and pizza restaurant, then went back to his car to retrieve the rifle from the trunk, moving the car closer to Macy's. According to prosecutors, Cetin's father told them that he and his son had had a falling out recently. The father said he last saw his son at dinner at about 4:30pm on the day of the shooting and that his rifle, which matched the description of the murder weapon, was missing along with ammunition.

Bush ordered the Strategic Air Command to halt the policy of keeping a fleet of nuclear-armed B-52 bombers on around-the-clock alert, posed for an immediate retaliatory strike against the Soviet Union. With Cold War scenarios of the kind portrayed in films like “Dr. Strangelove” becoming ever more remote, the aging B-52s’ nuclear mission effectively came to an end. Bush’s pronouncement accurately anticipated the fall of the communist state, which dissolved on Dec. 31. The presidential decision meant, in the words of then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, that “United States strategic bombers shall stand down from their alert postures, and their nuclear weapons shall be removed and stored in secure areas” at 11 Strategic Air Command bases. Story Continued Below Some 40 bombers had stood poised for decades, night and day, to launch at several minutes’ notice. “This process can be reversed if need be,” Cheney added. “It would take something less than 24 hours to restore the bombers to their former alert status.” The air armada began arriving at Strategic Air Command bases in 1955 as an integral component of a nuclear triad. This consisted of land-based missiles, deployed in hardened silos; missile-carrying submarines, cruising beneath the oceans; and the manned Boeing B-52 bombers, with eight engines and swept-back wings, measuring 185 feet from wing tip to wing tip. Under the terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia, the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, on Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, destroyed 365 B-52 bombers. Russian military officers verified their demise, with the aid of both satellite photos and on-site inspections. To ensure that the planes would never fly again, they were chopped into pieces with a 13,000-pound guillotine. Even though the last B-52 rolled off the Boeing production line in 1961, the war plane has proved its versatility and usefulness over the years, continuing into present times. On April 9, 2016, a classified number of B-52s arrived at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar to participate in Operation Inherent Resolve, an American-led effort to help local partners to ultimately destroy the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. At the same time, a number of B-52s were deployed to Afghanistan to conduct airstrikes against Taliban militants and to carry out close-air support missions.

Washington State Patrol/Handout via Reuters. 3/3 By Tom James | MOUNT VERNON, Wash. MOUNT VERNON, Wash. There is no evidence showing that a man charged with five counts of first-degree murder after confessing to a shooting rampage at a shopping mall in Washington state over the weekend had contact with any known Islamic militant groups or individuals, a law enforcement official told Reuters on Monday. Turkish-born Arcan Cetin, a 20-year-old legal U.S. resident, was advised of the charges against him during a brief hearing in Skagit County District Court in Mount Vernon, Washington, on Monday and ordered held on $2 million bail. According to charging documents, Cetin admitted to police investigators that he brought a Ruger .22 caliber rifle into the Macy's department store at Cascade Mall in Burlington, about 65 miles (105 km) north of Seattle, on Friday evening and fatally shot five people. Skagit County District Attorney Richard Weyrich declined to discuss a motive for the shootings. But a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told Reuters there was nothing to suggest that Cetin had had contact with any known Islamic militants.

The aircraft is said to feature a unique mission sensor suite, which gives a 360-degree coverage on all sensors. It uses maritime radar, electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors, electronic support measures (ESM), automatic identification system (AIS) for effective surveillance. The Triton UAV has been built from the elements of the RQ-4 Global Hawk and boast of reinforced airframe and its wing is able to withstand hail, bird strike and gust load protection. It also features de-icing and lightning protection systems. These features allow the aircraft to undertake missions in harsh weather conditions, normally seen at sea. The Triton is expected to complement the Boeing P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. The aircraft can also be used for other missions like signals intelligence, search and rescue and communications relay. Apart from the US Navy, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) is expected to acquire seven of these aircraft. Another possible export customer for MQ-4C is India. Earlier reports suggest that the Indian Navy had considered this UAV to complement the eight Boeing P-8I Poseidons in its arsenal.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Washington mall shooting suspect identified as an immigrant from Turkey September 26, 2016 by yalibnan 2 Comments The suspect in Washington mall shooting was identified as Arcan Cetin, 20, an immigrant from Turkey A suspected gunman believed to have killed five people at a Washington state mall was arrested Saturday, according to authorities. At a news conference, officials said they had not ruled out any possible motives for why 20-year-old Arcan Cetin allegedly shot four women and one man at the Cascade Mall in Burlington Friday evening. The suspect in Washington mall shooting was identified as Arcan Cetin, 20 Island County Sheriff’s Lt. Mike Hawley told reporters that he spotted Cetin near the suspect’s home in Oak Harbor, around 30 miles due west of the mall. Hawley said he immediately recognized Cetin as the suspect, turned his patrol car around and arrested Cetin without incident. “He said nothing,” said Hawley, who added that Cetin was unarmed and carrying a computer in a satchel when he was apprehended. “He was kind of zombie-like.” Mount Vernon Police Lt. Chris Cammock said Cetin had immigrated to the U.S. from Turkey and was a “legal permanent resident.” It was not immediately clear when Cetin came to the U.S. Hawley said Cetin had been arrested for simple assault last year, but provided no further details on the case. The Seattle Times reported that Cetin faced three domestic violence assault charges in both Burlington and Island County, with the victim identified as Cetin’s stepfather. The newspaper reports Cetin also was arrested for drunken driving. Court records show Cetin was told by a judge on Dec. 29 that he was not to possess a firearm, the newspaper reported. However, the stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was “going through a hard time.” Cetin was arrested almost exactly 24 hours after his alleged victims were shot at the mall Macy’s makeup counter. The four female victims died in the store. The male victim died early Saturday as police finished sweeping the 434,000-square-foot building. Local media outlets had identified the victims as of early Sunday. One was 16-year-old Sarai Lara, a cancer survivor and high school sophomore. Her mother, Evangelina, told the Seattle Times that through a translator that she was shopping with Sarai and her younger sister, but they split up. She said Sarai went to Macy’s looking for pants. News of the shooting spread through the mall, and Lara tried to get to her daughter but was unable to do so. KIRO-TV identified two more victims as Belinda Galde, 64, and her mother, 95-year-old Beatrice Dotson. The Seattle Times identified the other two victims as Macy’s makeup artist Shyla Martin, 52, and Chuck Eagan, a Boeing maintenance worker who was shot while helping his wife flee the store. DEVELOPING: Cascade Mall Suspect Identified By Friends As Arcan Cetin, A 20 Year Old Immigrant From Turkey – KIRO pic.twitter.com/WlEwOQIyrO — Breaking911 (@Breaking911) September 25, 2016 “There are people waking up this morning, and their world has changed forever. The city of Burlington has probably changed forever, but I don’t think our way of life needs to change,” Burlington Mayor Steve Sexton said earlier Saturday. “This was a senseless act. It was the world knocking on our doorstep, and it came into our little community.” Surveillance video captured the suspect entering the mall unarmed and then recorded him about 10 minutes later entering the Macy’s with a “hunting type” rifle in his hand, Cammock said. The lieutenant said late Saturday that the rifle was apparently brought into the mall from a suspect vehicle. The weapon was recovered at the scene. “Probably one of the most difficult moments for us last night was knowing that there were family members wondering about their loved ones in there,” Cammock said. Burlington, a community of 8,600 people, is about 65 miles north of Seattle, too far to be a commuter town, but its population swells to 55,000 during the day because of a popular outlet mall, retail stores and other businesses. Burlington is the only major retail center within 30 miles in a region where agriculture is king, said Linda Jones, president of the Burlington Chamber of Commerce. Residents gathered Saturday to comfort each other at a community gathering in a city park. “It’s too scary. It’s too close to home,” said Maria Elena Vasquez, who attended the gathering with her husband and two young children. Joanne Burkholder, 19, of Mount Vernon, was watching the movie “The Magnificent Seven” in the mall’s theater when security guards came in and told them to evacuate immediately. Dozens of panicked moviegoers gathered in the hallway, and Burkholder heard screaming as the officers escorted them to safety in a parking lot. As she drove home later, she had to pull over because she was shaking so hard, she told The Associated Press. “I’m just very thankful for my life this morning. I’ve never been so terrified in my life,” she said Saturday, trying to hold back tears as she attended the community vigil. “You’d think it would happen in Everett or Seattle, but a small town of Burlington, I’d never dream something like this would happen.” People who believed they may have lost loved ones were being sequestered at a church three blocks from the mall, where counselors and a golden retriever therapy dog were present. Dozens of people attended a Saturday evening prayer service for the victims. The gathering was held at Central United Methodist Church in nearby Sedro-Woolley, Wash. The Rev. Cody Natland lit five candles on a table in front of the church, one for each victim.

BUSINESS Technology A hot market for IPOs shows itself — at least for a week Trade Desk Christopher Galluzzo / Nasdaq Employees and investors of the Trade Desk celebrated the company's initial public offering by ringing the closing bell at Nasdaq on Wednesday. Employees and investors of the Trade Desk celebrated the company's initial public offering by ringing the closing bell at Nasdaq on Wednesday. (Christopher Galluzzo / Nasdaq) Paresh Dave Ample free food and other perks are nice, but it’s stock options and lofty missions that often seduce people into joining tech start-ups. That’s why Jeff Green will never forget the excited expressions on employees’ faces last month when he told them their advertising software company would go public. It would open the door for them to cash in on their shares and signal that the company would aggressively chase its ambitions. “They couldn’t believe that day had actually come and that we had made the decision and chose to do it,” said Green, chief executive of Ventura-based the Trade Desk Inc. Few start-ups ever reach the point where they can list on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. But initial public stock offerings have been an even rarer sight this year, which could see the fewest IPOs since the Great Recession. New listings are down about 50% from last year, and experts don’t see the floodgates opening until next year. Companies have been scared off by financial crises in China and Europe and the unease surrounding the U.S. presidential election. They’re also getting pushed to achieve profitability before going public or accept a haircut in their valuation, investors say. And for most businesses, there’s been ample cash available to stay private longer. Green, 39, fought past those concerns because he has a fast-growing enterprise that’s making money. Wall Street will never lose its hunger for that combination, he said. Several other companies with healthy profit margins also made the leap in recent days, fueling the year’s busiest week for IPOs, according to money manager Renaissance Capital. Auto lubricant maker Valvoline had the largest of eight offerings, hauling in $660 million. The group, including cosmetics products maker e.l.f. Beauty and IT software firm Apptio, raised more than $1.2 billion and all saw their share prices shoot up in public trading. Investors say it’s a sign of a healthy appetite for risk, though much of the interest stems from persistent weak returns on other investment options. Many of the newly listed companies are trading at big premiums to peers that have been publicly traded for longer. All but a dozen of the year’s nearly 80 IPOs are trading above their starting price, according to research firm FactSet.  “There’s a lot of cash around, and the alternatives in bonds and elsewhere are not very attractive,” said Todd Morgan, chairman of fund advisor Bel Air Investment Advisors. Investors “are chasing the hot market. They expect all the IPOs will go up.” It certainly worked out that way for Trade Desk. The company raised more than $78 million from the stock sale on Sept. 20, when shares were priced at $18 each. Shares traded up 76% to $31.69 on their first day on Nasdaq and closed at $27.66 on Friday.  Getting to market required years of preparation and a month of sweating over whether to pull the trigger, Green said. “The day before we announced to employees a month ago, it felt like the day before marriage,” he said. “I’ll go to married or divorced in the future, but I’ll never be a single again. Life will be different in some way.” His previous start-up significantly influenced his decision. He had co-founded an advertising company that was sold to Microsoft in 2006, but the company got lost in the shuffle of the technology giant. His team lost its “vision and clarity,” he said. “I’m not sure if I would have the courage to go public if I hadn’t sold my last company,” he said. “We have all the fundamentals and mechanics working for us. Why would we risk messing that up?” The Trade Desk provides an online service that lets ad agencies and advertisers automatically place bids in auctions for ad space on websites and apps. The auctions last less than a second, and the Trade Desk’s fee is tied to how much a customer spends on each month’s digital ad buys. The system brought in $75.6 million in revenue and $6.6 million in profit during the first half of the year. Barely 1% of the money spent on ads worldwide each year is transacted through real-time digital auctions, which means the Trade Desk and rivals like AppNexus and Turn have plenty of room to grow, according to Green. “Because we’ve just started the transformation, we wanted a mechanism to be in there for the long haul,” he said. Going public changes life within a company. The Trade Desk’s 450 employees probably feel a bit richer, which may adjust their behavior. The Trade Desk’s bankers have the option to sell stock held by some investors and employees at the IPO price, providing an instant payout. But even those holding onto their shares or subject to a lock-up period in which they can’t sell can see daily price changes, making their wealth feel more real. “The only way I know to temper that and maintain the culture is talk about it,” Green said. “Money doesn’t define who we are. The hotels we stay in don’t define who we are. What people are looking for is making an impact.” Several more IPOs are in the works, though there’s unlikely to be a rush of offerings. Online accounting software developer BlackLine Inc. has filed confidentially to go public as soon as next month, with the 15-year-old company valued at more than $1 billion including its debt, Reuters reported last week, citing anonymous sources. A spokesperson for the Woodland Hills start-up declined to comment. Founded by Chief Executive and software programmer Therese Tucker, BlackLine’s service centralizes data storage, automates some accounting tasks and provides a layer of analytics to assist in decision making. It is used by companies such as Costco and Boeing. Inc. magazine reported the company generated $83.6 million in revenue last year. BlackLine could become the most lucrative listing ever of a venture-capital funded company founded or led by a woman in the region, according to financial research firm PitchBook. The bar was set only last week when emergency-alert software maker Everbridge Inc., co-headquartered in Pasadena and Burlington, Mass., raised $75 million in an offering valuing the company at $323 million, according to PitchBook. Among Everbridge’s co-founders and board members is Cinta Putra, who was CEO from 2002 through 2011. Everbridge lost $10.8 million last year. But CEO Jaime Ellerston has said the company went public in an effort to lend a stamp of legitimacy to its sales pitch. “We believe we can gain significant competitive advantage by being the first public company in our space,” he said. Everbridge started talking to investors a few weeks ago, with the earthquake in Italy and hurricane in Florida providing news to drive home the need for his company’s service. Company insiders cashed out to the tune of $15 million.

Airlines like Qantas, Singapore Airlines, and Malaysia Airlines are all making plans to reduce the amount of service they fly on the Airbus A380 jumbo-jet. Airbus, for its part, has cut production by 55%. The plane is currently flown by 13 airlines out of 57 airports. The routes average more than 4000 miles (6500 km—London to Miami, for example). There are shorter routes, like Emirate’s 45 minute hop from Dubai to Kuwait City and China Southern’s three-hour 1,000-mile trip between Chengdu and Beijing. A decline of service on the A380 isn’t just a bummer for traveling fans, it could inconvenience airports too. Upgrades were needed to be made all over the surface and buildings of airports to accommodate the larger and heavier plane. Without service from the A380 (or Boeing’s similarly declining 747) those improvements will sit idle. Stuffed full of economy seats, the plane can seat well over 800 passengers, though none use that configuration. Most airlines use the extra space on the two-level plane for large areas of plush business and first class seating. (Some have even installed showers and in-air cocktail lounges).

These two have certainly not held back on their jabs at each other, especially during the past couple of months as they inch closer to Election Day in November. So what are Clinton and Trump sparring about now ahead of the debate? Airline aesthetics. Last week, Trump called out Clinton on Twitter for “copying” his airplane rallies, after Clinton debuted  her “Stronger Together”–branded Boeing 737 earlier this month and invited the press corps on the tarmac and on board. While Clinton’s plane is a standard airliner with standard seating and a no-frills interior, Trump travels in his privately owned 757 model, tricked out with things like Rolls-Royce engines, 24-karat gold-plated seatbelts, and silk walls.  Two means of travel on two very opposite sides of the airliner spectrum; Clinton and Trump are polarizing even when flying the friendly—or, in their case, not-so-friendly—skies. So rest easy, Mr. Trump, your opponent isn’t being a copycat. In fact, presidential candidates have been inviting the press to hear them speak on the tarmac for decades. It’s all a part of the political show: a wave from the aircraft door, speaking at a podium with a big Boeing in the background, and, now, matching the campaign planes with the personalities of the candidates themselves. Ahead of tonight’s debate, a study in airline aesthetics, above, courtesy of Clinton and Trump.     Subscribe now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe In This Story: Holiday Travel Hillary Clinton Politics Share Tweet Add a Comment Tweet Subscribe Now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe Recommended For You __title__ __category__ __title__ __category__ Vogue Fashion Runway Beauty Culture Living Magazine City Guides Videos Subscribe VOGUE VIP Vogue App Vogue Shop Promotions Vogue Archive Vogue Podcast Log In | Register Log Out Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Instagram Sign up for Newsletter Contact Press Subscriptions Digital Editions Vogue Worldwide UK India Italy Mexico Australia Germany Korea Spain Taiwan Russia France Brazil Japan Portugal Ukraine Turkey China Reprints/Permissions Media Kits Careers Condé Nast Digital Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides.com Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Magazine Customer Service Sitemap © 2016 Condé Nast.

A committee of experts constituted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to look into the possibility of designing curricular structure for a bachelor-level degree programme in aeronautics has prepared a draft syllabus which has been sent to all universities for their comments and objections. In a notice to the universities, UGC Secretary Jaspal S Sandhu says that the "idea was to address the shortage of skilled manpower in the burgeoning sector of aeronautics that requires techno-scientific expertise for successful operation." Consultations and deliberations in the meetings by the experts revealed that the area of aircraft maintenance in the identified sector (aeronautics) is particularly affected by shortage of skilled human resources. "Thus, it merits urgent attention of institutions of higher education, which is why the committee decided to design the template of syllabus for a BSc Honours (Aircraft Maintenance) as a way of encouraging universities to come forward and offer this programme under the choice-based credit system (CBCS) introduced by UGC," Sandhu said. "There is a national need and it is a welcome. That said, they should not hurry into anything and compromise on the quality. Given that there is no aerospace degree programme in the country (there are engineering courses) this is better suited than a direct masters programme, which was also thought of earlier.," former Bangalore University Vice-Chancellor MS Thimmappa said. From aircraft structure and associated systems to flight navigation and from rotorcraft (helicopters) to gas turbine engine, the course will see over 17 chapters or sub-subjects that students will learn. Almost all these chapters will have four points for theory and two for practicals. In specific cases like Aviation Legislation and Human Factors, the chapters will have five points for theory, two for practicals and one point for tutorials. Former Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Chairman and Managing Director RK Tyagi said: "There is a huge potential. In the next ten years, we are looking at one aircraft being inducted every week in India only in the commercial segment. Whether it is by Airbus or Boeing I cannot say." Last year, industry experts had written to the civil aviation minister that if India exploited the market correctly the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) industry can be worth $700 million every year. Most of India's MRO's needs today are met by other South Asian countries, including Sri Lanka and Singapore. Most airlines spend nearly 15% of their revenues towards MRO and India's share in this business is only over 1%—with majority of airlines operating in India also forced to go to Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, UAE et al. J Crasta, Chairman of CM Environs Private Limited which deals with aerospace and avionics and an executive member of industry bodies Ficci and Assocham said, pointed out that there has been a huge neglect in this field. "Imagine if even Air India is dependent on another country for its repairs. The potential is huge and the industry will be glad that the UGC is doing something to address the shortage."
