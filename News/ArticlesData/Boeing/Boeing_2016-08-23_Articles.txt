The printers were designed to address the requirements of aerospace, automotive and other industries by being able to build completed parts with repeatable mechanical properties. The 3D printers are not yet commercially available, but Stratasys is working with Ford Motor Company and Boeing to develop new applications for them. The two new machines include the Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator and the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator. Stratasys Stratasys' new Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator and Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator allow manufacturers to build parts of near limitless sizes with greater detail, strength and ligher weight than before. Because both printers use a "screw" or "worm" drive filament extruder, they're able to print with composite materials, such as carbon fiber, which don't shrink or warp as much as traditional thermoplastics. Typically, fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers press a polymer filament through a pair of wheels or gears and out of a heated extruder head, layer by layer. A screw extruder winds the filament through the head, which increases the flow pressure needed tor extruding composite materials. Stratays' Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator uses a horizontal build platform versus a traditional vertical platform to create printed objects. By turning the platform horizontally, the machine can build parts sideways, which translates into a build area that's only limited by the space a manufacturer has. "This gives us the capacity for making much larger parts and to gain much lighter assembly," said Ellen Lee, technical leader at Ford's additive manufacturing research facility. 3D printing allows the Ford design freedom it cannot get from traditional manufacturing methods, such as injection molding, Lee said. With injection molding, one automobile or truck part often consists of many smaller pieces that must be joined together, creating less strength and greater weight. "With the increased print size, we could consolidate many large parts into one," Lee said. "We're producing parts that are now measured in feet rather than inches," said Richard Garrity, president of Stratasys Americas. Aerospace giant Boeing also played an influential role in defining the requirements and specifications for the demonstrator 3D printers, Stratasys said. Boeing is currently testing an Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator to explore the production of low volume, lightweight parts. "Additive manufacturing represents a great opportunity for Boeing and our customers, so we made a strategic decision more than a decade ago to work closely with Stratasys on this technology," Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said. "We are always looking for ways to reduce the cost and weight of aircraft structures, or reduce the time it takes to prototype and test new tools and products so we can provide them to customers in a more affordable and rapid manner." By flipping an FDM 3D printer on its side, Stratasys was not only able to increase the size of parts, but also achieve speeds 10 times or more greater than traditional FDM technology, according to Garrity. Stratasys' other new machine, the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator, utilizes a material extruder at the end of a robotic arm that can maneuver along a 5-point axis. The printer also has a robotically-controlled print platform that can move along three axes. Combined, the 8-axis robotic printer enables extremely precise builds from virtually any angle, reducing the need for typical support materials, which has dramatically slowed 3D parts production. Ford, Stratasys The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator adds detail to an automotive parts prototype. Just as with a desktop 3D printer, the new Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator is an FDM model and uses a heated extruder head to melt and deposit multiple layers of polymers to create an object. Once the basic part is constructed, a second smaller extruder head on the robotic arm can be used to create fine details. A major advantage to the Robotic 3D printer is the ability to print across fused layers, adding strength to a part. For example, traditional vertical FDM 3D printers construct an object using a process that creates ribbing that is more easily broken. Multi-axis printing allows the composite materials to move right to left, up and down or diagonally, adding strength. "Unfortunately, composites production is constrained by labor-intensive processes and geometric limitations," Stsratasys said in a statement. "The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator...redefines how future lightweight parts will be built, and provides a glimpse into how this technology could be used to accelerate the production of parts made from a wide variety of materials."

The company has been around since the early days of 3D printing, and has been responsible for some of the industry’s biggest breakthroughs and milestones. They’ve grown into a huge multinational corporation with influence in nearly every major industry, and they’re responsible for one of the most popular methods of 3D printing: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Today Stratasys announced that they will be demonstrating some of their latest, most cutting-edge technology at the upcoming International Manufacturing Technology Show (IMTS) 2016. As part of their “SHAPING WHAT’S NEXT” vision, Stratasys will be debuting two “3D Demonstrators,” essentially previews of what’s coming next from the company – and for the 3D printing industry. And what’s coming next is pretty exciting. The Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator quite literally turns 3D printing on its side with a technology that prints on a vertical plane, allowing for virtually unlimited part size. The Infinite Build technology was developed in response to needs from the aerospace and automotive industries in particular, and Boeing and Ford are working closely with Stratasys on the development of the system. The Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator “Additive manufacturing represents a great opportunity for Boeing and our customers, so we made a strategic decision more than a decade ago to work closely with Stratasys on this technology,” said Darryl Davis, President of Boeing Phantom Works. “We are always looking for ways to reduce the cost and weight of aircraft structures, or reduce the time it takes to prototype and test new tools and products so we can provide them to customers in a more affordable and rapid manner. The Stratasys Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator enables products to be made at a much larger and potentially unlimited length, offering us a breakthrough tool to add to our robust additive manufacturing processes.” An aircraft panel 3D printed with the Infinite Build 3D Demonstrator. Boeing is currently experimenting with an Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator to produce lightweight, low-volume parts. Ford is also exploring the demonstrator for automotive manufacturing purposes, and will be working with Stratasys to develop applications for automotive-grade 3D printed materials that thus far have been impossible due to size constraints. “3D printing holds the promise of changing automotive design and manufacturing because it opens up new ways to innovate and create efficiencies in production,” said Mike Whitens, director, Vehicle Enterprise Sciences, Ford Research & Advanced Engineering. “Our vision at Ford is to make high-speed, high-quality printing of automotive-grade parts a reality. We are excited about the future opportunities that the scalable and versatile Infinite-Build concept can unlock, and look forward to collaborating with Stratasys to help achieve our goals,” The other new system Stratasys is unveiling is the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator. Working with Siemens, Stratasys developed the technology by combining their own additive manufacturing processes with Siemens’ industrial motion control hardware and design-to-3D printing software. Composite materials, which are ideal for producing strong, lightweight structures, are an integral part of manufacturing in the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as the oil and gas and medical sectors. Unfortunately, the production of composites is highly labor intensive and limited in terms of geometry. The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator The Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator uses an 8-axis motion system for precise, directional material placement, enabling the production of strong parts without the need for supports, which slow down production. The system demonstrates a new way to build lightweight parts, faster than ever and with a wider variety of materials. Part produced with the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator “Siemens is pleased to support Stratasys in their innovative additive manufacturing initiatives, of which the Stratasys Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator is one of the most promising,” said Arun Jain, VP, Motion Control, Digital Factory US, Siemens. “By working closely with Stratasys on motion control and CNC automation, Siemens is helping to create a flexible, multi-function manufacturing workflow that puts 3D printing firmly in the factory. We look forward to continuing to work with Stratasys to build manufacturing solutions that transform industries.” IMTS 2016 will be taking place in Chicago September 12-17. In addition to their two new major developments, Stratasys will also be showing off several examples of their current technology as it’s being used by customers in tooling and manufacturing applications, such as 3D printed jigs and fixtures, composite tooling, mold tooling, and production parts. “Stratasys is building on our success in manufacturing with applications such as manufacturing aids, injection molds and composite tooling, and leveraging our relationships with innovative industry leaders to further extend the applicability of additive manufacturing in demanding production environments,” said Ilan Levin, CEO of Stratasys. ”We view the level of factory integration, automation, and performance monitoring potentially offered by these new demonstrators as catalysts for the transformation to Industry 4.0. Stratasys invites all visitors to IMTS to see these new technologies, as well as our field-proven industrial additive manufacturing solutions, in action.” Will you be attending IMTS this year?

The company is already due to receive eight 787 jets by the end of FY17, aiming to replace the deteriorating aircraft fleet of 747-400 wide-body jets. As a part of the existing contract with Boeing, Qantas has an option to acquire15 more 787 Dreamliner along with purchase rights to buy 30 additional 787 jets after the successful delivery of the aforementioned eight jets. Currently, the airline operates a fleet of total 118 commercial jets. Of this, the airline plans to refurbish its operational Boeing’s 737-800 and Airbus Group SE (OTCMKTS:EADSY) A330-200 in order to improve the flight experience. “Our first aircraft is still about 15 months away, but I’m delighted to say that Dreamliner flights on our existing network will be on sale before Christmas.” Qantas Airways CEO Alan Joyce commented in the earnings release. “The aircraft is full of inbuilt features to keep you comfortable on a long flight – like better air quality, less noise, and more natural light.” The announcement may appear as a good news for Boeing, as the company is not receiving a considerable demand from the market. Qantas Airways itself deferred the delivery of eight Airbus’ A380-800 jumbo jets to strengthen its cash flows, while operating the pre-delivered 12 A380-800 jets. Aimed at meeting the current trend, earlier this month Boeing announced that it might not increase monthly production capacity of its 787 Dreamliner and plans to maintain it at 12 jets per month. With this decision, the aircraft manufacturer would be able to extend the lifespan of the 787 Dreamliner production line. At present, Boeing has a total backlog of 716 787 Dreamliner, based on which it can continue operating for approximately five more years. Since the launch of the 787 Dreamliner, the company received total 1,161 orders and delivered 445 jets till now. On the contrary to wide-body jets, Boeing is receiving healthy demand of its single-aisle commercial jets, as airlines around the world are focused to reduce their operational expenses by adding smaller fuel-efficient jets. Simultaneously, the company expects a steady aircraft demand from China due to increase in traveling, despite the economic slump. Boeing has also been facing slow demand in its military commercial jets, which led to poor revenue from Defense, Space & Security segment in last few quarters. The company is trying to offset the decline in Defense segment revenues by expanding its commercial jets fleet that contributes around 70% to its consolidated revenues. Industry experts predict the reduced wide-body commercial jets demand to continue in next few years, as competition amongst airlines increases. Since last year, the oscillation in crude oil prices has also intensified competition and increased passenger flight capacity. This increase in flight capacity also resulted in reduced fares, which is likely to continue in coming months. Driven by lower fuel prices, airlines also started to defer delivery of new jets as they continue to operate older jets. Both Boeing and Airbus are under pressure from this downturn in the aerospace industry, as they booked less number of orders since the year began. Yesterday, Aviation week also disclosed Boeing’s internal aircraft forecast for the current year, based on which the company expects only 535 new orders, considerably lower from its official FY16 guideline for 740-745 commercial jets. However, the company’s spokesman turned down the internal forecast by saying that Boeing is committed to its target and it has a host of internal forecasts. However, based on the current scenario and increased competition from other aircraft manufacturers, it is still early to say whether the company will meet the target.

The scientists knew where to look because the ship was sunk intentionally.  'She was intentionally sunk by the Navy in 1951, and her location was known by the Navy,' Susan Poulton from OET told MailOnline. 'She was surveyed by sonar in 2009 and again in more detail in 2015, but this was the first visual survey done of the wreck.'  The science team on board also noticed that the bow had struck the seabed first, despite sinking stern-first, burying itself in the sediment. The team also found two aircraft. Grumman Hellcat fighter aircraft seen in aircraft elevator hatch pictured This year, the wreckage was found in 2,600 feet (792 metres) underwater off the coast of California's Farallon Islands and is said to be 'amazingly intact,' with its hull and flight deck clearly visible, and what appears to be a plane in the carrier's hangar bay To study the wreckage, the team of scientists and technicians on board the sanctuary vessel R/V Fulmar, used an 18.5-foot-long (5.6 metres) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) called Echo Ranger from The Boeing Company.

The survey showed the Independence is 'amazingly intact,' with its hull and flight deck clearly visible.  It is upright, slightly listing to starboard, with much of its flight deck intact, and with holes leading to the hangar decks that once housed the carrier's aircraft. To study the wreckage, the team of scientists and technicians on board the sanctuary vessel R/V Fulmar, used an 18.5-foot-long (5.6 metres) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) called Echo Ranger from The Boeing Company.   'The damage surveyed was a combination of damage sustained in the atomic bomb blasts of 1946, damage from when she made impact with the bottom of the ocean, and general corrosive wear after many years on the seafloor,' Ms Poulton said. 'The science team on board also noticed that the bow had struck the seabed first, despite sinking stern-first, burying itself in the sediment.' The team also found two unexpected aircraft. 'We did confirm the presence of a wrecked aircraft F6F-5N Hellcat still in one of the hangers and found the remains of a second aircraft late in the dive.' 'This ship fought a long, hard war in the Pacific and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship. It is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the 'greatest generation' that sent not only this ship, but their loved ones to war.'

The wreck of the USS Independence lies nearly 30 miles off the central California coast.  This is where the US Navy scuttled it to take it beyond the reach of potential Soviet espionage at the end of its usefulness as a nuclear test platform in 1951.

However, given its radioactive past, the marine archaeologists were concerned about how safe it would be to explore and contacted nuclear physicist Kai Vetter.  Professor Vetter is head of applied nuclear physics at Berkeley Lab, nuclear engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and the co-founder of the Institute for Resilient Communities. 'They wanted to know if we could ensure the safety of their equipment,' said Professor Vetter. 'And to see if you'd pick up contamination if you went down there.' In short, the answer is no.  Professor Vetter said that neither the submersible nor the team was ever in danger of contamination because 'water is an excellent radiation shield'.  Underwater, radiation will only extend several inches from contaminated materials and the unmanned research submarine stayed at least 100ft (30 metres) away from the wreck.  Given its radioactive past, the marine archaeologists were concerned about how safe it would be to explore and contacted nuclear physicist Kai Vetter.

While a relatively small number of organisms close to the wreck might take up some of these rust particles, the effects of radioactivity are diluted through the food chain While contaminated rust particles from the ship are released and transported by water, the dilution factor of the ocean is enormous, essentially nullifying any radioactive effect, Professor Vetter continued.  And while a relatively small number of organisms close to the wreck might take up some of these rust particles, the effects of radioactivity are diluted through the food chain because the number of organisms exposed is so small. In contrast, he added that mercury is much more prevalent and widely distributed in the ocean, and this is why its concentration builds up in the food chain.  Plus, Professor Vetter said that the isotopes of concern - in this case cesium 137 and strontium 90 - both have a half-life of about 30 years.  This means that after 30 years, half the isotopes responsible for the initial contamination transform into other non-radioactive isotopes.  'It has been more than 60 years since the USS Independence was scuttled, which means that less than a quarter of the initial radioactive isotopes remain,' Professor Vetter said.  The shipwreck site of the former aircraft carrier is located in the northern region of Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Professor Vetter said that neither the submersible nor the team was ever in danger of contamination because 'water is an excellent radiation shield'.

It was found in 2,600 feet (792 metres) underwater off the coast of California's Farallon Islands and is said to be 'amazingly intact,' with its hull and flight deck clearly visible, and what appears to be a plane in the carrier's hangar bay.  To study the wreckage, the team of scientists and technicians on board the sanctuary vessel R/V Fulmar, used an 18.5-foot-long (5.6 metres) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) called Echo Ranger from The Boeing Company.  This survey showed that the Independence is upright, slightly listing to starboard, with much of its flight deck intact, and with holes leading to the hangar decks that once housed the carrier's aircraft. USS Independence (CVL 22) operated in the central and western Pacific from November 1943 until August 1945.  It was part of the carrier group that took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and was assigned to strike duties against targets in the Philippines and Japan. It was later one of more than 90 vessels assembled as a target fleet for the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests in 1946.  During these tests it was damaged by shock waves, heat and radiation, but it survived and was returned to the United States.  After being transported back to Pearl Harbor and San Francisco for study, the vessel was later sunk near the Farallon Islands on 26 January 1951 loaded with 55-gallon drums of low-level radioactive waste. 'After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,' said Mr Delgado, chief scientist on the Independence mission and maritime heritage director for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries.

It was sunk near the Farallon Islands on 26 January 1951 loaded with 55-gallon drums of radioactive waste The 'Able Test' of July 1, 1946, dropped a plutonium core 'Fat Man' weapon on the target fleet moored at Bikini THE ABLE NUCLEAR TEST  On 1 July 1946, the United States conducted the first nuclear test after World War II.  The explosion took place at the Bikini Atoll lagoon, situated in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean.   The explosion of the fission bomb, largely identical to the weapon used in the attack on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, occurred 158 metres above sea level and had a yield of 23kilotons.  The bomb, named Gilda after Rita Hayworth's character in the 1946 eponymous film, was dropped from the B-29 Superfortress Dave's Dream of the 509th Bombardment Group. The main aim was to test the effects of nuclear weapons on ships.  78 vessels, many of which had been captured during World War II, was anchored in the lagoon.  The blast sunk only five of them, leaving another 14 seriously damaged. The Journal of Maritime Archaeology gave over an entire issue to the collection of documents and photographs from the tests.  This era was grimly summarized in a then-classified report on the Bikini tests which suggested that, with the coming of the 'Bomb,' it was possible to depopulate the earth, leaving only 'vestigial remnants of man's works.'  The explosion took place at the Bikini Atoll lagoon, situated in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean.  Test Able was to be the first of a series of 67 tests in the atoll and the second U.S. nuclear test of over a thousand to follow. The explosion of the fission bomb, largely identical to the weapon used in the attack on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, occurred 158 metres above sea level and had a yield of 23kilotons.  The main aim was to test the effects of nuclear weapons on ships.  To that end, a fleet of 78 vessels, many of which had been captured during World War II, was anchored in the lagoon.  The blast sunk only five of them, leaving another 14 seriously damaged. 'The Journal of Maritime Archaeology is honored to be able to present the case study of the USS Independence,' says JMA's co-editor-in-chief, Annalies Corbin.  'NOAA's achievements in contextualizing the work ahead for maritime archaeologists around the world as it relates to post-World War II and Cold War archaeology is critical to launching meaningful conversation and developing initial plans for underwater cultural heritage management of vessels like the USS Independence.'  The US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Office of Ocean Exploration and Research and the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries worked with the Boeing Company in 2015 to pinpoint the wreck.  The 'Baker test' of July 25, 1946 detonated a weapon suspended beneath the moored target fleet at Bikini. The resulting cloud of steam, water, and pulverized coral and sand irradiated the target fleet, including USS Independence The goal was to learn more about it in a deep water test that merged high-resolution sonar and a free swimming underwater robotic vehicle, 'Echo Ranger.' 'Historical and, by extension, maritime archaeology of the recent past can and should include merging documentary evidence with physical remains,' notes NOAA's James Delgado, Director of Maritime Heritage for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and lead scientist for the Independence mission.  The bombed-out World War II relic was deliberately sunk - or scuttled - in 1951, loaded with 55-gallon drums of radioactive waste, and was recently rediscovered using sonar equipment. And now a nuclear physicist has revealed how radioactive the abandoned aircraft carrier really is, and whether it poses a threat to humans and wildlife. The fourth USS Independence (CVL 22) operated in the central and western Pacific from November 1943 until August 1945.   It was later one of more than 90 vessels assembled as a target fleet for the Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests in 1946.  The region, in the Marshall archipelago, was used to carry out 67 nuclear tests, including the explosion of the first H-bomb in 1952. After being transported back to San Francisco for study, the USS Independence was sunk near the Farallon Islands on 26 January 1951 loaded with drums of low-level radioactive waste. In April, a team of researchers used sonar from an autonomous submarine to find the wreckage buried 2,600 feet (792 metres) off the coast of California. It is said to be 'amazingly intact,' with its hull and flight deck clearly visible and the survey showed that the Independence is upright, slightly listing to starboard, with much of its flight deck intact, and with holes leading to the hangar decks that once housed the carrier's aircraft This wartime views of USS Independence (CVL 22) show the ship as it entered the final stages of the war in the Pacific.

Posted: Sept. 22, 2009 0 Comments SHARE By Wayne Risher Posted: Sept. 22, 2009 0 FedEx and Boeing on Tuesday introduced FedEx's first 777 Freighter, a game-changing cargo carrier that is key to the express delivery company's global growth strategy. FedEx officials said the plane, christened Saad (pronounced SAHD) after the son of a company auditor in New Jersey, should be making a 2,000-plus-mile flight from Washington state to Memphis shortly. The 2091/2 -foot-long plane, with a wingspan of 212 feet, 7 inches, is destined to become a fixture in the skies over FedEx hubs; the company ordered 30 with an option to buy another 15. A new hangar was built off Winchester at Memphis International Airport to house the 777 and other aircraft. It features longer range, better fuel economy and lower emissions than the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, a transcontinental freighter it is replacing. FedEx officials say it will carry the company's service to new heights, eliminating refueling stops and shaving one to three hours off transit times between Asia and North America. FedEx officials traveled to Boeing's factory in Everett, Wash., to celebrate completion of the plane, which is scheduled to begin flying between continents in April after several months of flight checks and shorter routes. Boeing said it is the ninth 777 Freighter delivery and the first to an American global freight carrier. "The 777 Freighter will allow FedEx Express to operate point-to-point routes that save valuable flying time, coupled with outstanding fuel efficiency and environmental responsibility," said Kevin Schemm, a Boeing vice president. "The 777F is a game-changer," added Michael L. Ducker, president, international, of FedEx Express. "Our customers around the world will benefit from more point-to-point routes and the shorter flight times, increasing their competitiveness in the global marketplace." FedEx officials said shorter transit time means later pickup deadlines in markets served by the 777s. "The Boeing 777 is an extraordinary testament to our dedication to fleet enhancement, allowing FedEx Express to provide unmatched services to our customers around the world," said David J. Bronczek, president and CEO of FedEx Express. FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said, "It's a technological masterpiece, and it's going to elevate us competitively in the global market that we're in." McCluskey said FedEx plans to have four 777s in service by April and 15 in the fleet by the end of fiscal 2014. The 777 orders also have played a role in FedEx's battle against a proposed change in the labor law covering FedEx Express workers. FedEx made the order for the second 15 planes and 15 options contingent on Express workers continuing to be covered under the Railway Labor Act. The 777F's price tag has been estimated at about $225 million apiece. A posting on FedEx's Citizenship Blog said the first 777 is named for the son of Kashif Zia, an input auditor who joined FedEx in 1998 at the Newark Airport. Zia said Saad means "good luck" and "lucky." All 650 planes in the FedEx fleet are named for children of team members. -- Wayne Risher: 529-2874 About the Boeing 777F World's largest twin-engine cargo aircraft Flight range equals about 6,675 land miles, or nearly three times approximate distance between the east and west coasts of the U.S. Payload capacity 215,000 pounds, or 98 metric tons Uses 18 percent less fuel than McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Engine technology reduces emissions 18 percent Advanced noise-reduction technology meets airport noise standards and makes takeoffs and landings quieter 0 Share Tweet Email Print Business Topics Jobs & Wages Real Estate Medical Industry Economic Development Tourism & Entertainment Entrepreneurs Non-Profits Public Corporations FedEx & Logistics National Business Trending Now Memphis Homicide Tracker More Business Bass Pro Pyramid sales fall slightly as honeymoon ends Bass Pro to buy rival Cabela's for $5.5 billion French firm picks W.

T&Cs. Click here to apply. by Chris Chamberlin | November 15, 2016 UPDATE | It'll be at least another few months until Qantas passengers get their first taste of inflight Internet as the airline pushes back public trials of the service until early 2017. While one Qantas Boeing 737 aircraft has now been kitted out with the technology, the delay allows Qantas and its connectivity partner ViaSat to conduct further testing of the system before opening it up to travellers. "While we know that customers will want to connect to the WiFi, we really do appreciate their patience while we go through our final testing process," said Qantas’ Head of Customer Experience Phil Capps. This next round of testing "ensure(s) that, first and foremost, the safety of the installation meets Qantas’ stringent standards, as well as ensuring the system will deliver the level of performance we expect at this stage of the trial," Capps added. Qantas had previously planned to debut inflight Internet on domestic flights by the end of 2016, with passengers to enjoy free inflight streaming of cricket matches under a partnership with Cricket Australia. However, the delay now means that airborne travellers will miss the bulk – if not all – of the summer cricket season, which winds down on February 22 2017. Once public trials of the service do commence in early 2017 aboard one Boeing 737 aircraft, Qantas aims to begin fitting its entire domestic Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 fleets with the tech from the middle of the year, with fleetwide completion due in 2018. The airline remains in talks with suppliers to bring inflight Internet to its regional (QantasLink) and international fleets, but has no firm plans at this stage. PREVIOUS, August 24 2016 | Qantas plans to offer inflight Internet access on every aircraft in its domestic fleet and is looking to extend sky-high WiFi across its international network as well. With a trial to take place on its Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 aircraft towards the end of the year, the Roo will complete the roll-out of inflight WiFi in 2017 and is in the final stages of securing the tech for its QantasLink Boeing 717s and Dash 8s, along with its Network Aviation Fokker 100s. Passengers flying during the Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 tech trials later this year will be able to watch a live stream of the summer's cricket season under a partnership between Qantas and Cricket Australia. “A flight from Sydney to Perth should be enough time to catch an entire match of 20/20," Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce says, "and live cricket is just one of the partnerships we are looking at.” Also on the agenda is inflight Internet across Qantas’ international fleet. “There are over 200 Qantas aircraft and some complex technical issues to work through… but our plan is to provide Wi-Fi to all our customers as soon as we can, and we’ll be providing more detail after the domestic trial,” Joyce’s speech reads.

Postmedia had no involvement in the creation of this content. x Fast-paced farce will be a grand time in Gananoque Sponsored Content More from Sponsored Content Published on: August 23, 2016 | Last Updated: August 23, 2016 5:21 PM EST Paul Dunn and Tess Degenstein in A Grand Time In The Rapids at the Thousand Islands Playhouse. Jay Kopinski Share Adjust Comment Print   The Thousand Islands Playhouse is following up the hit shows Boeing Boeing and Don’t Dress for Dinner with another frivolous comedy at its waterfront theatre. A Grand Time in the Rapids will be on stage in Gananoque from now to Sept. 17. Set in the 1950s, A Grand Time in the Rapids involves three characters in one apartment setting. Thalia is seeking help from Ted, a well-intentioned etiquette expert whose aim is to provide assistance with her romantic troubles. When Thalia’s boyfriend Boyd enters the apartment, Thalia is left with the task of admitting the details of her disastrous past. Ted is there to chaperon this encounter, while helping Thalia to maintain her poise and manners as she explains her story. The audience can expect a significant transition, as what appears to be a polite and composed play in Act 1 dramatically shifts in Act 2. Drinks are thrown, doors are slammed, and the audience will enjoy it all with a hearty bout of laughter. Craig Pike and Paul Dunn in A Grand Time In The Rapids at the Thousand Islands Playhouse. Jay Kopinski   The story is woven together by the quick wit of Edmonton-based playwright Stewart Lemoine, who has written more than 70 plays and is considered one of the city’s best-kept secrets. Though all of his plays have been produced in Edmonton, they do not often go beyond its city limits, unless an artist has discovered his work or has a direct connection to Lemoine himself. It’s an exciting rarity to have one of his plays brought to Gananoque. “Our audiences love a classic farce, and I think it is important to support the work of Canadian playwrights,” said Ashlie Corcoran, Playhouse’s artistic director. “It is exciting to find a fast-paced show that fits the bill.” This production of A Grand Time in the Rapids is directed by Ron Pederson, who originated the role of Ted at Edmonton’s Teatro La Quindicina. He is also known to Playhouse audiences as an actor, most recently starring in the musical Into the Woods. The small cast of three brings a mighty presence to the stage. They are all Toronto-based artists who have starred in previous productions at the Thousand Islands Playhouse. “The cast is incredible,” says Pederson. “They’re excellent, comedic virtuosos. It takes a very specific skill to handle the language and technicality to get this. These three actors are dynamite.” The Thousand Islands Playhouse is delighted to bring this Canadian show to the stage for audiences to enjoy.

The planes are all being sent to the aircraft “boneyard” in Roswell, N.M., as part of what American is calling “one of the largest single-day aircraft retirements in airline history.” USA TODAY The 'boneyard': Where airlines send old planes to be scrapped Of the 20 planes headed to the New Mexico desert on Tuesday, 17 were originally delivered to American Airlines. The three others were inherited by American via its acquisition of TWA. The average age of the 20 retiring jets is 28 years old, according to FlightRadar24, which is encouraging its users to track the retirement flights. The 140-seat MD-80s will be arriving to Roswell throughout the day, though they’ll be coming in at a clip of about one every five minutes during an 85-minute window starting at 11:20 a.m. local time (1:20 p.m. ET). Many so-called "avgeek" aviation enthusiasts were following the mass retirement on Twitter with the #Super80SendOff hastag. USA TODAY August's #avgeek gallery: 30 cool aviation photos Still, American spokesman Josh Freed tells Today in the Sky on Tuesday "today’s 20 retirements do not indicate an acceleration of MD-80 retirements." "It’s just that we have a long-term MD-80 retirement plan and with the busy summer flying season winding down, today was a good day to take care of these," Freed adds. The eventual retirement of the MD-80 – long the backbone of American’s domestic fleet – will end an era for American. The carrier once had more than 370 “Super 80s,” as the airline refers to them, in its fleet. But they’re scheduled to be phased out this decade, replaced by modern new Boeing 737 and Airbus A320-family jets as part of American’s aggressive fleet-renewal plan. To get all the aircraft type filters with one touch, choose ‘MD-80 family’ from the list. #Super80SendOffhttps://t.co/RVptupN8ns— Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) August 23, 2016 American had 87 MD-80s remaining in its fleet as of the second quarter of 2016. By the end of the third quarter, American says that number will have dropped to just 53 – aided in large part by Tuesday’s mass retirement. Freed said some MD-80s will remain in the carrier's fleet "through at least summer 2018." Two full-time American employees on the ground there will process incoming aircraft as they arrive. Planes can sit indefinitely in storage in Roswell, where the dry desert air helps keep the idle aircraft from corroding. Some find second lives, taken in by cargo carriers or by smaller airlines in the developing world. Others face a stark end – raided for parts or scrapped altogether. From 11:20—12:45L, an @AmericanAir MD-80 is scheduled to land in Roswell every 5 minutes. https://t.co/pKybbkNMh5pic.twitter.com/H691jD1trj— Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) August 23, 2016 IN PHOTOS: Riding a retiring MD-80 to the airline 'boneyard' FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn Photos: Riding a retiring jetliner to the airline 'boneyard'  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The massive Boeing 737  a passenger jet converted to VIP standard  will be operated by the islands Longtail Aviation. Martin Amick, CEO of Longtail Aviation, declined to discuss the jets ownership, but aviation websites listed the registered owner. Mr Tariko is the billionaire founder and owner of the Russian Standard vodka brand and the Russian Standard Bank. The new Boeing is he second in the Longtail fleet. Mr Amick said: We are very proud and pleased the owners have chosen us and we hope there will be others like them who see we are doing well. I am sure there will be other aeroplanes. As is the case with any other air carrier, you grow in size, you, the staff needed to service the aircraft you have. The limit is more likely imposed by the size of the field  this is a top of the line, high-end type of aircraft and there are very few people who can afford or have the capacity to run them. Mr Amick said that Bermuda management and registration offered special advantages to owners. He explained that Longtail Aviation was the only company in the world that has a Bermuda air carrier certificate  which means aircraft run from the island can be hired out for charters. He added that other countries offered the same type of service  but that the process was more difficult and time-consuming than in Bermuda. Mr Amick said: Bermuda has a very efficient regulatory authority, the Bermuda Civil Aviation Authority is very efficient and run by very competent people, particularly when they are working with a known operating company like Longtail Aviation. He added: The Bermuda aircraft registry is very popular around the world  there are more than 700 aircraft and of this only about 150 of them are private jets. The rest of them are airliners. Mr Amick said that few of the planes operated from the island spent time here. He added: This latest one could come here, but it will not spend a significant amount of time in Bermuda. The aircraft, based on the successful civilian airliner, is configured to carry just 18 VIPs and includes two private staterooms with baths and showers, a galley, private office space and luxurious seating. Mr Amick said: In 1998, the Boeing Aircraft Company re-engineered and successfully introduced the 737 Boeing business jet, nicknamed the BBJ, as a VIP private jet. Immediately upon its introduction, into corporate service, the BBJ became the gold standard for the entire private jet travel industry. The BBJ offers the best of commercial aviation safety and reliability in the private air travel sector. In addition to two Boeing 737 VIP jets, Longtail operates a large MD-87 private jet, a stretched version of the DC-9 airliner, and a smaller Dassault Falcon 900.

Camair-Co The Challenge is Huge For New Management! Victorine BIY NFOR | Cameroon-tribune | Publié : Mardi le 23 Aout 2016 06:51:39 | 5808 hits | Opinion | The implementation of the restructuring plan is awaiting the new management team. | Nous suivre sur facebook | Nous suivre sur twitter | Imprimer | Envoyer cet article à   The stakes are high for the new management team of the Cameroon national air carrier, Camair-Co. The new Board Chairman, Mefiro Oumarou and Director General, Ernest Dikoum appointed by President Paul Biya yesterday August 22, 2016 and commissioned in Yaounde by Transport Minister have the tasked of overseeing the strict implementation of the restructuring plan, proposed by the American consulting firm, Boeing, after a forensic audit. The skies may appear clearer for the company with the proposed plan to restructure the company after months of uncertainty caused by the recurrent breakdown of the Boeing 767-300 ER christened the “Dja” and the Boeing 737-700 coupled with the recent ban by the Civil Aviation Authority prohibiting the company from flying to Europe. The sigh of relief will however be heaved when the new management team takes the restructuring plan to the end. Nine Additional Aircraft The team is expected as proposed by the American firm, Boeing, to purchase nine additional aircraft to step up its fleet to 14 aircraft. Camair-Co’s inability to fly higher has always been blamed on its limited fleet, with Boeing insisting in its strategic audit report that the company’s flight expansion and business plan programme that brings out reliability was only achievable with more aircraft. The task is therefore huge for the new management team that is expected to purchase new aircraft according to its to-be-new destinations. New Flight Destinations Camair-Co’s inability to make ends meet has partly been attributed to its limited flight destinations which is understandable. The company planes, apart from flying across Africa, only go to Europe. The new restructuring plan endorsed by the Head of State makes provision for 27 destinations. Five intercontinental lines like Paris, Bruxelles, Washington and Wangzhou alongside 13 regional and nine domestic lines have been recommended by the consultant as government seeks to redress the country’s lone airline company. Ernest Dikoum and his team will therefore have the daunting task of making the company profitable through the multiplication of its flight destinations. FCFA 35 Billion Debts Camair-Co is in the bad books of its service providers like fuel providers, aircraft lenders and navigation service experts. Boeing consultant is proposing that government pays the company debts worth FCFA 35 billion. The new management team is therefore expected to work out a payment plan to relief the company of this nightmare. FCFA 60 Billion Funding In June 2015, government secured a FCFA 25 billion loan within a plan to re-launch the company. Priority was the purchase of new aircraft to add to the three the company owns. However, the funds are expected to be disbursed now given that the report of the forensic audit of the company required has been endorsed.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: August 24th, 2016 >> Story Satnews Daily August 24th, 2016 Double Deployment Delivery Success For Arianespace A dynamic duo has successfully gained the upper reaches with a successful launch by Arianespace of the Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 satellites aboard the first Ariane 5 launch vehicle's orbital injection mission of two Intelsat satellites. Two telecommunications relay satellites were orbited for Intelsat via an Ariane 5 launch. Photo is courtesy of Arianespace. Arianespace’s sixth launch of 2016, the fourth using an Ariane 5, occurred on Wednesday, August 24, 2016, at 07:16 p.m. (local time) from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana. This mission was the 73rd successful Ariane 5 launch in a row and also reflected the steadily increasing performance of the Ariane 5 rocket—back in June of this year, the Ariane 5 established a record launch of 10,730 kg. This launch was Arianespace’s second of the year for Intelsat. Arianespace has now launched 58 satellites for this operator, with their business relationship spanning mre than three decades. Intelsat operates a fleet of approximately 50 satellites and delivers high-performance distribution solutions for media applications and high data-rate connectivity for enterprise, fixed and mobile telecommunications and government applications. Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 are the company’s 57th and 58th satellites launched by Arianespace since the orbiting of Intelsat 507 in October 1983. Intelsat 29e, launched in January of 2016, covers the Americas and the North Atlantic. Intelsat 33e, the second satellite in this series, will provide broadband coverage of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific, as well as certain media solutions. The Intelsat 36 satellite will provide media distribution services for the south African and Indian Ocean regions. Artistic rendition of the Intelsat 33e satellite. Since the company's inception, Arianespace has launched half of all Intelsat satellites, including half of that firm's current on orbit fleet of operational satellites. In 2017, Arianespace will launch two additional Intelsat satellites: Intelsat 32e and Intelsat 37e. Arianespace and Boeing have been partners since 1987. Intelsat 33e is the 52nd Boeing satellite to be launched by Arianespace, which has four more Boeing satellites in its order book. Arianespace and SSL have been working together since 1983. With Intelsat 36, Arianespace has now launched 56 satellites based on SSL platforms and has nine more SSL satellites in their order book, including five to be deployed in GTO. Arianespace now has five geostationary (GEO) satellites in its order book for US-based operators, along with 12 geostationary satellites built by American manufacturers. The company also will deploy telecommunications and Earth Observation (EO) constellations built in the United States. Artistic rendition of the Intelsat 36 satellite. Arianespace will use an Ariane 5 in October of 2018 to launch the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), developed by NASA in conjunction with the Canadian Space Agency and European Space Agency (ESA). Shortly after the announcement of the orbital injection of the two satellites on today’s Flight VA232 with Ariane 5, Arianespace Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Israël extended his thanks to Intelsat for their loyalty over the last 30-plus years and for selecting Arianespace for today’s first-ever launch of two of their telecom satellites on the same Ariane 5. He also thanked Boeing and SSL who built the two Intelsat satellites launched on this mission as well as offered his congratulations to everyone who contributed to this 73rd successful launch in a row of Ariane 5: Airbus Safran Launchers and the entire European launcher industry for the reliability and availability of Ariane 5,; ESA, for their seamless support for the Ariane program; the CNES/CSG, and all companies and staff at the launch base and the teams at Arianespace, for their commitment and professionalism, as we the company marks the sixth successful launch in 2016 and gears up for five more launches during the year.

(NYSE: BA) has filed a patent application for an artillery shell that would deliver up to six gallons of fire retardant per round, day or night, 24 hours a day, in any weather, regardless of fire conditions. Some guns could deliver fire retardant within 15 feet of a target at a range of 15 miles, according to the application. Using a standard guide that estimates the speed at which a wildfire can spread, the patent application noted that on a large 883-acre fire it would take more than 34 hours to deliver 360,000 gallons of retardant by airplane or helicopter. Artillery shells with a three-gallon payload could deliver that much in about half the time, minimizing the area burned to a total of about 1,103 acres compared with a burned area of 3,130 acres when only a helicopter is used to dump retardant on the fire. The Boeing staff responsible for the application also took notice of the environmental impact of leaving a lot of shrapnel behind: In one embodiment, the external surface … of the artillery shell … may be made of any degrading metal which decomposes in nature in less than ten years or is inert and is not harmful to the environment without decomposition. In this embodiment, the external surface … is made of high carbon steel, structural glass, or ceramics having a tensile strength greater than about 200 MP such as Zirconia, Zirconia-toughened Alumina, or Alumina. The shell would explode in mid-air, above the fire, and retardant coverage would vary between one and six gallons per 100 square feet. There is even a proposed variation that does not use any explosive material or fuse. Seven Boeing employees are listed as the inventors and the patent has been assigned to the company.

With the November election looming, “it’s our job to really understand the impact” decisions on such issues as foreign trade, the nation’s defense budget, shifting global partnerships and the Export-Import bank will have on the future of aerospace,” Joan Robinson-Berry said during a keynote address at the annual S.C. Aerospace Conference and Expo. The election “is something we’re all thinking about probably more than we want to,” she said. Robinson-Berry did not openly endorse either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, but described attributes of a candidate that will “ensure that we don’t step backwards in what we’ve accomplished over the last 100 years.” “More than ever, we need to have that leadership attribute I call emotional resilience — to be calm, to be focused and to have a clear heart in some of these decisions,” Robinson-Berry said at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center. “We have to be aware of the shifting global economy, including oil prices and the changes in airline policy and global trade and the Ex-Im Bank, how important that is to our industry and, of course, trade. “We need to think about these things that are very complicated, very politically charged, but that have a direct impact on our ability to grow our aerospace industry, not only in our state but in our country,” she said. After her remarks, Robinson-Berry said the next president “absolutely must support” the federal Ex-Im Bank, which provides financing to foreign companies looking to buy expensive U.S.-made goods, including commercial aircraft. “It’s important to support a global market to trade,” Robinson-Berry said of the lending agency. Boeing is one of the bank’s biggest beneficiaries, and many of its sales — including those of the 787 Dreamliners made in North Charleston — would face financial hurdles without the bank’s backing. Congress reauthorized the Ex-Im Bank in December following a lengthy bipartisan fight, but its board still does not have the quorum needed to make loans exceeding $10 million because of Senate inaction. Clinton has said she supports the bank because it keeps the United States competitive in the global economy. Trump opposes the bank, saying the companies that benefit from it “can do very well without it.” Trump also has said he wants to “rip up” many of the trade agreements the aerospace industry now supports. Robinson-Berry also discounted comments Trump made during the primaries in which he predicted Boeing will moves its production facilities to China. During a speech in Colleton County earlier this year, Trump said: “Everyone loves Boeing today, but talk to me about Boeing in five years — unless I’m elected president, then you’ll be OK.” Boeing’s businesses in North Charleston, aren’t going anywhere, Robinson-Berry said. They include the Dreamliner fabrication and assembly campus, a research center, a plant that designs and makes engine parts and a factory that makes 787 interior cabin parts. “I know we’re going to grow internationally, but we also have a strong presence here,” she said. “We made a huge investment in North Charleston. It’s hard for me to believe that we would take that huge investment and infrastructure and shut it down.” Robinson-Berry took over as vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina in June, when its former leader, Beverly Wyse, moved back to the Seattle region to become a division president. Robinson-Berry has been with Boeing for 30 years. The two-day aerospace conference has drawn more than 500 attendees to hear about industry trends, workforce and education initiatives and developments in new technology.

With the help of the international nonprofit organization Vital Voices, whose mission is to invest in and empower women leaders, the airline’s 22nd Next-Generation 737-800 will transport and deliver nearly 30 boxes full of relief items including clothes and school supplies. The items are headed to The Children’s Advocacy Center Thailand (ACT), a non-profit organization dedicated to better the lives of abused children and youth in Thailand. Representatives from ACT will deliver the aid to impacted children and youth throughoutThailand. “We are honored to play an important role for the well-being of our children and youth,” said Nok Air CEO Patee Sarasin. “Providing timely supplies to those in need will affect the lives of many in the region. Nok Air is proud to continue playing a vital role in cultivating the well-being of our community.” As part of the Global Corporate Citizenship program, Boeing is committed to building better communities worldwide. “We are honored that Nok Air partnered with The Boeing Company to deliver humanitarian aid to the many children in Thailand who are in need,” said Sam Whiting, Director, Global Corporate Citizenship, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We look forward to working closely with Nok Air and non-profit organizations like ACT in Thailand to identify future opportunities.” Based in Bangkok, Thailand, Nok Air is a low-cost carrier that operates an all-Boeing fleet. As part of a tradition in naming its new airplanes, Nok Air has designated this particular airplane ‘Fah Kram,’ which means blue skies.

A non-profit organization that strives to prevent and treat blindness worldwide, Orbis typically completes 10-12 aircraft missions per year, flying doctors, nurses and anesthesiologists – all volunteers – across  the globe to provide hands-on ophthalmology training to health workers onboard the MD-10, a fully accredited teaching hospital. A key purpose of the organization is to prevent “avoidable blindness”. Orbis estimates that there are 280 million visually impaired people in the world and 80% of them do not have to be: 240 million just need glasses, the other 40 million can be cured if they can afford or have access to eye care.  Jack McHale, director of the MD-10 program (as well as a former interim president and CEO of Orbis and the former managing director of aircraft acquisitions at FedEx), gave Aviation Week a tour of the MD-10 on a stopover at the Reagan Washington National Airport on June 30. FedEx donated the aircraft to Orbis and a host of other companies provided financial help for the modifications and outfitting. While the MD-10 performs the same mission as its predecessors – the DC-8 from 1982-1992 and a DC-10 from 1992-2016 – its internals are quite different, explains McHale. Both the DC-8 and DC-10 were passenger aircraft that had to be converted into mobile hospitals, meaning the operating rooms were certified as an integral part of the aircraft, an expensive proposition.  No so with the MD-10. Aside from the “theater” or teaching area at the front of the aircraft... ...and changing rooms and lavatories at the rear of the cabin, the remainder of the hospital is completely independent of hte airframe and housed in nine 125in. x 217in. x 96in. cargo containers stacked back to back. The containers were initially loaded through the front 102 in. x 140 in. cargo door, rolled into place, fastened in and hooked up, but there are no electrical or other connections to the aircraft itself, meaning the actual hospital did not have to be certified as part of the aircraft. From front to back, the cargo containers on the MD-10 hold an administrative office, audiovisual/IT room, laser treatment room, observation area, operating room, sterilization room and recovery area, none of which require input from the aircraft.   Above: Laser Treatment Room Below: Operating Room Below: McHale describes the Recovery Room This means that when the MD-10 lands at a destination, where it will usually stay for about three weeks, the 22 crew members have certain tasks to complete and a few items to obtain from the airport. "We need a set of stairs, a garden hose and a forklift," says McHale. Other than the water they take on, the hospital is self sufficient, thanks to two electrical generators and an air conditioning unit that are stored in belly cargo and taken out at the destination.   The unique cargo container hospital was built by MMIC, a maker of mobile surgery units (picture the trailer portion of a tractor trailer), based in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. "We went to them and said if we give you three trucks, cut in three, can you put them all together and make a hospital" says McHale, "and they said sure." Built in St. Johnsbury, the containers were then shipped to Victorville, California, where the other modifications were made and the aircraft flight tested by a FedEx crew.  Orbis holds the patents for the cargo pallet-mobile hospital conversion, and is optimistic the idea might resonate with militaries or government agencies that may be in need of a flying hospital.  The organization has 19 volunteer pilots, including the two below, all of whom are FedEx pilots offering the services on their own time. They will fly the dozen or so missions per year that Orbis strives to complete, and be flown home on commercial airlines after landing the MD-10 at a new location. When the aircraft is ready to leave again, Orbis flies another crew to the location.   While FedEx contributes to maintenance costs, Orbis pays the fuel bills, airplane tickets and hotel rooms for the two dozen or so doctors, nurses and anesthesiologists volunteering for a given mission. Orbis has 400 doctors, nurses and anesthesiologist volunteers. McHale too spends a good portion of his time volunteering, and remains passionate about the work.  “When you see somebody get a life back because they can see, whether it’s a child or an 80-year-old guy, you know that it’s worth it," he says.

China has some basic hospitals in some places, but in other places they have some of the most modern hospitals in the world. Has Orbis been (for example) to Bangladesh?

Log In or Register to post comments Advertisement Rene Kunz on Aug 24, 2016 I have the same question about China-PRC being the No.1 destination. Is the Chinese government still unable to take care of of their population now, considering that they Chinese Government/Chinese corporations are investing in and buying up companies and landholdings all over the globe and expanding their military might at a rapid pace. Does not most of the population within the African Continent have a more serious and devastating problem with eye diseases and blindness that China? Log In or Register to post comments grantar2 on Aug 26, 2016 BlazonMc, re-read the article. They are going to China on a teaching mission. For all it's new found wealth China with the largest population on earth is very poor, with poor medical infrastructure across most of the country. The wealth as concentrated in the costal regions. That said their medical technology lags Europe and particularly the U.S. By training Chinese doctors a great amount of progress can be made. The China mission is akin to teaching the how to fish, rather than giving them a fish ( I am sure you know the proverb). As for Bangladesh, the answer is many times. You can google Orbis Bangladesh and see some of the work. Log In or Register to post comments msadesign on Aug 24, 2016 Don't tell me this isn't a great country. Log In or Register to post comments charles.stewart... on Aug 24, 2016 Jack McHale deserves a great vote of gratitude for his work to secure this flying hospital. I worked with Jack when he was at FedEx and I at Boeing. He was personally dedicated to Orbis, and ensuring this great service around the world. Thank you Jack!! Log In or Register to post comments vercingetorix t... on Aug 24, 2016 It is a superb example of non partisan humanitarianism. Excellent stuff and we owe everyone involved a debt of gratitude. Log In or Register to post comments skitnik on Aug 24, 2016 Yes, I completely agree with you. For example, the all the crew members (18 from 12 nationalities, while I've worked there) have equal salary and contracts for maximum two years, regardless of the position. That is to allow more to go through the great opportunity to work on board and gather priceless experience, that to bring back to their home country clinics; The world renown eye surgeons come and operate absolutely pro bono! FedEx does free of charge all aircraft related jobs and spares shipment! Log In or Register to post comments el ttigre on Aug 24, 2016 What a country , we have some very good people among us.

Log In or Register to post comments Peter S on Aug 24, 2016 China is a huge country with a vast and diverse population. Outside the big cities in rural areas, the peasants really are peasants despite what the communist government wants westerners to think. Health care, if you can afford it is scarce and expensive for people who barely earn but a few dollars (converted) per day. They are called peasants for a reason. My father is one of them!

They have funds to purchase US Bonds, US property, spending a large sum on space exploration, but not building sufficient medical facilities, and now the US has to help with sending a Flying Hospital???? Why??? Did anyone looked Africa, some countries in South America, India, Pakistan, etc.????? There are many countries on the earth that do not have the financial resources to take care of their population with proper medical facilities. Why China?????? It is amazing that we have such dedicated personnel available, donations from corporations and individuals to support the program, so why do we not apply more common sense.

Atherton posted Aug 23rd, 2016 at 11:01am Boeing Promotional Image For Boeing T-X Trainer Just the tip of the plane is visible here. Black metal faintly lit against a dark backdrop gives just the slightest hint of an airplane. The glimpses are parts of a teaser trailer for the Boeing and Saab designed T-X, their entry into a trainer jet competition for the Air Force. If the video is slowed down just enough, it’s possible to see just the tip of the plane: There’s also a trailer with a half-second view of plane from overhead, looking very much like a narrow dart. The competition's goal is to replace the Air Force’s existing T-38 trainers, which have trained Air Force jet pilots since the 1960s. Airplanes have advanced quite a bit since then, so the Air Force wants to make sure their new trainer can adequately prepare new pilots for modern planes. Besides the Boeing and Saab collaboration, three other teams (including Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman) are putting forth bids for the contract to replace the trainer. The Air Force plans to start looking at proposals in December, and we’re starting to see glimpses of many of the designs already in the works. Ultimately, the Air Force is looking to buy 350 new jets to train their pilots on for decades to come, and a 350-jet contract is pretty good business for whatever team can get it. So what will the Boeing- and Saab-designed trainer jet actually look like? The announcement page says “Stay tuned for the reveal in September 2016!” Conveniently, that’s the same month as the Air Force Association's Air & Space Conference and Technology Exposition. Expect it to make a debut in the lead up to that conference.

Mr Brownlee says having an underwater surveillance capability deters interference with the sea lines of communication that New Zealand and many of its friends rely on for trade purposes. “Knowing what is happening underwater is integral to monitoring submarine activity,” Mr Brownlee says. “This is particularly important in the Asia-Pacific region which is home to two-thirds of the world’s submarines. “The current Orion systems are old and have become less reliable. “I am pleased that New Zealand businesses Safe Air, Beca and Marops Limited will also be involved in supporting this acquisition through its life, with around 25 per cent of the value of the contract being spent with these companies.” The recently released 2016 Defence White Paper confirmed the importance of the New Zealand Defence Force having capabilities to cope with the realities of a complex and changing strategic environment, and to enable it to operate across a broad spectrum of geographic and operating environments. Work is already underway within Defence on the Future Air Surveillance Capability project which will select a replacement for the Orion aircraft, which is due to retire from service in the mid-2020s.

That record, previously held by Scott Kelly, fell today as Jeff Williams became the U.S. astronaut record holder for most cumulative days in space. Williams’ third long-duration stay aboard the International Space Station is coming to an end. On September 6th, Williams is expected to have both feet planted back on Earth. He will have lived and worked in space for 534 days. Did You Know: The record for most days spent in space belongs to Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka. He has spent 879 days in space. It’ll be a long time before anyone approaches that record. Scott Kelly, who recently spent a full year in space, was in mission control today and congratulated Williams on his accomplishment. He did have one question for Williams, though. “Do you have another 190 days in you?” Kelly jokingly asks referring to a full-year aboard the ISS. “That question is not for me, that’s for my wife,” Williams quips back. .@StationCDRKelly congratulates @Astro_Jeff on breaking his record of 520 total days in space by a U.S. astronaut! https://t.co/y9BxzUWtgH — Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 24, 2016 Kelly goes on to congratulate Williams and Kate Rubins for their successful spacewalk earlier this month to install the International Docking Adapter. This new docking port will make manned trips by SpaceX and Boeing a reality. Kelly signs off by saying he hopes to see Williams the moment he touches down back on land on September 6th. As for Williams last two weeks in space? He won’t be lounging around waiting for the time to pass by. Williams and Rubins will head back outside the ISS for another spacewalk on September 1st. Here’s what they will be doing. Related Stunning Video Shows Where ISS Crew Work, Sleep and Snap Incredible Pictures Working on the port side of the orbiting complex’s backbone, or truss, Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins of NASA will retract a thermal radiator that is part of the station’s cooling system. The radiator is a backup that had been deployed previously as part of an effort to fix an ammonia coolant leak. They’ll also tighten struts on a solar array joint, and install the first of several enhanced high-definition television cameras that will be used to monitor activities outside the station, including the comings and goings of visiting cargo and crew vehicles. Jeff Williams’ history in space The first of four trips to space began in 2000. Williams served as flight engineer and lead spacewalker for the STS-101 mission aboard the space shuttle Atlantis. That mission delivered more than a ton of supplies to the ISS and prepared the station for the arrival of the Zvezda Service Module. Williams and James Voss conducted one spacewalk to install several new batteries, smoke detectors and cooling fans in the Zarya Control Module. They also installed handrails on the Unity node to aid future spacewalks. In 2006, Williams began his first six-month stay aboard the ISS with two other crewmembers (Expedition 13). Back then, the ISS only had two modules and three crewmembers. Today, the space station houses six crewmembers most of the time. He then served as flight engineer on Expedition 21 and commanded Expedition 22. And now he’s wrapping up another lengthy stint as part of the Expedition 48 crew. Here he is back in June keeping tabs on a pair of satellites dubbed SPHERES. Related NASA Pencils In New InSight Mars Mission Launch Date Williams is expected to be back on Earth on September 6th.

About 64 percent of drone crashes are caused by technical issues, a study released today by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) says. The study is the first to dive beyond general finger pointing when drone crashes cause a stir. After a drone hit a British Airways plane en route to Heathrow Airport in April, Graham Wild and Glenn Baxter, both from the RMIT engineering department, and John Murray from Edith Cowan University, decided to conduct a study on just what caused most drone accidents. Related: This catapult crashes drones into raw pork to simulate what drone crashes do to the human body The researchers looked at 150 reported drone crashes worldwide, occurring between 2006 and 2016. The study showed that technical glitches were the guilty party in more than half the cases. Dividing those causes down even further, the team said that the loss of communication between the drone and the operator was the most common error. “Large transport category aircraft, such as those from a Boeing or Airbus, are required to have triple redundant systems for their communications,” Wild said. “But drones don’t and some of the improvements that have reduced the risks in those aircraft could also be used to improve the safety of drones.” Many drones have fail-safes that will automatically land the aircraft when it looses communication with the pilot — while that prevents “runaway” drones in many cases, landing automatically means there’s nothing to tell the drone what’s below. Many fail-safes also have to be calibrated, something that many novice drone users fail to do. An online poll in 2014, for example, showed that out of 774 DJI Phantom owners, a third of them had lost control at some point and 122 of them never actually saw their unmanned aircraft again. The results from the RMIT study led Wild to conclude that the regulations aren’t quite keeping up with the growth of drone technology. Lightweight drones aren’t expected to meet the same standards as their larger counterparts, yet they can still cause damage if they fly in a built-up area, he said. Another issue is that drone crashes are seldom reported unless they cause damage. Being able to analyze more crash data would help drive additional research to support government regulations. “Drones are being used for a wide range of tasks now and there are a lot of day-to-day activities that people want to use them for — delivering pizzas and packages, taking photos, geosurveying, firefighting, and search and rescue,” Wild said. “It’s essential that our safety regulations keep up with this rapidly growing industry.” New AI program could help drones avoid flying over big crowds Inexpensive follow drone Up&Go will take flight thanks to crowdfunding 5 tips for getting the best video footage from your drone flight Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News The best Black Friday tech deals Yahoo Finance Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

(NYSE: I), operator of the world's first Globalized Network, powered by its leading satellite backbone, today announced that Intelsat 33e, the second of seven planned Intelsat EpicNG high throughput satellites, was launched successfully from French Guiana aboard an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. Liftoff occurred at 6:16 p.m. EDT. The Intelsat 33e satellite separated from the rocket's upper stage at 6:44 p.m. EDT, and signal acquisition has been confirmed. Intelsat 33e, manufactured by Boeing, will bring high throughput capacity in both C- and Ku-band to the Africa, Europe, Middle East and Asia regions from 60°E. The satellite will join Intelsat 29e, the first Intelsat EpicNG satellite, which was launched in January 2016 over the Americas and North Atlantic Ocean region, to form a high throughput overlay to Intelsat's fleet of enterprise-grade, wide beam satellites. Intelsat 33e is equipped with the sector's most advanced digital payload on a commercial spacecraft and combines wide beams and spot beams with frequency reuse technology. The digital payload provides customers with unprecedented security and flexibility, enabling seamless access and the ability to shift capacity to match their usage needs in a particular region or timeframe.

"Our first high throughput satellite, Intelsat 29e, is already in service and exceeding our customers' expectations in the Americas. With Intelsat 33e, customers operating in EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions will now be able to leverage Intelsat EpicNG's differentiated capabilities and greater efficiencies to grow their businesses and deliver enhanced value to their customers." Mr. Spengler continued, "Intelsat 33e and the Intelsat EpicNG architecture are fully backwards compatible and interoperable with Intelsat's existing satellite fleet and terrestrial infrastructure. This allows customers to cost efficiently use currently deployed network hardware so that they can have immediate access to high performance connectivity. Intelsat 33e also brings us one step closer to providing the first global, fully interoperable wide beam and high throughput Ku-band broadband service. We remain on schedule to launch the remaining five Intelsat EpicNG satellites. The 2018 launch of our Horizons 3e satellite will complete our global coverage, adding the Pacific Ocean region." The Intelsat 33e payload will deliver carrier-grade services to fixed and mobile network operators, and broadband for applications such as enterprise, aeronautical and maritime mobility and government. Companies such as EMC, Gogo, Harris CapRock, KVH, Marlink, Panasonic Avionics, Romantis, Supernet, and Television and Radio Broadcasting Network of Armenia (TRBNA), will be among the first to deploy services on the platform. Intelsat 33e is the 57th Intelsat satellite launched by Arianespace. It will replace Intelsat 904, which will be redeployed.

The team members are Robbie van Zyl, Parker Korn, Marcus DiBattista, Ian Buckalew, Andrew Walter, and Matt Harmon.   “Congratulations to this team that lived up to the school’s pursuit of excellence,” said Stacey Smith, McIntosh High School assistant principal.   The McIntosh MultiRotor Team stepped onto the flight line amid worsening weather conditions which included 15 mph winds and gusts of up to 20 mph. Weighing heavily on their minds were that these same conditions had just taken its toll on two other teams resulting in one lost drone and one crash landing.   Earlier in the day, a team from an aviation high school in Seattle sponsored by Boeing had performed an almost perfect mission, as had a team from a STEM high school in Minnesota. The MHS team knew it would all come down to how well they handled the pressure and the weather conditions during the next 45 minutes of their mission attempt.   The prestigious UAS4STEM contest was designed by the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA) to introduce students to the positive impact that drone technology could have on our future and to provide a program for students to learn about the technical intricacies of autonomous drones. The contest requires teams to build and customize a drone and to learn how to configure and program the drone to perform autonomous missions.   The drone could be programmed to fly missions on its own from a ground station computer connected by a radio telemetry uplink while the team monitored a live video feed transmitted by the drone to a screen on the ground. The challenge was to search and locate and identify hidden objects in a designated search area. Teams are judged on their ability to find all the objects and accurately report the GPS coordinates of each object.   The mission this year was life-or-death challenged based on finding a lost group of hikers in a remote area before a major storm would consume the area. Little did the organizers realize how realistic the premise of the contest would turn out to be.   A frontal storm system was approaching, preceded by winds exceeding 15 mph. Halfway through the day, a series of violent storms hit the area, creating very difficult conditions for the teams. According to Marcus DiBattista, the mission telemetry specialist, “We were prepared for the worst, and this was pretty much it.”   Back on the flight line, the team, composed of Robbie van Zyl, Parker Korn, Marcus DiBattista, Ian Buckalew, Andrew Walter and Matt Harmon, realized that the months of preparation and practice would come down to the next 45 minutes.   What they did not know at that time was that they had scored highest of all the teams on the flight readiness briefing — a presentation to judges of how they have modified the drone for the challenge and how they plan to approach the mission.   As their drone took off on its mission, the next storm was rolling in and the wind speed progressively increased and became more gusty. In the words of Ian Buckalew, the mission controller, “the worsening conditions and high winds required us to rewrite and upload parts of the mission program mid-flight to compensate for the wind.”   However, the entire mission could not be autonomous. During the process of locating the objects using the precision onboard GPS, Matt Harmon, the team pilot, had to take manual control of the drone. “The stormy conditions we experienced were more challenging from a pilot’s perspective than any thing I’ve flown in before,” Matt said.   Less than two minutes before the end of the allotted time, the team was still searching for the last “missing hiker.” Despite being very low on battery, they decided to make one final search attempt in an area they had not previously searched. Their excitement as they spotted the last missing hiker was sobered as they realized that they were critically low on battery and had less than two minutes before returning to base.   After tagging the location they sent a “return to base” command. Less than 100 yards from the base the drone’s battery reached a critical voltage level and the team initiated a controlled emergency landing. Fortunately, the drone was close enough to base to be recovered, and Parker Korn and Andrew Walter had less than 60 seconds to run out to recover the distressed drone.   The team had just completed a perfect mission and the first place in the contest came down to the young McIntosh team and a team of upperclassmen from Minnesota. In the end, when the final position of the objects were compared, the Minnesota team’s superb mission narrowly edged out the McIntosh team. On two of the objects the McIntosh team had missed the actual location by less than three meters.   According to Robbie van Zyl, the mission commander, “Our understanding of the technology was among the best but in the end it was the ability to work well together as a team of Chiefs that gave us a shot at winning the national title.”   Robert Grgetic, the McIntosh coach, was delighted with the final result. “This was an incredible experience to see these Chiefs compete against the best in the nation and to take second place. The whole season was incredible. I have seen this team learn things related to physics and engineering that most people will only be exposed to at engineering school.”   The team was one of 11 from middle and high schools across the country that competed in the first National UAS4STEM competition sponsored by the Academy of Model Aeronautics. The program is designed to encourage students to learn about the sUAS (drone) phenomenon through teamwork, competition, and success through STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). The competition was held at the International Aeromodeling Center in Muncie, Indiana on Aug. 20.   The team qualified for the national competition after winning their regional competition earlier this year. A total of 75 teams took part in regional competitions across the nation, with only 11 of them advancing to the national event.   The UAS4STEM competition is a search and rescue challenge. This year’s mission was for each team to use a sUAS to support a search and rescue mission for a small group of hikers who went missing in a remote area. All competitors were required to complete the sUAS ground school curriculum and work together to build a Quadzilla quadcopter.

UNHEAVY METAL: Ozztosh Luma S By Richard Bienstock | Photography by Massimo Gammacurta Brian Ostosh is not your typical guitar builder. For one thing, he’s never played guitar, though he is well versed in piano, marimba, flute, and piccolo. Furthermore, he spent much of his adult life working not in the MI industry but in aeronautics. After retiring a few years ago, he switched his focus to guitar making, a move that, in his estimation, is not as radical a shift as it may seem. “I’ve always been fascinated with building things,” he says. “When I was young it was surfboards, because I’m from Southern California. Then it was canoes. After that, aircraft.” The connecting thread? “They’re all hollow, lightweight structures,” he continues. “So when it came to the guitar, I just used that same knowledge, even though I had never built a guitar in my life.” Given his unique background, it’s hardly surprising that Ostosh’s guitars, which he builds under the company name Ozztosh, are untraditional. Take the model shown here, the Luma S, which, at first glance, bears a resemblance in shape, pickguard style, and pickup configuration to a Fender Stratocaster (hence the S in its designation). But the instrument’s brilliant reflective surface is the first hint that this is not an ordinary electric guitar. Rather, every Ozztosh creation boasts a body crafted from 6061 aluminum alloy, the same material, Ostosh says, that is used in the construction of Boeing aircraft. Of course, Ostosh is hardly the first builder to employ metals in his creations. But one of the more appealing aspects of his metal bodies, he says, is how thin he is able to cut them. “In my years in aeronautics I did a lot of molds for wings and wing tips and things where lightness is important,” he says. “So I learned how to cut very, very light parts. I translated that machining knowledge to guitar bodies to keep the weight down. One thing I realized from looking at other aluminum guitars is that when you’re coming from the world of wood construction, you design heavier pieces because you don’t realize how strong aluminum is. But the strength of aluminum is phenomenal compared to, say, maple.” In Ostosh’s guitars, the tops and backs are carved and partially routed from two 35-pound solid blocks of aircraft-grade 6061 aluminum billet and then joined together with machine screws. Inside, Ostosh explains, “a vertical wall keeps the top and back from collapsing,” adding that he has received a U.S. Patent for the contiguous sound chambers resulting from the hollowed-out body cavity. As for what the chambered aluminum body offers in terms of tone? “I would say clarity, accuracy, distinctiveness,” Ostosh says. “There’s no absorption. I would compare it to a xylophone versus a marimba: wood key verses metal key. When I was younger I played in a marching band, and you could hear the guy with the glockenspiel over the other 120 instruments. That’s the sound of metal.” Continuing the non-wood theme, the Luma S boasts a Moses Graphite neck and fretboard, while the pickguard is CNC-machined aluminum-alloy finished on this example in a blue-tinted polyurethane clear coat. Other features include a trio of Nordstrand NVS pickups (“their most basic duplication of the Stratocaster single-coils,” Ostosh says), a Super-Vee BladeRunner bridge, Sperzel Trim-Lok tuners, a Graph Tech Tusq nut, one master volume and two tone knobs, and a three-way selector switch. The guitar shown here boasts a stunning basic polish finish, though, Ostosh says, “We can put any finish on the aluminum. We’re experimenting with direct-embed coating, automotive paint, and laser etching. We can do things that are impossible with wood.” That customization applies to every facet of an Ozztosh instrument, from pickup and pickguard options to guitar necks, which Ostosh recently began crafting from the same billet aluminum used for his bodies. As for whether he believes tonewood purists will find his aluminum instruments appealing, Ostosh acknowledges that he is fighting traditionalists. “But when people hear the guitar first, they don’t know it’s metal until they pick it up, because the tonality, richness, and clarity are so incredible.” And in some areas, he continues, aluminum is clearly superior to wood. “Sustain, for one—it’s just incredible,” Ostosh says. “And stability—we send these things cross-country by FedEx, and when they’re picked up on the other end they’re still in tune. They’re rigid and they’re not affected by humidity. They’re ready to go at all times.” Ostosh is just getting started in his new career—at present he has built roughly 15 Ozztosh guitars in three different models—the Luma S, the Luma T (similar in shape to a Telecaster), and the Luma P-Bass. But he believes his guitar-building days will be somewhat limited, due to a degenerative eye disease that will eventually compromise his vision. “My plan is to get these designs out of my head, onto the computer, and into reality,” he says. To that end, he’s currently working on a new design. “I’m developing an amp head chassis,” he announces. “It’ll be billet aluminum, shiny on the outside, and will absorb the heat from the tube. Hopefully we’ll have that for the NAMM show next year. That’s the next super-project to come.” LIST PRICE: $5,995 Ozztosh Luma Guitars, ozztosh.com Want to read more from this issue?

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Ariane 5 sets new record via the lofting of Intelsat pair August 24, 2016 by Chris Bergin Arianespace successfully launched its fourth Ariane 5 mission of the year with the deployment of two more telecommunication satellites from the European Spaceport in Kourou on Thursday. The launch of Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 marked the heaviest launch to date for the European workhorse, with liftoff in the middle of the launch window at 22:17 UTC. Ariane 5 Launch: The Ariane 5 ECA (Cryogenic Evolution type A) – the most powerful version in the Ariane 5 range of rockets – was employed once again for this flight, a vehicle that is an improved version of the generic Ariane 5 launcher. Those improvements relate mainly to the structure of the Ariane 5, allowing for an increased thrust and ability to carry heavier payloads into orbit. See Also UPDATES Ariane 5 Dual Launch 65 Launch Vehicle Manuals (L2) Click here to Join L2 Designed to place payloads weighing up to 9.6 tonnes into GTO, this increased capacity allows the Ariane 5 ECA to handle dual launches of very large satellites. Given Arianespace now enjoys a full family of launch vehicles. With the introduction of Soyuz at the Spaceport in 2011, Arianespace’s family was joined by the lightweight Vega vehicle, following her successful debut in 2012. Arianespace will also be at the center of a new launch vehicle, the Ariane 6, which has been approved by the ESA members. This latest mission was designated Flight VA232 in Arianespace’s launcher family numbering system and was the 231st Ariane mission since this series of vehicles entered operation in 1979. T-0 targetted the start of a 45-minute launch window at the Ariane Launch Complex No. 3 (ELA 3). However, a boat in the range delayed the T-0 to the middle of the window. The Ariane 5 mission had a total payload lift performance of 10,735 kg – which is a new record upmass number for an Ariane 5 mission to Geostationary Transfer orbit – by 5 kg. This total included the two Intelsat satellites, as well as the launcher’s SYLDA dual-payload deployment system and the protective payload fairing. The launch profile for the Ariane 5 began with lift off around seven seconds after the ignition of the main stage cryogenic engine at T-0, with the two solid-propellant boosters ignited, enabling liftoff. The launcher first climbed vertically for 6 seconds, then rotated towards the East. It maintained an attitude that ensured the axis of the launcher remained parallel to its velocity vector, in order to minimize aerodynamic loads throughout the entire atmospheric phase, until the solid boosters are jettisoned. The fairing protecting the payload was jettisoned at T+200 seconds. Once this first part of the flight was completed, the onboard computers optimized the trajectory in real time, minimizing propellant consumption to bring the launcher first to the intermediate orbit targeted at the end of the main stage propulsion phase, and then the final orbit at the end of the flight of the cryogenic upper stage. The main stage splashed down off the coast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean (in the Gulf of Guinea). At orbital injection, the launcher will have attained a velocity of approximately 9,365 meters/second, and was at an altitude of 640 kilometers. Riding as the upper passenger in Ariane 5’s payload arrangement was Intelsat 33e. It was released approximately 28 minutes into the mission. The spacecraft was built by Boeing using a 702MP platform, and will operate from an orbital position of 60 deg. With an estimated liftoff mass of 6,600 kg, this bird was the 52nd satellite built by Boeing (or its predecessors) to be launched by Arianespace. Intelsat 33e is the second satellite in Intelsat’s next-generation, high-throughput Intelsat EpicNG series, joining Intelsat 29e – which was successfully lofted on an Ariane 5 mission performed in January. Once in orbit, Intelsat 33e will meet the broadband demand for carrier-grade telecom services, enterprise networks, aeronautical connectivity and media services. Sporting 20 C-band and 249 Ku-band transponders (36 MHz equivalent) and a 450 MHz Ka-band, the satellite is expected to serve in orbit for 15 years. The second passenger was also an Intelsat bird, marking what is now a 30-year association between Arianespace and the satellite company. In total, Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 were the 57th and 58th Intelsat satellites to be lofted by Arianespace, continuing a relationship that started with Intelsat 507’s launch in October 1983. Deployed from Ariane 5’s lower passenger position, Intelsat 36 was built by SSL (Space Systems/Loral) on a 1300 platform in Palo Alto, California. It was the 56th satellite using an SSL platform (and 50th with the 1300 configuration) to be launched by Arianespace. Set to serve for 15 years, the satellite includes 34 Ku-band transponders and 10 C-band transponders. The Ku-band payload was built to support MultiChoice, the leading direct-to-home platform in South Africa. The C-band payload spot beams cover high traffic telecom centers in Europe, Central Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia; and a C-band wide beam provides coverage over sub-Saharan Africa for data and media services. With a liftoff mass of around 3,253 kg, Intelsat 36 has a role in enhancing Intelsat’s media neighborhoods serving the South African and Indian Ocean region when starting operations from its 68.5 deg. East orbital position – where the satellite will be co-located with Intelsat 20, which was launched by Arianespace in August 2012. The satellite’s separation occurred approximately 41 minutes after liftoff – completing the Ariane 5 mission. “I would like to thank and congratulate the teams at Intelsat, Arianespace, and SSL who contributed to the successful launch of Intelsat 36,” said John Celli, president of SSL. “We are pleased to hear that the satellite, which is the second that we have delivered for Intelsat this year, is functioning according to plan.” (Images via Arianespace and Intelsat).

While 3D printing can be an appropriate solution for some problems, it isn’t for all of them, since manufacturers who need large parts can’t always make them with current 3D printing methods. Stratasys is looking to change that, demonstrating a new “infinite-build” system that could change the way various industries use 3D printing. Stratasys announced today that it’s Infinite-Build 3D Simulator will be showing off next-generation 3D printing techniques. Not a whole lot has changed, save for one major detail: Stratasys says this system takes traditional 3D printing and flips its side, giving manufacturers a vertical plane with which to craft larger items. With that in mind, it isn’t much of a surprise that companies like Boeing and Ford have shown interest in testing the system. Boeing is exploring if this system would be a good fit for producing low volume, lightweight parts for its planes, while Ford says it’s interested in seeing if the Stratasys Infinite-Build system is capable of producing larger-scale, automotive-grade parts, which wasn’t possible before due to the size of the some of the parts Ford was looking to produce. Assuming Stratasys’ partners can benefit from the application of this Infinite-Build system, this has some pretty exciting implications for the future of additive manufacturing, as companies will be able to make lightweight parts on demand and drop the cost of production in the process. Stratasys says it will have more details on this system in the coming months, so stay tuned.

When Pope Francis visited the U.S. Congress in September 2015, he boldly posed a moral challenge to his American hosts, asking: "Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society?" "Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money," he solemnly concluded. "Money that is drenched in blood." In this case, it's innocent Yemeni blood. During his almost eight years in office, President Obama has approved a jaw-dropping, record-breaking $110 billion in weapons sales to the repressive Saudi regime, all with Congressional backing. "In the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and stop the arms trade," Pope Francis said. Our lawmakers have failed miserably at heeding the Pope's call. Manufacturers such as Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and McDonnell Douglas have been pushing these sales to offset military spending cuts in the United States and Europe. These weapons manufacturers spend millions on lobbying, filling the campaign coffers of both Republicans and Democrats. - Advertisement - In addition to that lobbying power, U.S. officials were pressured to placate Saudi Arabia after the Obama administration made a deal with its adversary, Iran. That appeasement came in the form of a level and quality of arms exports that should've never been approved for a repressive regime with an atrocious human rights record. Saudi Arabia is the number one exporter of radical Islamic extremism on the planet. Fifteen of the 19 Sep. 11 hijackers were radicalized Saudi citizens. The regime oppresses religious minorities, women, LGBT people, and dissidents, while dozens of non-violent participants in their own Arab Spring protests face execution, usually by beheading. The Pentagon says that providing the Saudis with F-15s bombers, Apache helicopters, armored vehicles, missiles, and bombs supports Saudi Arabian defense missions and helps promote stability in the region. But since March 2015, the Saudis have being using these weapons offensively to intervene in neighboring Yemen. Their relentless onslaught has killed thousands of innocent civilians, decimated Yemen's infrastructure, and left more than 21 million people -- that's four out of five Yemenis -- desperately in need of humanitarian assistance. The United Nations has said that Saudi air strikes on civilian targets likely constitute war crimes and calls the situation in Yemen a "catastrophe." Despite this carnage, the Obama administration just announced an additional $1.15 billion in Saudi weapons sales. - Advertisement - In the week following that announcement, the Saudis bombed a Yemeni potato chip factory, a school, a residential neighborhood, and a Doctors Without Borders-run hospital. Most of the dead and wounded were women and children. But it's not too late for Congress to stop this madness. By law, they have 30 days after arms sales are announced to stop or modify the deals. And despite the overall apathetic response to the crisis in Yemen, not all members of Congress are turning a blind eye to the violence.

The airline posted a record profit of $1.52 billion in the year ended June 2016, and now it may be looking to add to its current order for eight 787 Dreamliners from Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). Qantas is scheduled to take delivery of its first Dreamliner late next year. Airline CEO Alan Joyce told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that the company would like to exercise its options and purchase rights for an additional 45 of the planes, but it depends: I’d like to order all of them if I can make a good return out of them. This aircraft’s technology is going to change the game for Qantas. The change will come at the expense of Airbus. Qantas currently flies 12 of the company’s A380 superjumbo jets, but recently deferred an order for eight more. Joyce said that Qantas likes the 12 A380s it has, but the airline does not see a need for any more. While that is good news for Boeing, the company also took a bit of hit on Monday when India’s Jet Airways asked the company to delay delivery of 10 787s from 2017 to 2019. The airline placed the order for the new planes in 2006, according to a report at the Puget Sound Business Journal. Jet plans to replace the 787s with 10 Boeing 777s that it has leased to Turkish Airlines and Etihad that will be coming off lease in the same time frame. The leases were made when the price of jet fuel was much higher than it is today, and the Indian airline believes that it can operate the older planes profitably in the current fuel price environment. The deferral is not expected to affect Boeing’s 12-per-month production of the 787, but it may have some impact on the company’s wavering plan to jump that number to 14 per month next year. As of mid-August, the aircraft maker has booked just 20% of the wide-body orders it had forecast for 2016.

The machines represent the next step in large-scale 3D printing for manufacturing, which experts say will completely change the field in the next decade.

The Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator and the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator expand the company's Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology across manufacturing to more efficiently build bigger, stronger, higher-quality parts. Stratasys also partnered with Boeing to define the requirements and specifications for the Infinite-Build to meet their needs for customized flight parts. Ford Motor Company is also exploring the machine's abilities for car manufacturing, Stratasys announced. Both the aerospace and automobile industries face pressure to continue to innovate and evolve—not only in performance, but in time to market, said Scott Sevcik, director of manufacturing platform development at Stratasys. Industry leaders are considering how to gain a competitive edge by offering a more differentiated passenger experience, whether in flight or on the road. SEE: 3D printing: The smart person's guide "These industries are looking strongly toward 3D printing as a critical enabler to meet those needs going forward," Sevcik said. "It offers the freedom of design, to be able to create parts that you could not make before with traditional processes." The new machines further Stratasys' efforts in large-scale manufacturing with 3D printing. In June, the company announced a partnership with Toyota division Daihatsu, offering 10 different 3D printed designs and patterns that owners can customize for the Copen two-door convertible. While 3D printing has been used on a small scale for race car parts in the past, these projects represent the industry's first move into more mainstream auto manufacturing. Rise of 3D printing manufacturing The adoption of industrial 3D printing continues to grow, with global spending on printers reaching nearly $11 billion in 2015. Spending is predicted to rise to about $27 billion by 2019, according to International Data Corporation. About two-thirds of US manufacturers are currently adopting 3D printing in some way, an April PricewaterhouseCoopers report found—roughly the same number as did in 2014. However, 51% are using it for prototyping and final products, compared to 35% two years ago. And, 52% of manufacturers expect 3D printing to be used for high-volume production in the next 3-5 years, compared to 38% in 2014. "3D printing is going to lead to as much change in manufacturing as the Industrial Revolution did over the last 300 years," said Rick Smith, co-founder and CEO of Fast Radius, an on-demand manufacturing company backed by UPS. "For a larger and larger percentage of manufacturers, it makes sense to open up the full range of complexity, and to produce in smaller, customized batches." At the same time, cost will drop and quality will rise, making it even more appealing for mass market production, Smith added. 3D printing is starting to disrupt two main areas of manufacturing, Smith said. The first is complexity: These machines can design parts with any geometry that cannot be made in any other way. This allows for part consolidation, which reduces weight. The second disruption is in the supply chain: The ability to print customizable parts on demand enables zero inventory. "You can shift from mass production followed by mass warehousing to on demand production in smaller quantities with customization," Smith said. With more major companies investing in this technology, we can expect to see a dramatic acceleration of 3D printing adoption in industrial production in the next year, Smith said, and a complete change in production cycles in the next five to 10 years. Large, customizable parts Aerospace was one of the leading early adopters of 3D printing in manufacturing, due to the technology's ability to increase performance outcomes and reduce weight, Smith said. Now, many of the applications from the aerospace industry are bleeding into the automotive industry, where weight reduction and performance outcomes are also significant concerns. The new Stratasys Infinite-Build produces large, customizable tools and production parts designed for accuracy, repeatability, and speed. "We're really going after the ability to do large, lightweight, thermoplastic parts with better mechanical processes on a repeatable basis," Sevcik said. Applications include customized interior panels for aircrafts and dashboards for cars. The machine literally flips FDM on its side, allowing you to 3D print on a vertical plane instead of horizontally, without size limits. It also operates at a speed 10 times faster than previously possible, Sevcik said. It can change in and out different types of material, with process control embedded in the system. Meanwhile, the Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator enables automation of high-value composite parts for the aerospace and automotive industries, but also for industries such as sporting goods. The machine includes an 8-axis motion system, which uses precise, directional material placement to build strength while reducing or eliminating support strategies—rare for this type of manufacturing, Sevcik said. This machine is aimed at increasing the growth of composite parts, making them lighter and more fuel efficient. Stratasys partnered with Siemens to integrate extrusion technology with Siemens Industry Motion Control and Siemens PLM Software, hoping to ease the labor-intensive processes and remove size limitations for composite part creation. "The ability to print on demand where you need it, when you need it, is a major driver for these industries and how they look at 3D printing," Sevcik said. Both printers and other tools will be on display at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago from September 12-14, 2016. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers On Wednesday, Stratasys announced two new 3D printers to be used for manufacturing in the aerospace and automotive industries, with Boeing and Ford testing applications for them. 3D printing's use in industrial manufacturing continues to grow, as about two-thirds of US manufacturers are currently adopting 3D printing in some way, with more than half using it for prototyping and final products this year. New 3D printing machines can reduce the weight and increase the performance of parts for planes and cars by consolidating composite parts. Stay up to date on all 3D printing news.

(NASA) After 15 years as a pure research lab, the International Space Station (ISS) might be ready for business. NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in U.S. efforts to create a marketplace in space. NASA posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it has become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues.” “Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability.” The International Space Station.

(NASA) NASA also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavors 250 miles above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an email. In its RFI, NASA stressed that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. NASA received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, said in an email. Orbital ATK Inc., which has a NASA contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it submitted information, which it declined to reveal. The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr., president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former NASA astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a test bed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support NASA’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies, declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since NASA agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020. During an almost six-hour spacewalk Aug. 19, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, U.S.-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of interest to NASA might be how to minimize the harmful effects of space on the human body – from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure – as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-Earth, President Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science … of trying things out in microgravity.” One analog to this type of exercise is the “CubeSat” initiative, in which NASA allows schools and nonprofits to conduct research in space. These nanosatellites, about 4 inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving NASA access to the research. To date, the agency has chosen 119 CubeSat missions, with 46 launched and 29 scheduled within 12 months. NASA opened its latest round of submissions earlier this month.

Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Jonathan Timm Aug 24, 2016 Business Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Earlier this year, at the encouragement of President Obama, the Department of Labor finalized the most significant update to the federal rules on overtime in decades. The new rules will more than double the salary threshold for guaranteed overtime pay, from about $23,000 to $47,476. Once the rules go into effect this December, millions of employees who make less than that will be guaranteed overtime pay under the law when they work more than 40 hours a week. Unsurprisingly, some business lobbies and conservatives disparaged the rule as unduly burdensome. But pushback also came from what might have been an unexpected source: a progressive nonprofit called the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). “Doubling the minimum salary to $47,476 is especially unrealistic for non-profit, cause-oriented organizations,” U.S. PIRG said in a statement. “[T]o cover higher staffing costs forced upon us under the rule, we will be forced to hire fewer staff and limit the hours those staff can work—all while the well-funded special interests that we're up against will simply spend more.” Though many nonprofits supported the new overtime rules, PIRG was not alone. (U.S. PIRG declined multiple interview requests for this article.) Over 290,000 comments were posted to Regulations.gov, many of them from nonprofits taking issue with the rule, including Habitat for Humanity, the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, and the YMCA of the USA. These responses expose a gap between the values that many nonprofits hold and the way they treat their own staffs. There’s no doubt that nonprofits today face serious financial difficulties and constraints, but do they have no choice but to demand long, unpaid hours of their employees? Putting questions of fairness aside, is their treatment of their workers limiting their effectiveness? * * * The answers have a lot to do with how nonprofits survive in an economy that’s geared primarily toward profit. Many nonprofit organizations stare down a shared set of challenges: In a 2013 report, the Urban Institute surveyed over 4,000 nonprofits of a wide range of types and sizes across the continental U.S. It found that all kinds of nonprofits struggled with delays in payment for contracts, difficulty securing funding for the full cost of their services, and other financial issues. Recent years have been especially hard for many nonprofits. Most have annual budgets of less than $1 million, and those budgets took a big hit from the recession, when federal, municipal, and philanthropic funding dried up. On top of that, because so many nonprofits depend on government money, policy changes can cause funding priorities to change, which in turn can put nonprofits in a bind. Heather Iliff, the president and CEO of an association called Maryland Nonprofits, says that she has seen a number of funders suddenly shift the requirements of their funding in response to a new trend, leaving organizations scrambling to adapt. “On the one hand it’s positive that the government is trying to look at what works and fund what works, but they tend to be categorical and abrupt in their shifts, without providing the necessary transitional supports,” Iliff says. Iliff has seen that scramble to meet funding demands lead to bizarre and unproductive decisions. An employee of one agency that serves adults with significant developmental disabilities told her that its funders recently ordered it to provide clients with a number of hours “in the community,” as opposed to time spent on the in-house services it normally would have administered. But the funders did not provide guidance on how to do that, and the agency’s best option was to bus disabled adults to a mall’s food court just to satisfy the new requirement. All of this is particularly difficult for human-services nonprofits that survive mostly on Medicaid funding. Homeless shelters, for example, don’t charge for their services, and thus can’t raise prices when their funding is cut. (These types of agencies have a longer period to adjust to the new overtime rules.) And when faced with funding cuts, many nonprofits have no place to turn but their own payrolls. The pressure from funders to tighten budgets and cut costs can produce what researchers call the “nonprofit starvation cycle.” The cycle starts with funders’ unrealistic expectations about the costs of running a nonprofit. In response, nonprofits try to spend less on overhead (like salaries) and under-report expenses to try to meet those unrealistic expectations. That response then reinforces the unrealistic expectations that began the cycle. In this light, it’s no surprise that so many nonprofits have come to rely on unpaid work. Strangely, though nonprofits are increasingly expected to perform like businesses, they do not get the same leeway in funding that government-contracted businesses do. They don’t have nearly the bargaining power of big corporations, or the ability to raise costs for their products and services, because of tight controls on grant funding. “D.C. is full of millionaires who contract with government in the defense field, and they make a killing, and yet if you’re a nonprofit, chances are you aren’t getting the full amount of funding to cover the cost of the services required,” Iliff said. “Can you imagine Lockheed Martin or Boeing putting up with a government contract that didn’t allow for overhead?” * * * When faced with dwindling funding, one response would be to cut a program or reduce the number of people an organization serves. But nonprofit leaders have shown themselves very reluctant to do that. Instead, many meet financial challenges by squeezing more work out of their staffs without a proportional increase in their pay: The Urban Institute report found that most nonprofits choose to cut salaries, benefits, and other costs long before scaling back their operations. “There is this feeling that the mission is so important that nothing should get in the way of it,” Elizabeth Boris, one of the Urban Institute report’s authors, says. The nonprofits that opposed the new rules expressed as much in the comments they submitted on Regulations.gov. One nonprofit’s human-resources director said the rule would result in “fewer services being effectively delivered to the population we serve, not to mention the deep financial impact that it will have on our agency to try to fund overtime at that level.” Said another, “Any increase in funds that have to go to salaries will cause a decrease in funds available to assist the elderly, which will result in causing them additional hardships.” “As a manager of a non-profit organization, this proposed rule would make it very clear in deciding whether it would be financially possible to find a way to stay in business,” one comment on the rule read. “The answer is no.” These nonprofit employees are saying that their operations depend on large numbers of their lowest-paid staff working unpaid overtime hours. One way to get  to that point would be to face a series of choices between increased productivity on the one hand and reduced hours, increased pay, or more hiring on the other, and to choose more productivity every time. That some nonprofits have done this speaks to a culture that can put the needs of staff behind mission-driven ambitions. A number of forces much larger than any single nonprofit have allowed the present situation to take shape. In the 1970s, 62 percent of full-time, salaried workers qualified for mandatory overtime pay when they worked more than 40 hours in a week. Today, because the overtime rules have not had a major update since then (until this one), only 7 percent of workers are covered, whether they work in the nonprofit sector or elsewhere. In other words, U.S. organizations—nonprofit or otherwise—have been given the gift of a large pool of laborers who, as long as they clear a relatively low earnings threshold and do tasks that meet certain criteria, do not have to be paid overtime. Unsurprisingly, many nonprofits have taken advantage of that pool of free work. (For-profit companies have too, but they also have the benefit of being more in control of their revenue streams.) Boris says that nonprofits like PIRG, for example, have a tradition of forcing employees to work long, unpaid hours—especially their youngest staff. “There’s a culture that says, ‘Young people are paying their dues. It’s okay for them to be paid for fewer hours than they’re actually working because it’s in the effort of helping them grow up and contribute to something greater than they are,’” Boris says. Mary Beth Hastings, who has more than 20 years of experience working in the world of global-health organizations, has witnessed this in a variety of workplaces throughout her career. “Too often, I have seen the passion for social change turned into a weapon against the very people who do much—if not most—of the hard work, and put in most of the hours,” Hastings recently wrote on her blog. “Because they are highly motivated by passion, the reasoning goes, they don’t need to be motivated by decent salaries or sustainable work hours or overtime pay.” But they probably do. A 2011 survey of more than 2,000 nonprofit employees by Opportunity Knocks, a human-resources organization that specializes in nonprofits, in partnership with Jessica Word, an associate professor of public administration at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, found that half of employees in the nonprofit sector may be burned out or in danger of burnout. The survey had some methodological limitations—its sample wasn’t as representative as the researchers would’ve hoped—but Word told me that she believes employees at nonprofits are uniquely stretched. “These are highly emotional and difficult jobs,” she said, adding, “These organizations often have very high rates of employee turnover, which results from a combination of burnout and low compensation.” Despite the dearth of research, Word’s findings don’t appear to be unusual: A more recent study of nonprofits in the U.S. and Canada found that turnover, one possible indicator of burnout, is higher in nonprofits than in the overall labor market. Yet for all their hours and emotional labor, nonprofit employees generally don’t make much money. A 2014 study by Third Sector New England, a resource center for nonprofits, found that 43 percent of nonprofit employees in New England were making less than $28,000 per year—far less than a living wage for families with children in most cities in the United States, and well below the national median income of between $40,000 and $50,000 per year. (For comparison, about a quarter of American workers earn less than $28,000 per year.) Until the new overtime rules kick in, many of those workers could be working extra hours without any extra pay. Why would nonprofit workers be willing to stay in jobs where they are underpaid, or, in some cases, accept working conditions that violate the spirit of the labor laws that protect them? One plausible reason is that they are just as committed to the cause as their superiors, whose decision-making can prioritize an organization’s values above all else. Another possible explanation is that because the job market is so difficult, they have no better options. But it also might be that some nonprofits exploit gray areas in the law to cut costs. For instance, only workers who are labelled as managers are supposed to be exempt from overtime, but many employers stretch the definition of “manager” far beyond its original intent. Low-paid workers who do not have executive decision-making power and do not manage a staff, according to the Department of Labor’s criteria, shouldn’t be classified as exempt, but some employers put them in positions that are nominally managerial to escape overtime regulations. And even regardless of these designations, the emotionally demanding work at many nonprofits is sometimes difficult to shoehorn into a tidy 40-hours-a-week schedule. Consider Elle Roberts, who was considered exempt from overtime restrictions and was told not to work more than 40 hours a week when, as a young college grad, she worked at a domestic-violence shelter in northwest Indiana. Doing everything from home visits to intake at the shelter, Roberts still ignored her employer’s dictates and regularly worked well more than 40 hours a week providing relief for women in crisis. Yet she was not paid for that extra time. Roberts once responded to a call from a woman who needed help escaping her apartment while her attacker was out. When Roberts arrived, the battered woman clung to her and asked her to listen to a recording of the sounds of fighting and of the woman screaming and crying. Roberts joined her in prayer, helped her move her things to a new apartment, went back to the agency, locked herself in the bathroom, and sobbed. On days like that, Roberts wanted to get therapy, but knew that she couldn’t afford it. “If I had gotten paid for all the hours I was working, even at my base rate, I would have jumped at the opportunity to seek care to make sense of what I’ve experienced on the job,” Roberts says. “But I wasn’t making enough to pay for anything more than my basic needs.” When reached by phone, Roberts’s former employer said that staff are not allowed to work overtime, but that they do work extra hours voluntarily without recording the time, such as for self-directed study on how to better serve clients. When hours run long due to travel or other circumstances, the employer said, staff can adjust their hours for the rest of the week to make up the difference. But according to Roberts, this would have meant asking for schedule changes almost every week, which would not have been acceptable in the organization's culture. “The unspoken expectation is that you do whatever it takes to get whatever it is done for the people that you’re serving,” she says. “And anything less than that, you’re not quite doing enough.” It isn’t clear how common Roberts’s experience is. The Department of Labor bases its enforcement actions on complaints, which makes it hard to track violations, says Catherine Ruckelshaus, the general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy organization. With the difficulty of the job market, the decline of unions, and the culture of self-sacrifice in nonprofit work, very few employees are willing to come forward to file a complaint against their employer. This means that there’s no way to know how many nonprofit employees are working long, unpaid overtime hours when they shouldn’t be. Still, Ruckelshaus says, “Nonprofit workers have more protection than they think or than even perhaps their employers think. But because the law isn’t crystal clear … there’s a gray area and that’s been exploited by some of these nonprofits and that’s created a culture where workers don’t think they’re covered.” * * * It’s certainly the case that nonprofits face considerable challenges, but it doesn’t seem like every organization is making a good-faith effort to do right by their employees when they decide how to respond to those challenges. And, setting aside the issue of fair pay, many wonder whether getting the most work out of staff for the least possible cost is efficient or sustainable. Work-life balance is particularly relevant when employees’ work is emotionally taxing and poorly rewarded, and turnover for any organization is notoriously costly. Nonprofits that don’t take this seriously may be shooting themselves in the foot. Mary Beth Hastings suggests that if nonprofits truly care about the well-being of their staffs, one easy place to start is simply to write higher salaries into budget proposals. Likewise, government and philanthropic funders could be a lot wiser in how they dole out money: Scarce public-service dollars can impose a state of financial stress on the people who put them to use. Indeed, many nonprofits have come out in support of the new overtime rules, even while acknowledging the challenges of following them. Stuart Mitchell, the CEO of a human-services nonprofit called PathStone, wrote in an op-ed that “paying a livable wage is the right thing to do not only for our deeply committed employees, but also for the participants that rely on our services.” And representatives of 150 social-justice organizations signed a letter stating their support for the new rules, writing, “It is time to revisit the idea that working for the public good should somehow mean requiring the lowest-paid among us to support these efforts by working long hours, many of which are unpaid.” More broadly, the Human Services Council of New York argues that the sector should call on the government to expand funding for nonprofits to maintain their level of services with increased pay. However they do that, nonprofits would be better off if they could act with efficiency as a goal, but not the only one.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What's Really Going On in North Carolina's Gubernatorial Race? David A. Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey.

Toggle navigation    Home Pakistan Islamabad Punjab Sindh Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Balochistan Gilgit Bultistan Azad Jammu & Kashmir World Business Sport Life & Style Opinion Blogs Features Today's Paper E-PAPER Archives F-16’s manufacturing in India to affect Pakistan’s aerial defence By: agencies 24-Aug-16 Top News LPG distributors to protest against police today   23-Nov-16 196     LAHORE: Eminent speakers urge govt to invest on education, R&D 23-Nov-16 227 LAHORE: The 14th National Symp ... WASHINGTON: An American global security and aerospace company's offer to shift all of its F-16 manufacturing to India could give New Delhi partial control, along with the US, over which countries are able to purchase the jets and spare, according to a media report. The report by Bloomberg News comes as a Congressional report showed a 73 percent decline in US aid to Pakistan since 2011 due to deterioration of Pakistan-US ties following the killing of Osama bin Laden in a commando raid in Abbottabad. Bloomberg News said Lockheed Martin Corp’s proposal to make India hub for F-16s "comes with an added benefit for Prime Minister Narendra Modi: A strategic win against nuclear rival Pakistan."  Such a move may allow India to choke off key supplies to Pakistan, which has relied on F-16s as its main aerial defence for decades. “Some components may be produced only in India," Abhay Paranjape, Director of Business Development at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, was quoted as stating while talking about the company’s F-16 proposal. Asked whether Pakistan would still be able to source F-16 jets or parts elsewhere under the arrangement, Paranjape said questions about foreign military sales policies should be referred to the US government. Roger Cabiness, a spokesman for the US Department of Defense, in turn referred questions on the sale of F-16 spare parts to Lockheed, Bloomberg News said. The strategic element is a key selling point as Lockheed pushes to win an order that may exceed 100 fighter jets, part of Modi’s plan to spend $150 billion on the armed forces and create jobs under his “Make-in-India" policy, the report said. A deal would breathe new life into the F-16, an older model than the stealth F-35 warplane, and further boost US-India defense ties at the expense of Pakistan, it said. “What we are doing is putting India as the center of the supply base," Randall Howard, Lockheed Martin’s aeronautics business development director, said on Aug. 4 in New Delhi. “Today, there is no potential Pakistan sale." Amid deteriorating Islamabad-Washington ties in recent years, Congress in May refused to give subsidies for Pakistan to buy new F-16s, prompting it to consider buying used ones from Jordan instead. The US this month withheld another $300 million in military aid to Pakistan over its alleged failure to take action against terrorists carrying out attacks on American troops in neighboring Afghanistan. Nafees Zakaria, a spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Office, declined to answer questions about Lockheed Martin’s F-16 proposal, as did Nungsanglemba Ao, a spokesman for India’s Defence Ministry, according to the report. The company’s overtures to India will prompt Pakistan to look more to China and Russia for military hardware, Najam Rafique, Director at Islamabad’s Institute of Strategic Studies, was cited as stating by Bloomberg News. “Pakistan is diversifying its options," he said. Competition for the India jet order is fierce, the report noted.  Lockheed Martin’s rivals such as Boeing Co. and Saab AB are all offering to shift some production to India as part of their bids to replenish India’s aging fleet. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade, it said. Modi last year scaled back an earlier deal with Dassault Aviation SA, opting to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets off the shelf instead of building 126 in India after negotiations hit repeated delays. That effort has since stalled over price, providing an opportunity to other jet-makers to step in. It’s unclear when a decision will be made. Lockheed’s proposal attempts to turn its greatest weakness - the fact that Pakistan also flies F-16s - into a main reason for India to acquire the jet, according to the report. “Since India would house the only existing production line, it would be able to deny Pakistan any further platforms or also have influence on Pakistan Air Force logistics," Pushan Das, who follows military modernisation at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi, was quoted as stating. Lockheed Martin, which is winding down F-16 production in the US, has successfully sold the jet for decades. The proposed facility in India would provide much-needed highly skilled jobs as Modi heads into several important State-level elections in 2017, Bloomberg News said. “We are not looking at just assembling India’s F-16 here," Lockheed Martin’s Paranjape said. “We are looking at establishing a complete manufacturing base ecosystem." The report said it was still unclear which firm will win India’s lucrative fighter jet contract, citing some analysts as dismissing the F-16 as a dated “fourth generation" platform opposed by the Indian Air Force because it won’t have major upgrades in the future. Others like Georgetown University associate professor C. Christine Fair have suggested New Delhi is unlikely to get a more advanced fighter jet made in India because of difficulties with transferring state-of-the-art technology. While many obstacles remain, an agreement with Lockheed Martin would cement closer ties between the nations if the US government doesn’t prevent the transfer of advanced radar or avionics technologies, according to Anit Mukherjee, an Assistant Professor at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If this deal was to happen - and that’s a big if - then it will be a big plus for US-India relations and a significant indicator of the transformation in the defence relationship," he said. “If this deal goes through, and the US is honest about tech transfer, then it has the potential to really build up India’s military-industrial base." Meanwhile, the report about heavy decline in US security assistance to Pakistan since 2011, was prepared for the US Congress by the Congressional Research Service (CRS). It covers both military and economic assistance given between 2002 and 2015 as well as those earmarked for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. It also shows a 53 percent decrease in economic assistance since 2011. Security aid fell 73 percent from nearly $1.3 billion in 2011 to $343 million in 2015. Economic aid declined from nearly $1.2 billion in 2011 to $ 561 million in 2015, the report said. The cancelled $ 300 million payments were in the form of Coalition Support Fund (CSF) under which Pakistan has received over $14 billion since 2002. The CSF accounted for “as much as one-fifth of Pakistan’s total military expenditures” from 2002 to 2014, said the CRS, a US government news and analysis service for Congress. The CSF is meant to reimburse US-allied nations “for their operational and logistical support of US-led counterterrorism operations”. The CRS data shows that CSF accounts for 43 per cent of $ 32.2 billion worth of US government financial transfers to Pakistan from 2002 to 2015. Economic aid comprises 33 per cent of transfers at $10.6 billion followed by 24 per cent in security aid at $ 7.6 billion. The CRS report, however, shows that Pakistan has or still is in the process of receiving nearly $1.2 billion worth of weapon systems from the US since 2001. This includes, eight P—3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft worth $ 474 million and 20 AH—1F Cobra attack helicopters at $48 million. Pakistan is also getting mid-life update kits for 60 F—16A/B fighter jets already in its inventory at a cost of $ 892 million, of which the US paid $ 477 million through FMF. Since 2001, Pakistan has paid or is still paying $2.5 billion for US arms. This includes big-ticket items such as $1.43 billion for 18 new F—16C/D Block 52 Fighting Falcon combat aircraft and additional armaments for the aircraft at a cost of $629 million.

A contract to this effect was signed between the government and Boeing. The investment comes after recently released 2016 Defence White Paper confirmed the importance of the New Zealand Defence Force having new capabilities. The latest investment in new defence capabilities will help the country to cope with the realities of a complex and changing strategic environment. With this investment, the New Zealand Defence Force will be able to operate across a broad spectrum of geographic and operating environments. New Zealand Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee said that underwater surveillance capability deters interference with the sea lines of communication that New Zealand and many of its friends rely on for trade purposes. Brownlee further added: “Knowing what is happening underwater is integral to monitoring submarine activity. “This is particularly important in the Asia-Pacific region which is home to two-thirds of the world’s submarines.” The Orion aircraft are expected to retire from service in the mid-2020s. "The Orion aircraft are expected to retire from service in the mid-2020s." A replacement for the old and less reliable Orion aircraft will be chosen as part of Defence on the Future Air Surveillance Capability project. Work under the project to select replacement for Orion has already commenced. Nearly 25% of the value of the contract is being spent with New Zealand businesses Safe Air, Beca and Marops.

Dreamliners as long as the first few aircraft generate a profit, Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said. Australia’s largest carrier is due to receive the first of its eight Dreamliners at the end of 2017, and has options and purchase rights to buy another 45 of the long-range, fuel-efficient aircraft. “I’d like to order all of them if I can make a good return out of them,’’ Joyce said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Wednesday. “This aircraft’s technology is going to change the game for Qantas.’’ The Sydney-based airline’s Jetstar subsidiary already operates 11 787s.

On Wednesday, the carrier reported record profits and announced its first dividend in seven years, helped by the Irishman’s restructuring moves such as retiring old planes and deferring orders for eight A380 superjumbos from Airbus Group SE. Four-Month High Qantas shares jumped as much as 5.3 percent in Sydney to their highest intraday level in more than four months after the carrier reported an 84 percent jump in annual net income. Joyce has reversed losses after cutting thousands of jobs and dropping unprofitable routes as part of a A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) transformation program. The airline is working on the first destination for its 787 and will announce the route at the end of this year. Options include Melbourne-Dallas, Perth-London and Brisbane-Dallas, Joyce said in the interview. Qantas uses the A380 to fly to Dallas from Sydney, a 16-hour journey that is one of the world’s longest commercial flights. The Dreamliner will allow Qantas to bypass many of the traditional airline hubs, Joyce said. Joyce emphasized the importance of making money with the aircraft on an earlier call with reporters. "We have to demonstrate we can make money out of the eight we have,” he said. “Once we’ve done that, we’ll be comfortable in ordering more." With Joyce seeking more 787s, the airline’s fractured relationship with the A380 superjumbo doesn’t look like mending. Joyce reiterated in the interview that Qantas doesn’t need the remaining eight A380s on order. Qantas operates its 12 A380s on routes like Sydney or Melbourne to London via Dubai, and to Hong Kong, Dallas and Los Angeles. “The 12 we have today actually have a very good use," Joyce said. "They operate at big hub airports with slot restrictions. We see a use for 12. We don’t see a use for more than 12. We don’t see a need for those last eight aircraft."

(Bloomberg photo by Andrew Harrer) McDonnell Douglas-made MD-80s are being put out to pasture By Justin Bachman • Bloomberg Aug 23, 2016 (…) Andrew Harrer An American Airlines McDonnnell Douglas MD-80 (N266AA) aircraft takes off at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Va., on Feb. 19, 2010. (Bloomberg photo by Andrew Harrer) As summer draws to a close, American Airlines is hastening the pace at which it sends aged McDonnell Douglas MD-80s to the aircraft boneyard. Five years into a revamp of its fleet, the world's largest carrier on Tuesday will retire 20 MD-80-family aircraft, "one of the largest single-day aircraft retirements in airline history," according to American. "Summer is the busiest time of the year for airlines, and with summer flying winding down, we can go ahead and park these aircraft," the company said in a statement. The planes being sent Tuesday to the Roswell International Air Center in New Mexico are, on average, 28 years old, about five years older than the carrier's overall MD-80 fleet. American plans to retire 45 MD-80s this year, most of them in the third quarter, and be rid of all of them by the end of 2017 as part of a fleet renewal project. Economically, the MD-80 is no match for the newer Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family of aircraft that have replaced it. American, which ordered 460 new Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. jets in 2011, says the 737-800 and A321 jets replacing the MD-80 are 35 percent more fuel efficient on a per-seat basis. Two other U.S. MD-80 operators, Delta Air Lines Inc. and Allegiant Travel Co., both plan to quit the jet in the next few years. The MD-80 is a modernized version of the Douglas DC-9, which gained range and weight capabilities in the DC-9 80, dubbed by McDonnell Douglas as the Super 80 Series. The first Super 80 (a moniker only American chose to retain among U.S. carriers) flew in October 1979. American took its first of the 140-seat jets four years later, and at its peak had nearly 375 of them in service-the largest operator of the almost 1,200 MD-80s sold to airlines across the globe. Later variants added fuel and performance enhancements. The model has enjoyed a strong safety record, with two of the most high-profile MD-80 crashes attributed to human error. In August 2008, a Spanair MD-82 crashed while departing Madrid, killing 154 people, after pilots had incorrectly configured the plane for takeoff. In January 2000, an Alaska Airlines MD-83 crashed off the California coast while trying to divert to Los Angeles. The accident was blamed on improper maintenance, which caused a key horizontal stabilizer component to fail in flight. That crash killed 88. Last year, a Delta Air Lines MD-80 slid off a snowy runway while landing in New York City. No one was injured seriously. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Who's hired?

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Pilots who fly the MD-80 cite the airplane's quirks but praise it for a mix of old-school flight controls and modern technology. Aviation enthusiasts occasionally refer to it as the "mad dog" owing to the MD designation, or even the "angry puppy." "You really earn your pay" flying the MD-80, an American pilot told Bloomberg Businessweek in a 2008 interview.

Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) on Tuesday launched a website offering a “sneak peek” at the design it has prepared with Saab for the so-called T-X training jet that will replace the venerable T-38. Over the weekend, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) and its partners began runway testing of its clean-sheet design to replace the T-38. Boeing first teased its design at the Air Force Association conference in September of last year and is planning to reveal the new plane on September 13 at the company’s defense facilities in St. Louis, just a week before this year’s conference. Boeing’s T-X spokeswoman, Rachelle Lockhart, said of the company’s decision to go with an all-new design: We’re investing in the future of the Air Force, and we saw an opportunity to build something better from inception. We could give the Air Force exactly what it wanted while meeting its requirements and schedule. In addition to the clean-sheet design from Northrop Grumman and its partners, BAE Systems and L-3 Communications Holdings Corp. (NYSE: LLL), as well as Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon Corp. (NYSE: RTN), also are proposing modified versions of existing training jets. Lockheed has teamed up with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and plans to offer a modified KAI T-50. Raytheon is partnering with Italy’s Leonardo (formerly Alenia-Aermacchi) on a modified M-346 training jet built by the Italian firm and designated the T-100. The Air Force released its final draft RFP last month and is expected to have the final document released late this year or early next. That will start the clock running on a one-year evaluation phase, according to Aviation Week. A milestone decision is expected early in fiscal year 2018 and entry into service is currently set for 2024. The initial phase of the contract is worth about $8.4 billion, but the total could run much higher. The Air Force plans to buy 350 of the new planes.

This sixth mission of the year will be launched from the Ariane Launch Complex No. 3 (ELA 3) in Kourou, French Guiana, atop an Ariane 5 booster. The launch window starts at 5:55 p.m. EDT (21:55 GMT) and extends for 45 minutes. The work on the launch started in mid-July with the arrival of the satellites in French Guiana. Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 were shipped to the Guiana Space Centre in late July. Both spacecraft were put through a series of tests including electrical checks verifying command and telemetry systems, as well as electrical propulsion tests, validating the Xenon propulsion system. The engineers also performed bi-propellant tests to make sure that each thruster responds correctly to activation commands, and to prove there were no leaks. With a lifetime of fifteen years, the Intelsat 33e has been built by Boeing and is based on its 702 MP platform. The satellite weighs 6.6 metric tons and measures 7.9 by 3.8 by 3.2 meters. It features two deployable solar wings, each with four panels of ultra-triple-junction gallium arsenide solar cells, capable of generating up to 13 kilowatts of power. Equipped with 20 C-band and 249 Ku-band transponders, Intelsat 33e will be inserted into a geosynchronous orbit inclined 60 degrees East, replacing Intelsat 904. The satellite is designed to deliver carrier-grade telecom, enterprise networks, aeronautical connectivity, and certain media services. This is the second spacecraft in the company’s EpicNG series – a high-performance, next-generation satellite platform that delivers global high-throughput technology. Its Ku-band spot beams are to provide broadband services for Europe, Africa, West Asia, and Asia, while a Ku-band wide beam provides broadcast coverage of Europe, West Asia, and Asia. The satellite’s C-band spot beams will cover high traffic telecommunications centres in Europe, Central Africa, West Asia, Asia, and Australia. When it comes to the C-band wide beam, it is expected to deliver coverage over sub-Saharan Africa for data and media services. Intelsat 36 with a life of over fifteen years was manufactured by Space Systems/Loral (SSL) and is based on the SSL-1300 bus. Weighing about 3.25 metric tons, its dimensions are 17 by 10 by 11 feet (5.2 by 3.1 by 3.4 meters). The spacecraft has two deployable solar arrays that will generate up to 15.8 kilowatts of power. Intelsat 36 is fitted with 34 Ku-band transponders and 10 C-band transponders. Its Ku-band payload will support Intelsat’s MultiChoice direct-to-home service in South Africa, while the C-band payload is expected to provide in-orbit resilience for the video content distribution neighborhood at 68.5 degrees East where the satellite will be co-located in a geosynchronous orbit, together with Intelsat 20. The Intelsat 33e satellite was on 6 August mated with the payload adapter in the S5 payload facility and four days later it was encapsulated in the payload fairing. Intelsat 36 was installed on the payload adapter four days later and its encapsulation took place afterwards with the stack was placed atop the Ariane 5 launcher. The launch rehearsal and final preparations of the booster for the upcoming liftoff were held last week, while the rollout of the rocket to the launch pad was scheduled to be performed one day before the planned blastoff. The final countdown for the liftoff will be commenced 11 hours and 30 minutes ahead of the launch. Designated VA232 in Arianespace’s numbering system, it will see the Ariane 5 rocket fly for about 42 minutes when Intelsat 33e will be released into orbit first nearly 29 minutes after launch, while Intelsat 36 will separate 13 minutes later. According to Intelsat Investor Relations Vice President Dianne J. VanBeber, “We take the next step in establishing our Intelsat EpicNG high-throughput platform with Intelsat 33e, the second in our series of seven planned satellites. We also launch Intelsat 36, which is a fully committed custom payload for an important DTH customer in South Africa,” The Ariane 5 in ECA configuration is the heavy-lift rocket for missions to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) and usually carries two telecommunications satellite payloads. The flight is powered during the initial flight phase by a cryogenic core stage and two solid rocket boosters, followed by the use of a cryogenic upper stage for orbital injection of the payload. The 54.8-meter tall ECA is an improved version of the Ariane 5 launcher, designed to deliver payloads, mainly communications satellites, weighing up to 10 tonnes. Although it has the same general architecture, some significant changes were made to the basic structure of the generic version to increase thrust and enable it to carry heavier payloads. ECA is also used by institutional customers for non-GTO missions; for example, launching ESA’s Herschel and Planck scientific missions in 2008. This will be the 232nd liftoff of an Ariane vehicle from the Kourou Spaceport. It will be the fourth Ariane 5 launch of 2016 (the 87th Ariane 5 launch overall) and the sixth of 12 flights planned this year by Arianespace, utilizing its family of the heavy-lift Ariane 5, the medium-lift Soyuz, and the lightweight Vega. Arianespace’s next launch is scheduled for 16 September when it is expected to send into orbit PeruSat 1 for the Peruvian Armed Forces and four SkySat Earth-observing microsatellites for Skybox Imaging. The mission will be performed by the Vega launcher, lifting off from Kourou. tags Two Intelsat satellitesC and Ku-Band transpondersArianespaceEpicNG seriesDianne J.

Published: 11:17 August 23, 2016 Alexander Cornwell, Staff Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE DUBAI: Nepal Airlines has held informal stake sale talks with a Middle East airline after the Nepalese government mandated it to find a “strategic partner,” its managing director said Monday. The state-owned carrier is in the midst of a turnaround, having recently brought in two Airbus A320 narrow body jets and with plans to bring in two A330 wide-bodies as it phases out out-of-production Boeing 757s. It resumed flights to Dubai from Kathmandu on August 18 after a four-year hiatus and is considering more than doubling its network to 19 destinations. Nepal's government wants the airline to bring in an outside investor to fast track the expansion plan that also includes adding at least one new aircraft a year from 2017. “The government is quite serious,” managing director Sugat Ratna Kansakar told Gulf News following an evening Monday press conference in Dubai. He told Gulf News that executives from a Middle East airline recently visited him in Kathmandu for “informal talks” about purchasing a stake. He declined to provide further details on the airline. Nepal’s government could sell as much as 51 per cent of the airline to Nepalese or foreign investors and retain minority ownership, he said. Majority foreign ownership would not change the airline’s status as Nepal’s flag carrier, he added. Nepal’s government believes an outside investor-led expansion would give the airline a greater share of passenger traffic, of which over 90 per cent of the market is at present controlled by foreign airlines, according to Kansakar.

The company will now lease the currently vacant building that used to house Spacehab, in addition to constructing a new second building once a formal lease is signed. SpaceX’s contract to build should be approved as early as next month, Chief Executive Officer John Murray tells Florida Today. The locations will be used to refurbish and collect first-stage Falcon rockets that have been launched from Cape Canaveral. The company’s first Cape launch in 2015 was a complete disaster, but since then SpaceX has had eight successful missions in 2016 so far. It launched its first Falcon 9 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in June. In March, SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said that recovering first-stage rocket boosters could reduce the cost of the Falcon 9 rocket up to 30 percent. SpaceX already has two launch pads in the area, one at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and one at the Kennedy Space Center. NASA recently invested $32 million in the company’s mission to send one of its capsules to Mars by 2018. However, Space News reported that would only be about 10 percent of the mission’s $320 million cost. Alongside Boeing, SpaceX has also received more than $3 billion from NASA to develop shuttle technology to transport astronauts to the U.S. Space Station. SpaceX isn’t just taking over NASA real estate, it’s increasingly replacing NASA as a leading researcher and producer of space technology. SpaceX will launch its next rocket from the Cape location on Sept. 3. Photos via Getty Images / NASA Elon Musk Says SpaceX Falcon Heavy Is the Most Powerful Rocket in the World: ...

Their booty ranged from $80 to $2,500. The Clintons have done better, much better. The Associated Press found that 85 of 154 private rich folks, more than half, who were granted a meeting with Hillary when she was secretary of state pumped a total of $156 million into the Clinton Foundation. “Reach for the sky, cowpoke!” The AP probe found that 20 of those privileged supplicants gave a million-plus each, and 40 donated more than $100,000. “Don’t anyone move a muscle!” These do not include reps from foreign governments — who gave another $170 million to the fund. “Frisk ’em, Clyde!” By all accounts the Clinton Foundation, run by Bill, does charitable work. But, conveniently, it also polishes the couple’s political image. AP did not find what if anything the 85 donors actually got for buying Hillary’s time. Maybe they gained nothing more than a smile and a handshake. Ha! Yeah, right. If you believe that, I’ve got some swamp in Arkansas to show you ... “Hands where I can see ’em, mister!” If it looks like a scam and smells like a scam, what the hell do you call it? If you’re the Clintons, you call it a charity. This is not their first whiff of corruption or other sordidness. Let me run a few examples by you. Monica Lewinsky, Whitewater, deleted emails, Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Benghazi, Travelgate, Troopergate ... Bill reportedly bedded every beauty queen he could get his hands on (Miss Arkansas 1958 says he was a yawn in the sack). Meanwhile, Hillary attacked any woman who dared accuse her hubby of sexual shenanigans. Worse, while she was secretary of state, Boeing gave the Clinton Foundation $1 million and arranged six-figure speaking gigs for Bill — and, lo and behold, won a $35-billion contract with the U.S. air force. “Hand it over, hombre!” Speaking of hombres, Donald Trump gains most from the Clintons’ corruption. If not for Hillary, Trump’s chances of being president are slim to none. But her monkey business has made her as unpopular as Donald’s mouth has made him. And Trump is no fool. “It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the state department begins,” the Republican nominee said at a rally Tuesday night. “It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office.” Even Clinton’s Democrat supporters concede the optics suck. I still think Trump will beat Hillary Nov. 8, despite the polls. If not, Bonnie and Clyde reclaim the White House. Or the Underwoods? Ever watch House of Cards, the Netflix series? It follows the perverse political path of slimeball President Frank Underwood (played by a drawling Kevin Spacey) and Claire, his icy first lady (a blond Robin Wright). The Underwoods are a ruthless, cynical power couple. The show is brilliant, though far-fetched. You know that politicians commit dastardly deeds to gain power. But, good grief, the Underwoods actually snuff a reporter by shoving her onto subway tracks and use carbon monoxide to eliminate a congressman standing in their way. There are limits, even in politics. But the Underwoods’ other plots and ploys ring true to what we see in real-life politicians, in Ottawa, Washington and any other capital. No one suggests the Clintons are inspiration for the Underwoods. Nor are the original Bonnie and Clyde. But I don’t think the show is based on Abe and Mary Lincoln. mstrobel@postmedia.com Sponsored Links See All Sponsored Links Strobel Bonnie and Clyde of U.S. politics By Mike Strobel, Toronto Sun First posted: Wednesday, August 24, 2016 06:03 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, August 24, 2016 06:14 PM EDT Hillary and Bill are giving Bonnie and Clyde a run for their money. “Stick ’em up!” That’s how Ms Parker and Mr. Barrow greeted bank tellers back in the 1930s.

In 1970, the team moved to Milwaukee and became the Brewers. AP Photo Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email comment Aug 24, 2016 Jim CapleESPN Senior Writer Close Author of "The Devil Wears Pinstripes" and winner of a Sports Emmy. Reported from 17 World Series, 9 Olympics, 6 continents. Follow on Twitter Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email print comment With the Rams rebooting in Los Angeles, ESPN.com presents a series exploring the remnants departed teams have left behind in the cities they abandoned. SEATTLE -- The Seattle Pilots had an official theme song that included the lyrics: "You brought the majors to the evergreen Northwest; now, go, go you Pilots, you're going to be the best!" Sadly, those lyrics should have been: "Now go, go you Pilots, you're going to be the Milwaukee Brewers (not that you're ever going to be very good there, either)." THE DEPARTED An ESPN.com series exploring the remnants left behind by teams that relocated: • St. Louis Browns: Lovable losers remembered fondly. • Philadelphia Warriors: Image of Wilt's 100-point game will never fade. • Troy Trojans: Yes, this upstate NY town was once a major league city. • Seattle Pilots: Failed season largely forgotten beyond "Ball Four." • Hartford Whalers: The most beloved team that no longer exists? • Montreal Expos: Youppi!, Canadiens keep team's spirit alive. • Buffalo Braves: They left in 1978, but some in Buffalo won't let go. • Minneapolis Lakers: 1948 loss to the Globetrotters was landmark. • Philadelphia/KC Athletics: Vagabond A's led colorful past lives. Story • San Diego Clippers: Why Bill Walton takes blame for hometown's loss. As part of a four-team expansion that also saw the debuts of the Montreal Expos, Kansas City Royals and San Diego Padres, the Pilots began in Seattle in 1969. But just a year later they were gone, relocated to Milwaukee after going bankrupt and being bought by Bud Selig. Nearly a half-century later, little physically remains here from that season. The Pilots' home of Sicks' Stadium was torn down decades ago, and a Lowe's home improvement store now stands on the site. Inside the store is a replica of the departed ballpark's home plate and markings where the bases and mound once were. "You go back a couple generations in baseball history and we had professional baseball from 1901 to 1969, through two world wars and a depression, and then -- poof! -- it's gone," Seattle sports historian David Eskenazi said. "The first year we didn't have pro baseball was 1970." The Pilots might be remembered even less had it not been for the finest baseball book ever written: "Ball Four," Jim Bouton's diary of that 1969 season. Bouton wrote in his Opening Day entry after beating the Angels 4-3, "Already we're better than the Mets." The Pilots did not remain so. Ichiro Suzuki and the Mariners wore Pilots uniforms during a "Turn Back the Clock" promotion in 2006. AP Photo/John Froschauer The Mets went on to win their first World Series that year, but Seattle went 64-98 and finished last in the six-team AL West. The aptly named Sicks' Stadium was a tiny and old minor league ballpark with plumbing issues that resulted in players sometimes taking cold showers or just going home without showering. Perhaps conditions would have been better had the Lowe's been around in 1969. Those Pilots drew only 677,944 fans, though that still was more than the Phillies, White Sox, Padres or Indians drew that year (the major league average was 1,134,569). They drew 14,993 for the April 11 home opener, a 7-0 win over the White Sox, but three days later a mere 3,611 watched the Pilots lose to the Royals. Only 1,954 fans showed for another April game. I was there Aug. 22 for Tommy Harper Night, held when Harper stole his 60th and 61st bases of the year, yet it was of so little interest it was attended by just 6,719 fans besides me. "I don't think this is a town that will ever draw 25,000 or 30,000 regularly," Bouton wrote. "It's a town much more concerned with culture than athletics." (This has changed, as all those Seahawks No. 12 jerseys document.) A Lowe's store now stands at the site of Sicks' Stadium, the Pilots' home for their year in Seattle. Transcendental Graphics/Getty Images Low attendance and a poor stadium -- workers were still nailing and painting the bleachers of the renovated Triple-A park the day of the home opener -- were not the only issues. The Seattle owners, Dewey and Max Soriano, were not rich enough to support the Pilots -- they needed to sell 47 percent of the team stock to former Cleveland Indians owner William Daley. Nor were there rich businessmen in the area to take over the franchise in that era -- Bill Gates and Paul Allen still were Seattle teenagers just learning the wonders of computers. Before Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks started here, Boeing was the main local company. It was about to begin staggering layoffs that would lead to an early '70s billboard that infamously read: "Will the last person leaving Seattle turn out the lights." Maybe the Pilots inspired the sign. One week before the 1970 season began and with the team's finances in ruins, the Pilots' fate was still so much up in the air that they sent their equipment truck from spring training in Arizona to Provo, Utah. There the drivers stopped and waited for word whether to continue to Seattle or veer northeast to Milwaukee. On March 31, eight days before the team's season opener, word was sent: Go to Wisconsin. The Pilots were moving to Milwaukee. As the late Mike Hegan told me once, the day after the move to Milwaukee was announced, he and his teammates entered their spring training clubhouse and found their jerseys now had MILWAUKEE stitched across the chest rather than SEATTLE. "It's amazing how cold this business can be," Hegan said. Pilots third baseman Rich Rollins takes a swing wearing a helmet with the "scrambled egg" design that replicated the look of some military headwear. Darryl Norenberg/USA TODAY Sports Seattleites still know all too well how cold it can be. In 2006, Howard Schultz, who turned Starbucks into a global phenomenon, sold the NBA's SuperSonics to a group of Oklahoma businessmen who moved the team to Oklahoma City in 2008. Fortunately, the Pilots' legacy lives on in an important way beyond "Ball Four," the home plate at Lowe's and the occasional fan wearing a replica cap with the pilot-like scrambled egg design across the bill. Thanks to Washington Attorney General Slade Gorton and trial lawyer Bill Dwyer, the state successfully sued the American League over the Pilots' departure. The league agreed to give Seattle another expansion team in 1977: the Mariners. Although after 39 seasons and not a single World Series appearance, Seattle is still wondering whether the Mariners will ever go, go to be the best.

United Airlines ending BGM airport flights Anthony Borrelli , aborrelli@pressconnects.com | @PSBABorrelli 5:21 p.m. EDT August 24, 2016 United Airlines is suspending one of three daily flights from the Greater Binghamton Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport due to construction at Newark. (Photo: AP File Photo ) 65 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE United Airlines will discontinue its flights out of Greater Binghamton Regional Airport in November, the airline announced Wednesday. The airline had been offering daily flights out of the Binghamton area to Newark Liberty International Airport, and in a statement, United officials said service would no longer be offered after Nov. 29. The decision to discontinue that service comes after a continuous review of its operations and measures of demand for service, according to the airline. "We have determined that our service between Newark and Binghamton does not meet our expectations and is no longer sustainable," United said in a statement. Customers with reservations for travel beyond Nov. 29 will be refunded. Although losing the major airline is disappointing, it does leave room for expanding services through the remaining two airlines — American and Delta  — that run flights out of Binghamton, Broome County Aviation Commissioner David Hickling said Wednesday. "We loved the fact that we had three major airlines serving our market; we've had a great relationship with them," Hickling said. "United put a lot of thought into it, but ultimately, they're in a market to make money, so it's a business decision, and I respect their decision as much as I am disappointed by it." On Wednesday, United Airlines officials would not say whether services at other regional airports in the state were being reviewed. "We still have tremendous connectivity out of Binghamton," Hickling said. "Both American and Delta are going to do well with this decision (by United); they'll probably pick up more passengers." American and Delta offer nonstop service to Philadelphia and Detroit, respectively, out of Binghamton. Delta to Detroit offers 115 domestic flight connections and 19 international connections. American to Philadelphia provides 87 domestic connections and 27 international connections. In April, United also withdrew services after two years operating out of Elmira Corning Regional Airport. It had offered daily flights to Chicago, complementing existing service provided by Allegiant, Delta and American Airlines. Following the announcement that United was discontinuing at the Elmira airport, Chemung County Executive Tom Santulli said it was believed United "didn't do as much corporate business as they thought" they would get when they first began offering flights there. United Airlines and United Express operate more than 4,500 flights a day to 339 airports across five continents. In 2015, United and United Express operated more than 1.5 million flights carrying more than 140 million customers. The airline also operates more than 720 mainline aircraft, and this year, the airline anticipates taking delivery of 21 new Boeing aircraft, including 737 NGs, 787s and 777s. The airline is a founding member of Star Alliance, which provides service to 192 countries via 28 member airlines. Federal funds for runway The loss of United flights at the Binghamton airport followed an announcement earlier Wednesday by U.S. Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand that $10.7 million in federal funding had been awarded to help repair the airport's runway. Last year, the airport made repairs after a section of runway pavement failed. Further testing found the main runway needed upgrades along its entire length. On Wednesday, Schumer's office announced $10,705,035 in funds were allocated through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration Airport Improvement Program. Officials say this will allow the airport to rehabilitate its runway's touchdown zone and lighting along its runway. "This major airport upgrade will ensure all of the passengers, businesses, academics and pilots who fly in an out of the Southern Tier each day have both a pleasant experience and, most importantly, a safe one," Schumer said in a statement Wednesday. In a July letter to FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, Schumer had requested the full $10.7 million cost of runway rehabilitation be made available in this fiscal year, to avoid potential delays in the project.

But new research is adding some clarity to the reasons behind the rising number of drone incidents, suggesting that more often than not, technical glitches rather than piloting errors are to blame. If you've ever tried your hand at piloting a drone, then you'll understand that things don't always go to plan. A slip of the joystick here, an overzealous acceleration there, things can come unstuck pretty quickly and the learning curve can be unforgiving. The US government has introduced a smartphone app, an awareness campaign and mandatory registration for these reasons: to keep rookie pilots both aware of the dangers and accountable for any missteps. Lehmann Avaiation launches modular drones Drone technology has changed rapidly over the past decade and France's Lehmann Aviation is looking to help professional drone users future-proof their UAVs with what the company claims is the world's first modular design in its latest line of drones. While it far from absolves us humans of blame, a new study carried out by researchers at Australia's RMIT University and Edith Cowan University has indicated that more often than not, technical problems may actually be the cause of drone accidents. The team examined 150 reported civil incidents between 2006 and 2016, and found that malfunctions were the cause for 64%. The research found that in most of these cases, a breakdown in the communication links between the operator and drone was the reason for the incident. Really, this is neither good news nor bad news for the drone industry as accidents are accidents, whether caused by humans or failing technologies. Rather, the study emphasizes the need for more robust communications systems for drones. The researchers believe this is an area where drones could follow the lead of larger aircraft and benefit from more regulatory oversight. Now, drones being used to deliver drugs in prison Police has said that they recovered two drones carrying mobile phones and drugs near London's Pentonville prison and have set up a special task force - Operation Airborne - to catch offenders trying to get contraband into the jail. "Large transport category aircraft, such as those from a Boeing or Airbus, are required to have triple redundant systems for their communications," says Dr Graham Wild from RMIT's School of Engineering. "But drones don't and some of the improvements that have reduced the risks in those aircraft could also be used to improve the safety of drones." Recently announced drone laws in the US allow any drone under 25 kg (55 lb) to be flown commercially without any form of airworthiness check, so long as the operator has a remote pilot certificate. In the view of the researchers, this allows too much margin for error. "Drones are being used for a wide range of tasks now and there are a lot of day-to-day activities that people want to use them for, delivering pizzas and packages, taking photos, geosurveying, firefighting, and search and rescue," says Wild. "It's essential that our safety regulations keep up with this rapidly-growing industry."

(Photo: Rudolph Bell) 1 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE COLUMBIA – South Carolina manufacturers in the aerospace industry plan to boost their use of contract laborers as a cushion against delays or surges in business, according to a new survey. The survey, conducted by Aviation Week, was released Wednesday during the third-annual South Carolina Aerospace Conference & Expo. Aerospace suppliers that responded in detail reported that they expect their work forces to be 23 percent contract labor “primarily in the role of coatings application and operators,” according to the survey. The companies said they expect to increase their reliance on contract laborers “to provide some flexibility in dealing with program delays or surges – an increase of 100 percent between December 2015 and year-end 2017.” The largest increase in contract labor would be in the area of A&P mechanics, followed by maintenance and engineering technicians, the companies reported in the survey. The survey also found South Carolina aerospace suppliers planned to hire 140 additional employees in 2016 and another 158 in 2017. Most of the new jobs in both years would be entry-level operators, it found, followed by machinists and engineering technicians. The survey projected a near doubling of aircraft painter positions in 2017. Carole Rickard Hedden, executive editorial director for Aviation Week Executive Intelligence, who oversaw the survey, said 92 South Carolina companies were contacted and 13 percent, or about 12, responded. All of the companies that responded employ less than 500 people, she said. The survey was commissioned by the South Carolina Council on Competitiveness, the University of South Carolina, the South Carolina Technical College System and the South Carolina Aeronautics Commission. It did not include The Boeing Co., which employs nearly 8,100 people at its North Charleston aircraft manufacturing operation, because Boeing’s size threatened to distort the results and because “Boeing has reached a steady state with no stated desire to add more workers beyond (those needed) to replace those leaving the organization,” according to the survey. 1 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2bWy8uW TOP VIDEOS Rifles, tourists are new normal at Trump Tower 1:53 More Americans are becoming millionaires 0:51 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Police clash with Standing Rock protesters 1:46 Raw: Int'l Space Station Gets 3 New Crew Members 1:46 Starbucks is raising prices for some of its drinks 0:27 Navy Debuts Futuristic USS Zumwalt Destroyer 1:54 Raw: Surveillance shows moment of Ill. explosion 0:27 Congress warned of internet vulnerabilities 2:01 Where in the world to invest now that the election is over 4:13

Natalie Walters Aug 24, 2016 12:16 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Qantas Airways (QUBSF) CEO Alan Joyce appeared on BloombergTV's "Trending Business" on Wednesday morning to talk about the company's record profits for 2016.  Before today's market open, the airline company reported an 85% rise in net profit for the year through June to $780 million, as well as its first dividend since 2009.  The incredible jump in profits is mainly due to the company's "transformation program," which to date has delivered $1.66 billion in benefits to the bottom line, Joyce explained. "Without that, Qantas wouldn't be producing these record results," he said.  In addition, Qantas' international business growth can be linked to partnerships with three airlines - Emirates, China Eastern (CEA) and American (AAL), Joyce said. "That's helped restructure that business and allowed us to focus on growth, particularly in Asia," he explained.  Qantas' growth should continue as the airline will receive the first of eight Boeing Co. Dreamliners at the end of 2017, BloombergTV's Rishaad Salamat pointed out. Qantas has the option to buy another 45 of the long-range, fuel-efficient aircraft, he added.  "This aircraft's technology is going to change the game for Qantas," Joyce told Salamat. The company will decide whether to order more Dreamliners based on the performance of the first eight planes, Joyce said.  "I'd like to order all of them if I can make a good return out of them,'' Joyce said.  "We have to demonstrate we can make money out of the eight we have," he added.  Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like Asian Markets Mixed as Investors Await Jackson Hole Speech Japan closes up as dollar strengthens, pending Janet Yellen's remarks on Friday, but Chinese production curbs hit oil prices and Australia's mining slowdown hits the construction sector.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other SLS Program working overtime to make 2018 debut August 24, 2016 by Philip Sloss Exploration Systems Development (ESD) Deputy Associate Administrator Bill Hill explained plans to mitigate flow concerns – such as recent adjustments to the Space Launch System (SLS) Core Stage delivery schedule – to keep the program on a path to launch Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) in late 2018. Mitigation may include extra shifts to find margin in the schedule. Working a Path – Stepping on the Gas: ESD’s “build-to-sync” review, which will continue into the Fall, is currently looking at how Orion, SLS, and Ground Systems and Development and Operations (GSDO) work will fit together for EM-1. The Orion, SLS, and GSDO programs have been working on parallel development paths to complete work to get ready for EM-1, and ESD will be in charge of final integration of that work as it comes together at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. See Also SLS Forum Section L2 SLS Section Click here to Join L2 The three programs have gone through their critical design reviews, and now ESD is reviewing how the work and the schedules fit together now and in the future, including the challenges of integration in both areas. “Each of the programs went through the typical systems engineering approach – you do a systems requirements review (SRR), and then a preliminary design review (PDR) and then a critical design review (CDR),” Mr. Hill explained in an interview with NASASpaceFlight.com “For the integration ‘stuff’, we did a systems requirements review, but our ‘parallel’ to the preliminary design review was what we call a ‘design-to-sync.’  So we reviewed all of our design products there.  And then this past spring and summer we did what we call ‘build-to-sync,’ which is kind of a parallel to the critical design review that each of the programs did. “(That involved) pulling together the 170-plus products that we, under the Exploration Systems Development portfolio, have developed from an integrated standpoint.” Recent schedule forecasts have the integrated EM-1 Orion spacecraft and the SLS Core Stage arriving at KSC a few months later than earlier predictions, which were used to derive the current September-November, 2018 launch readiness period, and Hill noted that they are looking at different ways of adjusting the work at KSC to try to meet that window of time. “I have a team right now taking a look at if we get Core Stage (to KSC) at the end of March (and) get Orion at the end of April, early May of ’18, can we still make the September-November timeframe (for launch),” he explained.  “We believe we can. “Until recently, everybody assumed that there was a hard nine-month schedule (at KSC). We’re interrogating that; we don’t think it’s nine months – it was based on a one shift, five days a week schedule. “So we’re looking at ‘what if we introduce a three-shift, six days a week or a three-shift, seven days a week [schedule]?’ We’ll probably go to six days a week, just to give us a little margin.  (We’re looking at) if we do that, how much do we shrink down the schedule from nine months? “(A) ‘back of the envelope’ look (says) we can get (the schedule) down to seven months and still keep thirty days of margin in there. (And we’re also looking at) how do we shrink it down even more.” In addition to looking at adding work shifts to the KSC schedule, ESD and the three programs are looking at the work itself to see if time could be saved there. “We’re also looking at the integrated tests that are going to be done at Kennedy,” he explained. “We had planned to do a Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR), a full up (launch countdown) rehearsal.  We may be able to do a tanking test, get that behind us, and not have to do a full up wet dress, because Orion really doesn’t get a lot of fueling or anything like that (in a WDR). “We might be able to do that independently of Orion, so we might go out to the pad without Orion and do those tests.” Other examples of refining the path to EM-1 includes the additional pre-mate, pre-launch testing involved with the Mobile Launcher. “We had planned to do a full-up Mobile Launcher test at the park site and then take it into the Vehicle Assembly Building and basically repeat all of those tests,” Mr. Hill added. “(The) Vehicle Assembly Building looks like it’s going to come in a little bit ahead of where we thought it was, so we might be able to just bring in the Mobile Launcher in and just do that test once – that takes a few weeks (of work) out of the schedule. “So we’re looking at other options – that’s what they pay us to do, they pay us to try to deliver on time and on budget and we going to continue to do that on a daily basis.” The build-to-sync effort that started earlier this year will continue into the Fall of this year. Mitigation of schedule concerns over two years ahead of launch will provide the program with options. *Click here for 100s of SLS News Articles* “What we’ll do is work our way through whether we choose a specific launch date or maintain the two-month window,” Mr. Hill added. “We’ll see how we come out in the end.  That will culminate with an agency review sometime in the late October timeframe, early November.” In the interview at the Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the first SLS Core Stage is being manufactured and assembled, Mr. Hill added also talked about recent adjustments to the Core Stage schedule for EM-1 that has impacted on the schedule discussions. “We just went through a renegotiation with Boeing and rebaselined the entire (Core Stage) schedule; we’re sticking to that schedule. “We believe that we can ship out of here (MAF) with the engines integrated to get to Stennis in the September (2017) time-frame, get it on the B-2 test stand – where we’re going to do a full-up Core Stage hot-fire.” Although the schedule is still targeting shipment of the Core Stage from MAF to Stennis in late September, 2017, the rebaseline does lengthen the time spent at Stennis for the “Green Run” test campaign before the Core Stage is put back on the Pegasus barge and shipped to KSC, which moved from January to March, 2018. “Part of the renegotiation was to extend the time at Stennis – one of the things we did that we hadn’t planned on (earlier) was to repair the Core Stage if we damaged it somehow during the hot-fire,” That renegotiation had a ripple effect on the EM-1 flow, with Mr. Hill explaining the Program will have to step on the gas to counter such changes. “We’ve added in about thirty days for that in that schedule. There’re some other areas where we were really assuming – you’ve heard of ‘green-light’ schedules? “I call the next step above that a ‘motorcade’ kind of a schedule where you don’t worry about green lights or red lights, you just blow through everything. “We were kind of not as conservative on our first go-round and I think we’ve got a more realistic schedule today and that’s why it’s where it’s at.” (Images: NASA and L2 – including photos from Philip Sloss and SLS renders from L2 artist Nathan Koga – The full gallery of Nathan’s (SpaceX Dragon to MCT, SLS, Commercial Crew and more) L2 images can be *found here*) (To join L2, click here: https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/) Related Articles NASA Lunar Imaging CubeSat – SkyFire – to ride with EM-1 Space Industry press forward with exploration hardware development Share This Article L2 - What's Popular Recent Forum Posts Latest SpaceX prime Falcon 9 rockets for December return Long March 3C launches fourth Tianlian-1 spacecraft Cygnus OA-5 departs Station after one month mission Atlas V successfully launches with GOES-R advanced weather satellite Soyuz MS-03 completes ISS docking with Expedition 50 crew Shenzhou-11 returns Chinese duo to Earth Ariane 5 ES successfully launches Galileo quadruplets Software and Service Module cited as main critical paths to EM-1 launch date As OA-7 Cygnus moves to Atlas V, high praise noted for Antares RTF Long March 2D fires opening salvo in new weather observation constellation Tags Antares Ariane 5 Atlas V CCDev china CRS Cygnus Dragon Dream Chaser EFT-1 ESA ET EVA Falcon 9 FRR HLV ISS Long March Mars Orbital Orion Progress Proton-M Russian SLS SNC Soyuz SpaceX SRB SSME STS-119 STS-125 STS-126 STS-127 STS-128 STS-129 STS-130 STS-131 STS-132 STS-133 STS-134 STS-135 T&R TPS ULA Archives Select Month November 2016  (17) October 2016  (21) September 2016  (27) August 2016  (25) July 2016  (19) June 2016  (22) May 2016  (23) April 2016  (23) March 2016  (22) February 2016  (18) January 2016  (21) December 2015  (23) November 2015  (24) October 2015  (24) September 2015  (27) August 2015  (23) July 2015  (24) June 2015  (22) May 2015  (21) April 2015  (19) March 2015  (24) February 2015  (17) January 2015  (17) December 2014  (25) November 2014  (21) October 2014  (27) September 2014  (23) August 2014  (19) July 2014  (23) June 2014  (20) May 2014  (21) April 2014  (21) March 2014  (21) February 2014  (21) January 2014  (22) December 2013  (25) November 2013  (22) October 2013  (27) September 2013  (28) August 2013  (23) July 2013  (23) June 2013  (24) May 2013  (23) April 2013  (20) March 2013  (20) February 2013  (20) January 2013  (23) December 2012  (21) November 2012  (23) October 2012  (28) September 2012  (25) August 2012  (23) July 2012  (24) June 2012  (23) May 2012  (41) April 2012  (25) March 2012  (26) February 2012  (28) January 2012  (23) December 2011  (32) November 2011  (26) October 2011  (25) September 2011  (25) August 2011  (28) July 2011  (32) June 2011  (24) May 2011  (31) April 2011  (27) March 2011  (24) February 2011  (25) January 2011  (24) December 2010  (26) November 2010  (30) October 2010  (31) September 2010  (25) August 2010  (28) July 2010  (22) June 2010  (26) May 2010  (27) April 2010  (29) March 2010  (28) February 2010  (25) January 2010  (22) December 2009  (22) November 2009  (28) October 2009  (28) September 2009  (29) August 2009  (32) July 2009  (28) June 2009  (25) May 2009  (31) April 2009  (28) March 2009  (30) February 2009  (26) January 2009  (23) December 2008  (25) November 2008  (28) October 2008  (27) September 2008  (20) August 2008  (22) July 2008  (18) June 2008  (26) May 2008  (22) April 2008  (22) March 2008  (23) February 2008  (25) January 2008  (23) December 2007  (23) November 2007  (25) October 2007  (30) September 2007  (23) August 2007  (38) July 2007  (28) June 2007  (34) May 2007  (30) April 2007  (26) March 2007  (25) February 2007  (28) January 2007  (25) December 2006  (35) November 2006  (27) October 2006  (29) September 2006  (36) August 2006  (31) July 2006  (39) June 2006  (30) May 2006  (27) April 2006  (28) March 2006  (30) February 2006  (32) January 2006  (26) December 2005  (25) November 2005  (26) October 2005  (30) September 2005  (28) August 2005  (35) July 2005  (30) June 2005  (25) May 2005  (19) April 2005  (29) March 2005  (4) February 2005  (1) NASASPACEFLIGHT About NASASpaceFlight Advertise With Us Contact Us NASASpaceflight © 2005 - 2015 Website Designed by Dr Nox & Associates

(CRUS) Signaling Upcoming Gains S&P 500: Enjoy a Rare Thanksgiving Bull Feast! View All Posts iShares Dow Jones US Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:ITA) — As I reviewed a list of ETF returns, ITA, which tracks the Dow Jones US Select Aerospace & Defense Index, stood out as a consistent performer with a low expense ratio of 0.44%. Reviewing my August AAII ETF guide, this fund shows a line of black numbers, and no red, indicating annual returns that are difficult to match: six-month (+18.98%), one-year (+10.70), three-year (+14.89%), five-year (+17.49%) and 10-year (+11.82%). These returns are through July 31, and they don’t reflect sales charges and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. ITA pays an annual dividend of $1.35 per share for a current forward yield of 1%. Morningstar gives ITA a five-star rating for the fund’s unusual combination of below-average risk and high returns. The top 10 holdings in ITA are United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LLL), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (NYSE:COL) and Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT). Turning to the chart, we see that ITA made a new high in early June, which exceeded its previous all-time high of around $125, made in the second quarter of 2015. But in late June, profit-taking drove shares below their 50-day moving average. However, ITA managed to hold above its 200-day moving average and preserve its bull market stance. The current channel in which shares trade is a bull recovery channel, which is confirmed by very high volume at its start and a supportive MACD indicator. Buy ITA as an investment in the U.S. aerospace and defense industries, which are uniquely suited to meet the replacement and new equipment needs of the U.S. armed forces.

Then Airbus has a website for you. Airbus (EADSF) has launched a booking site dedicated solely to A380 flights, hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the aircraft among some passengers. "Booking systems today do not allow the passengers to easily choose their preferred aircraft and we decided to fill that gap by easing the access to the iconic A380 aircraft, for everybody," said Marc Fontaine, Airbus Digital Transformation Officer. The A380 super jumbo jet operates on 102 routes to around 50 destinations globally, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Dubai, Tokyo and Sydney. The new website, http://iflya380.com, allows passengers to pick any A380 flight operated by one of the 13 airlines that fly the super jumbo. Related: Airbus cuts production of A380 super jumbo Airbus said the aircraft has proven to be a hit with travelers, but the company is struggling to convince more airlines to buy it. The A380, designed to challenge Boeing (BA) in the super large aircraft market, took 15 years to develop at a cost of $25 billion. But orders have not matched Airbus' expectations. Airlines are now moving towards more fuel efficient planes, rather than super large aircraft, to cut down costs. Fuel is the second biggest expense for airlines, behind staff costs. The company announced it is cutting down production of the aircraft. It said it will build only 20 of the twin-deck A380 next year, and only 12 per year from 2018. That's down from 27 it delivered in 2015.

By Austin Wright and Jeremy Herb 08/24/16 05:25 AM EDT “In the case of Trump vs. Clinton, defense executives see the same thing in Trump that people in other industries and the media see, which is that he’s a totally unknown quantity, and that’s scary,” said industry consultant Loren Thompson. | Getty Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print The nation’s top defense contractors have long been a bastion of support for Republican candidates for office. But this time, they’re with Hillary Clinton. The Democratic presidential nominee is leading Republican rival Donald Trump by a ratio of 2-to-1 in campaign donations from employees working for defense giants like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. That’s a sharp turnaround from 2012, when defense contractors gave more to then-Republican nominee Mitt Romney than to President Barack Obama. Story Continued Below It’s also a departure from recent decades, in which the industry overall favored Republican congressional and presidential candidates in eight of the past 10 election cycles, with Democrats getting more in 2008 and 2010. Since Trump locked up the Republican nomination three months ago, employees of 25 of the nation’s largest defense companies have donated $93,000 to Clinton, compared with $46,000 for Trump, according to a POLITICO review of filings with the Federal Election Commission. Clinton's donor rolls also include more than two dozen top defense executives, while Trump’s show just two. Donors with ties to Pentagon contractors may simply be betting Clinton will win. But some say they are concerned about Trump's pronouncements on national security, which have included skepticism about NATO’s role in countering Russia, and they fear he will follow through on his pledge to upend business as usual in Washington. “I’ve worked with Republicans and Democrats of all stripes over the years,” said Linda Hudson, who ran the U.S. branch of British defense firm BAE Systems, the Pentagon’s eighth largest contractor, from 2009 to 2014. “And it’s the first time I’ve seen one who scares the hell out of me if he were to become president.” 2016 Clinton asks Romney’s allies for cash to stop Trump By Gabriel Debenedetti Hudson, who’s given $5,400 to the Clinton campaign this election cycle, said she considers herself a Democrat but has contributed in the past to lawmakers in both political parties who have strong positions on defense issues. Her biggest problem with Trump, she explained, is that “he appears to have no impulse control.” On the stump, the real estate mogul and reality television star has repeatedly criticized defense contractors and their lobbyists for exerting undue influence on government spending. Clinton, meanwhile, was an ally to some of them when she was in the Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee. “My view is Hillary is far more aligned with the types of issues that are important to the defense industry than Trump is,” Hudson said. Officially, defense firms are trying to avoid taking sides in this year’s race for the White House — with most of their corporate political action committees contributing to House and Senate candidates but not to the Clinton or Trump campaigns. But that hasn’t stopped many of their top executives from making their preferences known through individual contributions. And those preferences skew toward Clinton, who defense watchers say offers what weapons makers crave most: predictability. “In the case of Trump vs. Clinton, defense executives see the same thing in Trump that people in other industries and the media see, which is that he’s a totally unknown quantity, and that’s scary,” said industry consultant Loren Thompson, who plans to vote for the former secretary of State. A number of big names in defense circles have opened their checkbooks for Clinton. They include former Lockheed Martin CEO Robert Stevens; Edward Kangas, who chairs the board of directors at United Technologies; Pam Wickham, the vice president for corporate affairs and communications at Raytheon; John Casey, who leads the Marine Systems division at General Dynamics; Vivek Lall, a senior executive at General Atomics; and Frank Ruggiero, the top in-house lobbyist at BAE Systems, among others. Many of Clinton’s defense industry donors have longstanding ties to the Democratic Party, including Greta Lundeberg, Boeing’s vice president for strategy and advocacy and a former National Security Council staffer in the Obama administration; and Robert Hale, an adviser at Booz Allen Hamilton who was the Pentagon’s comptroller under Obama. Others have histories of giving to both political parties, including Gregory Walters, a senior in-house lobbyist at Lockheed Martin, who also contributed this year to Republican Rep. Kay Granger of the Texas congressional district where Lockheed assembles its F-35 fighter jet. Biden reassures NATO allies: I don't think Trump 'understands what Article 5 is' By Nick Gass At least four other in-house lobbyists at Lockheed have given to Clinton. In contrast, Trump’s donor rolls include just two senior executives at major defense firms, according to POLITICO’s analysis. Scott Feeney, the director of international government relations at Rockwell Collins, has given $225 this year to the Trump campaign, and Jennifer Gallagher, listed as a senior manager for government relations at Raytheon, has given $250. Feeney did not respond to a request for comment, and Gallagher declined through a spokesman to comment. One Republican defense lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he said he has to preserve relationships on both sides of the aisle, said the defense “community is just much more comfortable with Clinton.” The lobbyist said he plans to vote for Clinton in what will be his first vote ever for a Democratic presidential candidate. “With Hillary Clinton we have some sense of where she would go, and with Trump we have none,” the lobbyist said. “He knows nothing about the system.” The lobbyist also speculated that some defense executives might be contributing to Clinton — who has a polling advantage over Trump in all the key battleground states — because they believe she’s going to win. Asked to comment, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign pointed out that defense contributions make up a small fraction of overall fundraising totals. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Some of the defense contractors named in this article declined to comment, while others noted that they have no control over the individual political contributions of their employees. the playbook interview Playbook Interview: David Petraeus By Daniel Lippman “As a corporation we have a longstanding practice of not participating in presidential election campaigns,” said Lockheed spokesman William Phelps. “Any contributions made by our employees is personal and not associated with the corporation.” In all, Trump’s campaign has received $55,000 in contributions from employees of the 25 major defense contractors, compared to $273,000 for Clinton — a 5-to-1 advantage. These totals do represent a small amount of the hundreds of millions of dollars raised overall by the campaigns, but they’re indicative of trends in an industry that depends on government contracts for its revenues. The totals only include contributions from individuals who have given more than $200, as the campaigns are not required to itemize smaller donations. This lopsided ratio is a reversal from 2012, when Romney brought in $1.4 million from defense PACs and industry employees, edging out Obama, who bought in $1.2 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. “All the people I know in the industry who are actively involved in the campaigns are on the Clinton side,” said Thompson, the defense industry consultant. “Clinton has been in public life for decades, her priorities are well understood, and many senior executives in the defense industry know her personally.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Austin Wright awright@politico.com @abwrig Jeremy Herb jherb@politico.com @jeremyherb This story tagged under: Military Hillary Clinton Elections Donald Trump 2016 Elections Hillary Clinton 2016 Donald Trump 2016 Defense Industry Show Comments Politico Magazine 15 Trump Flip-Flops in 15 Days By Ruairí Arrieta-Kenna How the Left Created Trump By Rob Hoffman Giuliani Took Money From a Group That Killed Americans.

EDASC organized the day-long tour for Thornquist as part of an ongoing initiative to showcase local businesses who manufacture parts for the aerospace industry. Sternlicht noted the importance of introducing state Commerce officials to vital Skagit companies such as Chinook. "Not only is Chinook a prominent Boeing supplier, but also its social enterprise mission merits more awareness statewide. These visits help both Skagit and state folks to work together in economic development." Rob Martin, Chinook Enterprises Founder and CEO led the hour-long tour. "We were very excited to showcase what we do here, and to discuss business opportunities and challenges we face as a social enterprise in the aerospace assembly field." Chinook's history in aerospace dates back to 1987 when the company began assembling parts for the 747 Program. Over thirty-five years later, Chinook's award-winning production team is busier than ever.

Pilot Alan Kreppert told authorities the Piper single engine, fixed wing plane had engine trouble and he could not make it back to the nearby Creve Coeur Airport.  Kreppert and his passenger were not injured. Jon Sanders and his wife were heading home when they saw the plane’s lights. “Honestly I didn’t know what I was looking at at first. You don’t expect it to be a plane,” Sanders said. But when they drove under a street light on Page, they suddenly saw the plane’s belly and realized it was unusually low. “We immediately started slowing down,” Sanders said adding “he was probably I’d say a 100 yards in front of us when he touched down.”  He went on to describe the landing, “he brought one wheel down.. a back rear wheel.  He kind of bounced around just slightly and dropped it down and immediately started veering off to the shoulder.” The plane is owned by the Boeing Employees Flying Club and it is based at Creve Coeur Airport. This is not the first time the Page Extension (Highway 364) corridor proved to be a safety valve for small planes.  Maryland Heights police recalled a plane crash along a bike path between the Page Extension and the Creve Coeur Airport in 2014. Maryland Heights Police Public Information Officer Mark Fedak said the pilot had been practicing take-offs and landings at the airport.  The FAA is investigating the incident.

NASA's Williams sets U.S. space record James Dean , FLORIDA TODAY 12:53 p.m. EDT August 24, 2016 Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams earlier this month monitored bowling ball-sized internal satellites known as SPHERES aboard the International Space Station. Williams on Wednesday sets a U.S. record for most cumulative days in space with 521 over four missions. His record is expected to total 534 days by the time he returns to Earth in early September. (Photo: NASA) 48 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Scott Kelly is widely known as the Ironman of U.S. astronauts after his recent yearlong mission aboard the International Space Station, during which he set a NASA record for most cumulative days in space with 520 over four flights. But as of Wednesday, that career record will belong not to Kelly but Jeff Williams, an unassuming NASA veteran who doesn't mind if his six-month tour lacks the promotion and buzz of Kelly's "#YearInSpace." The commander of the station’s six-person Expedition 48 crew marks his 521st day in space Wednesday, a total expected to reach 534 days by the time he returns to Earth on Sept. 6 to conclude his fourth spaceflight. Don’t expect the retired Army colonel — a 58-year-old grandfather who the oldest NASA astronaut to live on the orbiting laboratory complex — to boast about the achievement. “It’s an honor to spend any day in space, and certainly to have accumulated that time is truly an honor for me,” Williams told NASA TV recently. FLORIDA TODAY NASA's OSIRIS-REx nearing launch to collect asteroid sample But he prefers to shift the attention to the station itself, which he considers humanity’s greatest technological feat, and the international partnership that has put it together. “That’s really the bigger story to me, personally,” he said. Williams’ 20-year astronaut career has spanned the station’s assembly, which began in 1998. His first flight was a 2000 shuttle mission that helped set up the fledgling outpost for its first permanent crew later that year. Crews have now lived continuously on the ISS for nearly 16 years. Since that 10-day shuttle flight, it’s been all long-duration missions for the Wisconsin native, who has launched three times from Kazakhstan on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. He’s the first American to serve on three ISS expeditions, which typically last five or six months each. The previous two were in 2006 and 2010, before station construction was officially complete. FLORIDA TODAY GOES-R weather satellite arrives for November launch Williams’ current mission has helped set the stage for the station’s next chapter, which will rely more on commercial operations. Last Friday he performed his fourth spacewalk, pairing with NASA’s Kate Rubins to install a docking port that opened the door for Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the outpost late next year or in early 2018. They are preparing for another spacewalk next week. On Aug. 19, Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams (shown) and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins of NASA successfully installed the first of two international docking adapters to the International Space Station during a five-hour and 58-minute spacewalk.  (Photo: NASA) Williams also has helped set up a prototype habitat module designed by Bigelow Aerospace, a potential precursor to private space stations that could follow the ISS. A West Point graduate in 1980, Williams later earned two master’s degrees and finished first in his class at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Still, it took him about 10 years and multiple applications to win entry into NASA’s astronaut corps in 1996. He preaches perseverance to young people. Williams is old enough to remember Russia as a Cold War adversary. Now he sees the ISS partnership involving the U.S., Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada as a model for peaceful international relations. “I trust that it serves as a very positive example to the world below,” he said. When he returns to Earth in less than two weeks, Williams told CBS News recently that he looks forward to seeing family and friends and to “the simple things in life.” Those include smells of Earth often taken for granted, relaxing in quiet without the station’s constant hum of fans and pumps, and anything his wife will cook for him. “She’s the real hero in all of this, putting up with me being up here that many days over the years,” he said. And Williams knows records are made to be broken. In fact, Peggy Whitson, currently fourth on NASA's career list with 377 days in space, is scheduled to launch to the ISS in November and set a new U.S. record next year.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak on Friday, comments that are eagerly awaited in terms of fresh clues on the timing of a US rate hike. “The earnings season is largely over and the only thing we can look at is Fed-speak which is antagonising,” Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Key Biscayne, Florida-based Frank Capital Partners, told Bloomberg. “We’re in the most aggressive dip-buying market I’ve ever seen. I wouldn’t even call the last two days a dip, but any little tiny decline seems to be an excuse to buy and talk about the Fed.” In 3.21pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3 percent. In 3.06pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4 percent. The Nasdaq touched a record high 5,275.74. The Dow moved higher as advances in shares of Nike and those of Cisco, up 1.9 percent and 1.2 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Boeing, each 0.6 percent weaker respectively. Shares of Best Buy soared, up 18.9 percent as of 3.12pm in New York, after the company reported quarterly earnings that exceeded estimates, underpinning optimism about a turnaround. There were disappointments too. Shares of JM Smucker dropped after the company downgraded its full-year sales estimate because of weakness in its new pet foods division, acquired last year. Net sales, excluding one-off items, are expected to range from flat to down 1 percent this year, the company said in a statement. It previously had predicted a 1 percent increase. Shares of Smucker sank, trading 8.4 percent weaker as of 1.44pm in New York. Shares of Monsanto rose. Negotiations between Bayer and Monsanto are advancing toward a deal after the companies made progress on issues including the purchase price and termination fee, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Shares of Monsanto climbed 3.2 percent as of 2.21pm in New York, while those of Bayer gained closed 0.7 percent higher in Frankfurt. The latest US housing data offered reason for optimism. A Commerce Department report showed new home sales climbed 12.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 654,000 units in July, the highest level in almost nine years. “This marginally raises our near-term outlook for the housing market, as tightness in the new home market suggests further impetus to new construction ahead,” Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.9 percent advance from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 index increased 0.6 percent, France’s CAC 40 index rose 0.7 percent, while Germany’s DAX index climbed 0.9 percent.

NASA has officially completed installation of the new International Docking Adapter (IDA) on the ISS, which opens the space base up for all manner of new spacecraft to visit. Essentially, it means the ISS is now primed and ready for the private spaceflight revolution. The docking adapter was attached to the ISS’s second Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2) via spacewalk last week. The docking port was previously used for space shuttles (remember those?). By getting the IDA up and running, the ISS can now accept the private ships that will be flying in 2017 and 2018 to bring astronauts to and from the station, as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. It’ll obviously open up a new docking port for the spacecraft being developed by SpaceX and Boeing, but also any future craft, since it’s built to the International Docking System Standard. Along with making the ISS more versatile, this upgrade also makes it more attractive for when NASA packs up and moves on. The space agency has been teasing plans to allow private corporations to keep the station running once the current funding slate runs out in 2024, as NASA shifts its budget and priorities toward Mars. Having a fancy new IDA is certainly a nice perk.  (Via The Verge, NASA) Related Stories em drivescienceTechnologyNASA 6 NASA believes that fuel-free EM Drive concept could potentially work Trent Moore NASAspace 1 Retro NASA concept video from the 1960's shows early version of Apollo missions Trent Moore SpaceXInternetspacescience 2 SpaceX just asked to launch 4,400 satellites to create high-speed space internet Trent Moore spaceStephen Hawking 6 Stephen Hawking predicts humans won't survive another 1,000 years on Earth Trent Moore More from around the web Latest News Blog View Close Latest DuneFrank HerbertLegendary Entertainment 0 Legendary Entertainment wins screen rights to Frank Herbert's Dune Jeff Spry HighlanderChad StahelskiLionsgate 0 Highlander reboot remains immortal, lands a John Wick director Nathalie Caron InterviewMark HamillMark Hamill’s Pop Culture QuestComic-Con HQ 0 Mark Hamill on his collector impulses, a definitive Joker, and the role he'd still like to play Tara Bennett Hulkmarvel comicsShe-Hulk 0 She-Hulk takes up Bruce Banner's mantle in first look at new Hulk comic Trent Moore Game of Thronesellie kendrickHBOhodor 0 Watch: Game of Thrones’ Meera Reed apologizes to Hodor Aaron Sagers Lost in SpaceParker Poseynetflix 9 Danger, Will Robinson!

And on Monday the 53-year-old Pirates Of The Caribbean actor was seen for the first time since his divorce from his 30-year-old Rum Diary co-star was finalized. The father-of-two was spotted climbing aboard a four-level, $200m mega yacht owned by Saudi Prince Abdul Aziz, 42, in Ibiza, Spain, where the movie star has been residing for the past several weeks. Scroll down for video  Riding the high seas in style: Johnny Depp was seen for the first time since he settled his divorce with Amber Heard for $7m. The star was arriving to a mega yacht in Ibiza, Spain  Head down: The 53-year-old actor appeared glum as he hid behind a pair of sunglasses Easy does it: The Pirates Of The Caribbean actor held onto a drink in a plastic cup as he made his way off a speedboat and onto the luxury liner Amber was last seen on Friday in London with friends Margot Robbie and Cara Delevingne. On Monday Depp looked ready for a night of clubbing on Sunset Boulevard in his white shirt with rolled up sleeves that revealed his collection of tattoos, black vest, baggy striped slacks and layers of necklaces and bracelets.

Share this article Share And it also looked as if the rocker wanted to stay under the radar a bit by wearing a black cap and black sunglasses. The Black Mass actor did not appear to be in the best of spirits as he stepped off a small speedboat with Prince Abdulaziz written on the back and onto the massive yacht, which at 482 feet is one of the longest and tallest motor yachts in the world. She is now his ex: Heard accused the movie wonder of being physically abusive and supplied several photos and anecdotes about his alleged violence; here they are seen in January 2015 A long, difficult summer: The bad press started in May when Heard filed legal documents Thanks for the good times: The Alice Through The Looking Glass actor, seen here shaking hands with one of the crew, has had to duke it out with his lawyers over the split He had a hand: Several make handlers made sure the A lister didn't fall; it has been only about a week since he settled with Amber He has friends in high places: The speedboat belongs to Saudi prince Abdul Aziz, 42, and was marked Prince Abdulaziz on the back Depp, who has two children with Vanessa Paradis (Lily-Rose and John), was not alone as there were several male attendants making sure he did not slip as he entered the vessel. Spending time on the giant floating palace is not new for the superstar as he was seen there in early August as well. His host Aziz - who is reportedly worth $10 billion - has also partied with Leonardo DiCaprio so celebrities are not new to the yacht. It is not known why Depp is in Spain but it is believe that he wants some privacy after the poor light Heard cast him in after they split this spring. They were married for only 15 months and had no prenup. His pricey quarters: The father-of-two was spotted climbing aboard a four-level, $200m mega yacht A vessel Jack Sparrow wouldn't mind stealing: With a length of 147 metres (482 ft 3 in) at delivery, the yacht was the longest and tallest motor yacht in the world when built His home for weeks: Depp was also spotted on the mega vessel in early August In May Amber had accused him of battery and even supplied photos of her bruised face. Heard alleged in her court filing that an 'inebriated and high' Depp had grabbed her cellphone, 'wound up his arm like a baseball pitcher and threw the cell phone at me striking my cheek and eye with great force' during a dispute. She stated in the filing that Depp continued to attack her even after throwing the phone, claiming: 'He then forcibly pulled back my hair as I attempted to stand up from the sofa. Johnny continued screaming at me, pulling my hair, striking me and violently grabbing my face.' He sure likes celebrities: The Prince has also partied with Leonardo DiCaprio Plenty of room to party: The now single Johnny could fit his entire entourage and a football team on the yacht At play: Prince Aziz, who is reportedly worth $10b, spotted in New York City in April; he also owns a Boeing 777 and Canadair Challenger Earlier this month it was revealed that Depp had cut his finger while in an argument with his wife and had written in his own blood a nasty message for her on a mirror. Daily Mail Online has learned that the incident happened last March while Depp was in Australia and was high on weed and ecstasy on top of having drunk several bottles of red wine. He had been speaking with Heard on the phone while she was filming The Danish Girl in London when they began to fight and he threw the phone at some glass, causing the injury. Tough times: It is not known why he is in Spain but it is believe that he wants some privacy after the poor light Heard cast him in after they split this spring. They were married for only 15 months and had no prenup The court papers claim that Depp then took his bloody finger and dipped it in blue paint before using the mixture of the two liquids to write 'STARRING,' 'Billy Bob, ' and 'Easy Amber' on the wall. 'Billy Bob' is Billy Bob Thornton claims Heard, who had starred in the 2008 film The Informers with the actress and then London Fields, which will be released later this year. Depp was reportedly accusing Heard, 30, of having an affair with the 61-year-old actor during the fight, which occurred in his Australian villa while he was filming the latest installment of Pirates of the Caribbean. It got ugly: In May Amber had accused him of battery and even supplied photos of her bruised face Dirty laundry: Heard alleged in her court filing that an 'inebriated and high' Depp had grabbed her cellphone, 'wound up his arm like a baseball pitcher and threw the cell phone at me striking my cheek and eye with great force' during a dispute The photos of the injured finger and writing in the blood and paint mixture have been entered as exhibits in the case. Heard is also claiming in court papers that Depp did not have the finger treated until almost 24 hours after he sliced off the top of the digit, and that doctors had to use a flap of skin from his hand to fashion a new tip. In photos taken a month after the incident when the pair returned to Australia, Depp and Heard are seen getting off a private jet with his finger wrapped in a scarf. Sad statement: She stated in the filing that Depp continued to attack her even after throwing the phone, claiming: 'He then forcibly pulled back my hair as I attempted to stand up from the sofa' More bad news: Earlier this month it was revealed that Depp had cut his finger while in an argument with his wife and had written in his own blood a nasty message for her on a mirror DailyMail learned that when news leaked that he had cut his finger and written that message, he wanted the settlement reached quickly.  In a joint statement released exclusively to Daily Mail Online the couple described their relationship as 'passionate' and at times 'volatile' but said neither of them intended to cause the other harm. The statement said: 'Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have agreed to resolve their divorce proceedings privately. He wanted the accusations to end: DailyMail learned that when news leaked that he had cut his finger and written that message, he wanted the settlement reached quickly 'They are issuing this joint statement: 'Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has lied nor made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. 'Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future. Amber will be donating financial proceeds from the divorce to a charity. There will be no further public statements about this matter.' The money has been shared: Heard has since donated her settlement to help battered women and sick children Instead a softening of the wording was agreed upon that both Depp and Heard were happy with. A source said: 'Amber is happy with the settlement, it was never about the money for her, she was unhappy with the way Johnny treated her but it has been painful and emotionally rendering to relive this stuff. 'She didn't want to torture Johnny any more and wanted it to be over before the court hearing on Wednesday.' Heard has since donated her settlement to help battered women and sick children. She revealed she is donating the money to both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, where she says she has worked as a volunteer for 10 years.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 1k shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Kanye West hospitalized 'for his own health and safety' Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

Whittington Follow Following Rate the news Nanoracks being paid by NASA to study making space habitats out of fuel tanks Upper stage fuel tanks of the Atlas V and even the Space Launch System could become space stations Three Station Crews to Answer Media Questions from Orbit | NASA - nasa.gov Advertisements #NASA recently handed out study contracts to six companies to develop deep #Space habitats that will sustain astronauts in cis-lunar space and on the Journey to Mars. Five of the companies are developing habitats that would be launched fully outfitted and ready to go. A team called Ixion, led by Nanonracks, and including Space Systems Loral and the United Launch Alliance, has come up with a different approach. #Nanoracks, which has provided commercial experiments for the International Space Station, envisions using the fuel tanks of upper stages of rockets and outfitting them to become habitats. The idea of using a fuel tank of a launch vehicle to make a space station habitat is an old one. Skylab, which flew in the 1970s, was the upper stage of a Saturn V. In the 1990s a group of NASA engineers proposed a concept called Geode which would have converted the space shuttle liquid fuel tank into a space station, attaching modules, robotic arms, and so on while refurbishing the inside. The first step for the Ixion effort would be to convert the upper stage of the Atlas V, called the Centaur. The Centaur would be equipped with a docking hatch. When the Atlas V takes a Cygnus cargo ship or, later, a Boeing CST-100 Starliner, the Centaur would remain attached instead of being discarded and tossed into the atmosphere. When the Cygnus and later the Starliner docks with the ISS, the robot arm would snatch the Centaur and attached it to another docking port. The Centaur would be vented of fuel and pumped full of oxygen. Then astronauts would enter and outfit the interior to make it a fulling functioning habitat. The newly created module could remain at the International Space Station or could be tugged to a new location to form the basis of a commercial space station. The resulting habitat would be four meters wide and have an interior volume of 54 cubic meters. The process could be adapted to other launch vehicles as well. The upper stage hydrogen fuel tank for the heavy lift Space Launch System would have an eye popping volume of 495 cubic meters, half the volume of the ISS. Using the SLS upper stage hydrogen tank to build deep space habitats would help spread the $1 billion cost of launching the heavy lift rocket, making each mission dual use.

By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:August 23, 2016 11:48 pm The lunar orbiters had sent back a total of 3,062 photos. (Source: NASA) It’s often said, photographs are frozen memories, and rightly so in many aspects as they capture a moment, thereby, making it memorable and sometimes, it could just go on to become historic. Just like on August 23, 1966 – when the first photo of Earth was captured from its satellite Moon. It’s been 50 years since this first photo was captured and produced by NASA’s Lunar Orbiter 1. The photo was transmitted to Earth by the unmanned robotic spacecraft and received at the tracking station at Robledo De Chavela near Madrid, Spain. The image was taken during the spacecraft’s 16th orbit. August 10 was the 50th anniversary of the launch of the first of five lunar orbiters that returned images of “99 per cent of both the near- and far-side surfaces of the moon”. According to a report, the lunar orbiters had sent back a total of 3,062 photos. The first spacecraft, Lunar Orbiter 1, left Earth on August 10, 1966, and after 92 hours, it was finally orbiting the moon. According to NASA, the Lunar Orbiter 1 – built by The Boeing Co. – was launched on an Atlas SLV-3 Agena-D rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida. It was mainly designed to take photographs of smooth areas of the Moon’s surface, which would help to select landing sites for the Surveyor and Apollo missions, later launched by NASA.

You don’t want to mess with a working spacecraft if you don’t have to.” Though, initially, there were debates, as changing the satellite position would endanger the orbiter’s main objective, NASA finally decided to take picture of our planet. Thereby after lot of considerations, on August 23, 1966, “the spacecraft successfully took a photo of an earthrise, the blue planet rising above the moon’s horizon,” reports Space.com. Since then, this first photo of the Earth from the Moon has been historical and a printed poster of the image were presented as souvenirs to visiting dignitaries. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

A recent survey of over 1,500 people in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, conducted by YouGov revealed that 43 per cent of Emirates' residents are planning to travel during the Eid holiday. Four and five-star hotels are the top choice for families, with 32 per cent of accommodation requests by UAE residents for four-star options, and 48 per cent choosing to go the full luxury route. Popular destinations winning the public vote include India, just 3.5 hours away which, with the recent introduction of the e-Tourist Visa, has seen rising numbers of UAE visitors since 2015. "The economic slowdown hasn't seemingly deterred UAE residents from their annual travel plans and with a wealth of cultural, relaxing and city destinations reachable from Dubai in under four hours by air, we are seeing a surge of interest for stays at our member properties in destinations ranging from legendary India and the natural beauty of Georgia to pure relaxation in the Maldives," said Saurabh Rai, executive vice-president of Preferred Hotels & Resorts. "The availability of low cost carriers is also helping boost demand, with Air Arabia and FlyDubai's route networks adding new destinations all the time, and opening up a number of new and exciting destinations to intrepid travellers," said Rai. He added that staycations were also a preferred option as 23 per cent of residents were unable to travel due to work. Data released by global aviation leader Boeing, revealed that in 2015 Asian low cost carriers recorded average annual growth of 24.5 per cent over the previous decade, against just 13.4 per cent by European carriers. In India, the growing line-up of Preferred hotels include the Leela Palace Chennai - a five-star hotel that combines Indian tradition and contemporary comfort. The Greater Caucasus, with its dramatic mountains and abundance of outdoor activity options is also becoming increasingly popular with regional travellers. - rohma@khaleejtimes.com   Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Local business UAE residents opt for short luxury vacations Easily accessible destinations and short luxury trips are the top...

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, sits on the floor during a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing last fall in Washington, D.C. Commercial drones have become much more common and the Pentagon is taking an interest in them.  (Andrew Harrer / Bloomberg file photo)   By Justin BachmanBloomberg Tues., Aug. 23, 2016 They’re cheap, they’re light and they can carry a small bomb; the commercial drone is essentially a new terror gadget for organizations such as Hezbollah, Daesh (also known as Islamic State, ISIS and ISIL), or anyone else looking to wreak havoc on a budget. “That’s the same quad copter you can get on Groupon or go down to Sam’s Club and buy for $400,” U.S. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller said last week at a Washington forum on future warfare. The elusive nature of small drones is one reason the federal government has designated the District of Columbia a “national defense airspace” and prohibited drone flights there. A recent spate of drone-related incidents, including one last year in which a drone crashed on the White House lawn, probably didn’t help, either. But the problem is no longer about enthusiasts with a bad sense of direction. Article Continued Below Weaponized to various degrees of sophistication, such unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now being used in the Syrian civil war and along parts of Lebanese and Syrian borders with Israel, where Hezbollah holds sway. “There has been an increasing concern in the military and a wider acceptance of how pernicious this problem is going to be, moving forward,” says Andrew Metrick, an intelligence security analyst at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. “From a U.S. and allies perspective, we haven’t had to think about how to fight where we don’t have total aerial supremacy.” The U.S. military has begun studying small drones and how best to respond. Earlier this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) issued a request for ideas on how to protect troops from the new threat; it is planning a workshop next month. “We’re looking for scalable, modular, and affordable approaches that could be fielded within the next three to four years and could rapidly evolve with threat and tactical advancements,” a DARPA program manager, Jean-Charles Ledé, said in a statement. Closer to the battlefield, the Marine Corps has begun integrating small drones into training exercises at the Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, Calif., Neller said. A Marine or soldier who spots a drone overhead would typically shoot it down, but smaller drones can operate surreptitiously and elude radar since they are barely larger than a bird. Their small motors make acoustic detection enormously hard, and while wide-area camera sensors deployed on the ground might detect a drone, they usually require large computational resources in the field. One solution is an electronic signal jammer to prevent a drone operator from flying within a certain vicinity, an approach that U.S. forces have studied. Unlike an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), a small drone can’t be used by an enemy to “blow up a tank, but you can more easily attack individual war fighters, you can collect intelligence, and you can tie down a lot of resources by forcing U.S. personnel to respond to the danger,” said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Lexington Institute. “If you think there’s a drone nearby that might be watching you or might be a threat, then you have to be more careful, and that means you’re distracted from your primary mission.” It’s worth noting that the U.S. deploys small drones, typically for reconnaissance and surveillance. One of these, called Switchblade (PDF), is a model from California-based Aerovironment Inc. that’s been used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. The 5.5-lb. drone can carry a lethal charge and has been flown in Syria, Metrick said. When it comes to large drones, the U.S. has shown itself, somewhat controversially, to be without peer. Remotely piloted Reaper and Predator drones have been used in thousands of attacks, including “targeted killings” for more than a decade. And the U.S. has major ocean-going drones: The autonomous Echo Voyager from Boeing Co., for example, can patrol underwater for months. Those drones are all highly advanced platforms, with technology and price tags that put them far out of reach of almost all but the most advanced militaries. For the guerrilla masses, the numerous cheaper, lightweight models are far more accessible. Their easiest use would be simply to monitor U.S. activities. But it’s their potential for modified, deadlier use that worries U.S. military tacticians. “When was the last time an American military force worried about being bombed by enemy air? World War II?” Neller said. “So what capabilities do we have to defend ourselves from enemy air or enemy unmanned air?” Such drones represent only one facet of a future battlefield on which the U.S. military will no longer enjoy complete dominance, the general said. Technology has given potential adversaries new advantages, especially as the U.S. has “developed a system of war fighting that is very dependent upon the internet, the network, and space.” All three are vulnerable because they establish an electronic signature as they operate. Mobile phones, for example, put soldiers in harm’s way in the new digital conflict zone, because a drone might home in on them and explode. “We’ve just got to change,” Neller said, describing a future battlefield in which fighters must become virtually invisible, a return to a time when electronic detection was impossible because there were no satellite radios, Google Earth maps, or GPS-enabled mobile phones. In many ways, the new era he envisions would replicate the operating environment a soldier in 1916 might have known. “You’re living out of your pack. You’re going to stop at night. You’re going to dig a hole. You’re going to camouflage, and you’re going to turn off all your stuff. And you’re going to sit there and try to sleep. And you’re going to be careful to not make any noise and you’re going to try to have absolutely no signature. “Because if you can be seen, you will be attacked. “That’s the difference. “And that’s what we’ve got to get.” Read more about: United States The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Let's start with a skeptical examination of the latest “new” technology, fixed wireless.  AT&T, Google and Verizon are all testing fixed wireless schemes, with the two cellular carriers relying on 4G LTE and to-be-determined 5G technology for faster speeds with less fiber infrastructure deployments.   Fixed wireless services require a cell tower with fiber capacity to deliver services to subscribers, typically with an external antenna for a subscriber.  No fuss, no muss, no trenching. Sounds great! But it all depends on the radio frequencies involved and the load around the cell tower.  One doesn't typically position cell towers and microcells in low-density areas, due to demand for mobile services.  If service is being delivered in higher and/or 5G licensed frequencies, line-of-sight is needed at some point between the service provider and subscriber – easy enough in rural environments if you have a tower, but denser urban environments and cities become a pain.  Service using 5G technology gets into bigger hand waving, since available frequencies will vary from country to country and geography to geography depending on licensing.   Because 5G requires line-of-site, any service provider playing in those frequencies will need to deploy more cells – more than the “thickening” required for 4G urban deployments – and those cells will have to have fiber to provide sustainable speeds akin to, well, fiber.  There are some interesting tricks with mesh networking to extend coverage without the use of fiber, but RF bandwidth and antennas used for networking deducts from available resources to serve customers. Facebook is testing long-duration unmanned aircraft, drones if you prefer.   Each drone will stay aloft at 60,000 feet for weeks at a time, powered by solar energy and connecting to other drones and the ground via laser, with end-user connectivity delivered via laser beam.  But Facebook has many months of work to build and demonstrate a single production-quality end-to-end constellation, delving into aeronautical engineering territory that only NASA and the Department of Defense have explored.  The economics might not work. Large scale satellite networks using several hundred to several thousand satellites in low Earth orbit are all the rage, with players from Boeing to SpaceX having filed plans with the FCC to reserve spectrum and launch test satellites. OneWeb appears the farthest along, with financial backing from Bharti, Coca Cola, Intelsat and contributions from Airbus, Qualcomm and Virgin Galactic  “Cloud” satellite networks offer low latency and coverage of the entire Earth's surface, but nobody's built one with a couple hundred satellite networked together. The Iridium network is the best working example today, with around 66 satellites and spares put up in the 1990s and delivering voice and lower-speed data. OneWeb, in comparison, plans to put at least 648 satellites into orbit starting in 2019-2020, with ground users getting speeds of 50 Mbps per second or faster.   Initially, OneWeb made a lot of noise about delivering broadband everywhere on the planet, but has since shifted to pitch the ability of the network to serve businesses and extend cellular phone coverage.   Good intentions to deliver broadband to the world are one thing, but business customers will be necessary to pay the bills and keep the lights on. How many cloud satellite networks can the market support? Nobody knows. OneWeb has the daunting task to demonstrate that a single cloud satellite network can be a successful business.  LEOSat believes there's room for a cloud network tailored to the high-end enterprise market, delivering low latency and gigabit speeds for corporate and government customers, with performance equal to or better than fiber.  Many cloud satellite network proposals are also facing a battle with terrestrial 5G networks for radio spectrum, with satellite builders trying to stake out spectrum claims before some 5G providers can get their own equipment running. There is no clear winner in the rush to new networks, except for fiber.  Broadband delivered by fiber doesn't have to worry about radio interference and can easily carry hundreds of gigabits to terabits of traffic per second on a single cable. Fiber has outlasted challenges from other schemes, due in part to its maturity and relative simplicity.  Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Doug Mohney Contributing Editor Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Making Sense of SpaceX, Boeing and Other Mega Satellite Broadband Projects By: Doug Mohney    11/22/2016 SpaceX's plan to put a whopping 4,425 satellites into low earth orbit (LEO) is the boldest plan for adding global non-terrestrial broadband capacity, … Read More The Abysmal Pace of New PC Tech By: Doug Mohney    11/22/2016 While storylines of the death of the PC have been running since the release of the iPad and the wave of tablets, it is clear that style has overtaken … Read More Five Ways Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Customer Experience By: Special Guest    11/22/2016 AI is transforming the way companies interact with customers.

Login Register Public Release: 23-Aug-2016 Tech issues cause most drone accidents: Research Increased regulation and reporting of accidents needed for industry: Researchers RMIT University Share  Print  E-Mail World-first research has found technical problems rather than operator errors are behind the majority of drone accidents, leading to a call for further safeguards for the industry. Researchers Dr Graham Wild and Dr Glenn Baxter from RMIT University's School of Engineering, along with John Murray from Edith Cowan University, completed the first examination of more than 150 reported civil incidents around the world involving drones, or Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The study showed technical problems were the cause of 64 per cent of the incidents, which occurred between ¬2006 and 2016. Wild said their findings illustrated the need for further airworthiness requirements for RPAS vehicles, as well as the mandatory reporting of all accidents or incidents. "Understanding what happens to drones, even those that don't cause damage to people or property, is essential to improve safety," he said. The research came about after an incident earlier this year involving a drone and a British Airways Airbus A320 at Heathrow Airport. Recently published in the journal Aerospace, the study found that in most cases, broken communications links between the pilot and the RPAS were the cause of the incident, leading the researchers to call for the introduction of commercial aircraft-type regulations to govern the communications systems. "Large transport category aircraft, such as those from a Boeing or Airbus, are required to have triple redundant systems for their communications," Wild said. "But drones don't and some of the improvements that have reduced the risks in those aircraft could also be used to improve the safety of drones." Wild said more robust communications systems, even on cheaper RPAS, could help prevent accidents. Part of the problem with current regulations was related to the large difference in size between those drones that required licences and those that didn't, he said. Wild said drones weighing less than 25kg did not require any airworthiness certificate, just licences for the pilot, despite the potential damage that could be caused if they failed while flying in a built-up area. "Drones are being used for a wide range of tasks now and there are a lot of day-to-day activities that people want to use them for - delivering pizzas and packages, taking photos, geosurveying, firefighting, and search and rescue," he said. "It's essential that our safety regulations keep up with this rapidly-growing industry." ### For interviews: Dr Graham Wild, +61-3-9925-8051.

This research report titled 'Global Strategic Bomber Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This market research report also includes up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions. In 2015, the Americas had the highest market share of 54.5% due to the ongoing investments for the sustainment of strategic bomber fleets. Simultaneously, investments in the development of new-generation strategic bombers will also play a substantial role in propelling the market in the coming decades. "In the last couple of years, air forces of Russia and China have increased the use of strategic bombers. For instance, Russia is employing strategic bombers to drop heavy munitions to neutralize the rebel forces in Syria, whereas China is developing advanced strategic bombers to maintain its dominance in the South China Sea as well as to combat in long-range warfare," says Arushi Thakur, one of Technavio's industry experts for defense research. Request sample report: http://goo.gl/QINwmQ The report categorizes the global strategic bomber market into three segments based on aircraft engine type: Turbofan Turbojet Turboprop Global turbofan engine strategic bombers market Turbofan engines, also known as bypass jets, are the most efficient engine type compared to its counterparts. With a massive 72.41% market share in 2015, the turbofan segment led the global strategic bomber market and this growth will continue through 2020. Turbofans are the modern version of aircraft turbine engines and are found in most of the new generation supersonic strategic bombers In 1997, the US Air Force introduced one of the most sophisticated long-range strategic bombers, the B-2 Spirit, which was designed and manufactured by Northrop Grumman. The B-2 Spirit is powered by four F118 non-afterburning turbofan engines developed by General Electric, each generating 17,300 pound-force, allowing the aircraft to reach a speed of 0.95 Mach at an altitude of 12,192 meters from sea level. Since 1997, 21 of these aircraft entered into service in the US Air Force. Likewise, the Russian MoD, in collaboration with Kuznetsov, engaged in the R&D efforts to generate up to 35 tons of thrust from the NK-32 afterburning turbofan engine that powers Tu-160 strategic bombers. Such sustainment and modernization efforts for turbofan-powered strategic bombers will have a substantial positive impact on the growth of the market in the coming years. Global turbojet strategic bombers market Turbojet engines are the simplest form of all aircraft turbine engines that consist of four sections, namely compressor, combustion chamber, a turbine section, and exhaust. Turbojet engine-powered strategic bombers have been in service since 1952. Therefore, the need to upgrade the existing technology will be driving the market during the forecast period. The US Air Force currently operates over 60 B-1B Lancer turbojet engine-powered strategic bombers. Over the years, these aircraft underwent numerous technological upgrades to ensure optimum operational capability. In February 2016, the US DoD announced its plan to pull out the B-1B Lancer bombers from its combat mission against Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria, and subsequently, replace them with the B-52 Stratofortress. This strategic move was planned with an aim to modernize the aging fleet of B-1B Lancers. "The upgrade work will include installing integrated battle stations, which have moving maps and enhanced diagnostics systems, as well as the establishment of an automation system that makes an aircraft a more lethal weapon delivery platform," adds Arushi. Global turboprop engine strategic bombers market Turboprop engines provide a greater fuel efficiency and performance at slower airspeeds as compared with turbofans and turbojets. This type of engine is operational only in Tu-95 strategic bombers in service with the Russian Air Force since 1956. In 2013, the Russian MoD initiated modernization programs for its Tu-95 strategic bombers with an aim of enhancing the avionics and the weapon delivery systems of its 16 aircraft fleet. Despite being old, the prime objective of the Russian MoD was to ensure that these aircraft remain operational until 2025-2030. However, the engines and airframes of Tu-95 strategic bombers will not be upgraded. In November 2015, Russian Machines, a Russian conglomerate, delivered the first upgraded Tu-95 strategic bombers that can carry nuclear-tipped missiles. Also, the upgraded Tu-95 is equipped with advanced radio-radar and target navigation system, which functionality is based on the global navigation satellite system. Such development efforts in this segment will drive the strategic bomber market during the forecast period.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Holy Land Principles to Face Cisco Again Holy Land Principles to Face Cisco Again Posted on August 23, 2016 by CSRwire Press Releases, Events and Reports in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer The shareholder campaign forges ahead to hold American companies doing business in Israel/Palestine accountable for their fair employment. The campaign launched in 2012 is the first time ever that the companies were faced with this issue, even though larges numbers of Shareholder Resolutions have been filed since 1972 on all sorts of other SRI (Socially Responsible Investing) issues. These issues and concerns are commonly summed up as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). The Holy Land Principles — an 8-point corporate code of conduct for American companies doing business in Palestine/Israel— are pro-Jewish, pro-Palestinian and pro-company. The Principles do not call for quotas, reverse discrimination, disinvestment/divestment or boycotts—only for fair employment by American companies. The Principles are based on the very effective Mac Bride Principles, which have powerfully advanced fair employment for Catholics in Northern Ireland. Please visit HolyLandPrinciples.org for more information. In particular, view the Animated Internet Video, which presents the issue in a very compelling way. It is the big existential question for American companies in the Holy Land that no longer can be ignored. Fr. Sean McManus— President of the Capitol Hill-based Holy Land Principles, Inc. and Irish National Caucus— said: “The FedEx annual meeting is on Monday, September 26 at 8 AM (Central time) in Memphis, TN. Our Resolution will call on FedEx to sign the Holy Land Principles. Cisco Resolution — the heart of the matter Fr. McManus continued: “However, our Cisco Resolution for the Annual Meeting sometime in November 2016, calls on Cisco —at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information—to disclose the breakdown of its workforce in Palestine/Israel using the nine job categories which are utilized in the U.S. Department of Labor’s EEO -1 Report (Equal Employment Opportunity): 1.Officials and managers; 2. Professionals; 3. Technicians; 4. Sales; 5. Office and clerical; 6. Craft Workers (skilled); 7. Operatives (semiskilled); 8. Laborers (unskilled); 9. Service workers.” (See text of Resolution: http://www.holylandprinciples.org/cisco-shareholder-resolution-for-2016/). Fr. McManus explained: “Cisco proclaims that it is proud of its fair employment in Israel/Palestine. Now we are providing them with a way to verify, following the adage of President Reagan, ‘Trust but verify.’ Surely, this is an eminently reasonable request to make of Cisco? How could Cisco reasonably refuse? This Resolution is also entirely consistent with the Ruggie Principles, which Cisco says it endorses.” Barbara Flaherty— Executive Vice President of Holy Land Principles, Inc. said: “The following eight Resolutions were filed in July for 2017: Coca-Cola, Corning, General Electric, General Motors, Intel, McDonald’s, Pepsi, and UPS. And after September 15, the following 16 will be filed for 2017: 3M, Alphabet (Google), Apple, AT&T, Boeing, Caterpillar, Crawford &Co, ECM, Estee Lauder, FedEx, Lockheed Martin, Marriott, Marsh and McLennan, Pfizer, Proctor & Gamble, and Xerox. Additionally, after the Cisco meeting in November 2016, we will file yet again with Cisco for 2017.” Nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come Fr. Mc Manus concluded: “We set out to fill a vacuum that was crying out to be filled. It is unconscionable that fair employment by American companies in Israel/Palestine was studiously ignored ever since Shareholder Resolutions became popular and, indeed, almost de rigueur—  especially by the faith-based and SRI community. Now our 25 Resolutions for 2017 help to redeem that sad negligence. We look forward to gaining the support of all shareholders, consumers and stakeholders. The Holy Land Principles can promote fair employment in American companies in Palestine/ Israel just as our Mac Bride Principles promote fair employment in the American companies doing business in Northern Ireland. The Holy Land Principles will continue to grow and flourish, because nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.” NOTE OF INTEREST: Fr. McManus appears in the critically acclaimed documentary film, “Bobby Sands: 66 DAYS,” now showing in Ireland and soon to be shown in the USA. Fr. Mc Manus’ role is to explain the American reaction to the 1981 Hunger Strike in which Bobby Sands and his nine colleagues died. Bobby Sands survived for 66 Days, dying on May 5. Fr. Mc Manus himself did a 12-day hunger strike outside the British Embassy in Washington, coming off his hunger strike when Sands died.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    They're cheap, they're light, and they can carry a small bomb: The commercial drone is essentially a new terror gadget for organizations such as Hezbollah, Islamic State, or anyone else looking to wreak havoc on a budget. "That's the same quad copter you can get on Groupon or go down to Sam's Club and buy for $400," U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General Robert Neller said last week at a Washington forum on future warfare. The elusive nature of small drones is one reason the federal government has designated the District of Columbia a "national defense airspace" and prohibited drone flights there. A recent spate of drone-related incidents, including one last year in which a drone crashed on the White House lawn, probably didn't help, either. But the problem is no longer about enthusiasts with a bad sense of direction. Weaponized to various degrees of sophistication, such unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now being used in the Syrian civil war and along parts of Lebanese and Syrian borders with Israel, where Hezbollah holds sway. "There has been an increasing concern in the military and a wider acceptance of how pernicious this problem is going to be, moving forward," says Andrew Metrick, an intelligence security analyst at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. "From a U.S. and allies perspective, we haven't had to think about how to fight where we don't have total aerial supremacy." The U.S. military has begun studying small drones and how best to respond. Earlier this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) issued a request for ideas on how to protect troops from the new threat; it is planning a workshop next month. "We're looking for scalable, modular, and affordable approaches that could be fielded within the next three to four years and could rapidly evolve with threat and tactical advancements," a DARPA program manager, Jean-Charles Ledé, said in a statement.  Closer to the battlefield, the Marine Corps has begun integrating small drones into training exercises at the Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, Calif., Neller said. A Marine or soldier who spots a drone overhead would typically shoot it down, but smaller drones can operate surreptitiously and elude radar since they are barely larger than a bird. Their small motors make acoustic detection enormously hard, and while wide-area camera sensors deployed on the ground might detect a drone, they usually require large computational resources in the field. One solution is an electronic signal jammer to prevent a drone's operator from flying within a certain vicinity, an approach that U.S. forces have studied.  Unlike an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), an enemy using a small drone "can't blow up a tank, but you can more easily attack individual war fighters, you can collect intelligence, and you can tie down a lot of resources by forcing U.S. personnel to respond to the danger," said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Lexington Institute. "If you think there's a drone nearby that might be watching you or might be a threat, then you have to be more careful—and that means you're distracted from your primary mission." It's worth noting that the U.S. also deploys small drones, typically for reconnaissance and surveillance. One of these, called Switchblade (PDF), is a model from California-based Aerovironment Inc. that's been used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. The 5.5 pound drone can carry a lethal charge and has been flown in Syria, Metrick said. When it comes to large drones, the U.S. has shown itself—somewhat controversially—to have no current peer. Remotely piloted Reaper and Predator drones have been used in thousands of attacks, including "targeted killings" for more than a decade. And the U.S. has major ocean-going drones: The autonomous Echo Voyager from Boeing Co., for example, can patrol underwater for months. Those drones are all highly advanced platforms, with technology and price tags that put them far out of reach of almost all but the most advanced militaries. For the guerrilla masses, the numerous cheaper, lightweight models are far more accessible. Their easiest use would be simply to monitor U.S. activities. But it's their potential for modified, deadlier use that worries U.S. military tacticians. "When was the last time an American military force worried about being bombed by enemy air? World War II?" Neller said. "So what capabilities do we have to defend ourselves from enemy air or enemy unmanned air?" Such drones also represent only one facet of a future battlefield on which the U.S. military will no longer enjoy complete dominance, the general said. Technology has given potential adversaries new advantages, especially as the U.S. has "developed a system of war fighting that is very dependent upon the internet, the network, and space." All three are vulnerable because they establish an electronic signature as they operate. Mobile phones, for example, put soldiers in harm's way in the new digital conflict zone, because a drone might home in on them and explode. "We just got to change," Neller said, describing a future battlefield in which fighters must become virtually invisible, a return to a time when electronic detection was impossible because there were no satellite radios, Google Earth maps, or GPS-enabled mobile phones. In many ways, the new era Neller envisions would replicate the operating environment a soldier in 1916 might have known: "You're living out of your pack, you're going to stop at night, you're going to dig a hole, you're going to camouflage, and you're going to turn off all your stuff. And you're going to sit there and try to sleep. And you're going to be careful to not make any noise and you're going to try to have absolutely no signature. Because if you can be seen, you will be attacked. That's the difference. And that's what we got to get."   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

Photo: HT Lockheed Martin Corp.’s offer to shift all of its F-16 manufacturing to India comes with an added benefit for Prime Minister Narendra Modi: A strategic win against nuclear rival Pakistan. The proposal would give India partial control along with the US over which countries are able to purchase F-16 fighter jets and spare parts, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. That may allow India to choke off key supplies to Pakistan, which has relied on F-16s as its main aerial defence for decades, if the US allows it do so. “Some components may be produced only in India,” Abhay Paranjape, director of business development at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said in an interview about the company’s F-16 proposal. Asked whether Pakistan would still be able to source F-16 jets or parts elsewhere under the arrangement, Paranjape said questions about foreign military sales policies should be referred to the US government. Roger Cabiness, a spokesman for the US Department of Defense, in turn referred questions on the sale of F-16 spare parts to Lockheed. The strategic element is a key selling point as Lockheed pushes to win an order that may exceed 100 fighter jets, part of Modi’s plan to spend $150 billion on the armed forces and create jobs under his “Make-in-India” policy. A deal would breathe new life into the F-16, an older model than the stealth F-35 warplane, and further boost US-India defence ties at the expense of Pakistan. India focus “What we are doing is putting India as the center of the supply base,” Randall Howard, Lockheed Martin’s aeronautics business development director, said on 4 August in New Delhi. “Today, there is no potential Pakistan sale.” India and Pakistan have been enemies ever since partition when Britain exited the region in 1947. The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought three wars over disputed territory, and have few economic ties. US relations with Pakistan have worsened in recent years. Congress in May refused to give subsidies for Pakistan to buy new F-16s, prompting it to consider buying used ones from Jordan instead. The US this month withheld another $300 million in military aid to Pakistan over its failure to take action against terrorists carrying out attacks on American troops in neighbouring Afghanistan. Pakistan looking elsewhere Nafees Zakaria, a spokesman for Pakistan’s foreign ministry, declined to answer questions about Lockheed Martin’s F-16 proposal, as did Nungsanglemba Ao, a spokesman for India’s defence ministry. The company’s overtures to India will prompt Pakistan to look more to China and Russia for military hardware, according to Najam Rafique, director at Islamabad’s Institute of Strategic Studies. “Pakistan is diversifying its options,” he said. Competition for the India jet order is fierce. Lockheed Martin’s rivals such as Boeing Co. and Saab AB are all offering to shift some production to India as part of their bids to replenish India’s aging fleet. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Stalled negotiations Modi last year scaled back an earlier deal with Dassault Aviation SA, opting to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets off the shelf instead of building 126 in India after negotiations hit repeated delays. That effort has since stalled over price, providing an opportunity to other jet-makers to step in. It’s unclear when a decision will be made. Lockheed’s proposal attempts to turn its greatest weakness—the fact that Pakistan also flies F-16s —into a main reason for India to acquire the jet. “Since India would house the only existing production line, it would be able to deny Pakistan any further platforms or also have influence on Pakistan Air Force logistics,” said Pushan Das, who follows military modernization at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Lockheed Martin, which is winding down F-16 production in the US, has successfully sold the jet for decades. The proposed facility in India would provide much-needed highly skilled jobs as Modi heads into several important state-level elections in 2017. Manufacturing ‘ecosystem’ “We are not looking at just assembling India’s F-16 here,” Lockheed Martin’s Paranjape said. “We are looking at establishing a complete manufacturing base ecosystem.” Of course, it is still unclear which firm will win India’s lucrative fighter jet contract. Some analysts dismiss the F-16 as a dated “fourth generation” platform opposed by the Indian Air Force because it won’t have major upgrades in the future. Others like Georgetown University associate professor C. Christine Fair have suggested New Delhi is unlikely to get a more advanced fighter jet made in India because of difficulties with transferring state-of-the-art technology. While many obstacles remain, an agreement with Lockheed Martin would cement closer ties between the nations if the US government doesn’t prevent the transfer of advanced radar or avionics technologies, according to Anit Mukherjee, an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If this deal was to happen—and that’s a big if—then it will be a big plus for US—India relations and a significant indicator of the transformation in the defence relationship,” he said. “If this deal goes through, and the US is honest about tech transfer, then it has the potential to really build up India’s military-industrial base.” Bloomberg Topics: F-16LockheedFighter jetsIndiaPakistan More from this Section Govt reaches out to opposition to break logjam in Parliament over note ban Karnataka govt appoints retired judge to probe suicide of DySP Ganapathy Cabinet push for Jawahar Navodaya schools, new merchant shipping bill Sartaj Aziz to visit India in December for Heart of Asia conference Jute workers to get paid via bank transfer Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Tracking demonetisation: Our reading list India may gain from Donald Trump’s TPP pullout threat First Published: Tue, Aug 23 2016. 02 34 PM IST Read more from Livemint The propaganda of currency patriotism Airlines brace for demonetisation headwinds by advancing flash sales Govt reaches out to opposition to break logjam in Parliament over note ban Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Latest News The propaganda of currency patriotism Airlines brace for demonetisation headwinds by advancing flash sales Govt reaches out to opposition to break logjam in Parliament over note ban Raising resources using climate-resilient bonds West Bengal is revising its social contract Mint On Sunday The dilemma of Draupadī’s disrobing The prodigals return to Neroca US elections: How slogans can make or break a candidate Now, the crowd can bankroll your research How to maximize judicial time Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2016 HT Media Ltd.

Ariane 5 is approved for this week's Arianespace launch with two Intelsat payloads by Staff Writers Kourou, French Guiana (ESA) Aug 23, 2016 File image. Arianespace's fourth Ariane 5 flight of 2016 has been given the "green light" for liftoff on Wednesday following the prelaunch readiness review, which was conducted at the Spaceport in French Guiana. This milestone - held prior to each Arianespace mission from the near-equatorial launch base - confirms the heavy-lift vehicle and its dual-satellite payload are flight-ready, along with the Spaceport's infrastructure and the network of downrange tracking stations. The approval also clears Ariane 5 for tomorrow's rollout from the Final Assembly Building to the ELA-3 launch zone, where it is scheduled for liftoff on August 24 during a 45-minute launch window opening at 6:55 p.m. local time in French Guiana. A dual-passenger launch for Intelsat Designated Flight VA232 in Arianespace's numbering system, this week's mission has an estimated payload lift performance of 10,735 kg. - a total that factors in the two satellite passengers, Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36, plus the SYLDA dispenser system and integration hardware. Intelsat 33e is to be deployed first during the 41-minute flight sequence and will operate from an orbital position of 60 deg. East. Built by Boeing using a 702MP spacecraft platform, it is the second satellite in Intelsat's next-generation high-throughput Intelsat EpicNG series - joining Intelsat 29e, which was launched by Arianespace aboard another Ariane 5 in January. Installed in the lower payload position, Intelsat 36 will be the second passenger released by Ariane 5. It was manufactured by SSL (Space Systems Loral) based on the company's 1300 platform, and will operate from the 68.5 deg. East orbital position - where Intelsat 36 will be co-located with the Intelsat 20 satellite launched by Arianespace in August 2012.

Russia's 'US Missile Defense-Killing' Hypersonic Rockets Arriving Soon by Staff Writers Moscow (Sputnik) Aug 23, 2016 A hypersonic missile design displayed at an exhibition staged by the Raduga Design Bureau. Image courtesy Sergey Mamontov and Sputnik. Russian defense analyst Vladimir Tuchkov analyses Russian, Chinese and American developments in hypersonic weapons technology, including the expected timeframe for their deployment, which is sooner than you may expect. Last week, Tactical Missile Systems Corporation general director Boris Obnosov told Russian media that he was confident that Russia would be introducing hypersonic missiles capable of speeds between Mach 6 and Mach 7 by the year 2020. The director emphasized that such weapons would significantly weaken the potential of enemy missile defense. "It's obvious that with such speeds - when missiles will be capable of flying through the atmosphere at speeds of 7-12 times the speed of sound, all [air] defense systems will be weakened considerably." Tactical Missile Systems Corporation (KTRV by its Russian acronym) is based in Korolyev, outside Moscow. Several dozen specialized research institutes and industrial enterprises are involved in the development of Russia's hypersonic missile potential, with KTRV a leader in this area not only in Russia but also compared to defense engineering companies globally. Obnosov's comments come on the heels of a recent speech by Admiral Cecil Haney, the Head of US Strategic Command, in which the admiral warned that American anti-missile and anti-aircraft defense systems will be virtually incapable of intercepting the Russian hypersonic systems expected to be deployed soon. Commenting on these developments in a piece for Svobodnaya Pressa, Russian defense analyst Vladimir Tuchkov pointed out that while supersonic weapons have become a very popular topic of discussion today, their development actually began much, much earlier, going back to the Cold War. The analyst recalled that "in the 1970s, the Raduga Design Bureau, now a part of KTRV, began research exploring the possibility of creating a cruise missile with a speed of Mach 5 or greater. At the time, the problem was little studied. Firstly, it was impossible to use ordinary turbojet engines for speeds in excess of Mach 3. The sharp increase in air speed pressure resulted in a loss of efficiency in the engines, with a sharp rise in temperature in the combustion chamber of the air-fuel mixture also reducing efficiency. The higher the temperature, the lower the thrust. Moreover, as temperatures rose, so too did the risk of the rocket's turbine blades becoming deformed and simply melting." "In this situation," Tuchkov noted, "the only option is the use of a ramjet engine - in this case a hypersonic scramjet. The use of a rocket engine, either liquid or solid fueled, for cruise missiles, is impossible, since the entire trajectory of the flight must be actively controlled and adjustable." "The design of the scramjet is very simple, with the number of moving parts reduced to a minimum. Theoretically, these craft can reach speeds of up to Mach 25, although the practical ceiling of operation is about Mach 17-19. However, the scramjet also has a significant drawback - its normal operation begins at speeds exceeding Mach 3. Before this speed, it is necessary to accelerate the missile using a solid booster, or some other method, similar to the kind used to launch a high-speed aircraft." The analyst recalled that when development of hypersonic missile technology first began in the Soviet period, one of the key problems for engineers was overheating. "It was necessary to create the kind of heat shield through which the onboard flight control equipment would continue to work flawlessly." In the 1980s, Raduga Design Bureau created several prototypes of a new cruise missile - the Kh-90, NATO codenamed Koala. The cruise missile weighed 15 tons, had a length of 9 meters, and a 7 meter wingspan. With an expected range of up to 3,000 km, the missile had a design speed of Mach 5. "The project," Tuchkov noted, "advanced far enough for several test launches to be conducted. During the last of them, the missile reached speeds ranging from Mach 3 to Mach 4." The missile was aircraft-launched. Of course, "all of the USSR's hypersonic weapons designs were strictly classified. It was only due to the fact that the project was closed in 1992 thanks to a lack of financing and the collapse of the defense industry in general that some information about the Kh-90 has become publically available." After a period of stagnation in the 1990s, development resumed. Today, the analyst noted, Russia has reached a point where it has created and is actively testing at least two hypersonic systems. "This includes the 3K-22 Zircon anti-ship cruise missile, the main developer of which is the NPO Machine Building plant in Reutov, outside Moscow, which is also part of KTRV. At the same time, an export version of the missile, known as the Brahmos, is being developed for the Indian Navy." The first information about the Zircon appeared in 2011, with testing beginning a year later. "To date, five test launches have been made...During the last launch, in March of this year, the rocket was successfully tested in normal operation mode." Effectively, Tuchkov noted, "work on the Zircon is progressing so rapidly that the first state testing is expected to begin next year, and mass production the year after that, in 2018. In this connection, the Tactical Missile System Corporation director's forecasts about the year 2020 looks quite modest." "Of course, he is talking about speeds of Mach 6-7, while the Zircon's design speed is 'only' Mach 5. Various estimates suggest its range may be between 400 and 1,000 km. Precise information on the engines is not available, but informed analysts suggest that acceleration is carried out via a reactive solid booster, with a scramjet used as the main engine." Furthermore, the Zircon has already been slated for installation onboard the heavy nuclear missile cruisers - the Peter the Great and the Admiral Nakhimov. It is also expected that a new Russian nuclear submarine, codenamed Project-Husky, currently under development, will be equipped with the Zircon. "As for Project 4202, it appears that this system will be able to meet and surpass the speeds discussed by Tactical Missiles Corporation's director. This missile too is being developed by the NPO Machine Building plant. To be more precise - this is not an independent missile, but rather a warhead onboard an intercontinental ballistic missile, which, after separation from the launch vehicle, acts like a hypersonic cruise missile would, maneuvering freely to determine direction and pitch." According to informed estimates, Project 4202 is capable of speeds between Mach 7 and Mach 12. For this reason, Tuchkov noted, the system can overcome "not only modern means of US missile defense, but even those systems which American engineers have not even begun to develop yet." The testing of Russia's hypersonic gliders is taking place using the tried and true RS-18B 'Stiletto' silo-based ICBMs, used to accelerate them up to the appropriate speed. "After being adopted by the military, Project 4202 will be installed aboard the new RS-28 Sarmat, and on future Russian ICBM designs. This is expected to take place between 2020 and 2025. When the expected first batch of 20 supersonic warheads is rolled out, it will effectively make the US missile defense system pointless. Every Sarmat will feature three hypersonic combat gliders." Foreign Analogues: USA Of course Russia is not the only country engaged in the creation of prospective hypersonic weaponry. The X-51, being developed by the Boeing Corporation under the aegis of the Pentagon's 'prompt global strike' concept, is expected to reach speeds of Mach 6-7. Testing began in 2010, but, as Tuchkov pointed out, none of them have been deemed successful so far. Brought into the air aboard a B-52 strategic bomber, the X-51, with a range of 500 km, has clocked a maximum speed of Mach 5.1. "However, all flights ended in the destruction of the test missile before the end of its planned flight." "Setting out on this costly project, the US positioned it as a tool for effective and lighting-speed strikes against terrorist groups. However, there is no doubt that the Pentagon also had in mind the traditional confrontation with Russia, and against a rapidly developing China. Yet the X-51, even if it is brought into mass production, will not solve the problems it was designed to handle, since the prospective Russian S-500 anti-aircraft missile system is expected to be capable of destroying hypersonic missiles." In this sense, Tuchkov noted, the DARPA program's Falcon HTV-2 has better characteristics in terms of its speed, having been successfully clocked at Mach 20. But the vehicle was launched from near space, first carried up by rocket booster, from where it hurled back down to earth. "In other words, there's nothing new here; the US Space Shuttles and our Buran flew in similar fashion. Following the second test, which took place in 2011, the missile was recognized as unpromising, since it was almost uncontrollable, and impossible to establish communications with." Foreign Analogues: China China too is actively involved in the development of hypersonic technology, beginning with its WU-14 rocket, which began testing in 2013. An average of three tests per year has taken place since then. The system's declared speed is Mach 10, although as Tuchkov pointed out, a variety of contradictory information has been circulating, estimating speeds from Mach 1.5 to Mach 7. "Series production of the WU-14 is expected to begin in the second half of the 2020s, and it is expected to be mounted on ballistic missiles, which for the Chinese is very important. Today, only a small number of Chinese ICBMs is capable of reaching the US, giving the Pentagon the hypothetical ability to fight off a Chinese nuclear attack. For Beijing, this is not only insulting, but disadvantageous in the diplomatic competition between the powers. With the arrival of hypersonic warheads, the US is expected to 'behave' more prudently." "Another task entrusted to the new weapon is the destruction of aircraft carriers; their defenses would be powerless against maneuverable warheads traveling at speeds of Mach 10."

Although the number of commercial jets is small compared to the number of cars, trucks and buses, airplanes produce the third-highest total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, according to Janet McCabe, the Environmental Protection Agency’s acting assistant administrator for air and radiation. Unlike other vehicles, airplanes are not subject to emission regulations, even though the EPA and the United Nations say that planes are responsible for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, the EPA announced that it will use its authority under the Clean Air Act to require reduced aircraft emissions, excluding small piston-engine and military planes. It is on the mark in doing so, despite opposition from aircraft manufacturers and airlines. The U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization recommended in February that emissions by international flights be reduced by 4 percent at cruising altitude by 2020 for planes under design, and by 2023 for planes in production. The EPA is expected to adopt similar standards for domestic flights. The big producers, Boeing and Airbus, already are moving in that direction by competing aggressively for fuel-efficient designs. And airlines are moving that way with fewer flights and higher passenger loads. Both industries and fuel producers are cooperating in developing lower-emission renewable fuels. Boeing estimates that the current global fleet of commercial jets will increase from about 20,000 now to more than 40,000 by 2040, making it all the more crucial to reduce their pollution.

Among the day’s presentations and panel discussions was an extensive conversation about the current state of wide-format graphics and opportunities in the market for commercial printers. By Richard Romano Published: August 23, 2016 Last week, the Printing Industries Alliance hosted an all-day “Post-drupa Report” at Manhattan’s Club 101, which drew an audience of more than 100 printers, mailers, and graphic arts service providers. The full slate of presentations and panel discussions ran the gamut from color management and prepress to postpress and finishing, and highlighted technology and product introductions at last spring’s drupa. One of the panel discussions covered wide-format graphics. Moderated by Denise Gustavson, editorial director of Wide Format & Signage magazine, the panel included David Kehoe of Canon Solutions America, Marc Johnson of HP, and Kristof Dekeukelaere of Landa Digital Printing. Introduced by Gustavson as “truly one of the bright spots of the industry,” wide-format printing was highly visible at drupa (as our coverage indicated), and while there were few new product introductions (save for corrugated packaging) display graphics of all kinds were, well, on display, the response to a market that by virtually every metric is experiencing strong growth. The panelists were in agreement that the number one issue for wide-format print providers was increasing speed. “In display graphics, there’s the need for faster turnaround time, while maintaining the highest print quality for indoor and outdoor graphics,” said Kehoe.  Retailers—perhaps the most conspicuous of wide-format print buyers—are eager to speed time to market, while at the same time striving to customize in-store POP and other displays. “They want to hyper-localize information to a specific city, to a store, even to a season,” said Johnson. Retail displays that would at one time have been printed in long, static offset runs, kitted, and shipped en masse to all of a brand’s stores are now more and more produced in short runs tailored to each specific location. Sometimes this localization is for very practical reasons. “Prices can differ from one state to another,” said Dekeukelaere, “and even from the city to the suburbs.” At the same time, a retailer’s product mix can very often vary by geographic region: you don’t find many snow shovels and ice melter in stores in the Southwest, for example. Brandowners are also standardizing the look and feel across all elements of a marketing campaign, and display graphics are playing a bigger role in those campaigns. Take direct mail. “It’s mailed to customers and they bring that direct mail piece to the store,” said Johnson. “The poster, all the way down to the endcaps, are all drawn off the same campaign.” And, at the same time, “it’s hyper-localized to the store,” Johnson added. So when we talk about growth in wide-format volume, its not what we normally think about when we think of volume. “There’s a lot of volume, but it’s a lot of small pieces,” said Kehoe. “Brandowners are asking, ‘who can turn this the fastest?’” Hence the need for speed without sacrificing quality. It’s not just retailers. The hospitality industry, for example, is taking advantage of display graphics. “If a hotel is hosting a corporate meeting for, say, Boeing,” said Johnson, “the graphics in the meeting space reflect that.” Then, when another company books the space, the graphics are swapped out. “The margins you can make on this are great,” he added. So what market segments did the panelists see as the biggest growth areas? Wallpaper and other forms of décor were cited by virtually all the panelists. “Take wallpaper,” said Kehoe, “People wouldn’t change their wallpaper for 20 years. Now they can change it once a month. These are extremely profitable segments to be in.” As the number of print applications expands, many micro-segments are appearing. HP’s Johnson identified architectural firms and even hospitals. “Hospitals are putting clings on an MRI machine,” he said. “These are all things that weren’t possible 10 years ago.” Floor coverings, draperies, and more were also cited as strong growth areas. The panelists also mentioned a feature that will be debuting at the upcoming Graph Expo 2016: “The House That Print Built,” a show floor destination in which the floor, walls, and furniture were all printed on wide-format or other specialty graphics equipment. We’ve seen this kind of thing at past SGIA Expos, but these applications are now moving more decisively into general commercial printing. Another driver, related to localization, is personalization, especially at the consumer level. “Vehicle graphics are a consumer product,” said Johnson. “And using wide-format printers, it’s easy to print phone or tablet covers.” That’s a function of the versatility of today’s equipment. “These may not be applications you bought the printer for,” said Johnson, “but you can do them.” As you may have gleaned from this space over the past year or so, fabric and textile printing are also big growth areas. Why? “There are very low manufacturing costs, the colors can be more vibrant, and you can overcome the challenges of shipping since you’re just shipping a piece of fabric,” said Kehoe. “Fabric is the new signage,” said Johnson. “Look at how  many trade show booths now have some kind of textile-based signage.” Despite all the interest in fabric printing, the panelists agreed that apparel printing is not an area that they have found too many commercial printers looking to get into, except perhaps screen printers eyeing a move into digital. And then there’s Maude: what about corrugated packaging? “The limitation had been that there was no digital technology that could print corrugated, said Dekeukelaere. As a result, brandowners have a pent-up desire for the ability to do short-run corrugated. “Before they do long runs, they want to prototype everything,” said Kehoe. “They want to do test runs.” There are also more and more customers who don’t need to do long production runs and are asking for short-run corrugated packaging. “They’re saying, ‘we don’t want 10,000 boxes,’” said Kehoe. So, how do commercial printers—or anyone else—take advantage of these new growth areas? “You need to have a plan,” said Kehoe. “You can’t just buy the equipment and hope customers will come.” Digital wide-format printing is disrupting some of the traditional display graphics markets. “Sign companies are completely different today than they were five years ago,” said Kehoe. For commercial printers, that’ a good thing. “They want commercial printers to come in,” Kehoe added, “because there is just so much work.” However, the one important piece of advice Kehoe stressed was: “Don’t drop your margins.” Other panels at the Printing Industries Alliance event included drupa observations and an offset vs. digital discussion, both moderated by WhatTheyThink’s Patrick Henry; a session on color management, labels, and packaging, moderated by Steve Katz, editor of Label and Narrow Web; and a conversation about postpress and finishing moderated by yours truly.     Tweet       Email    Print    Order Reprints Please offer your feedback to Richard.

Finding someone with management and transportation experience, who can work for far less than what the private sector could pay, is proving impossible. That's why whoever is hired is likely to be a management expert outside the industry who has already made enough money and "wants to give back," according to a Port Authority source familiar with the deliberations. "We have high expectations for a person who is a jack-of-all-trades," the source said. But it's likely there will be an interim hire where the focus is more on leadership and management. The challenge of choosing an apolitical CEO is that any leader must be aware of the politics involved in running the agency. That was a problem John Degnan, the board chairman and appointee of Gov. Chris Christie, faced recently when community opposition erupted over plans for a new bus terminal, even though planning had been ongoing for years. Now the agency is hitting the reset button on that project. Another Port Authority executive said: "All options are on the table." The CEO search is a national one, and I could see a number of former Fortune 500 CEOs coming out of retirement to fill the job—should they not mind the accompanying headaches. Former Ford CEO Alan Mulally came from Boeing to steer the automaker through the Great Recession. He knows how to take a skill set from one industry and apply it to another. Ivan Seidenberg led Verizon and is a part owner of the Mets. He understands local. And Kevin Burke, who left Con Ed after 40 years with the utility, can certainly run a service company that operates in the public domain. There are many other exceptional private-sector managers and leaders. Yet the post remains unfilled. It's a sad statement. The Port Authority used to be a magnet for talented New Yorkers, especially engineers who saw themselves as being the master builders of the region. Not anymore.

QuickTake Pakistan’s Turmoil The proposal would give India partial control along with the U.S. over which countries are able to purchase F-16 fighter jets and spare parts, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. That may allow India to choke off key supplies to Pakistan, which has relied on F-16s as its main aerial defense for decades, if the U.S. allows it do so. “Some components may be produced only in India," Abhay Paranjape, director of business development at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said in an interview about the company’s F-16 proposal. Asked whether Pakistan would still be able to source F-16 jets or parts elsewhere under the arrangement, Paranjape said questions about foreign military sales policies should be referred to the U.S. government. Roger Cabiness, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense, in turn referred questions on the sale of F-16 spare parts to Lockheed. The strategic element is a key selling point as Lockheed pushes to win an order that may exceed 100 fighter jets, part of Modi’s plan to spend $150 billion on the armed forces and create jobs under his “Make-in-India" policy. A deal would breathe new life into the F-16, an older model than the stealth F-35 warplane, and further boost U.S.-India defense ties at the expense of Pakistan. India Focus “What we are doing is putting India as the center of the supply base," Randall Howard, Lockheed Martin’s aeronautics business development director, said on Aug. 4 in New Delhi.  “Today, there is no potential Pakistan sale." India and Pakistan have been enemies ever since partition when Britain exited the region in 1947. The nuclear-armed neighbors have fought three wars over disputed territory, and have few economic ties. U.S. relations with Pakistan have worsened in recent years. Congress in May refused to give subsidies for Pakistan to buy new F-16s, prompting it to consider buying used ones from Jordan instead. The U.S. this month withheld another $300 million in military aid to Pakistan over its failure to take action against terrorists carrying out attacks on American troops in neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan Looking Elsewhere Nafees Zakaria, a spokesman for Pakistan’s foreign ministry, declined to answer questions about Lockheed Martin’s F-16 proposal, as did Nungsanglemba Ao, a spokesman for India’s defense ministry. The company’s overtures to India will prompt Pakistan to look more to China and Russia for military hardware, according to Najam Rafique, director at Islamabad’s Institute of Strategic Studies. “Pakistan is diversifying its options," he said. Competition for the India jet order is fierce. Lockheed Martin’s rivals such as Boeing Co. and Saab AB are all offering to shift some production to India as part of their bids to replenish India’s aging fleet. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Stalled Negotiations Modi last year scaled back an earlier deal with Dassault Aviation SA, opting to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets off the shelf instead of building 126 in India after negotiations hit repeated delays. That effort has since stalled over price, providing an opportunity to other jet-makers to step in. It’s unclear when a decision will be made. Lockheed’s proposal attempts to turn its greatest weakness -- the fact that Pakistan also flies F-16s -- into a main reason for India to acquire the jet. “Since India would house the only existing production line, it would be able to deny Pakistan any further platforms or also have influence on Pakistan Air Force logistics," said Pushan Das, who follows military modernization at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Lockheed Martin, which is winding down F-16 production in the U.S., has successfully sold the jet for decades. The proposed facility in India would provide much-needed highly skilled jobs as Modi heads into several important state-level elections in 2017. Manufacturing ‘Ecosystem’ “We are not looking at just assembling India’s F-16 here," Lockheed Martin’s Paranjape said. “We are looking at establishing a complete manufacturing base ecosystem." Of course, it is still unclear which firm will win India’s lucrative fighter jet contract.  Some analysts dismiss the F-16 as a dated “fourth generation" platform opposed by the Indian Air Force because it won’t have major upgrades in the future. Others like Georgetown University associate professor C. Christine Fair have suggested New Delhi is unlikely to get a more advanced fighter jet made in India because of difficulties with transferring state-of-the-art technology. While many obstacles remain, an agreement with Lockheed Martin would cement closer ties between the nations if the U.S. government doesn’t prevent the transfer of advanced radar or avionics technologies, according to Anit Mukherjee, an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If this deal was to happen -- and that’s a big if -- then it will be a big plus for U.S.-India relations and a significant indicator of the transformation in the defense relationship," he said. “If this deal goes through, and the U.S. is honest about tech transfer, then it has the potential to really build up India’s military-industrial base."

(Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP) Share Written by Adam Epstein Obsession Energy Shocks August 24, 2016 There’s a profanity-laced line in the 2006 cult classic Snakes on a Plane in which Samuel L. Jackson expresses his frustration with still having to deal with said snakes on said plane (video). That’s probably how Bill Nye feels about still having to repeatedly explain the reality of climate change in 2016. “The Science Guy,” the science educator best known for his beloved 1990s educational videos, appeared on CNN yesterday (Aug. 23) to discuss the recent flooding in Louisiana that killed 13 people, damaged 60,000 homes, and forced the evacuation of thousands of others. Nye was clear about what’s to blame for the disaster. “This is the result of climate change,” he said. “It’s only going to get worse.” Last week, a slow-moving, low-pressure storm hit parts of coastal Louisiana, creating torrential downpours that resulted in as much as 31 inches of rainfall over a two-day period. The Red Cross is calling the consequent flooding the worst natural disaster in the US since Hurricane Sandy, which killed over 200 people across the country’s eastern seaboard in 2012. “As the ocean gets warmer, which it is getting, it expands,” Nye explained. “Molecules spread apart, and then as the sea surface is warmer, more water evaporates, and so it’s very reasonable that these storms are connected to these big effects.” Scientists from around the world have concurred with Nye that this is exactly what the effects of climate change look like, and that disasters like the Louisiana floods are going to happen more and more. According to a National Academy of Sciences report published earlier this year, extreme flooding can be traced directly to human-induced global warming. As the atmosphere warms, it retains more moisture, leading to bouts of sustained, heavy precipitation that can cause floods. Recent floods over the past year in Maryland, Texas, West Virginia, South Carolina, and Oklahoma have killed dozens and displaced thousands more. Low-lying places like Louisiana are particularly susceptible to extreme flooding, especially as sea levels rise across the globe. After he was done explaining how climate change led to the flooding, Nye called out CNN for employing a “climate change denier” as one of their meteorologists. Nye was likely referring to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers, who has a history of climate change denial but has since renounced those views. “A scientist can be swayed by data and I was,” Myers tweeted yesterday. For Nye, a Cornell-educated, former Boeing engineer and current head of the nonprofit research organization The Planetary Society, explaining climate change was another day at the office. But at this point, Nye would probably prefer to start advocating for specific, real-life fixes to the climate problem, and not just trying to convince everyone that solutions are needed.

"Every IP licensing arrangement or patent litigation process requires direct interaction with government officials. However, emphasis should be put to differentiate political environment and judiciary," said F. Scott Kieff, Commissioner, United States International Trade Commission (USITC). He further said the judicial decision-making is the key to regulate property rights, predictability, economic growth and competition and a predictable and flexible system is required to facilitate innovation and competition. He was speaking at a conference on innovation, competition and intellectual property rights (IPR) issues pertaining to the information, communication and technology (ICT) sector organised by Jindal Initiative on Research in IP and Competition (JIRICO). JIRICO is an initiative of O.P. Jindal Global University. The two-day forum, organised over the weekend, witnessed participation of over 50 speakers from 10 government agencies, 16 universities and 15 leading corporations and law firms. Raj Kumar, Vice-Chancellor, O.P. Jindal Global University, said hosting the global forum was part of the larger effort of the university to engage in policy-making, by bringing together a diverse set of policy practitioners and stakeholders, under one single platform. "If you don't get protection, you will not have the incentive to innovate. The patent system in our country provides a limited monopoly of 20 years. But to transform the IPR regime of India, a lot more needs to be done, and DIPP (Department of Industrial Policy and Promotio looks forward to the expert opinions and key recommendations from this conference in this regard," said Rajiv Aggarwal, Joint Secretary, DIPP, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. "Modern corporations have understood that technology is a value-enabler for competition in the modern day business. Development and innovation in the aerospace and defence, should be shared in the open domain. This is what Boeing does as a market leader and research and development will significantly benefit from this," said Akhil Prasad, Country Counsel India, Boeing International Corporation. --IANS ag/ask/dg Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Ratan Tata's ego caused financial mess for group firms: Cyrus Mistry Demonetisation: Problem of plenty for RBI as banks park record Rs 4.32 lakh crore Supreme Court refuses to stay petitions against demonetisation Demonetisation: Union Minister latest victim as hospital declines to accept old notes No transaction charges on debit card payments: Govt More From Current Affairs Eiffel Tower's stairway section sold for half million euros Government approves new 62 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Congress panel on Punjab polls duscusses candidate selection Government shuffles five senior-level officers Old currency notes can be deposited in post office accounts [ more ] Top Stories Zee acquires 2 TV channels of Reliance Group; 49% in FM channels business ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod Rs 1 lakh crore shaved off Tata group cos' m-cap since Mistry's ouster F C Kohli debunks Mistry's TCS sale claim [ more ] Markets Intervention brakes rupee near record as $2.8 bn flees Sensex rises 91 pts, closes above 26,000 ICICI Prudential MF's attraction story Fall below 7,900 could take Nifty to 7,500-7,600 levels Profit-sharing deals with PEs will need shareholders' nod [ more ] Companies Tata Motors calls EGM to remove Mistry, Wadia Facebook builds China filter as hurdles linger Wadia sends third notice to Tata Sons Mistry knows where all the bodies are buried in Tata Group: Kumar Sun Pharma's sharpens emerging market focus with $60 mn acquisition in Russia [ more ] Opinion Gujarat Gas results set off downgrades Expect lower growth at Eicher Reliance Industries valuation at 10-yr low Don't revive inspector raj Resolving a disagreement [ more ] Latest News CERC for change in power transmission bid rules House Panel raps Centre for slow progress in PDS digitisation Tata Motors calls EGM to remove Mistry, Wadia GST Council meet put off by a week as consensus eludes Facebook builds China filter as hurdles linger [ more ] Today's Paper Tata Motors calls EGM to remove Mistry, Wadia Facebook builds China filter as hurdles linger Wadia sends third notice to Tata Sons Mistry knows where all the bodies are buried in Tata Group: Kumar Sun Pharma's sharpens emerging market focus with $60 mn acquisition in Russia [ more ] News you can use Demonetisation: Stricter norms for NRIs Spread equity investments over three-four months Deposits above Rs 2.5 lakh: Don't panic if you receive the I-T notice Expect your household budget to shoot up: Going cashless comes at a cost Opportunities amid chaos New Balance created its PR crisis.

The nation’s biggest carrier will pay a final dividend of 7 Australian cents a share and buy back as much as A$366 million ($279 million) of stock, according to a filing Wednesday. Earnings before tax and one-time items surged 57 percent to A$1.53 billion in the 12 months ended June 30. Joyce, who has cut thousands of jobs, deferred aircraft orders and dropped unprofitable routes as part of a A$2 billion transformation program, said the three-year plan is now on course to exceed its target. The regular dividend has returned earlier than some analysts had expected. “Qantas is in a really sweet spot,’’ said Angus Nicholson, a market analyst at IG Ltd. “A regular dividend in this global environment is going to be a real positive. It shows you how consistently the company can hold these gains going forward.’’ The airline’s shares rose 4.1 percent to A$3.54 at 10:10 a.m. in Sydney. Qantas stock has almost tripled since Joyce announced his turnaround program on Feb. 27, 2014. Before today, Sydney-based Qantas had made two one-off capital returns totaling more than A$1 billion in the past year. Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. have already restarted paying dividends after the global financial crisis. Surplus Capital Future surplus capital will be distributed first to shareholders in the form of a dividend, combined with share buybacks and one-off payments, Qantas said Wednesday. “We do see the strong performance of the company continuing,’’ Joyce said on a call with reporters. “Thanks to our transformation program, we’re making money.’’ The cash bonus for workers, including pilots, cabin crew and ground staff, will total A$75 million. Underlying operating profit at Qantas’s domestic business rose 20 percent to A$578 million, and soared 92 percent to A$512 million at its international unit. The measure at the Qantas loyalty frequent-flier unit rose 10 percent A$346 million and almost doubled to A$452 million at budget carrier Jetstar. International Alliances Rather than throw capital on its own international routes, Joyce has favored alliances with Emirates, China Eastern Airlines and American Airlines to generate profitable revenue. The weaker Australian dollar has also drawn more overseas visitors to Australia. Group net income jumped 84 percent to A$1.03 billion in the year to June. The transformation program has now wrung out A$1.66 billion in benefits—a figure that is now expected to reach A$2.1 billion by June 2017—Joyce said Wednesday. Qantas this financial year is due to receive the first of eight fuel-efficient Boeing Co. Dreamliners, after deferring its eight remaining A380 Airbus superjumbos. Joyce is considering deploying the Dreamliner on a direct Perth-to-London route that would rank among the world’s longest flights. On Australia’s eastern seaboard, other possible routes for the aircraft include Brisbane to the U.S., Melbourne to Dallas or Sydney to Chicago.

By: PTI | Washington | Updated: August 23, 2016 6:21 pm NASA plans to handover the control of ISS to a private company. NASA is planning to hand over the control of the International Space Station (ISS) to a commercial company around the mid 2020s, the US space agency has said. “NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit,” said Bill Hill, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development. “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit,” said Hill, speaking on a panel of NASA staff assembled to discuss the upcoming Mars mission. The timing fits with the end of the US government’s current funding of the ISS programme, which was extended by Obama administration from its original deorbiting date of 2016 through 2020, ‘Tech Crunch’ reported. Operations were prolonged through 2024 to help give NASA a platform from which to run its near-Earth preparatory missions leading up to the ultimate manned mission to Mars. However, NASA did not specify any potential buyer. A new docking adapter is being put in place to support crew shuttle missions from Boeing and SpaceX, both of which are set to start shuttling personnel to the ISS in 2017. SpaceX has been running resupply missions for the space station and NASA since 2012, and has completed nine such missions to date.

The agency is hoping to hand over control of the orbiting laboratory to a commercial entity sometime in the next decade, it said. NASA made the announcement during a press conference yesterday on its plans for future manned missions to Mars. “NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-Earth orbit,” said Bill Hill, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development. “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit.” In a blog post, NASA expanded on the idea, saying that: “Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” and that today’s solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability”. NASA said no more than that, not even mentioning any potential buyers by name. Any deal would likely be complicated too, given that the ISS is managed by a group of international partners, including the Russia’s Roscosmos space agency and the European Space Agency. It’s not clear what they have to say about the idea. Coincidentally, NASA’s announcement comes just days after Roscosmos made an announcement that it’s looking at the possibility of reducing its ISS crew contingent from three to two. NASA and Russia are committed to maintaining the ISS until 2024, which is the orbital platform’s current end-of-life date. However, today’s declaration suggests NASA may be looking to extract itself from the arrangement sooner in order to free up the $4 billion a year it spends on ISS for deep space missions. By handing over ISS to the private sector, NASA would have more funds to spend on proposed crewed missions to Mars and asteroids.

(Space X) and The Boeing Company, both of which are on track to begin flying astronauts to the ISS by 2018 anyway, and would likely benefit from data on how to minimize the effects of space on the human body. Other interested parties might be commercial space tourism entities such as Virgin Galactic Ltd. and Blue Orgin LLC, which could use the space station to offer extended vacations in zero gravity.
