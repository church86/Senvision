Iran News ... 09/20/16 First Boeing Jet Joins Iran's Naft Airline: Report Source: Press TV Iranian Naft Airlines, a homebound charter airline providing passenger and cargo services to Iran's Ministry of Petroleum, says it has received the first Boeing jet. The aircraft, one of the four Boeing 737 single-aisle jetliners bought from the US aviation company, was delivered to Naft Airlines on Sunday, its Managing Director Nurollah Rezai Niyaraki said. Boeing 737 "After the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), an agreement was signed with the Boeing company for purchase of four 737s and today one of the ordered aircraft was delivered to Iranian Naft Airlines," he told Shana news agency. The aircraft took off at 1700 hours local time on its first flight from Tehran to Ahvaz on Sunday, the official said. "According to the timeline, the remaining three Boeing 737s will gradually join the Iranian Naft Airlines fleet at specific dates" by the end of the current Iranian year on March 20, 2017, Rezai Niyaraki added. Naft Airline Other Iranian media reports said the aircraft, with a capacity to carry up to 148 passengers, had been leased to Iran under the complete crew, maintenance, and insurance (ACMI) arrangement. The reports, however, did not clarify whether the aircraft was a brand new or used plane and whether it had been leased directly by Boeing or another airline. In June, Boeing signed a memorandum of agreement with Iran Air to sell a total of 80 aircraft and lease a further 29 to the company in a potential deal worth about $25 billion. The plan, however, faces stiff opposition in US Congress, raising doubts about deliveries of the jets that are scheduled to start in 2017 and run through 2025. On Monday, Deputy Minister of Roads and Transportation Asghar Fakhriyeh Kashan said Iran may take one aircraft off the provisional deal with Boeing as he criticized what Tehran sees as unfair delays in finalizing it. The tentative agreement awaits US Treasury Department's endorsement before being finalized. Under the nuclear deal, the Treasury Department will review on a case-by-case basis the licensing of individuals or entities that want to export, re-export, sell, lease or transfer to Iran commercial passenger aircraft, and associated parts and services. Naft Airlines appears to be the first Iranian company to have its deal cleared by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Iranian airlines have some 60 Boeing airplanes in service, but most of them were purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution and are in a dire need of repair or retirement. ...

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/Files By Tim Hepher | TEHRAN TEHRAN Iran has reduced the number of airplanes it plans to buy from Airbus by six amid delays in U.S. regulatory approvals, and may knock one plane off a similar deal for more than 100 with Boeing, an Iranian official told Reuters. Iran announced plans in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion at list prices from Europe's Airbus but has complained about unexpected delays in receiving U.S. licences, which are needed due to the large number of U.S.-supplied parts. The country’s deputy transport minister told a conference on Monday there were signs the U.S. Treasury would release the crucial licences by the end of this month. But speaking again on Tuesday, he stepped up criticism of what Iran sees as unfair delays in unblocking the deal, which is part of efforts to rebuild Iran's elderly fleet that were built into a pact between Tehran and world powers to lift most Western sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran’s nuclear activities. "There are six fewer aircraft. These are the ones that were due to be delivered in 2016," the Iranian official told Reuters, speaking on the sidelines of the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. The deal to be finalised with Airbus in coming weeks could therefore be for 112 aircraft instead of 118, he said. On paper, these include 12 of Airbus's A380 superjumbos but Iran has not yet decided whether to take the double-decker jets, and has an option to convert them to smaller models, he said. Reuters first reported in June that Iran was having second thoughts about taking the world's largest passenger plane. The latest move takes further shine off the deal signed in Paris during a visit by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, but Western officials say it still represents a promising symbol of a new political and economic relationship with Iran. Boeing, which has also agreed to provide jets to Iran as it emerges from sanctions, may see its deal clipped by one jet to 108 aircraft instead of 109, the Iranian official said. Boeing said in June it had provisionally agreed to sell 80 planes directly to IranAir and to oversee the lease of a further 29. The Iranian official did not say whether the cancelled aircraft would come from the column of direct purchases or leases, nor whether it had been cut for the same reason as Airbus, but Boeing is also on the waiting list for licences. Both planemakers said they do not comment on discussions with airlines and would only act within U.S. regulations. Speaking at the CAPA conference, Western envoys sought to allay Iranian concerns over the delays in approving the airplane deals. They expressed optimism the deals would go ahead and reiterated their commitment to last year's nuclear deal. Unpicking years of sanctions is a complex task, complicated further in Washington by the fact that U.S. primary sanctions remain in effect, French Ambassador Francois Senemaud said. One person familiar with the process said the U.S. Treasury was moving ahead in its discussions and a licence decision, initially on the Airbus side of the deal, could come in weeks. Others have suggested the politically sensitive decision on whether to supply Western jets, opposed by many Republicans, could slip beyond November's U.S. presidential election.

Large elements for NASA’s Space Launch System are in production and will be joined together to create the rocket’s 212-foot-tall core stage, the backbone of the SLS rocket. Why is NASA building the world’s most powerful rocket? Because SLS is ready to support both near-term missions in the proving ground around the moon starting in 2018, while at the same time being capable of carrying the very large hardware like landers, habitats and other supplies and equipment needed to explore Mars and other deep space destinations in the 2030s and beyond. Engineers just completed welding the liquid hydrogen tank that will provide fuel for the first SLS flight in 2018. The tank measures more than 130 feet tall, comprises almost two-thirds of the core stage and holds 537,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen — which is cooled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. (NASA/Michoud/Steven Seipel) To power a Mars rocket, the core stage carries around 2.3 million pounds of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to fuel the four RS-25 engines. Engineers just completed welding the largest part of the core stage, the 130-foot-tall liquid hydrogen tank that will provide fuel for the first SLS flight in 2018, but there’s still work to ready the tank for its maiden voyage. “Building the core stage is similar to building a house,” said Joan Funk, SLS core stage lead at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. “With the massive, welded elements coming off the Vertical Assembly Center at Michoud, we’ve laid the foundation, framed the walls and put up the roof. The big items are in place. Now it’s time to get to work on the inside.” That’s where engineers will clean and prime each element before beginning the internal integration. Michoud’s Vertical Assembly Center, the largest spacecraft-welding tool in the world, is welding many of the core stage’s main elements — the forward skirt, the liquid oxygen tank, the liquid hydrogen tank and the engine section. The core stage’s fifth element, the intertank, which is bolted, is also being built at Michoud. The Boeing Company, headquartered in Chicago, is the prime contractor building the core stage, but to build the stage, Boeing has worked with 442 businesses across America, including 297 small businesses. “When welding is complete, these structures still have to go through more processing to turn them into functional parts of the rocket,” said Funk. “The core stage has parts with very different functions from housing the flight computer and primary avionics to holding the fuel to supporting the four RS-25 engines.” The final manufacturing processes and outfitting for each part of the core stage varies with the section’s function. Wet structures — elements that hold fuel, or the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks — are put through “proof tests” to assure manufacturing quality. The liquid oxygen tank is hydrostatically tested and filled with water; and the liquid hydrogen tank is pneumatically tested. After testing, the tanks and dry structures — elements that don’t hold fuel, or the forward skirt, intertank and engine section — are cleaned, primed and readied for the “work on the inside.” Much like a house being constructed, the core stage is outfitted with wiring, plumbing and insulation. The dry structures house flight computers, cameras and avionics — or the “brains” of the rocket. In a house, wiring can carry power or television and internet data from room to room. In the SLS’s core stage, 45 miles of wire cabling serves a similar purpose, carrying power and data from element to element powering flight computers, cameras, sensors, avionics and other electronics housed in the dry structures. The core stage’s plumbing contains lines that deliver the propellant and oxidizer from the tanks to the engines. Each dry structure also contains purge vent lines and hazardous gas lines designed to eliminate dangerous gases building up in the dry structures prior to launch. Where the rubber meets the road, the engine section is the business end of the core stage. It houses the four RS-25 engines — formerly space shuttle main engines, the most reliable rocket engines ever built — that produce more than 2 million pounds of thrust during launch. The engine section also houses the avionics used to steer the engines and is an attachment point for the solid rocket boosters. (NASA/Michoud/Steven Seipel) “The dry structures are cram-packed full of equipment and the domes of the tanks take up a lot of the room inside the dry structures,” said Funk. Racks, cameras, sensors, vent lines, wire cabling, valves, shelves, couplings, and more fill the core stage’s dry structures to near capacity. With every inch planned, equipment is mounted and wiring is placed methodically, accounting for time, space, accessibility and much more. When the dry structures are ready to be “stacked,” or joined to the other elements, there isn’t much room to spare. Before the elements can be stacked, insulation — which is more important to a rocket than to a house — is applied. Not only does NASA’s thermal protection system give the rocket its signature orange color, but more importantly, it protects the core stage from the extreme temperatures encountered during launch and maintains the fuels’ extremely low temperatures. The liquid hydrogen is chilled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit and the liquid oxygen is chilled to minus 297 degrees. How do those elements finally come together to form the 212-foot-long core stage? With the initial wiring, plumbing and insulation complete, the elements are divided into two sections for stacking. Each section is stacked vertically, with elements bolted to one another using segmented support rings welded to each element, providing stiffness. The liquid hydrogen tank sits atop the engine section to create the aft section, and the forward skirt and intertank are bolted to the top and bottom of the liquid oxygen tank to create the forward section. When complete, engineers “break over” the sections, or move them to a horizontal position, for their final assembly. Final wiring, plumbing and insulation are installed after the forward section is joined to the aft to complete the core stage assembly. Ratana Meekham, a Qualis Corp. engineering technician at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, helps install approximately 5 miles of cable on a half-ring structure being used to test the avionics system that will guide the SLS. The forward skirt, intertank and engine section contain the rocket’s avionics and electronics. (NASA/MSFC/Fred Deaton) Before punching its ticket to launch, the core stage will travel by barge to NASA’s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, where it will undergo a free modal test to understand the structure then be mounted in the recently renovated B-2 Test Stand for propellant fill and drain testing and hot fire testing called a “green run.” A green run, or the first time the engines are assembled into a single configuration with the core stage and fired at nearly full-power, tests the compatibility and functionality of the system to ensure a safe and viable design. Once post-test assessments and adjustments are complete, the core stage will travel again by barge to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, for its first flight with Orion.

The breakthrough towards developing commercially viable low carbon fuel is the result of a partnership between Virgin Atlantic and LanzaTech. Since 2011 they have been committed to producing the world’s first jet fuel derived from waste industrial gases from steel mills via a fermentation process. The Lanzanol was produced in China at the RSB (Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials) certified Shougang demonstration facility. The innovative alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) process was developed in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) with support from the US Department of Energy (DOE) and with the help of funding from HSBC. LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic are now set to continue to work with Boeing and a host of industry colleagues to complete the additional testing aircraft and engine manufacturers require before approving the fuel for first use in a commercial aircraft.  Assuming all initial approvals are achieved, the innovative LanzaTech jet fuel could be used in a first of its kind proving flight in 2017. Following a successful ‘proving flight’ the data collected will enable the partnership to seek approval to use the fuel on routine commercial flights.  This would also help pave the way for LanzaTech to fund and build their first commercial jet fuel plant to supply fuel to Virgin Atlantic and other airlines.  As a UK based partnership it is hoped the first LanzaTech jet fuel plant would be based in the UK. Sir Richard Branson said: “This is a real game changer for aviation and could significantly reduce the industry’s reliance on oil within our lifetime. Virgin Atlantic was the first commercial airline to test a bio-fuel flight and continues to be a leader in sustainable aviation. “We chose to partner with LanzaTech because of its impressive sustainability profile and the commercial potential of the jet fuel.  Our understanding of low carbon fuels has developed rapidly over the last decade, and we are closer than ever before to bringing a sustainable product to the market for commercial use by Virgin Atlantic and other global airlines.” Dr Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive of LanzaTech, said: “We can now truly imagine a world where a steel mill can not only produce the steel for the components of the plane but also recycle its gases to produce the fuel that powers the aircraft.  This program illustrates that such breakthroughs are only possible through collaboration.  In this case, it is governments (US DOE, FAA, DARPA), laboratories (PNNL, AFRL, SWRI, MTU, UDRI), NGOs (RSB) and industry (Virgin, HSBC, Boeing, Shougang, Airlines for America) coming together to disrupt our current global carbon trajectory. “We look forward to working with colleagues past, present and future to make this pioneering new fuel a commercial reality. “   The LanzaTech production process explained Steel production produces waste carbon monoxide (CO) gas, which is frequently flared (burnt off) to the atmosphere as greenhouse gas CO2 (or sometimes used less efficiently for other purposes). The LanzaTech process involves capturing carbon from the waste gas via fermentation to ethanol, which is recovered to produce ethanol feedstock for a variety of products, including aviation fuel. Each gallon of ethanol is converted to produce 1/2 gallon of aviation fuel. The process could be used to capture and recycle around 1/3 of the carbon that steel facilities would otherwise release into the atmosphere. Future potential of this technology Ground energy can be sourced carbon free – think solar or wind – but to make liquid fuels as per those needed for aviation you need a carbon source. Where this carbon comes from is up to us – new fossil resources, or recycled carbon. Recycling waste carbon streams is an effective way to keep fossil resources in the ground. Worldwide, around 1.7 billion metric tonnes of steel is produced every year and waste gases are produced through the chemistry of steel making. LanzaTech estimates that its process could be retrofitted to 65% of the world’s steel mills. This offers the potential to produce 30 billion gallons of ethanol worldwide, for around 15 billion gallons of jet fuel p.a. This would represent just under 19% of all aviation fuel currently used worldwide p.a. (80 billion gallon total world aviation fuel use).   About Virgin Atlantic Virgin Atlantic was founded by entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson over 30 years ago after he decided the UK aviation industry needed shaking up and style injected back into it. On 22nd June 1984, Virgin Atlantic’s inaugural flight to Newark took place, on an aircraft filled with personal friends, celebrities and the media. Today, Virgin Atlantic flies to over 30 destinations worldwide, including locations across the United States, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Virgin Atlantic has been active in the sustainable aviation space for many years.  Its Change is in the Air sustainability programme was established in 2007. Sustainable jet fuels are a key part of that programme’s carbon reduction focus.  For full information about Change is in the Air visit: www.virgin-atlantic.com/changeisintheair. Virgin Atlantic formally partnered with LanzaTech on its low carbon jet fuel in 2011.  The two companies have been working hard behind the scenes to progress the programme since then.  HSBC joined the partnership in 2014. About HSBC HSBC has been involved in the LanzaTech partnership since 2014. HSBC has shown commitment to projects that accelerate the shift to a low-carbon economy, reflecting its commitment to work with suppliers and customers alike to help address climate change.   Statements of support Antonio Simoes, CEO of HSBC Bank plc, said: “We are proud to have provided support and funding to allow production of this innovative new fuel to move from sample size to small demo scale. This breakthrough is testament to what can be achieved when different industries work together to address climate change and support the shift to a low-carbon economy.” Mr. Wang Tao, Chairman of the Beijing Shougang LanzaTech New Energy Technology Co. Ltd. said: “Our partnership with LanzaTech symbolizes Shougang’s desire to create a sustainable future for China where industrial growth and environmental benefits go hand in hand,” “Ethanol made from recycled carbon in China can now be used to fuel a plane in the United Kingdom, using technology from the United States! We are honoured to be part of this truly global partnership to provide new sustainable pathways for low carbon fuels that do not impact the food chain or land use.” Julie-Ann Felgar, Managing Director of Environmental Strategy at Boeing Commercial Airplanes said: “Boeing is proud to work with Virgin Atlantic and LanzaTech to further expand the use of sustainable alternative aviation fuel. Our work with Virgin Atlantic over many years to move the needle on identifying technologies and partnerships, such as this effort with LanzaTech, reflects the innovative spirit and deep commitment of our industry to reduce our CO2 footprint.” Barbara Bramble, Vice President for International Conservation and Corporate Strategies, at the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) said: “Safeguarding wildlife and habitat in the face of climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time. Technologies that reduce carbon emissions in transportation while meeting broader sustainability objectives can help to avoid the worst impacts of climate change on our wildlife and the habitats they call home. The progress announced today on a new pathway to sustainable aviation fuel is tremendously exciting, and National Wildlife Federation congratulates the global team, led by Virgin Atlantic, who has worked to make this a reality.” Rolf Hogan, Executive Director of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) said: “RSB provides sustainability solutions for any biomaterial anywhere in the world and is the highest rated global system for biofuels. Congratulations to Virgin Atlantic for being a true leader and innovator in this space, and for keeping sustainability at the forefront of their business. It is exciting to be part of the process that delivered sustainable and RSB certified ethanol for conversion to aviation fuel for Virgin Atlantic. We look forward to seeing many more examples like this across the world so that aviation can become a more sustainable form of transportation.” Peter Bakker, President of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development said: “LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic are demonstrating exactly the kind of innovative business leadership that the post-Paris world urgently needs.  Congratulations to both companies for their ongoing commitment to developing this breakthrough product. Under the below50 initiative we look forward to more ground-breaking collaborations between investors, producers and consumers that will help to scale-up solutions to decarbonize the transport sector.” John Holladay, Manager, Transportation Sector at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory said: “What this team is doing, capturing industrial waste gas- which can contain high levels of carbon monoxide gas- and turning it into jet fuel is almost magical. Our long term dream is making fuels and chemicals through recycling carbon. PNNL is proud to be involved with the project through bringing catalyst technology that builds on LanzaTech’s fermentation technology and we look forward to seeing the technology powering jets in the near future.” Source: Lanzatech and Virgin Atlantic, joint press release, 2016-09-14.

(Boeing) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Getting There September 19, 2016 Meet Boeing, lighting designer. The company that designed the 747 jumbo jet and helped drive down the cost of air travel worldwide is hard at work on its planes’ interiors. Boeing is trying to patent a projection system that would allow the airplane maker to project images, such as a blue sky with fair-weather clouds or stars, onto the plane’s surfaces interior surfaces, like ceilings and walls, according to a filing published last week. “Projection lighting is simply one of many technologies we are exploring to see if it can bring advances in both airline economics and passenger experience,” a Boeing spokesman said. “In theory, airlines could use lighting enhancements on the walls and bulkheads to display information about destinations or to project scenes that get passengers thinking about where they’re going.” (Courtesy Boeing) It’s part of the airline industry’s current mood-lighting movement. Aircraft manufacturers and airlines are trying to improve their cabins’ historically harsh cabin lighting schemes, which had largely consisted of florescent lights and harsh overhead reading lights that shouldn’t be looked at directly for more than three seconds. Aircraft manufacturers are trying to make their planes ever-more attractive to buyers. Some airlines are favoring planes that are smaller, cost less, and are cheaper to fly. Carriers are also scaling back on some of their airplane purchases altogether to save money. And airlines want to make their planes more attractive to customers, as they battle for passengers amid historically low fares and higher competition from discount carriers and traditional airlines. Whether the images of clouds or the expanse of space (may we also suggest dogs?) gives the illusion of a more spacious ride is yet to be seen, but small changes could make what is a cramped, uncomfortable ride for most of us, a little more pleasant.

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BOE ▼ 146.92 -0.05 -0.03% Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA 0FGH ▼ 268.51 -4.30 -1.58% Recently, Norwegian Air chief commercial officer Thomas Ramdahl told Business Insider in an interview his airline plans to launch $69 fares on trans-Atlantic flights starting next year. As a long-time Boeing customer, Norwegian selected the new generation 737 MAX 8 to launch the new fare. In fact, the airline, who currently operates a fleet made up exclusively of more than 100 Boeing jets, has 100 of the planes on order. But there's more to this story.

In other words, Norwegian is in need of a tweener. Traditionally, those routes have been the domain of Boeing's 757. However, Boeing discontinued the controversial plane in 2004 and still does not have an aircraft capable of matching its capabilities. Although Boeing did tell Business Insider that it is currently studying the possibility of a 757 replacement.© Provided by Business Insider Airbus A321neo That's where the 30 A321neo LR jets Norwegian ordered from Boeing's arch rival Airbus comes into play. "From the figures I've seen so far, the A321neo LR will have longer range than the MAX, so that gives us opportunities in smaller cities where frequency is more important having a large wide-body jet," Ramdahl said. While some airlines are holding onto its aging fleets of 757s, Norwegian seems to believe that it may have found a worthy successor for the long-serving jet. "It's difficult to say yes or no, but I think so," Ramdahl told us when asked if the A321neo LR is a true replacement for the 757. "It's interesting to see if Boeing is coming up with a replacement for the 757 as well, because they'll need to if the LR does what Airbus is saying it will do." In fact, Ramdahl told us that the A321neo offers 10% to 15% lower costs per seat than a wide-body jet. Based on Airbus' projected range of more than 4,600 miles, the A321neo LR should be able to match or beat the 757's range, the Norwegian executive told Business Insider. In addition, Norwegian Air's A321's are expected to be equipped with 220 to 230 seats — which is on par with the capacity of the 757-200.  © Provided by Business Insider Boeing 757 La Compagnie This is potentially distressing news for Boeing. Even though the segment traditionally occupied by the 757 is not as large as the 737s or as profitable as the large wide-bodies, there is still plenty of demand for airplanes of its type. With the Boeing answer to the LR — the 737 MAX 9 — being old-sold 5-1, it looks like Airbus is the only one with a truly competitive product on offer in the segment. And if a major, long-time customer just as Norwegian is willing to defect, then it certainly stacks the deck against Boeing when it comes to conquest customers. The 737 MAX jets features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. It's one of the most advanced and efficient airliners in the world. The A321neo LR also feature upgraded avionics and aerodynamics, but is equipped by a more powerful CFM LEAP-1A engine. However, Boeing is not in a position to simply bolt on larger engines to match the A321neo LR's range because there is a direct correlation between the diameter of a turbofan engine's fan blades and the amount of thrust the engine can produce. For example, the more powerful 1A engine's fan blades have a diameter of 78 inches — nine more than the 1B. © Provided by Business Insider Boeing 737Max Norwegian An upgrade to a larger engine will likely involve a redesign of the 737's landing gear. That's because the 737 was designed in the 1960s to be powered by Pratt & Whitney's JT8D engine with a much more compact fan diameter of 49 inches. Since then, Boeing has been bolting on larger and larger engines on the 737, but the under-wing space has not changed. The 737 has essentially maxed out on the engine size that can fit under its wings. As a result, Boeing will have to raise and relocate the plane's landing gear. This means that regardless of whether it decides to modify the 737 or build a new plane from scratch, it'll be a move that will likely cost billions. Norwegian expects to take delivery of its 737 MAX 8 in 2017 with the first A321neo LR expected in 2019.

MAGAZINE SUBSCRIBE WIN FUTURETECH ADVERTISE CONTACT US Wheels Tech Science Videos Test How to How to make How to fix Biofuel takes off 19 September 2016  print 0 Previous Next Air travel is predicted to treble in the next two decades. To cope, we will need nearly 40 000 new commercial aircraft. But more travel means more pollution, so there’s renewed vigour in the hunt for aviation biofuel. On a modest 50 hectares in the sleepy farmlands around Marble Hall in Limpopo, a quiet revolution in air travel is under way. That’s where a leafy plant sprouting from the red clay soil is being hailed as the answer to the challenge of creating sustainable aviation biofuel. The plant in question is Solaris, a member of the tobacco family (nicotine-free, for what it’s worth). Oil from Solaris seeds is converted into bio-jet fuel in a process developed and patented by the Italian company Sunchem Holding. What’s more, in time to come, emerging technologies are expected to exploit the leaves and stems to increase biofuel production. With the first harvest barely in, already there’s talk of an imminent test flight. That flight is planned for this year, in collaboration with SAA. Boeing and SAA, along with partners SkyNRG and Sunchem SA, are driving the local biofuel venture, which involves both commercial and small-scale farmers. If test farming in Marble Hall is successful, the project will be expanded to more farms in South Africa – and potentially to other countries. Since aviation biofuel was approved for commercial use in 2011, airlines have conducted more than 2 000 commercial flights using it. About three types have been approved by ASTM (the American Society of the International Association for Testing and Materials) International, the worldwide standards organisation. Demand and interest in the fuel are high, from both airlines and the military. The problem: insufficient supply. Refinery capacity remains small, the fuel comes at a price premium and currently sustainable feedstock is available in limited quantities only. “SAA continues to work towards becoming the most environmentally sustainable airline in the world and is committed to a better way of conducting business,” says Ian Cruickshank, Environmental Affairs Specialist, SAA Group. “The impact that the biofuel programme will have on South Africans is astounding: thousands of jobs mostly in rural areas, new skills and technology, energy security and stability and macro-economic benefits to South Africa and, of course, a massive reduction in the amount of CO2 that is emitted into our atmosphere.” Boeing International’s managing director for Africa, J Miguel Santos,said it is exciting to see early progress in South Africa towards develop-ing sustainable aviation biofuel from energy-producing tobacco plants. “Boeing strongly believes that our aviation biofuel collaboration with South African Airways will benefit the environment and public health while providing new economic opportunities for South Africa’s small farmers. This project also positions our valued airline customer to gain a long-term, viable domestic fuel supply and improve South Africa’s national balance of payments.” The project is intended to support South African Airways’ environmental goals as well as national objectives for economic and rural development. Solaris-based jet fuel will meet the Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterial’s CO2 life cycle reduction threshold of at least 50 per cent. When produced in an optimised supply chain set-up, savings are expected to reach up to 80 per cent, compared with fossil jet fuel (www.projectsolaris.co.za) The partners in the South African venture are leaders in the field. Boeing, which describes itself as the industry leader in global efforts to develop and commercialise sustainable aviation biofuel, is involved in about 20 biofuel collaborations spanning the globe. Besides its South African connection, it is also active in the United States, Middle East, Europe, China, Japan, Southeast Asia, Brazil and Australia. SkyNRG (www.skynrg.com) sees its mission as creating sustainable fuels for transport segments that have no other green alternative in the foreseeable future: aviation, marine and heavy trucking. It is the world market leader for bio-jet fuel, supplying more than 20 airlines worldwide. Maarten van Dijk, the organisation’s chief technology officer, described the Solaris project’s launch as an important milestone for his organisation. “(It) marks the start of our first operational feedstock project,” he says. “Commitment of all partners in the supply chain is crucial to realise our joint ambition and make this project a success and that’s why we’re proud to work together with Sunchem SA, Boeing and SAA. We also want to thank the Dutch Government for its strong support in this project, and for the development in sustainable jet fuel in general.” After two years of proving Solaris’ potential in small-scale trials, it is exciting to see the parts falling into place and work in progress on the next phase of the project, adds Joost van Lier, managing director of Sunchem SA. There is a strong belief in the project’s potential as a great opportunity for both commercial and community farmers. The final member of the collaboration, Sunchem Biofuel Development South Africa, is a joint venture between Sunchem Holding and an international group of investors/entrepreneurs, seasoned in developing alternative energy initiatives in Southern Africa. Trials with Solaris, dating back to 2013, have shown encouraging results. On the production side, the initial 11 hectares produced three tons of oil, six tons of press cake/animal feed and 45 tons of fresh biomass per hectare. Socially, they also helped forge strong ties with the commercial farming community and the regional smallholder farming co-ops. Emissions baseline confirmed Tough standards on new commercial aircraft CO2 emissions due to come into force from 2020 will lay down a strict do-not-exceed maximum fuel burn per flight kilometre. From 2023, this will also apply to existing aircraft designs still in manufacture. Commercial air travel’s umbrella body, the Geneva-based International Air Transport Association (IATA) has welcomed the standard for commercial aircraft, produced by representatives at the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). It took six years of negotiation and technical work before approval was granted by ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection. The standard does not solve aviation’s climate challenge on its own, IATA conceded, but was nevertheless an important element in a comprehensive strategy for tackling carbon emissions. “The next milestone will be the implementation of a market-based measure to address CO2 emissions, which we hope to see agreed at the ICAO Assembly in September,” the organisation said. The industry’s goal is carbon-neutral growth from 2020 and for a halving of CO2 emissions by 2050. The world’s other big aircraft manufacturer, Airbus, has also commended the CO2 agreement. The aim, the company said, was to reduce CO2 emissions from aviation by encouraging the integration of fuel-efficient technologies into aircraft design and development, ensuring older aircraft are replaced by newer, more efficient designs. This is part of a broader set of actions aimed at tackling aviation’s climate change impact including improvements in flight operations, deployment of sustainable jet fuels and the reduction of noise and other emissions together with the development of a global market based measure for aviation to be agreed at the ICAO General Assembly in October 2016. Airbus pointed out that it had invested significantly in improving the environmental performance of its sites, products and services. New aircraft coming to market would offer significantly reduced CO2 emissions and even the existing A380, in service since 2007, showed a 40 per cent reduction compared with previous-generation very large aircraft. Get set for an aviation boom More people, in more countries, are travelling by air. But we’re on the brink of an unprecedented boom. Data provided by Boeing show that, a little more than 20 years ago, about 1,5 trillion revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) were flown. Of that, nearly three-quarters was undertaken in Europe and North America. By 2014, total RPK had soared to six trillion. What’s note-worthy is that the Europe/North America travel more or less equally combined to make up only half the total. The other half was dominated by Asia (excluding China), with China next at about one-eighth of the total. By 2034, air travel will stand at 16 trillion RPK. Europe and North America’s share of that is estimated at 38 per cent, equal to China and the rest of Asia combined. According to a presentation by Boeing International’s managing director for Africa, J Miguel Santos, between now and 2034, airlines will need 38 000 new aircraft, valued at $5,6 trillion. By far the bulk of these will be standard single-aisle craft, which will account for 70 per cent. However, small and medium wide-body models will form a significant part of the total, accounting for between them 22 per cent. And who will be buying these planes? According to a Boeing estimate, nearly two out of every five will be destined for Asia. That’s as much as North America and Europe combined. Despite all that activity, aviation’s contribution to global greenhouse gases is minimal by comparison with terrestrial activities. As at 2010, according to a report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, aviation’s share was two per cent. Still, the industry is committed to carbon-neutral growth bu 2020. By 2050, it’s predicted, CO2 emissions will cut to half that of 2005. Boeing’s strategy for reducing emissions rests on three pillars: l More efficient aeroplanes l More efficient flight l Sustainable fuels. The most significant chunk of that, judging by a graphic indicating the company’s strategy, is sustainable fuels. What aviation needs, they say, is a drop-in biofuel that can be blended directly with petroleum jet fuel and meets or exceeds performance standards of petroleum – with no change to aircraft, engines or fuelling infrastructure.

David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen More from David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen Published on: September 18, 2016 | Last Updated: September 18, 2016 11:10 PM EST Share Adjust Comment Print If Lockheed Martin is worried about the potential of a legal challenge by Boeing over Denmark’s proposed purchase of the F-35, then the company isn’t showing it. Denmark rejected the Boeing Super Hornet and instead decided to purchase the same F-35 stealth fighter that Stephen Harper’s government originally wanted to buy. But Boeing says Denmark’s procurement process is flawed and has now submitted a “request for insight” which would require the country’s defence ministry to provide the data it used to select the F-35 over the Super Hornet. Boeing said this is the first stage for a formal legal challenge of the proposed F-35 purchase. But even if Boeing goes to court, can it stop a sovereign nation from buying a product it wants? In June, Denmark’s parliament approved the government’s recommendation to buy the F-35. Boeing might win in the courts and receive a determination that the procurement process was flawed. But how long would that take? And what if Denmark ignores the legal outcome and cites national security reasons to proceed on the acquisition since it needs an immediate replacement for its aging F-16s? The F-35As will be delivered between 2021 and 2026, Denmark says. Lockheed Martin will likely be moving quickly to acquire any long-lead items it needs for the aircraft and it is already positioning itself for industrial participation from Danish companies. It sent the following statement to Defence Watch: “Lockheed Martin respects the Danish government’s sovereign acquisition process and the outcome of the fighter replacement competition. We are confident the F-35 is the best choice for Denmark’s future defense needs. We will continue to support the post-decisional process and are now focused on executing the program, including industrial participation for Danish industry.”   RCAF squadrons, SAR Techs, civilian SAR personnel take part in major...

Window View with Sunlight. (Photo: Gizelka, Getty Images/iStockphoto) Disabled travelers who depend on wheelchairs say it's so difficult to use restrooms on many airplanes that they dehydrate themselves for a cross-country trip or avoid flying entirely. Some relief could be on the way as the Transportation Department considers this week the most sweeping rule revisions in 30 years to make airlines — now exempt from the Americans with Disabilities Act — more accommodating to passengers with limited mobility. But the changes, which also include provisions for people who are deaf, blind or for travel with animals, face stiff opposition from airlines who say such accommodations would cost billions of dollars. Three days of talks between the department's Access Advisory Committee and the various stakeholders, including airlines and advocacy groups for the disabled, begin Wednesday. A final decision from the committee could come in October. If the committee can't reach a consensus, the department could impose its own rules. Congress specifically exempted airlines from the Americans with Disabilities Act, which governs access on the ground. But the 1986 Air Carrier Access Act required steps such as accessible restrooms on wider twin-aisle planes, such as the Boeing 777 or Airbus A330, which often fly overseas routes. The committee is debating whether to require more accessibility on single-aisle planes, such as the 737 or A320, that dominate domestic routes. “When you’re talking about these two competing interests of money on the airline side and we’re coming from a civil-rights perspective on the other side, it’s a pretty wide chasm,” said Curtis Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, who worked on regulations after the 1986 law and is back on the latest panel. In addition to restroom accessibility, the committee will also consider requiring airlines to make its in-flight entertainment more accessible, with amenities such as captioning for deaf passengers and audio descriptions for blind travelers. The group could also rein in the menagerie of comfort animals now allowed to accompany passengers in the cabin, which now include kangaroos and turkeys as well as the more traditional dogs and cats.

For Page, who has used a wheelchair for 33 years since a car accident, and others like him, taking a trip is no easy task. “Someone with catastrophic disability such as paralysis has no access to the lavatory right now,”  Page said. “For me to get on a flight, there’s a lot more to it." About two-thirds of the 931 disabled people surveyed for the department in July told the Paralyzed Veteran that inability to use the lavatory is reason enough to avoid flying. Lavatories in the narrow, single-aisle planes can be cramped and difficult to reach with even a narrow, on-board wheelchair designed for the plane. Some thresholds have bumps. Doors face each other across the aisle, leaving little room to maneuver in privacy. Aircraft manufacturers say they have solutions. Boeing offers options for lavatories that are large enough or convertible for an assisted transfer from a wheelchair to a toilet, said spokesman Bret Jensen. Airbus' “Space Flex” design for its A320 aircraft uses a partition to convert two rear lavatories into a fully accessible restroom. Virgin America has 10 aircraft in its fleet that offer the benefit of a quick conversion for guests with reduced mobility, spokesman Christie O’Toole said. But airlines have resisted requiring the larger restrooms because that means losing three to six seats or galley space. The airlines say losing three seats per flight on four flights per day would cost the industry an estimated $33 billion over the next 25 years. “We’re looking for a data-driven approach to make sure we really serve all customers in the best way possible, especially customers with disabilities," said Doug Mullen, assistant general counsel for regulatory affairs for the trade group Airlines for America. "Carriers go above and beyond the minimum regulatory requirements when it comes to accommodations."

Deaf and blind travelers want access to the same seat-back entertainment as other passengers, said Howard Rosenblum, CEO of the National Association for the Deaf, a coalition of groups for 48 million people who are deaf or hard of hearing. “We pay the same price for tickets as hearing passengers yet do not receive the same service,” he said. The committee will debate whether — and when — to require accessible entertainment on new planes and existing planes as they are renovated.Freed said besides providing a more entertaining flight, the same technology could also ensure better safety warnings in an emergency for the deaf and blind. EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT ANIMALS The committee could also pare back some existing accommodations for emotional support animals. The Americans with Disabilities Act recognizes dogs and miniature horses as service animals. But the Transportation Department went further by recognizing emotional-support animals, a category that spans a broad variety of creatures. An estimated 100,000 animals a year accompany travelers in the cabin. But airlines say such a policy is easy to abuse. Service animals travel for free, and travelers often claim pets as service animals, sometimes using dubious certifications purchased on the Internet, to avoid paying fees, the airlines say. The airlines want to limit service animals to those recognized under the Americans with the Disabilities Act. Airlines warned in a joint statement in July that failing to restrict non-canines in a pet carrier during a flight would be “unacceptable,” and that eliminating emotional-support animals would be the “best approach.” The airlines complain that under one proposal from mental health and disability advocates "turkeys and other unusual animals would still be allowed in the cabin." “From the airline perspective we are looking for clarification and some alignment with the Americans with Disabilities Act, which strictly defines what a service animal is," Mullen said. “We want to make sure the rules are clear, which will help to ensure customers benefit from the best possible service when they take to the skies." The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America also urged the department to restrict animals on planes to service dogs to reduce exposure of animal dander to 25 million Americans with asthma and 50 million with allergies. The department has monitored complaints about animals on planes since 1996 because of the potential for abuse by travelers who claim pet as service animals to avoid fees to bring the animals aboard. Service animals travel free. A 2003 policy said airlines could require travelers to have a note on letterhead from a mental-health professional attesting to their importance as an emotional-support animal. But that policy spawned an industry of internet certificates that airlines and airports treat skeptically. Advocates agree the current policy raises skepticism about animals in the cabin. But they also note that some people have disabilities that aren’t obvious, such as epilepsy, diabetes or cardiac disorders. Some animals can detect an oncoming seizure, a drop in blood sugar or an episode of arrhythmia. A group that trains capuchin monkeys to assist the disabled wants the animals to be accepted as service animals to avoid hassles when delivering them by plane to their new owners. Trainers for the group Helping Hands: Monkey Helpers for the Disabled transport monkeys 20 to 30 times a year. The monkeys travel in soft-sided containers, rather than loose in the cabin. The owners with limited mobility from paralysis or multiple sclerosis don’t tend to take flights, but have the monkeys at home to fetch items, turn pages or scratch itches. “The independence our recipients gain from the everyday tasks our service animals help with is legitimate and irreplaceable,” said Megan Talbert, the group’s president. USA TODAY More trouble for the man who flies with a monkey Alicia Smith, a member of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said emotional-support animals could provide medical assistance as crucial as an oxygen bottle or a prosthetic by helping calm an autistic child or a veteran with post-traumatic-stress disorder. “We don’t want a Noah’s ark with untested animals that don’t have any proven ability to behave in a very unusual setting,” said Smith, who uses a large service dog to help maintain her balance. “That’s when you get the person bringing on the kangaroo and the turkey and kind of ridiculous animals.” After five months of talks, the committee has yet to reach a consensus. “Clearly there is a big gap between the airlines’ position, which is to get rid of them completely, and our position, which is to maintain them, but have some limits in terms of species and size,” Smith said. 1159 CONNECTTWEET 13 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cBlb6B

Iran announced plans in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion at list prices from Europe's Airbus but has complained about unexpected delays in receiving U.S. licenses, which are needed due to the large number of U.S.-supplied parts. The country’s deputy transport minister told a conference on Monday there were signs the U.S. Treasury would release the crucial licenses by the end of this month. But speaking again on Tuesday, he stepped up criticism of what Iran sees as unfair delays in unblocking the deal, which is part of efforts to rebuild Iran's elderly fleet that were built into a pact between Tehran and world powers to lift most Western sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran’s nuclear activities. "There are six fewer aircraft. These are the ones that were due to be delivered in 2016," the Iranian official told Reuters, speaking on the sidelines of the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran. The deal to be finalised with Airbus in coming weeks could therefore be for 112 aircraft instead of 118, he said. On paper, these include 12 of Airbus's A380 superjumbos but Iran has not yet decided whether to take the double-decker jets, and has an option to convert them to smaller models, he said. Reuters first reported in June that Iran was having second thoughts about taking the world's largest passenger plane. The latest move takes further shine off the deal signed in Paris during a visit by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, but Western officials say it still represents a promising symbol of a new political and economic relationship with Iran. Boeing, which has also agreed to provide jets to Iran as it emerges from sanctions, may see its deal clipped by one jet to 108 aircraft instead of 109, the Iranian official said. Boeing said in June it had provisionally agreed to sell 80 planes directly to IranAir and to oversee the lease of a further 29. The Iranian official did not say whether the canceled aircraft would come from the column of direct purchases or leases, nor whether it had been cut for the same reason as Airbus, but Boeing is also on the waiting list for licenses. Both planemakers said they do not comment on discussions with airlines and would only act within U.S. regulations. Speaking at the CAPA conference, Western envoys sought to allay Iranian concerns over the delays in approving the airplane deals. They expressed optimism the deals would go ahead and reiterated their commitment to last year's nuclear deal. Unpicking years of sanctions is a complex task, complicated further in Washington by the fact that U.S. primary sanctions remain in effect, French Ambassador Francois Senemaud said. One person familiar with the process said the U.S. Treasury was moving ahead in its discussions and a license decision, initially on the Airbus side of the deal, could come in weeks. Others have suggested the politically sensitive decision on whether to supply Western jets, opposed by many Republicans, could slip beyond November's U.S. presidential election.

The city will be the low cost carrier's third hub after Delhi and Hyderabad and will be a base for both Boeing B 737-800 and Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft. Emerging from a meeting with chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Singh who had started the airline in 2004 and scripted its turnaround after it went into a tailspin and crash-landed in 2014, said the airline was now ready for expansion and had decided to start with Kolkata as the mar ket was under-served and offered great potential. "We are looking at expanding domestic and international network from Kolkata. In the immediate future, departures will go up 40% from 15 to 21. Apart from adding two more frequencies to Guwahati, we will connect to Aizwal, Sil char and Gorakhpur from October 4. We will also connect Vizag and Jaipur from November-December. The CM has requested for connec tions to Durgapur and Bhubaneswar. We will examine the former proposal but the latter looks feasible," Singh said. While Bombardier aircraft will be used for regional connections, Jaipur and Vizag markets are likely to be serviced by Boeing planes. Apart from the surge in regional connectivity, SpiceJet is also firming up plans to increase its international operations from Kolkata that is currently restricted to a daily Bangkok flight. The airline plans to increase the frequency on the Kolkata-Bangkok sector to twice daily from December and daily to Dhaka and Chittagong with Bombardier from the same month. "We are also evaluating flights to Yangon, Dubai and Sharjah from Kolkata. There is a good demand for low-cost flights to these cities from Kolkata," said Singh. At present, full service carriers Emirates, Qatar and Etihad operate to the Gulf. The airline CMD urged Mamata to take up the issue of exemption of landing and parking charges for sub-80 seater regional aircraft at Kolkata airport. Though a policy exists, it is not enforced in metro airports. Offering her assurance, Mamata said her government would extend full support to the airline. She also requested Singh to introduce a direct flight to Europe and Far East from Kolkata. Speaking to TOI, the airline boss said the airline did not have planes to do the distance. "We will continue to explore possibility in shorthaul flights in a 4-hour radius. That restricts us to West and South-East Asia," Singh pointed out.

(Photo: Michael Kappeler/DPA /Newscom) Commentary By Diane Katz / @Dianeskatz Diane Katz, who has analyzed and written on public policy issues for more than two decades, is a research fellow in regulatory policy at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. Let’s put two and two together, shall we? For more than a year now, the U.S. Export-Import Bank has been limited to financing export deals of less than $10 million—a real hardship, evidently, for Ex-Im President Fred P. Hochberg and his buds who much prefer subsidies in the high nine digits for multinational corporations and foreign governments. Alas, the bank charter requires that those big-dollar deals win approval from three members of the five-member board, which is a no-go these days, with only two board seats presently occupied. On the upside, that leaves Ex-Im personnel more time to oversee the $102 billion in taxpayer-backed subsidies outstanding. These include a $5 billion loan to Sadara Chemical Co., a joint venture between Saudi Arabia, with a world’s top 10 gross domestic product of $1.6 trillion, and Dow Chemical Co., market cap $59.5 billion. Meanwhile, after months of relative quiet on Capitol Hill, the Ex-Im issue has popped up front and center in congressional negotiations over a spending bill to keep the government running after Sept. 30. The cronies are lobbying like there is no tomorrow for an appropriations “rider” that would quash the requirement that the Ex-Im board have a quorum of three (out of the five seats) in order to approve deals larger than $10 million. To do so would be bad policy. The quorum ensures that no one person controls the billions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees doled out by the bank each year. That’s the very essence of America’s system of checks and balances. Such a procedural stunt also would circumvent the legislative process that contributes to a full consideration of major policy change, and also override the Senate Banking Committee, which otherwise has jurisdiction over confirmations of Ex-Im board members. Bank advocates such as Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, insist that Ex-Im’s more generous subsidies are “vital to American businesses and their supply chains trying to compete in a fierce global economy.” That’s a stretch. Ex-Im transactions benefit a mere 2 percent of U.S. exports and, until this year, overwhelmingly profited just a few multinational corporations. And speaking of Iran: This latest effort to override Ex-Im’s charter just happens to coincide with news from Tehran that the Iranian government expects the U.S. Treasury to grant licenses by month’s end for Boeing Co. to sell the Islamic regime, the world’s foremost sponsor of state terrorism, a fleet of new jets. The $17.6 billion deal between the aviation giant and Iran was made possible by President Barack Obama’s lifting of economic sanctions against Tehran in January. Under terms of a memorandum of agreement, Boeing reportedly will supply 80 planes—including intercontinental jumbo jets—to state-owned Iran Air. Financing for the purchase has not been announced. Boeing (market cap $86 billion) long has been the principal beneficiary of Ex-Im largesse—until the bank lost its board quorum. But in fiscal year 2014 alone, the bank supplied more than $5.6 billion in taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign airlines on Boeing’s behalf, including: • $842 million to Kenya Airways. • $139 million to Virgin Australia Airlines. • $277 million to Biman Bangladesh Airlines. • $454 million to Air Canada. • $292 million to China Southern Airlines. • $734 million to Air China Cargo. • $424 million to Air China. • $296 million to Ethiopian Airlines. • $496 million to Korean Airlines. • $194 to Norwegian Air Shuttle. • $703 million to Russia’s Vnesheconombank Leasing JSC. • $497 million to Thai Airways International Ltd. • $284 million to Emirates Airline. All that taxpayer-backed financing for a single company, amounting to half of the total awarded during the entire year. And that’s exactly the type of crony deal-making that is driving the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and a bunch of other special interests to demand that Congress overrun the bank charter. The charter they all endorsed just nine months ago. But now the special interests are chafing under the charter constraints that limit the size of Ex-Im subsidies. Those constraints interfere, for example, with deals as big as Boeing’s pending fleet sale to Iran’s terrorist regime. The Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you.

Friday November 18, 2016 Analysis Argentina Community Economy World Culture Media Sports English on the Side   Number of Locals travelling to giant neighbour expected to rise sharply this summer Monday, September 19, 2016 Air travel shows signs of recovery as flights with Brazil take off Gol workers inspect a Boeing 737 aircraft at the firm’s maintenance centre at the Tancredo Neves International Airport in Confins, Minas Gerais, Brazil in this Thursday, September 15 picture. By Ignacio Portes Herald Staff Flights between Argentina and Brazil set to increase this summer as more firms target local market Argentina and Brazil might both be struggling with recessions, with bilateral trade between the two plunging dramatically over the last two years, but the market for air travel between the two Mercosur members is showing signs of recovery. After years of cutting costs amid falling demand, one of Brazil’s biggest airlines, Gol — which is partnered with Argentina’s state-owned Aerolíneas — says the number of extra flights this summer is expected to double compared to the 2015-2016 season. And it is Argentines who are leading the way, with the country’s travellers to Brazil outnumbering the Brazilians visiting Argentina for the first time in years, bucking a history of predominantly inverted flows. “Argentina’s number one destination is Brazil and Brazil’s is Argentina. And there’s a particular twist to that today, which is that Argentines are travelling more to Brazil than the other way round,” Gol’s Director of Institutional Relations Alberto Fajerman told the Herald. “Firstly because it’s a great destination, then because of the end of restrictions to purchase foreign currency, and finally because the real had a bigger devaluation than other currencies on the continent, and that turned Brazil into a reasonably economical destination.” Summers are always a period of increased demand, with firms adding special flights (be them chartered or sold on an individual basis) to cover for rising tourism, but despite two consecutive years of recession in Brazil and a 2016 of plunging purchasing power in Argentina, Gol said it was expecting roughly 250 extra flights when compared to nearly 125 a year ago. Asked if they do this because they expect more demand or if its the result of a special policy aimed at capturing a larger share of the market despite a stalled economy, another source close to Gol said that “the company would not move like this if it wasn’t expecting a positive response from the market.” The firm’s outlook for the Argentina-Brazil market is significant as roughly a third of those flights are covered by Gol, a figure which rises comfortably above 50 percent if its partner Aerolíneas Argentinas is included in the calculations. The news comes shortly after other foreign airlines made moves to expand in Argentina, with Colombia’s giant Avianca buying the small local firm MacAir in March and Ireland’s low-cost Ryanair also suggesting it could enter the local market. Cost saving Gol is also sometimes seen as a low-cost airline too, as the firm emphasizes flying on standarized planes to simplify operations, and even uses the lightest paint possible in order to reduce fuel costs. It was cost-saving that kept the firm afloat throughout the past few years, the firm’s spokesman said. “It is a difficult market. Business travellers have gone down from 60 percent of tickets sold to 50 percent, with leisure travellers, who usually pay less, growing in proportion. So each flight is producing reduced yields too. Our answer has been to cut costs so as to mantain margins,” Fajerman said, although repeatedly stating that this was not done at the expense of security measures. He was speaking after an event on the 10-year anniversary of Gol’s maintenance centre in Confins, Minas Gerais, the biggest in Latin America. Technicians for the company there said that they could use the facilities to fix planes from other firms, including Aerolíneas, but that this was more of an informal arrangement on an individual basis and not part of a wider agreement. With the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration authorizing the centre to repair US planes, the firm could now also use it for an additional profit stream. Changes in the market Historically, Brazilians have accounted for “two thirds or more” of the bilateral air travel between both countries, down to 55 percent “in good times,” but not frequently. Now, the market seems to be changing. Brazil, whose currency the real strengthened for years allowing for more travel abroad, has now gotten cheaper for foreign tourists going there. And while Argentina also devalued recently when the clamp on foreign currency trade was lifted in December, capital inflows are expected to keep the peso strong over the next few years, meaning that travel abroad will remain relatively affordable when compared to internal tourism. While purchasing power for the working person has fallen significantly in both countries as of late, the business sector, whose influence in air travel is strong, has gotten more optimistic after a couple of years of decline with the rise of market-friendly governments. Gol, Tam, Latam and Azul, the biggest carriers in Brazil, got rid of 60 planes over the last two years to reduce costs by downsizing their fleet. Now, they expect a timid recovery. Fajerman also hinted at a strategy targeting new destinations, adding direct flights from Buenos Aires to Manaos following the success of others to Fortaleza, Recife and Natal, while he said they also wanted to encourage Brazilians to visit cities outside of Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Mendoza, the typical three destinations for them. Formally, however, a bilateral agreement means that there is a weekly limit of slots for regular flights between Argentina and Brazil, which is unlikely to be expanded until Argentine firms sell their share in full, something which Gol is already doing. Only in the summer does this figure grow as an exception to keep the additional demand in check. “We are not adding regular flights because we are occupying the 76 slots we are assigned per week. We are shifting flights from one destination to another to keep demand satisfied,” Gol said. Outlook for the region As for other expansion plans, Fajerman said that it was only natural to think about focusing on Latin America due to the firm’s policy of only using Boeing models whose fuel capacity limits them to medium-distance travel. “We want to go to Peru next, then maybe Colombia,” he forecasted. “Sadly, we have suspended flights to Venezuela. Not for political reasons, but because of commercial problems, with exchange rates, access to dollars, that have meant that flights at the moment cannot be justified. But it is still a fantastic market that we know will come back, just as Brazil,” the director said. @ignacioportes Size email Print Share Vote Tweets por @BAHeraldcom Get to File LATEST NEWS MOST POPULAR BEST RANKED Macri meets with Canada’s Trudeau: 'We seek to enhance trade relations' Yellen says Fed could raise interest rates 'relatively soon' Gov't says income tax changes to be retrospective Trump shuffles transition team, eyes loyalists for Cabinet Recent releases                     Edition No. 5015 - This publication is a property of NEFIR S.A. -RNPI Nº 5293935 - Issn 1852 - 9224 - Te. 4349-1500 - San Juan 141 , (C1063ACY) CABA

Argentina: Aerolineas Argentinas faces a tough turnaround with government's new liberal mindset CAPA > Aviation Analysis > Argentina: Aerolineas Argentinas faces a tough turnaround with government's new liberal mindset 19-Sep-2016 Tweet © CAPA A new liberalised mindset emerging in Argentina has drawn the attention of Latin American airline groups looking to capitalise on new opportunities in the country’s historically closed-off domestic aviation market. Avianca’s major shareholder Synergy Group is aiming to launch a new domestic airline in Argentina, and the Viva Group is also eying establishing a new airline in the country after abandoning plans to launch its third low cost carrier in Costa Rica. At the same time, Argentina’s state-owned flag carrier Aerolineas Argentinas is attempting to transition to a more commercially minded airline after years of bleeding cash and being propped by the former Argentinian government. The airline is aiming to become solvent by 2018, but formidable challenges lie ahead for Aerolineas in reaching that goal, evidenced by the airline’s pilots recently resorting to a familiar tactic – staging a strike. Argentina’s pledge for a more liberalised aviation market is a welcome change, but obstacles loom large for the country’s largest airline and prospective start-ups as the government still regulates domestic fares, and infrastructure costs remain high. Still, a move toward liberalisation in one of Latin America’s most closed-off markets could be one of the most important developments in the region’s aviation industry in the medium to long term. Aerolineas Argentinas faces an uphill climb to achieving financial stability After Argentina’s current president Mauricio Macri was elected in late 2015, his new government made several overtures toward liberalisation, and stated its objective to double domestic air traffic over the next four years, after growing 60% from 2011 to 2015. See related report: Argentina Aviation Part 2: Aerolineas Argentinas is pressured as competition intensifies Aerolineas remains a government-controlled entity, but a new president is attempting to transform the airline into a viable commercial enterprise. The company has not released a balance sheet update since 2013, when it lost USD247 million on USD2 billion of revenue. Argentina’s government has outlined plans to cut subsidies to the airline; in fact, Aerolineas president Isela Costantini has been quoted in the press with the statement that in assuming leadership at the airline she has inherited a fleet of unpaid aircraft and high levels of debt. Aerolineas has 53 aircraft in its operating fleet and 21 on order.  Aerolineas Argentinas fleet summary, as of 18-Sep-2016 Aircraft In Service Inactive On Order* Total: 53 1 21 Airbus A330-200 8 0 1 Airbus A340-300 0 1 0 Airbus A340-300X 6 0 0 Boeing 737-700 16 0 0 Boeing 737-800 23 0 20 Source: CAPA Fleet Database Orders include those placed directly by the operator and by lessors assigned to the operator, from 18-Sep-2016 onwards. CAPA’s Fleet Database indicates that Aerolineas has 10 Boeing 737-800s scheduled for delivery in 2017, followed by five additional deliveries in 2018. Aerolineas Argentinas projected delivery dates for aircraft purchased from OEMs and leased from lessors, as of 18-Sep-2016 Source: CAPA Fleet Database Aircraft operated by subsidiaries/associates of the main airline may be listed separately. Firm orders include those placed directly by the operator and by lessors assigned to the operator, from 19-Sep-2016 onwards. Excludes aircraft for which the delivery date has not been announced, cannot be reasonably projected or is unlikely to be delivered. According to local news outlets, Aerolineas could post a USD1 billion loss for 2016. Ms Costantini has a stated goal of making the airline solvent by 2018; achieving that target entails slashing costs, cutting staff, and finding viable aircraft financing. Aerolineas recently took delivery of the first of two A330-200s from the aircraft lessor Aircastle, and Ms Costantini has highlighted the "unprecedented conditions" reached on the aircraft. With the onset of A350 widebodies leasing rates for the A330s are obviously favourable, but given Aerolineas credit profile – the airline’s suppliers and lessors are assuming considerable risks. Aerolineas did secure a 10.5 year, USD280 million loan from GE Capital Aviation Services in Aug-2016, secured by four A330-200s with GE engines and three 737-800s. During 2015 Aerolineas has USD110 million in debt to Boeing, which swelled to USD200 million in 2016. As the former GM executive Ms Costantini works to reconcile Aerolineas’ tangled and complex web of finances, labour unrest has once again surfaced at the airline. In mid-Sep-2016 pilots staged a strike, triggering the cancellation of dozens of flights. The airline’s pilots resorted to striking after failing to reach an agreement with Aerolineas’ management on wages. Aerolineas faces a wildcat strike as it works to bolster its leading domestic position The timing of any strike action for an airline is ill-fated, but Aerolineas is in the process of expanding domestically and the cancellations due to the strike do not engender a lot of confidence among passengers in a country where long haul luxury bus travel remains popular. Aerolineas has undertaken domestic expansion at the same time as the country’s new government has outlined plans to double domestic traffic during the next four years. As previously reported by CAPA, Aerolineas’ weekly domestic seats in Nov-2016 will grow 15% year-on-year, coinciding with the summer season of the Southern Hemisphere that begins in Oct-2016. Starting in Oct-2016 Aerolineas is adding frequencies to several markets, and introducing flights from La Rioja to Catamarca and El Calafate to Bariloche. Data from CAPA and OAG show that Aerolineas’ domestic seats are projected to rise in early 2016, growing 11% year-on-year for the first week of Jan-2017.

Argentina domestic capacity by airline (% of seats): 2-Jan-2017 to 8-Jan-2017 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and OAG The small charter and business jet operator MacAir Jet will represent a fraction of Argentina’s domestic seats in early Jan-2017, but changes are under way at the operator after it was acquired by Avianca Holdings’ major shareholder Synergy. Synergy plans to transform MacAir Jet into a scheduled turboprop operator with a base at Cordoba, Aerolineas’ second largest domestic base measured by seat deployment. However, Aerolineas’ deploys more than four times more seats from its largest domestic base at Buenos Aires Aeroparque. Aerolineas has expanded from Cordoba ahead of the establishment of Synergy’s new airline at the airport, growing from nine point-to-point domestic routes from the airport in Jun-2016 to 13 in Sep-2016. Aerolineas Argentinas top 10 domestic hubs/bases/stations by seats: 19-Sep-2016 to 25-Sep-2016 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and OAG. Aerolineas is clearly attempting to strengthen its network breadth in Argentina’s domestic market ahead of the establishment of new competitors, with Synergy being the greatest near-term threat. At one point Synergy aimed to launch the new airline by YE2016, but it is not clear if the company will meet that targeted start date. The Viva Group has also expressed an interest in establishing its third LCC in Latin America in Argentina and has met with Argentinian government officials about doing so, but Viva has yet to outline any definitive plans for entering the Argentinian market. LATAM Argentina is also likely to resume expansion in Argentina after being hamstrung from expanding by the previous government, in order to protect Aerolineas. But conditions also need to be favourable for LATAM Argentina’s expansion. Domestic fares are low, on average, and regulated by the government, while airport and other fixed costs are high. Those dynamics, along with Argentina’s weak economy, which is forecast to contract by 1% in 2016, create some challenges in operating profitably in Argentina’s domestic market. Yet the chance to inject true low cost competition in one of the few remaining markets without a true low cost airline is an opportunity not to be overlooked – if a prospective airline can achieve a cost profile that allows for the stimulation of traffic through lower fares. There should be more options for Argentinians than just a dominant flag carrier, one that is undertaking a painful transformation to a more legitimate and accountable commercial entity. After years of constraint, Argentina is now one of Latin America's most interesting markets The move toward a more liberalised aviation business within and to and from Argentina is a welcome sign for one of the few remaining countries without a true low cost airline, and for Latin America overall. Despite the current economic weakness stubbornly hanging over the region opportunities remain to stimulate some of Latin America’s domestic markets with the low cost model, if governments recognise the value of increased competition. Argentina appears to be taking positive steps in that direction. A real test for Argentina’s government is adhering to its pledge of lowering the subsidies that Aerolineas Argentinas receives, in order for the airline to transition to a competitive entity that operates with a new level of fiscal responsibility. Each changing dynamic will take some time to reach fruition, resulting in Argentina emerging as one of Latin America’ most interesting markets during the next few years. Want more analysis like this?

Argentina Aviation Part 2: Aerolineas Argentinas pressured as competition intensifies 30-Jun-2016 Argentina’s domestic market is poised for more rapid domestic growth driven by further expansion at Aerolineas Argentinas and intensifying competition. Aerolineas has focused primarily on domestic expansion since its renationalisation in 2008 and continues to grow its domestic fleet. Argentina’s domestic market grew by approximately 60% from 2011 to 2015, driven entirely from expansion at the Aerolineas Argentinas Group. Competition during this period was limited by the restrictive and protectionist policies of the previous government, enabling Aerolineas to increase its market share without having to fend off expansion from its local rival LATAM Argentina, or potential start-ups. Under the more liberal policies of Argentina’s new government, LATAM Argentina is now free to expand. New airlines are also able to launch, starting with a regional start-up backed by Avianca parent Synergy and a potential new affiliate of the Latin American LCC group Viva. Aerolineas is responding to the prospect of new competition by pursuing more domestic expansion. Avianca airline group: bracing for changing Colombian market as Latin America starts to recover 14-Nov-2016 Latin American airline group Avianca Holdings is welcoming continued improving trends in the region, which started to emerge in 2Q2016 and appear to be gaining strength in 2H2016. The company’s yield decreases slowed year-on-year in 3Q2016 to the single digits, and Avianca posted a rise in yields sequentially from 2Q2016 to 3Q2016. Avianca’s optimism rests on robust load factors, particularly on long haul routes from its largest market – Colombia –to the US and Europe. Demand is also picking up in South America as travellers adjust to the effects of currency depreciation that, while improving, have become a mainstay in many markets in the region. Avianca’s booking trends for Nov-2016 and Dec-2016 indicate that positive momentum is continuing into 4Q2016. The company faces changing dynamics in its largest market Colombia in late 2016 when Copa Airlines shifts its business model in the country to a low cost operation in order to compete more effectively. Avianca seems unconcerned about Copa’s change in strategy, citing its strong position in Colombia despite increased competition arising in the country’s domestic market during the last few years. Colombia’s market should undergo further changes in 2017 when LATAM Airlines Group begins instituting a new pricing model in its domestic markets, including in Colombia. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

The story of how this was done not only proves that the Clintons are behind the loss of American jobs, but shows how Bill Clinton established a Democratic strategy for manipulating foreign policy that was copied by both Hillary while she was Secretary of State and Obama while he was president. At the time, U.S.-China trade relations were conditioned upon China’s humanitarian treatment of its own citizens. Americans had seen protesters in Tiananmen Square crushed by Chinese tanks. The brutality of the Chinese toward unarmed protesters had shocked Americans so much that China was required to treat its citizens in a humanitarian way in order to maintain its MFN (Most Favored Nation) status. China desperately needed to keep its MFN status for one reason: only with MFN status could it get a huge discount on tariffs it had to pay to the U.S. With MFN Chinese manufacturers only had to pay a 6% tariff. Without it they would have had to pay an unprofitable 40%. So without its MFN status China couldn’t as easily compete with American manufacturers. China’s MFN status was suspended during the Korean War, but conditionally reinstated in 1980 under the Jackson-Vanir freedom of emigration amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. This is where Bill Clinton stepped in. With his 1993 Executive Order, he unconstitutionally seized control of the MFN conditions, removing it from the involvement of Congress, just as Obama seized treaty control away from the Senate with his Iranian nuke deal. Clinton’s Executive Order was issued at a time when the U.S.-China trade deficit was only $18 billion a year. In 2015 the deficit was $367 billion. It’s important to understand that at the time China’s MFN status was annually up for review by Congress. The effective law was passed in 1974. What Bill Clinton did, with an unconstitutional Executive Order, was to use “the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States” to rewrite a Congressionally approved treaty and change the terms. The way he changed it is eerily similar to the way Hillary practiced State Department decisions when she was Secretary of State from 2009 to 2012. Bill Clinton intentionally, with great harm to jobs in the U.S., changed the terms of the law in this way: instead of requiring a vote of Congress to reaffirm China’s MFN status every year, Bill Clinton illegally shifted the decision-making role to the Secretary of State. This eliminated the power of Congress to approve the annual MFN status. President Clinton, in his 1993 statement, said this was necessary to avoid the “annual battles between Congress and the Executive” which was divisive. Of course it was divisive -- the Framers of the Constitution intended it to be so. Without the input of the elected members of Congress the people had no say. Similarly, Hillary Clinton used her position as Sec. of State to personally approve/disapprove many agreements. President Obama was to emulate this shifting of foreign policy making to bureaucrats in 2015 with his so-called Iranian “deal.” An agreement with a foreign nation is a treaty, not a deal. This is because the authority of the U.S. government is used to both make the treaty and adhere to its terms. The Constitution properly gives the people, working through the Senate, the opportunity to have a voice in the terms of the treaty. Bill Clinton, Hillary, and Obama all stole this input from the voters and placed it under their control. And just as the Clinton Foundation has been linked to relationships Hillary had to her speech payers and donors, Bill Clinton’s decision to send jobs to China by permanently controlling its MFN status has been linked to campaign donations. Boeing Company wanted the EO. Boeing was the parent company of the Loral Corporation, which donated $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee in June, 1994, according to a Washington Post report at the time. A nice reward to Clinton for his MFN status change. The Loral Corporation is a major developer of missile flight control software and at the time they wanted to launch satellites from China. Boeing also owned McDonnell-Douglas which in 1994 made an agreement with China to open a parts factory in Beijing. If this all seems oddly similar to the deals Hillary made with foundation campaign donors, well, that’s because it is. While Bill Clinton made this deal through an Executive Order, it’s important to note that there are other developments which have evolved from the EO. The Clinton Foundation is legally located in Canada, allowing the Clintons to hide the identities of their donors. They also used the foundation as a method of obtaining payment for delivering unprecedentedly expensive speeches. In return, it appears that Hillary allowed donors access to her office and granted State Department permission on numerous foreign trade deals. Since these agreements and deals were made through email the Clinton email scandal is seen as an effort to hide the pay for play evidence. In 2001 Boeing got a $63 million dollar incentive “deal” from the Democratic mayor of Chicago to relocate its headquarters there. These incentives will likely be paid for, in typical Democratic Party style, by the middle-class and poor taxpayers who will have to make up that $63 million through their own family’s budgets. Boeing only brought 500 jobs to the city, costing taxpayers $126,000 per job. This, like the Chinese MFN Executive Order, promoted as a good investment for the city. When all of these actions are thoroughly investigated, these deals will reveal that the Democratic Party’s globalization initiative is mostly a scheme to get rich by trading U.S. governmental authority, and American jobs, to enrich a tiny number of people. As the Clintons and Obama get richer the American people lose jobs and become poorer. Those are facts. This is primarily done by shifting the authority of government. Bill Clinton bestowed the authority to reauthorize China’s MFN status to the Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton bestowed upon herself the authority to negotiate with companies with foreign interests and the foreign nations themselves. And Barack Obama seized the power of Federal agencies through his 32 czars, bypassing the restraints imposed by the Constitution. The basic strategy is to shift authority, then control that newly created authority, bypassing the role of Congress.  It’s only just begun. Voters can decide if they want to see more unrestrained power brokering by Hillary. On May 28, 1993 Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 12850. This improper EO changed the way the U.S. made trade deals with China and led to the loss of tens of millions of American manufacturing jobs. The story of how this was done not only proves that the Clintons are behind the loss of American jobs, but shows how Bill Clinton established a Democratic strategy for manipulating foreign policy that was copied by both Hillary while she was Secretary of State and Obama while he was president.

Of course it was divisive -- the Framers of the Constitution intended it to be so. Without the input of the elected members of Congress the people had no say. Similarly, Hillary Clinton used her position as Sec. of State to personally approve/disapprove many agreements. President Obama was to emulate this shifting of foreign policy making to bureaucrats in 2015 with his so-called Iranian “deal.” An agreement with a foreign nation is a treaty, not a deal. This is because the authority of the U.S. government is used to both make the treaty and adhere to its terms. The Constitution properly gives the people, working through the Senate, the opportunity to have a voice in the terms of the treaty. Bill Clinton, Hillary, and Obama all stole this input from the voters and placed it under their control. And just as the Clinton Foundation has been linked to relationships Hillary had to her speech payers and donors, Bill Clinton’s decision to send jobs to China by permanently controlling its MFN status has been linked to campaign donations. Boeing Company wanted the EO. Boeing was the parent company of the Loral Corporation, which donated $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee in June, 1994, according to a Washington Post report at the time. A nice reward to Clinton for his MFN status change. The Loral Corporation is a major developer of missile flight control software and at the time they wanted to launch satellites from China. Boeing also owned McDonnell-Douglas which in 1994 made an agreement with China to open a parts factory in Beijing. If this all seems oddly similar to the deals Hillary made with foundation campaign donors, well, that’s because it is. While Bill Clinton made this deal through an Executive Order, it’s important to note that there are other developments which have evolved from the EO. The Clinton Foundation is legally located in Canada, allowing the Clintons to hide the identities of their donors. They also used the foundation as a method of obtaining payment for delivering unprecedentedly expensive speeches. In return, it appears that Hillary allowed donors access to her office and granted State Department permission on numerous foreign trade deals. Since these agreements and deals were made through email the Clinton email scandal is seen as an effort to hide the pay for play evidence. In 2001 Boeing got a $63 million dollar incentive “deal” from the Democratic mayor of Chicago to relocate its headquarters there. These incentives will likely be paid for, in typical Democratic Party style, by the middle-class and poor taxpayers who will have to make up that $63 million through their own family’s budgets. Boeing only brought 500 jobs to the city, costing taxpayers $126,000 per job. This, like the Chinese MFN Executive Order, promoted as a good investment for the city. When all of these actions are thoroughly investigated, these deals will reveal that the Democratic Party’s globalization initiative is mostly a scheme to get rich by trading U.S. governmental authority, and American jobs, to enrich a tiny number of people. As the Clintons and Obama get richer the American people lose jobs and become poorer. Those are facts. This is primarily done by shifting the authority of government. Bill Clinton bestowed the authority to reauthorize China’s MFN status to the Secretary of State. Hillary Clinton bestowed upon herself the authority to negotiate with companies with foreign interests and the foreign nations themselves. And Barack Obama seized the power of Federal agencies through his 32 czars, bypassing the restraints imposed by the Constitution. The basic strategy is to shift authority, then control that newly created authority, bypassing the role of Congress.  It’s only just begun. Voters can decide if they want to see more unrestrained power brokering by Hillary.

Among other inaccuracies and flaws, the report cites Bellingcat’s ignorance of technical details. The Russian report is based on the investigation carried out by a team of bloggers, journalists, aviation experts and volunteers calling themselves ‘Anti-Bellingcat’. It makes use of the technical expertise of the Russian arms producer Almaz-Antey. The leader of the group and author of the report is Yury Kotenok, editor-in-chief of the news website Segodnia.ru. The biggest challenge for them is to help shed light on the absolute truth behind the tragedy. Their primary objective is to cut short the continuous spread of disinformation regarding the MH17 international investigation.  According to the authors of the Russian report, published on Tuesday, Bellingcat is “ready to design any version whatsoever meant to accuse Russia." “That’s an information war,” Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to the chief designer of Almaz-Antey, said in an interview with the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily. “[Bellingcat’s] version [of the tragedy] is evidence-free. They do not build a version based on facts, but trim the facts to fit their version. Just to give an example, the Dutch, at the suggestion of Bellingcat, claim that the missile flew toward the plane. This has been refuted by all our data, both mathematical and experimental,” he noted on Friday. Read more Russian arms producer challenges media criticism of its MH17 crash inquiry – report The first discrepancy, noted by the Russian activists that Bellingcat was trying to prove that the Malaysian Boeing was shot down by a BUK missile system belonging to the Russian army.  As “proof” Bellingcat referred to a Paris Match photo in July 2014 in Ukraine allegedly showing a BUK missile system being transported near Donetsk. The British outlet compared it with a picture of a BUK on the way inside Russia in Belgorod Region, alleging they are one and the same. However, in their report, Russian activists note a key difference between the two. The BUK pictured in Russia contains a "step" on the left side of the system. It has been introduced only after 1984 to ease the crew’s embarking to the vehicle. The picture posted by Paris Match and cited by Bellingcat does not have that feature,the activists note. “This means only one thing – the photographs presented different modifications of the ‘BUK’ systems, so, as sad as it might be for Bellingcat, there is no way it can be one and the same vehicle,” the report states. © segodnia.ru In the report Russian activists have countered Bellingcat’s claims that there have been no Ukrainian BUK missile systems in the conflict-zone in the country’s East. They provided various screen shots of Ukrainian media reports, picturing BUK missile systems of the Ukrainian army in the conflict area. One of the screenshots contains part of the program called “Hour CH” by the Ukrainian First National TV channel. The respective program is dated July 16, just a day before the MH17 crash. “The photo shows a self-propelled fire installation "Buk" [missile system] and radar 19ZH6 (35D6). This radar station in the Ukrainian army is used as an additional means of controlling the air space and targeting systems for air defense fire units, armed with ‘Buk’ [missile system]”, the activists’ investigation finds. Ukraine “does possess BUK missile systems of type BUK M1” and Kiev has in fact confirmed the modernization of some of it, adviser to the head designer of the Russian Almaz Antey arms producer, which also manufactures BUK systems, Mikhail Malyshevsky, told RT. Last Wednesday, Russian media obtained a statement by Almaz-Antey, in which the company accused Western media, including Bellingcat, of trying to manipulate public opinion and confusing facts to discredit its own investigation into the issue. © segodnia.ru Russian activists have also raised questions over Bellingcat’s allegation that the location from where the plane has been shot down by BUK was under rebel control. Bellingcat backs up its claims by showing maps of the conflict region provided by the Ukrainian military as well as services like LiveUAmap и kot-ivanov. But in fact Bellingcat itself admits that the official maps “did not reflect the full picture” of the fighting, according to Russian activists’ report. LiveUAmap has also a problem of being rather not accurate, showing some of the fighting “deep inside Russian territory,” the document adds. Russian bloggers accused Bellingcat of simply “interpreting facts” to suit their theory. “Even an approximate study of the evidences which are imposed by Bellingcat as irrefutable, allow us to make a conclusion about their untenability,” the report says.  Read more MH17 criminal probe at ‘advanced stage’ as relatives press Malaysia Airlines with lawsuit Speaking to RT, the former deputy chief of the Russian Air Defense forces, Aleksandr Tazehulalov, said the Malaysian Boeing might have been shot down unintentionally. “Many are inclined to believe that given the severe condition of the Ukrainian army at that time, the preparation of the crews of anti-missile systems was not enough for their effective use. I cannot confirm this theory … but every crew can make a mistake, there is this notorious human factor. I do not exclude it,” he said. Ukraine has been already involved in a civilian passenger jet being brought down by a missile over its territory. On October 4, 2001 a Russian TU 154 liner was shot down by a Ukrainian S-200 missile during drills in the Black Sea, killing all 78 people onboard. Back then Kiev officially recognized the responsibility and issued an apology. On September 28, the Dutch-led Joint Investigative committee will release its findings on the criminal part of the investigation, which is expected to name the exact responsible side for the crash. Malaysian Boeing MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed over war-ravaged East Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 people onboard.

Photo By Lanz Mendoza Tension gripped the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) on Tuesday when members of the anti-hijacking unit of the Police Aviation Security Group (Avsegroup) surrounded a Saudi Airline plane after the pilot mistakenly pressed the distress call button. The plane, a Boeing B777, landed at 2:39 p.m. but the 400 passengers were only allowed to disembark at 5 p.m. Airport officials said the Manila Control Tower (MCT) received the distress call at 2:15 p.m., prompting authorities to believe that the plane was under threat. Upon receiving the distress signal, airport authorities implemented a standard operating procedure “in accordance with the airport emergency plan.” The plane, which came from Jeddah, was not allowed to dock at Terminal 1 and the pilot was advised to park at the end of the taxiway. A crisis management team was deployed to verify if there was a hijacking incident. Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) general manager Ed Monreal later told reporters that there was no hijacking and that the pilot in command made a mistake. Monreal said the pilot accidentally pressed the distress button twice. He said the control tower asked the pilot to confirm if the plane was under threat and he again pressed the distress button. “We cannot take chances because we can not determine the real situation inside the aircraft. How can we say if the pilot is telling the truth if it was merely an accident or he may have been ordered to press the button at gun point,” he said. The tension eased when the passengers were finally allowed to disembark. However, they were subjected to rigid security check. Because of the incident, two international flights were diverted to Clark International Airport. Share. Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Email loading... Comments are closed.

In this report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the globalmachining centersmarketfor 2016-2020. The market is further categorized into four end-user segments, which are automotive, aerospace, metal fabrication, and others. "Low-cost manufacturing opportunities in APAC have compelled many companies across industries to shift their manufacturing bases to this region. Rising automotive production in Thailand and initiatives like Make in India have made APAC the focal point of global manufacturing. Therefore, Technavio expects this region to dominate the global market in manufacturing, and in turn, the machining centers market," says Gaurav Mohindru, a lead engineering tools research expert from Technavio. Technavio's heavy industry research analysts segment the global machining centers market into the following regions: APAC EMEA Americas In 2015, with a market share of over 40%, APAC dominated the global machining centers market, followed by EMEA with over 32% and the Americas with approximately 28%. APAC: growing market for machining centers APAC is a growing market for machining centers. The increasing investments in the major end-user industries such as automotive are fueling the demand for machining centers. The next major automotive market is India. Automobile sales in the country were 23.9 million units until April 2016 compared with 23.3 million units during the same period in 2014. This includes commercial vehicles, three wheelers, two wheelers, and passenger vehicles. The growing automobile market in India is one of the major reasons for the increasing investment by industry majors. The aviation sector in China is controlled by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) a major supplier of militaryplanes and helicopters to the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). This organization is posing a tough competition for global giants like Boeing and Airbus. The Chinese aerospace and defense sector is becoming a global military and defense competitor and is expected to be one of the major players in this sector in the next 25 years. Thus, the growth in the major end-user segments in APAC is expected to drive the demand for machining centers in the region during the forecast period.

EMEA: growth in major end-user industries in EMEA to boost growth The machining centers market is expected to grow over the forecast period despite the economic crisis, owing to the economy offered by such equipment. Machining centers provide industries with the opportunity for automation that results in better efficiency and lower power consumption. Automation and its consequences also enable companies to adhere to the strict regulations for energy efficiency and consumption implemented by the governments in European countries, like the 2012 Energy Efficiency Directive for 2020. Countries like UK, Italy, and Germany are major consumers of machining centers in the European market. This is mainly because of the presence of multinational automotive and aerospace companies in this region. The sales of automobiles improved considerably in the European Union since the financial crisis of 2008. Automobile sales showed a 9.3% growth in 2015 compared with that of 2014. In the Middle East and Africa, the automotive market is expected to show remarkable growth during the forecast period. This region is considered as relatively un-motorized by major automakers. The main countries that are expected to contribute to the growth of the automotive sector in this region are Egypt, Iran, South Africa, and Nigeria. During the forecast period, automobile sales in MEA region are expected to reach 3 million units annually, leading to 50% production capacity in the sector. Aerospace is another major sector that uses machining centers in EMEA. Boeing and Airbus are expected to increase their production capacity to meet global demand. The commercial and residential construction sector in Europe is expected to revive in 2016 and is likely to drive the market for the metal fabrication sector where machining centers are also deployed. In the EU, the construction sector in 19 countries is expected to enjoy a positive outlook and show significant growth. Thus, the growth in major end-user industries in EMEA is expected to drive the global market for machining centers during the forecast period. Americas: US holds the largest market for machining centers Being the most industrialized country in North America, the US holds the largest market for machining centers. This is attributed to the growing automobile, aerospace, and metal fabrication industries in the country. Traditionally, the US has always been a leader in the automotive sector in terms of technology and innovations. The country's automobile sector enjoys high demand mainly because of the huge consumer base with high disposable incomes. The high demand for automobiles, in turn, drives the equipment manufacturer market and attracts huge investments in this sector. The top vendors in the global machining centers market highlighted in the report are: Dalian Machine Tool Group (DMTG) DMG Mori Shenyang Machine Tool (SMTCL) Yamazaki Mazak Browse Related Reports: Global Metal Forming Machine Tools Market 2016-2020 Machine Tools Market in US 2015-2019 Global Metal Cutting Machine Tools Market 2016-2020 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

The A350 XWB is the latest addition to the THAI fleet and will operate on the Bangkok-Melbourne route. Photo/Airbus The cabin of Thai Airway’s A350 stands out for its Thai contemporary design. Photo/Airbus The Royal Silk Class of A350 is equipped with staggered seating, offering a good sense of privacy especially in the window seats. Photo/Airbus The Economy Class has the 3-3-3 seating with the “hot seats” numbered 50A and 50K. Photo/Airbus Along with a good choice of movies, the in-flight entertainment system also features the THAI Sky Connect, Wi-Fi service. Photo/Airbus Stretching its wings September 21, 2016 01:00 By Ariya Chayarit The Nation Toulouse, France Thai Airways International (THAI) sends it first A350 XWB into the sky with the royally bestowed name Wichian Buri The newest member of Airbus’ leading widebody family, the A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) is a mid-size long-range aircraft featuring the very latest in aerodynamic design, carbon fibre fuselage and wings, and the new, very efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. With these technologies improving performance in all aspects of operation, the A350 XWB is a serious competitor to Boeing’s B787 and B777. It also offers a 25-per-cent reduction in fuel burn and emissions and lower maintenance costs. The A350 XWB also claims to be the quietest passenger aircraft, next to the giant A380 superjumbo. It is six decibels quieter than the Boeing 787. Thais boarding the newly christened Wichian Buri, as Thai International Airways’ first A350 XWB is known, can be forgiven for immediately associating the aircraft with the grilled chicken for which its namesake district in Phetchabun province is known. While that probably isn’t on the menu, the plane does seem to have been created especially for Thais with the winglets on the newly designed wings bringing to mind the delicate hands of a Thai classical dancer – sweet but strong. Marginally wider that the Boeing 787, the cabin is done out in THAI’s signature violet and boasts both a contemporary design and mood lighting. It is configured in a premium two-class layout with a total of 321 seats: 32 seats in the Royal Silk business class and 289 seats in the main cabin economy class. Highlights in Royal Silk class include the 1-2-1 staggered seating with direct aisle access for each passenger, a fully lie-flat design seat that allows a six-foot-tall passenger to sleep stretched out and a 16-inch video screen. Economy class meanwhile has 3-3-3 seating with the “hot seats” numbered 50A and 50K. These special seats give passengers extra space to stretch their legs since the seats in row 49 are laid out in 2-3-2 leaving gaps at the left and right. To make the A350 economy class different from others, the most comfortable seat – the B/E aerospace pinnacle seat – is used throughout. It’s 18-inches wide, an inch wider than most economy class seats and equipped with a 11-inch video screen. The plane is equipped with the latest Panasonic eX3, in-flight entertainment system boasting about 100 movies, TV programmes, radio channels, music albums, and games. The flight also provides THAI’s Sky Connect Wi-Fi service.  Another plus is the extra-size overhead bins, with each stowing five standard cabin-compliant cases of maximum dimensions with up to 45 kilogramme weight. Airbus says it has 810 orders of the A350 XWB from 43 customers worldwide, making it one of the most successful widebody aircraft ever.  The Wichian Buri is the first of a dozen aircraft set to join the THAI fleet. Four are purchased directly from Airbus while the other eight are acquired under lease agreements. They will all be in service by 2018. After a short period of regional flights between Bangkok and Chiang Mai, Wichian Buri starts its regular Bangkok-Melbourne route next month.   Tags Thai Airways Airbus A350 Bangkok Air travel Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days Blasts from the past...

The worries are that a nine-to-12 month delay in returning to its launch tasks could wipe out the business. September 1st saw a SpaceX rocket suffer an on-ground ‘anomaly’ as it was being tested prior to launching a Spacecom satellite (Amos-6) and explode spectacularly in a blazing fireball. Last week, SpaceX’s president Gwynne Shotwell explain in a very relaxed manner that she was confident that the Elon Musk-owned venture would be returning to normal flight operations during November. Somewhat controversially, the United Launch Alliance’s CEO Tory Bruno, speaking a week ago, talked of SpaceX being grounded for between nine and 12 months. The Alliance is a j-v between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, two giant names in the rocket business and a regular contractor to the US military. Arianespace’s CEO made similar noises at last week’s Euroconsult Space Business Week summit, stressing how its Ariane 5 rockets had enjoyed a winning streak of 73 successful flights, and also saying that the French Guiana-based rocket facility had been inundated with enquiries as to available launch slots over the next two years. The delays to SpaceX – and the consequential further delays to a long list of clients which are booked onto future launches – is already a worry. If SpaceX cannot clearly identify the root cause of the conflagration, then there will be worries over future launches. Indeed, it’s highly unlikely that future launches would get insurance cover if the cause isn’t clearly defined. Then, assuming a fault is identified, it will have to be remedied. There’s also on-going repair work to Launch Complex 40 (and its supporting metal structure), as well as preparation on the adjacent Launch Complex 39A which was always destined to handle Falcon ‘Heavy’ launches, and not those of the Falcon 9 craft.

REUTERS/Edgar Su/File PhotoMore By Steven Scheer JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's defence industry faces layoffs, closures and a scramble to set up shop in the United States following the signing of a new U.S. military aid package that phases out Israel's ability to spend a quarter of the funds on its own businesses. The 10-year, $38 billion agreement, signed on Sept. 15 after a year of negotiations, comes into effect in U.S. fiscal year 2019. It constitutes the most military assistance Washington has ever provided to an ally, but was clinched only after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted concessions. Key among those is the gradual phasing out of a clause allowing Israel to spend 26.3 percent of the funds on its own defence sector, which competes actively with U.S. firms such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon. That means Israeli defence companies will miss out on up to $10 billion that might otherwise have been spent on home-made drones, missiles, tanks and other equipment, depending on the precise terms of the phase-out, which remain unclear. Once that phase-out is completed, all the funds in the agreement will have to be spent in the United States. "It's quite a problem," said one Israeli defence industry official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. "The bigger companies and most advanced ones with the best technology and capabilities will be able to survive, but the smaller you are, the bigger the problem is." Netanyahu's office declined to comment on the domestic consequences of the aid deal but has said the agreement "will greatly strengthen the security of Israel". Israel has about 700 defence-related firms, most of them with only 50 to 150 employees. They mainly act as subcontractors to Israel's four largest defence companies -- Elbit Systems, Israel Aerospace Industries, Israel Military Industries and Rafael Advanced Defence Systems. Israel's defence exports totalled $5.7 billion in 2015, about 14 pct of all exports and a major driver of the economy. OPTIONS None of the companies asked by Reuters to discuss the aid package were willing to speak on the record, mentioning concerns about future business. But several executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that as a result of the deal they were already considering contingency plans. One option would be for larger firms to open subsidiaries in the United States, like Elbit has done, to compensate for the loss of business. They might also acquire smaller U.S. firms. As one executive put it: "This should be translated into an opportunity for the Israeli industry, which should penetrate new markets and improve their competitive ability." "We should face the global trends and the fact that Israel is losing its ability to compete," the official said, adding the company where he works would "accelerate the process" of searching for a U.S. company to buy. Another area of concern is the loss of Israeli know-how, with aerospace engineers and scientists potentially moving abroad if there is a decline in inward spending and investment. The executives said they hoped that when the time comes, the government will find the nearly $1 billion a year extra needed to keep the sector afloat under terms of the agreement, although the sum may be hard to come by given the fractured political environment. According to Israel's Manufacturers' Association, even a 1 billion shekel ($265 million) cut in the defence budget will lead to the layoff of more than 2,000 workers, mostly from small- and medium-sized subcontractors that have a "to be or not to be" dependence on orders from the Israeli defence establishment. A source close to Netanyahu said the prime minister didn't anticipate any closure of small defence companies, and noted the procurement changes would go into effect only in time. On the domestic political front, the right-wing leader has drawn fire over the new pact from critics, including his former defence minister Ehud Barak, who said that Netanyahu's vocal opposition to last year's U.S.-led nuclear deal with Iran had jeopardised a potentially larger package. However, with uncertainties surrounding a tightly contested election for the White House, Netanyahu was keen to wrap up an agreement, replacing the current $30 billion deal that expires at the end of fiscal 2018. Read More Addressing his cabinet on Sunday, Netanyahu called arguments that Israel was short-changed in the negotiations "distortions and fabrications of parties with political interests". Avraham Bar David, a former general who works with some 200 small Israeli defence contractors through the Manufacturers' Association, predicted that "70 to 100 of them" will not survive the local procurement restriction. "These companies are too small to sell abroad," he said.

Most Wall Street strategists agree that the way to play the fourth quarter and next year is with large cap stocks that pay and consistently increase their dividends. We screened the Jefferies Franchise List stocks, which are the ones the firm ranks highest for its institutional and high net worth clients, and found four companies that look like good picks to finish up the year with. All are rated Buy and pay dividends that are at least as high as the 10-year Treasury yield. AbbVie This stock is one of the top global pharmaceutical stocks picks across Wall Street. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) is a global, research-based biopharmaceutical company formed in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories. The company’s mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world’s most complex and serious diseases. AbbVie employs more than 26,000 people worldwide and markets medicines in more than 170 countries. One of the biggest concerns with AbbVie is what eventually might happen with anti-inflammatory therapy Humira, which generated $14 billion in sales in fiscal 2015. That was the most any drug has recorded during a single year and represents a gigantic part of the company’s overall earnings. The problem is that biosimilars and generics are itching to enter the market with Amgen leading the charge, and some Wall Street analysts project that AbbVie may have a difficult time stopping that trend. Back in May, the patent board instituted Coherus BioSciences’ Inter Partes Review against the Humira ‘135 patent. The outcome of the review is expected in 12 months. While most analysts remain positive on Humira duration, the expected litigation uncertainty could continue to create an overhang on the stock, which does give investors chances to pick up shares lower. AbbVie investors are paid an outstanding 3.62% dividend. The Jefferies price target for the stock is $90, and the Wall Street consensus target is $71.28. The stock closed most recently at $62.91 a share. Boeing This top aerospace industrial is still down over 10% since the beginning of the year, and we recently noted it has been the worst performing Dow Jones Industrial Average stock this year. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services worldwide. Top Wall Street analysts have increased confidence in continuing good demand, and they note that the company has made announcements in the past that support the thesis that the productivity and margins will continue to improve. 787 execution is good as the company works through the backlog, and cash flow looks to be strong with 787 deliveries and C-17 orders. Some Wall Street analysts also point to continued lower oil prices as a bullish indicator for the top carriers who are Boeing’s big customers. Boeing investors are paid a very solid 3.44% dividend. The Jefferies price target is set at $165, and the consensus price target for the stock is $149.27. The shares closed trading on Monday at $127.48.

(Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) Story Highlights More than 78,000 veterans and spouses are interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona The U.S. flag is lowered to half-staff each morning to honor the dead and raised each evening Nathan E. Cook, the last survivor of the Spanish-American War, is among those buried there We could almost add another letter to the state's exalted Five Cs. How about a “D” for defense? Almost sounds like the name of a '50s doo-wop band — “D and the Five Cs.” It's true. Installations like Luke Air Force Base in Glendale, Davis-Monthan in Tucson, the Yuma and Gila Bend's facilities and National Guard sites contribute to Arizona's military bloodline, as do defense contractors like Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, among others. But a more somber site pays homage to those who have served and sacrificed, the 225-acre National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona in Phoenix. Think of it as the Arlington of the desert. More than 78,000 veterans and spouses are interred at the site on Cave Creek Road, which was authorized in 1976 by then-governor Raul Castro and dedicated in December 1978. The facility is one of two in the state managed by Veterans Affairs. The other located in Prescott. AZCENTRAL Who's buried in Phoenix-area cemeteries? Cemetery's mission “Our mission is to honor veterans and their families with final resting places in national shrines and with lasting tributes that commemorate their service and sacrifice to our nation,” administrative officer Deborah Ryan says. “It's a peaceful and serene setting with panoramic views of the mountain.” United States, Arizona and Prisoners of War flags proudly fly daily. The U.S. flag is lowered to half-staff each morning to honor the dead and raised each evening, Ryan says. A flagpole from the USS Arizona from Pearl Harbor holds the Arizona flag. The stirring bugle call “Taps” plays several times each day, along with honor guard salutes, for different ceremonies at casket sites, inurnments and columbarium niches. Ground-level plaques spread out in precise military fashion in all directions. Monuments arranged along the Memorial Walkway and Founder's Plaza include the World War II Submarine Torpedo, the Eternal Flame pyramid and Vietnam Veterans memorial. Notables Among the many at rest at the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona include Nathan E. Cook, the last survivor of the Spanish-American War, who died at age 106 in 1992. Cook also served in the Navy in World War I and early stages of World War II before retiring after 40 years as a lieutenant. Former Arizona governor Evan Mecham and his wife, Florence, also are at the site. The Army pilot was shot down in 1945 during World War II and was held as a prisoner of war for 22 days. Visitors to the site also note U.S. Rep. Jon Kyl's predecessor to Arizona's 4th Congressional District, Eldon Dean Rudd, who grew up in Camp Verde. Leading medical historian and former Army signal intelligence officer Thomas Bonner also is interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona. Bonner joined the Army after the attack at Pearl Harbor and went on to be the president of Wayne State University in Detroit and Union College in New York. Bonner died in 2003 in Scottsdale. Everyone is special Arizona's National Memorial Cemetery, Ryan says. “They're all notables,” she says. Contact “Only in Arizona” columnist Mark Nothaft at marknothaft.onlyinaz@gmail.com.

The Duwamish Waterway Park was a family affair Saturday afternoon with cultural dance and music featured on two stages, a dunk tank, boat rides, and tacos and hot dogs served. According to event emcee Paulina Lopez, a South Park resident, 600 hot dogs and 500 tamales were eaten. "This is the most awesome fest in the city," said B.J. Cummings, an advisor with the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition on policy issues, and a fundraiser. "There is no place in the world I'd rather be than on the banks of the Duwamish River. She added with tongue in cheek, "My heart is in the river. Well, my heart is in the river, but kind of in the mud at the bottom. And until that mud is cleaned up my heart is going to be trapped down there." "We will get it cleaner but we have a long road to go to get it clean, unfortunately," Mayor Mike McGinn told the West Seattle Herald. "Even if we clean out what's in the river, the pollution that still comes into the river from surrounding areas as well as from up river means that we'll have to keep working." Referring to the Duwamish River being identified as a Superfund Site, involving four parties most responsible to fund the cleanup, the City, County, Port, and Boeing, he said, "The four parties are working together, and we'll be figuring out who else will have to help with it (...) It's important that we're looking holistically at the river and the system and trying to make sure we're spending our money wisely so that our first investment gives us the biggest impact. But again, I have to emphasize that even if you clean up what's in the river you have to change the practices of all the sources of the river if you really want to keep it clean." ---------------------------------------- This morning at 9:00 a.m. the event activities began at Seacrest Park on Alki with walkers, bikers, and paddlers. Michael Lewis is event coordinator for the Walk, Bike, Paddle Festival Fundraiser, and a graphic designer. His wife, Mandy assisted. The walk was 6 miles, bike route, 10, and they met up with paddlers at the Duwamish Waterway Park." Five members of the First Aid Station Fast Team of the Seattle Chapter of the Red Coast were dispatched to keep the participants safe. Dusty Doty, 17, of Westwood, went on the kayak tour with his mother, Patty, and their friends in from Montrose, Colorado. "I always wanted to paddle the Duwamish and never have," said Patty. "I thought the park where we are going would be fun to explore. I don't know too much about the Duwamish River but you don't want to be dumping your kayak into it." "It's a great sunny day in the City of Seattle," said Alki Kayak owner Greg Whittaker. "Ive got 14 paddlers plus (more) people with their own kayaks." He prepped his group, "The Duwamish River has been cut off through industrial development which was really important to our economy here, but we are trying to reclaim it through new parks like the T-107 park by Kellogg Island which you will be paddling past." Kate Ayers of Highland Park teaches 5th grade at Concord Elementary School in South Park and was kayaking today. "We are teaching the kids about environmental and social justice and taking an active stance on cleaning up the Duwamish," she said. ________________________________________________________ Press release from event organizers: Duwamish River Festival 2011 6th Annual Duwamish River Festival When: Saturday August 27, 2011, 12:00 pm.-6:00 pm.

"VoiceGuy" Jim Cissell gives voice to a product he has been hired to promote for a future radio spot. He works from his basement home studio on the water in Fauntleroy. Jim Cissell speaks for himself, and the Fortune 500 By 02/01/2009 Lon Chaney may have been the man of a thousand faces, but West Seattle's Jim Cissell may be the guy with a thousand voices. The award-winning "VoiceGuy" as he calls himself can be heard narrating Disney trailers, promoting Levi's jeans, California avocados, and asks, "Did somebody say 'McDonald's?'" Cissell, who has been working in Seattle since 1986, may be the city's least recognizable big-time celebrity, working for more than half the Fortune 500, as his voice and not his face is familiar to many. That said, he has appeared in front of the camera on some Boeing and other commercials, more so in the past. "Less since these ears got bigger over the years," said the modest but successful, youthful 61 year-old as he practiced reading a script for a snowmobile ad in his basement home studio on the water in Fauntleroy. "Let's see. This asks for a man, age 30, slightly aggressive, and manly," he said, scrutinizing the script. "OK. Here we go." He punched at the dialog like a boxer and flailed his arms as if speaking to a large audience at a recreational vehicle convention. Then he read the disclaimer real fast at the end. "Speed reading is what you try to do with disclaimers," he explained. "You load up with a big breath and then cut down vowel sounds. Classically-trained actors resonate forever with each sound. Reading the disclaimer is the opposite. You bust through the vowel sound, getting right to the consonant. The consonant is what really shapes the word." Recording from his basement offers him much control over the sounds exiting his mouth, but there are a few hazards to working out of the house. For instance, his grandfather clock rang loudly in the middle of his script-reading. And there are the natural disasters. "The noise of the water out there gets in the way, and there's a bald eagle that squawks in my trees," he said without too much disappointment in his voice. But he was quick to add that he otherwise has great acoustics, and even installed a foam padded section in his ceiling over his microphone. And those voices, from a dead-on Donald Duck to a "crotchety old woman," as he put it. "I can do women's voices, but only when they sound old and crotchety." Cissell said he was inspired as a youngster watching, or rather listening, to Saturday morning cartoons. "That's when I started messing with voice. I loved imitating Donald Duck and Goofy. In 1959 we got our first TV, a black-and-white. I was 12, and only allowed to watch one hour a week. I figured out that if I got up early before my parents I could watch three or four hours of cartoons, like Mr. Magoo, and Heckle and Jeckle." His life took him to the Air Force, stationed in Thailand, and to law school, stationed at the University of Washington. "I finished getting my degree and passed the bar, but practicing law was too tough, too nasty. This is much more fun." His wife, Linda Kaye Johnson, is a semi-retired school teacher with the Shorecrest High School English and drama departments in Shoreline for 36 years. She "admitted" she shared her voice with her husband on a few commercial spots. "I think they were desperate," she smiled. Son, Jamie, did not follow in Dad's footsteps, but instead became a North Highline firefighter at Station 19. Jim said Jamie is very content there. And as for the VoiceGuy? He is pretty content, too. "It's great pay when you're working, and great fun," said Cissell. "Most workers punch in, do their job, and go home. In this business people compliment you for doing a good job."

Continue Reading Below Wall Street’s major averages traded in tight range, capping the session virtually unchanged as global oil prices trimmed gains and traders mulled key central bank meetings set for mid-week. Meanwhile, shares of defense companies that play a role in the war against terror-group ISIS climbed, including Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA), General Dynamics (GD), Northrup Grumman (NOC).  While the impact of terror-related incidents tends to have a dampening impact on investor psychology, investors have become somewhat immune to singular acts, said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group. “To a degree, investors and the markets have become inoculated [or] immune to lone actor acts of violence and terror. In the bigger picture, the acts of violent and terror that have punctuated the landscape globally have begun to have an additive effect on the collective mindset of investors,” he said.

Wall Street extended advances in global markets as investors focused on policy meetings from the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve taking place Tuesday and Wednesday.   Policy moves from the two key central banks could very well move in opposite directions, though uncertainty around the BoJ’s actions has stoked uncertainty in global markets. The BoJ is reported to be considering making negative interest rates a key component of future easing, while the Fed will discuss a prudent time to raise short-term interest rates.   Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Still, federal funds futures, a tool used to show Wall Street’s expectations for changes in monetary policy from the Fed, showed a 15% probability of a rate rise this month, with forecasts for a rate hike by the end of the year sitting at just above 50%.   Given a string of weak economic data, Nomura Chief U.S. Economist Lewis Alexander said he expects to punt yet again on rate hikes at the conclusion of its two-day meeting this week, though given recent comments from Fed officials, a rate increase can’t be completely ruled out. “The economy’s performance in the first half of the year was relatively weak. There is some evidence of a pickup in recent months, but the latest data suggest that activity slowed at the end of the summer. We think the FOMC will need to see a more sustained acceleration of economic activity before raising rates again,” Alexander said.    The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a handful of global currencies, slipped 0.3% in recent action. Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, which moves inversely to its price, was down 0.014 percentage point to 1.68%.   Elsewhere in the market, global oil prices pared gains of more than 2% in early-afternoon action. Prices were elevated after Venezuela said both OPEC and non-OPEC producers were close to solidifying a deal to bring stability to the market. Oil prices have seen heightened volatility since the summer of 2014 as oversupply worries have plagued the marketplace and large foreign producers have refused to cut prices to help clear the glut. West Texas Intermediate crude traded around $43.30 a barrel on Monday, while Brent, the international benchmark, climbed to just above $46 a barrel.  What do you think?

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Youkyung Lee. Updated September 19, 2016 9:08AM SHARE ALSO SEE Samsung Galaxy Note Note7 Smartphone Battery South Korea Verizon Samsung's recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones after several dozen caught fire and exploded may stem from a subtle manufacturing error, but it highlights the challenge electronics makers face in packing ever more battery power into ever thinner phones, while rushing for faster release dates. Announcing the recall on Sept. 2, Samsung confirmed dozens of cases where Note 7 batteries caught fire or exploded, mostly while charging. It plans a software update that will cap battery recharging at 60 percent capacity to help minimize risks of overheating. But it is urging owners to keep the phones turned off until they can get them replaced, beginning Monday. U.S. safety regulators stepped in Thursday with an official recall, saying Samsung's voluntary efforts were inadequate. Though Samsung promised replacement devices, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said U.S. customers would be eligible for refunds if they choose. Replacements are expected in stores by next Wednesday. The Note 7 debuted to rave reviews in August thanks to its speed, new software features and -- not least -- the estimated nine hours it would run between charges. But all that power comes at a price: Users began reporting the phones were catching fire or exploding, in one case incinerating the SUV it had been left in. Aviation authorities in the U.S., Australia and Europe have urged passengers not to use or charge Note 7s while flying and not to put them in checked baggage. On Monday, Canada issued an official recall. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, said in announcing the recall on Sept. 2 that an investigation turned up a "tiny error" in the manufacturing process for the faulty batteries in the Note 7s that was very difficult to identify. The end of the pouch-shaped battery cell had some flaws that increased the chance of stress or overheating, he explained. That kind of manufacturing error is unimaginable for top-notch battery makers with adequate quality controls, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research center at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Samsung and other experts should search for factors outside the battery cells that could have led to overheating, he said. "If Koh's argument is right, that makes Samsung SDI a third-rate company," Park said. "But it does not appear to be a simple battery problem." Time also is a factor in marketing and making the phones. In 2015, Samsung moved up its unveiling of its new Galaxy Note model to August from September, seeking a leg up on Apple's September iPhone upgrades. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping pace with demand for the Note 7. Samsung has not recalled Note 7s sold in China, but the company has refused to say which of its two battery suppliers made the faulty batteries or clarify whose batteries are used in which Note 7 smartphones. The company also refused comment on South Korean media reports that it has stopped using batteries from Samsung SDI, one of its two suppliers, in the Note 7. C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Seoul, cited SDI officials in estimating that about 70 percent of the batteries for the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones came from SDI. The other 30 percent are thought to have been supplied by Amperex Technology Ltd., a Chinese-based manufacturer that reportedly also is a main supplier of batteries for the iPhone. Problems with lithium batteries have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner, though having so many lithium-ion battery fires in a short time is unheard of, Park said. The batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing. If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. That's what happened with the Note 7, Samsung's Koh explained. "The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together," he told reporters in Seoul. It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7. It confirmed delays in shipments for extra quality tests weeks later, in late August, after photos of charred phones began popping up on social media. South Korean experts suggested Samsung may have been so ambitious with the Note 7's design that it compromised safety. "There was no choice but to make the separator (between positive and negative anodes) thin because of the battery capacity," said Lee Sang-yong, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked more than a decade at LG Chem, a leading lithium battery maker. Thicker separators can improve safety but will not necessarily prevent all overheating issues, he said. Doh Chil-Hoon, head of the state-run Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute's battery research division, said that based on the limited information provided by Samsung, he believes the push to increase battery power was part of the problem. "Even with a small manufacturing mistake, if there had been enough elements to ensure safety, it would not explode," Doh said. "It is a roundabout way of admitting weak safety." The Note 7 phones have a powerful 3,500 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 smartphone, which has a slightly smaller body than the Note 7, features a 3,000 mAh battery. So does the Note 5, launched in 2015. Apple does not provide information on the iPhone's battery capacity in milliampere hours. But two research firms that specialize in analyzing tech gadgets and their components said the battery in the iPhone 6S Plus is 2,750mAh. The size of the battery in the newly released iPhone 7 is not yet known. The 3,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Note 7 is "one of the highest, if not the highest, capacity battery we've seen in a phone," said Wayne Lam, an industry analyst at IHS Markit Technology. Lam said he thinks the Note 7 battery problem resulted from weak controls in manufacturing, not a poor or unsafe design. A spokeswoman at iFixit, which publishes repair guides for electronic gadgets, offered a similar view. "We don't think any internal design changes in the Note 7 are responsible for the exploding batteries -- more likely just a manufacturing defect," IFixit's Kay-Kay Clapp said in an email. Apple has tweaked hardware and software it developed itself to make iPhones use power more efficiently, while Samsung has increased the capacity of the batteries in its phones. That can be done without increasing size by adjusting components or changing the production process, Lam said. "You have two different trajectories, with Samsung packing in more energy density, versus Apple trying to trim it down by optimizing everything else," he said, adding that the two rivals are "constantly locked in this arms race of improving and one-upping." While Apple and Samsung are using built-in batteries for their premium phones, LG Electronics, Samsung's smaller South Korean rival, has opted for a replaceable, 3,200 mAh capacity battery for its new premium, jumbo screen smartphone, the V20. LG chose to make the phone thinner and allow customers to extend battery life by swapping out batteries. "The security of the battery isn't directly related to whether the battery is replaceable or not," Cho Joon-ho, head of LG's mobile business, told reporters. "But we make efforts to secure safety with quality controlling tests beforehand." © 2016 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

However, those orders are now stuck because US Treasury officials have failed to sign them off. Boeing’s aircraft are made in the United States, as are many of their components. Airbus assembles most of its aircraft in France, but it has an assembly facility in the US and many of its parts are also American-made.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out travel Search Destinations Themes News Travel Troubles Cruising Snow Kiwi Traveller Real estate company wants to help you beat jet lag with an app MADELINE STONE Last updated 13:27, September 19 2016 MGM Hotels Special light systems, air purification and aromatherapy are all part of the "Stay Well" hotels. For people who have to travel frequently for work, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be exceedingly difficult. Now a company has partnered with several US hotels to create a line of "Stay Well" hotel rooms equipped with high-tech features that have health in mind. The features — like a slowly increasing light that simulates the dawn, air purification systems, aromatherapy, memory foam mattresses, nutritious meals, and ambient sound that gradually increases in volume — are meant to improve air and water quality, regulate sleep patterns, and keep travellers from being exposed to allergens and germs. iSTOCK The apps suggest "Vitamin D Walks" that you can take at prime times to increase your sun exposure. Read more: * Researchers explain why jet lag can be worse when you travel east * Boeing is making a major change to its planes that could end jet lag as we know it First launched with 41 rooms at Las Vegas' MGM Grand in 2012, the Stay Well program has recently expanded to include 171 rooms at that hotel as well as others throughout the US.  Each of those properties also offers its own app, which can give travellers local recommendations and go into more detail on the wellness features you can expect to find in your room. A jet lag tool can give you a personalised jet-lag-fighting itinerary based on what time your flight lands and how far you've travelled. It will give you tips as specific as the best time to drink coffee and when to expose yourself to light to effectively beat jet lag. Blackout shades and circadian lighting make it easier for travellers to control their exposure to direct light. The apps suggest "Vitamin D Walks" that you can take at prime times to increase your sun exposure — a helpful reminder if you've been napping or suffering from jet lag. The Stay Well apps also come loaded with video meditations led by Deepak Chopra (Chopra sits on Delos' advisory board, along with Leonardo DiCaprio and former US Congressman Dick Gephardt). Ad Feedback Delos announced that it had raised an additional $20 million at an $800 million valuation in July. Bill Gates' Cascade Investment and Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeffrey Vinik led a previous investment round of $108 million in October 2015. Delos has raised a total of $171.24 million in venture capital since it was founded in 2013 by Paul Scialla.

NASA’s asteroid-harvesting mission solicits proposals for its robotic spacecraft Posted Sep 20, 2016 by Devin Coldewey, Contributor 0 SHARES Next Story Federal policy for self-driving cars pushes data sharing Asteroid mining is coming soon to a planet near you: this planet, and in 2021, to be specific. But NASA’s Asteroid Redirect Mission has lots of work to do before that point. Today the space-faring organization issued an official “request for proposal” from four partners on how they would go about creating the robotic spacecraft that would perform the actual asteroid redirection in question. This mission is a bit different from OSIRIS-REx, which recently got underway. The idea there is to go to an asteroid, grab a piece and return it to Earth — difficult enough, but it wouldn’t be the first collection of “live” asteroid matter — that was already achieved by the Japanese probe Hayabusa a few years ago (an astonishing achievement, by the way).

Boeing, Orbital ATK, Lockheed Martin and Space Systems all participated in a “conceptual design phase” in which the basics of the spacecraft were established, but this is the opportunity for each to differentiate itself from the others. The configuration of, say, the sensors with which the ARM craft will scan the surface, or the mechanism of its lander, are still up in the air. Those four will have about a month to get their proposal together: October 24 is the due date, and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory will make its decision some time next year.

During what was expected to be a typical monthly Navy Reserve drill weekend, news of the USS Zumwalt’s arrival gave Chief Henri an opportunity to see the Navy’s most advanced ship up close and personal. The USS Zumwalt is the first of three guided missile destroyers featuring stealth technology, automated operations, a uniquely shaped tumblehome hull, advanced weapon systems and an electric propulsion system. Though larger than current destroyers at 610 feet, the ship is manned by far less personnel, 147, while having the equivalent fire-power of the commonly recognized WWII era battleship. The Zumwalt can accurately target up to 20 simultaneous objectives up to 50 miles away.   The ship’s exterior architecture makes its radar signature that of a small fishing vessel. Zumwalt’s electrical plant has a capacity equivalent to powering 10,000 homes. The ship’s aft flight deck and hanger bay can accommodate two Sikorsky H-60 helicopters or one Boeing Osprey or three unmanned automated vehicles (UAV). The ship boasts an additional mission operation center and berthing spaces for aviation crews and special operation forces. It has a boat bay that hosts two rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIB) for various security, utility and special operation missions.   The Zumwalt’s next stop to what will be its homeport in San Diego, California, is Norfolk, Virginia, and then it will backtrack to Baltimore, Maryland, for its official commissioning in October. The Navy accepted delivery of the Zumwalt in May and is scheduled to join the fleet, fully operational, in 2018.     Naval Station Newport is home to the Naval War College and the Surface Warfare Officer School, among other Navy schools, whose students were able to get a first-hand glimpse of what their futures and the future of the US Navy has in store for them.  Active duty and Reserve sailors stationed in Newport toured the ship and mingled with the Zumwalt’s crew, all of whom were proud to be part of Navy history. “The significance of the advancement in technology onboard this ship is akin to when the Navy switched from sails to steam and from wooden hulls to steel. This is a definitive 21st century warfighting ship” said Chief Henri.   For more information on the USS Zumwalt, DDG 1000, go to http://usszumwalt.org/.

Cole, a 101-year-old World War II veteran, the last living member of the group after which the bomber is named.  © Flickr/ Stuart Rankin B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber Gets Fresh Upgrades On April 18, 1942, the "Doolittle Raiders," a group of 80 crew members and 16 B-25 bomber aircrafts, launched a strike on military outposts and target factories near Tokyo from the aircraft carrier USS Hornet. Cole said he was "very honored" and "deeply humbled" to represent Gen. Dolittle and his fellow Raiders. The strike, led by Lt. Col. James Doolittle with Cole as his co-pilot, proved to be an invaluable boost to the spirits of troops and US citizens following the Pearl Harbor attacks. © Flickr/ futureatlas.com Citing Rising Costs, US Air Force Mulls Buying Light Attack Aircraft The new bomber aircraft name was chosen by a survey on a website launched by the Air Force Global Strike Command in March. The site took suggestions for the next-generation craft from current airmen, their families and retirees. There were over 2,000 submissions and the name "Raider" was chosen by Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldfein and US Air Force Secretary Deborah James, who introduced Cole at Monday’s conference. After leaving the stage Cole said, "I thought it was quite a nice tribute," and that he "would feel a lot better about it if all the guys were here, but it's not possible." In October, a $21.4 billion contract for manufacturing the bombers was awarded to Northrop Grumman Corp., who beat out Lockheed Martin and Boeing, two of the world’s largest aerospace and defense companies. Northrop also manufactured the B-2 Spirit, which is augmenting the force’s B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer fleets. The service intends to purchase 100 of the bombers from Northrop.  © AFP 2016/ SAUL LOEB US Air Force Orders $700Mln Worth of New Bombs Over Next Five Years "We haven't set the official number," said. Gen. Robin Rand, commander of Air Force Global Strike Command. During a panel later in the day, Rand commented that the service should buy more than planned 100 bombers. "We need to start with a minimum of 100 B-21s. We need to really dig our heels in on, 'What should that ceiling be?'" The stealth bomber is not expected to be introduced to service until the mid 2020s. ...

(Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images) Photo: Tim Boyle/Getty Images Delegation works to lasso Chicago jobs and investment for Texas 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Texas officials are in Chicago this week to try to lure Windy City jobs and investment to the Lone Star State. The two-day trip was organized by the Texas Economic Development Corp. and Gov. Greg Abbott's office and includes a corporate reception, a roundtable with consular officials and investors, a luncheon and meetings with site-selection consultants. Officials with the Greater Houston Partnership, the Dallas Regional Chamber and several other regional economic groups and businesses are delegates on the trip. "Chicago and the Midwest are strategic business attraction areas for Texas with a wealth of companies that can benefit from our state's advantageous business climate," Tracye McDaniel, president and CEO of Texas EDC and its private marketing division, TexasOne, said in a statement. "Through proactive outreach to targeted decision makers, we aim to keep the wave of companies coming to Texas." Texas hopes to build on a cadre of Chicago and Midwest-based companies already doing extensive business in Texas, including Archer-Daniels-Midland, Boeing, Wilson Sporting Goods and W.W. Grainger, which recently opened a new sales facility in San Antonio with the help of a $975,000 Texas Enterprise Fund grant. "Our goal is to make sure that message is heard loud and clear by the C-suite in the Windy City," Bryan Daniel, executive director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development and Tourism, said in a statement.

China would maintain that it imposes an export duty on primary aluminum explicitly to prevent the export of primary metal, largely seen as exporting energy due to the high power cost associated with producing each metric ton of the metal. MetalMiner Price Benchmarking: Current and Historical Prices for the Metals You Buy Many outside China believe a considerable amount of metal leaks out of the country in the nominal form of semi-finished products which avoid the export duty, and, indeed, attract a value-added tax refund, only to be subsequently remelted. Large volumes of exports from China make their way to Vietnam, and it is believed much of this material is remelted in the country before being sold. The Impact of Chinese Aluminum However, our concern in this article is not so much the impact of primary metal leakage, considerable as it may be, but rather the growing threat of Chinese value-add product manufacturers and the impact they are having on western firms that had previously had the field cornered for automotive and aerospace — to name but two high-tech applications for aluminum — applications. Chinese material at the end of the last century was considered a joke in terms of quality, but over the first 10 years of this century the country has invested heavily in European and Japanese extrusion, rolling and heat treatment plants and equipment. By the beginning of this decade, Chinese extrusions and commercial sheet/plate were being given equivalence to material from many other sources such as Russia, Turkey, South Korea, Taiwan and other locales. Are aluminum slabs welded together really “deep-processed extrusions?” Such material is still sold at a discount to European or North American semi-finished products, but its growing penetration and the willingness of major distributors to hold a proportion of their inventory as Chinese material, speaks volumes for its growing acceptance, particularly in terms of quality. The Lucrative Automotive Market Still, while China — and to a lesser extent mills in places like Malaysia, Turkey and other locales — gradually ate into western mills’ commodity products, those same western mills moved upstream, investing heavily to meet growing demand for automotive sheet and castings, aerospace sheet, plate and extrusions. But now, Chinese manufacturers are beginning to enter these markets with a number of Chinese mills gaining Boeing and Airbus approval, underlining their intentions to take a slice of this lucrative market. Zhongwang Aluminium’s daring announcement that it intended to buy Aleris for $2.3 billion marked a new turning point, in which Chinese firms not just invested at home in the hope they could gradually expand exports of aerospace and automotive products, but are now even looking at taking over the crown jewels of western aluminum producers. China Zhongwang certainly has enough money and clout to buy its way into the market, it is the world’s second-largest aluminum extruder and has ambitious plans to grow further. The use of aluminum by the automotive sector had been seen by western firms as a major source of growth for a decade to come, and a sector in which they had relatively little competition outside the US and Europe. The use of aluminum alloy in a car’s main structure will rise by 17.5% each year between 2015 and 2025, Goldman Sachs analysts are quoted as saying by the FT. Growth estimates that have helped support substantial investment by western firms like Aleris, Alcoa and others to meet anticipated demand. The arrival of the Chinese has the potential to upset that dramatically. The U.S.-based Aluminum Extruders Council has said Zhongwang’s takeover of Aleris “raises very serious concerns for the entire aluminum industry,” and is trying to mobilize support to block further Chinese penetration. We are already seeing the use of anti-dumping and similar litigation as we have in steel to protect domestic producers currently doing very well out of the sector, but fearing major disruption is only just over the horizon.

Harris, R-Vancouver, was first elected in 2010 and serves as minority whip for the House Republican caucus. He is a straight-shooter who has strong conservative credentials but also has the ability to engage in debate, listen to the other side, and demonstrate leadership. As he told the Editorial Board prior to the primary: “The hardest thing I’ve learned as a legislator is that I have to compromise. To get things done, you have to compromise; legislation comes in small pieces.” Harris is running against Democrat Martin Hash, who is conducting a low-key campaign that makes him unlikely to win. In the primary, Harris received 47 percent of the vote to 39 percent for Hash — despite splitting the Republican vote in the three-person race. Before we go any further, we must mention that this — as always — is merely a recommendation. We trust the willingness and ability of voters to examine the candidates and the issues before casting an informed vote. It would be preferable if Hash was running a more active campaign that could flesh out the issues and put pressure upon Harris; voters would be better served. But, realistically, it is highly likely that Harris will be re-elected. That being said, we shall focus more upon offering advice for Harris and other lawmakers, rather than repeating the strong reasoning behind supporting his re-election. Among the notable developments is that Harris is in line to be the ranking Republican on the House Education Committee if he returns to Olympia. This will be essential, as funding for K-12 education promises to be the most pressing issue facing lawmakers next year. Undoubtedly, they have been negligent in their paramount duty to fully fund public schools; this year, four years after the state Supreme Court ruling in McCleary v. Washington, lawmakers essentially planned to make a plan rather than addressing the issue. We expect Harris to put his leadership and diplomatic skills to use next year in helping the Legislature to come up with solutions rather than rhetoric. Establishing the line between those two traits is one of Harris’ strengths. As an example, he was a strong supporter of tax breaks for Boeing that were passed during a special session of the Legislature in 2013, but admits now that the breaks should have been more strongly tied to keeping jobs in the state. This kind of pragmatism is what sets Harris apart from many modern-day politicians, who all too often cling to dogma at the expense of reality. In a commentary upon pervasive ideological rigidity, he said, “It’s really important as we say these things — how do we get there?” Because of that, we also encourage Harris to take the lead in creating synergy among Southwest Washington lawmakers. It has been clear in recent years that local representatives have not worked to find common ground and unearth issues upon which they can work together for the betterment of the community. Differences of opinion often are unavoidable, but a lack of communication and consensus from local lawmakers has hampered this region’s effectiveness in the Legislature. Before any of that can happen, of course, Harris needs to be re-elected. The Columbian believes that such an occurrence would be beneficial to Clark County.

On Monday a KQ plane landed safely despite bursting its tyres while landing at JKIA. Daily Nation Photo. PREV NEXT Photo gallery In Summary In general tyres are divided into two groups, ‘Radial’ tyres and ‘Bias’ tyres. Bias ply tyres are constructed with the carcass plies laid at angles between 30º and 60º to the centre line or rotation direction of the tyre. The succeeding plies are laid with the cord at angles that are opposite to each other. This provides balanced carcass strength. Most aircraft tyres in service today are bias ply tyres. A typical tyre will be a combination of rubber, fabric and steel. Advertisement By Nelson Bwire A Kenyan Airways vessel yesterday burst its tyres as it landed at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya. The aircraft, KQ415 was from Entebbe Airport in Uganda. According to a press statement from the Airline, the plane landed in Nairobi safely and there were no injuries recorded. "The aircraft is being inspected by Kenya Airways Engineers. There were no injuries. Kenya Airways wishes to thank all its guests for their patience and continued support and assure them that their safety is paramount," the statement reads in part. Kenyan media reports that there was a delay in flights due to the incident. The statement by Kenya Airways. Previous Situations In August, A plane with 76 passengers on board was forced to make an emergency landing at Birmingham Airport when a tyre burst after takeoff. The Flybe flight 1274 from Amsterdam to Manchester was forced to ground early after passengers alerted cabin crew. A Hawaiian Airlines plane made an emergency landing in Tokyo in JUly, bursting its tyres and forcing the closure of one runway and the cancellation of several other flights, although no one was injured, local media reported. In July still, A tyre of an Oman Air plane flying in from Muscat burst while landing at Dar Es Salam airport in Tanzania. The airline said there were no injuries in the incident on flight WY 707, a Boeing aircraft. There were 158 passengers and six crew members on board. In May, A Lufthansa Airbus A330 was stranded on the runway at Mumbai airport for 22 hours after four of its main tyres burst during landing. Flight LH-764, which travelled from Munich, had 163 passengers on board - none of whom were injured.   How different are Aircraft tyres According to Skybrary, a source on aircraft related issues, tyres for aircrafts are designed to withstand extremely heavy loads for short durations, and the number of tyres could increase with the weight of the plane. An Aviation author with Micheline tyres states that; An aircraft tire must withstand a wide range of operational conditions. When on the ground, it must support the weight of the aircraft. During taxi, it must provide a stable, cushioned ride while resisting heat generation, abrasion and wear.1/4 next advertisement In the headlines Lugogo shooting: Key witness speaks out The woman whom detectives have twice arrested and interviewed following clues that she witnessed Parliament should review gun policy, says Kayihura The Inspector General of Police, Gen Kale Kayihura, has tasked MPs to review the country’s gun National Top detectives join Akena murder probe   National Akena killing: Police to continue holding suspects   National Wildfire leaves 800 homeless in Kotido   National Bishops seek to reconcile Odoki, Arua Christians   Advertisement National Another Pension scam hits Public Service Business NSSF turns to smaller power plants after acquiring major stake in Umeme Other Sport Ugandan volleyball star Daudi Okello goes pro in Bulgaria Special Reports 5 years; family awaits justice for slain child World Trump firm on agenda but says Americans have nothing to fear Advertisement Latest News National Bishops seek to reconcile Odoki, Arua Christians   National Wildfire leaves 800 homeless in Kotido   National Jailed Makerere students granted bail   National Museveni forwards six for new EC team   National KCCA budget cut by Shs160b   National Akena killing: Police to continue holding suspects   National MPs querry officials over Isimba, Karuma funds   Advertisement From The East African News EAC gets $194 million funding lifeline from Washington   Science and Health Heroine Umra brings health care to the marginalised   News Eala to debate gender, plastics Bills in Nairobi   News Museveni names new head of Electoral Commission   Business Tanzanian sues to stop Kenya from concluding EPA with Europe   Business Tanzania in drive to improve doing business climate   Business Ugandan suppliers to South Sudan complain of exclusion from pay list   Advertisement Web Mail e-Paper 93.3 KFM Business Directory Sqoop Dembefm NTV Uganda Africa Review The East African Daily Nation The Citizen Business Daily About us Contact us Advertise with Us Terms of Use Nation Media Group

Manila airport manager Eddie Monreal said Flight SV872 from Jiddah made the distress call about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the airport. Airport authorities asked for a verification of the emergency message and one of the pilots confirmed the distress call verbally with the airport tower, aviation security chief Mao Aplasca said. He said the pilot did not immediately say the emergency call was a mistake. The pilot did not tell the control tower that the button had been pushed accidentally until the plane was parked, Aplasca said. Despite the assurance, airport authorities continued to treat the incident as a crisis, Monreal said. Passengers disembark from Saudi Arabian Airlines plane at the parallel runway of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport after it made a distress call shortly before landing Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016 at suburban Pasay city south of Manila, Philippines. Philippine officials say the Saudi Arabian Airlines plane from Jeddah was placed in isolation after it touched down, but the flight crew later said they made a mistake in sending the emergency message. Manila airport manager Eddie Monreal said authorities deployed security forces around the aircraft as a precaution. Passengers were later allowed to disembark.(AP Photo/Bullit Marquez) "We can never play around with safety and security," Monreal said. "We decided that we will not take that call hook, line and sinker saying that it was a mistake." Security forces were deployed around the Boeing 777 as a precaution. Outside the airport complex, police quickly set up a security cordon and checkpoints. The passengers were later allowed to disembark and told reporters that everything had seemed normal in the cabin until relatives informed them by cellphone about reports that the aircraft may have been hijacked. When Princess Habiba Sarip-Paudac, a news anchor at a state-run TV network who was on the plane, peered out of the window, she saw SWAT forces and police, some with dogs, who later boarded the plane. She said the passengers "felt like it was really a hijacking. They thought someone would throw tear gas." As the plane sat isolated on the tarmac, "Not even one crew explained. For two hours, they were saying, 'Sorry ma'am, we don't know anything, we don't know what to say,'" Paudac told reporters. Many of those coming off the plane were dressed in white, likely indicating that they were returning from the annual hajj pilgrimage, a ritual required of all able-bodied Muslims once in a lifetime. Saudi Arabian Airlines, also known as Saudia, does brisk business during the hajj, which reached its climax last week. The 71-year-old airline, which operates 119 planes, said on its official Twitter feed later Tuesday that there was a false alarm of a hijacking aboard the flight. Monreal said the plane was carrying 410 passengers and 21 crew members. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said it is investigating the cause of the incident. "Appropriate penalties and sanctions will be imposed on the erring pilot if the result is indeed a human error," it said in a statement. The pilots were not being held during the investigation, Aplasca said. The incident came after Philippine officials in February announced they had strengthened security for Saudi Arabia's embassy in Manila and its national airline because of a possible threat. At the time, officials also said additional armed officers were posted in the boarding area for the Saudi flag carrier and to guard the airline's luggage. It did not elaborate on the threat. However, it came as the Sunni-ruled kingdom has been on increasingly hostile terms with Shiite power Iran. ___ Associated Press writers Jim Gomez in Manila and Adam Schreck and Jon Gambrell in Dubai contributed to this report.

Korean Apache choppers to be unveiled next month 2016/09/20 15:43 Tweet Facebook Share Google +1 Reduce Enlarge Print SEOUL, Sept. 20 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's military said Tuesday it will unveil its most advanced Apache attack helicopters to the public for the first time during a flyby set for next month. The Army's AH-64E Apache Guardian helicopters will join AH-1S Cobras and UH-60 Blackhawks in a joint flight to mark the 68th Armed Forces Day on Oct. 1. "The aim is to show off the country's military prowess amid growing threats from North Korea," the defense ministry said in a statement. It said the planned flight can highlight the military's unwavering determination to counter any provocations from the North and to be fully ready to fight at any time. From the Air Force, the F-15K and the KF-16 fighter jets will also make a flyby during the event to be held in Daejeon, 164 kilometers south of Seoul. South Korea signed a $1.6 billion contract to buy 36 Apache helicopters and receive two years of training and maintenance services from Boeing Co. In May, four of the choppers were delivered to the Army, it said. The AH-64E Apache helicopter, equipped with 16 air-to-surface Hellfire guided missiles, is capable of devastating North Korean armored vehicles and air-cushion vehicles (ACVs). "The military plans to gradually deploy the last of the Apaches with Army units by the end of 2017," the official said. In this photo taken on May 26, 2016, Apache helicopters are being delivered to the South Korean Army to counter threats from North Korea.

Citing a source privy to the investigation, SMH reported that the Joint Investigation Team comprising experts from Australia, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine have gathered evidence of the launch site of a standard that could be presented in a potential criminal trial. The Australian daily reported that the findings of the team's investigation will be made public next Tuesday, firstly to the kin of the 298 victims, and then in a press conference. The investigators of the July 2014 incident are reportedly also expected to identify the type of weapon used to shoot down the plane. However, SMH reported that they are not expected to identify those responsible for launching the rocket, and that the probe into the perpetrators is still continuing. It reported that the related evidence will also likely be classified for a potential criminal trial. The Boeing jet carrying people from 17 nations was en route fro Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a surface-to-air missile, plunging 33,000 feet into the conflict-ridden Donetsk region in Ukraine, near the borders of Russia. In the early hours of the plane crash that killed everyone aboard, the Ukraine government and pro-Russian insurgents blamed each other for the tragedy.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts Cops detain Bersih 2.0 chairman, committee member ahead of rally More arrests on Bersih 5 eve, Maria and Mandeep may miss rally, Red Shirts leader missing Police road diversions in KL from 7am Now, DAP MP arrested for sedition, taken to Seremban High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts Rafizi sentenced to 18 months’ jail, might lose MP seat Malaysian ringgit plunges in offshore markets, BNM locks spot in Do Malaysians trust the news they read?

Dias, 57 is leading Canadian contract talks for workers of General Motors, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ford Motor Co, whose four-year labor contract expires at midnight. The Unifor autoworkers' union chose GM as its strike target and is demanding the company commit to producing new vehicle models in its Oshawa, Ontario plant. Choosing GM as the strike target is a high-stakes gambit, given there is no obvious new vehicle production that could be assigned to Oshawa. GM has said it will not commit to building new models in Canada until it has a contract in hand. Dias says Unifor will not sign a contract without that promise. "If we're going to have a dust up, we might as well have it immediately," said Dias, who became Unifor president in 2013. GM has been the most reluctant of the three automakers to invest fresh money in Canada. The country has seen those dollars go to lower-cost sites in the southern United States and Mexico. Now, Dias will either lead Canada's first auto strike in 20 years or secure a contract with GM against the odds, which could bolster union confidence as it heads into talks with Ford and Fiat Chrysler. "Unifor was built to fight," he said at a 2014 United Auto Workers convention. "We're sick and tired of playing defense and it's about time that we started to play offence." Dias, who grew up in a union family, began work at de Havilland Aircraft in 1978, becoming a union plant steward, chair and president in 1987. His father, Jerry Dias Sr., worked at the same plant and was also union local president. When Boeing put de Havilland up for sale in 1990, Dias demonstrated strategic smarts in the way he led a fight to secure a better deal, said Roland Kiehne, a co-worker at the time. Alongside organizing lunch-time demonstrations that emptied the plant, Dias sued the Canadian government for breach of trust over the deal and convinced politicians to get involved. It worked, and De Havilland was sold to Canadian plane maker Bombardier. A fitness buff, Dias can whip up union delegates with impassioned speeches, once inviting a critic who called him one of Canada's five most feared men to "kiss my union ass" at a public rally. Dias said automotive executives talk in specifics at contract talks and expect the same of him. "These aren't charm school graduates. These are people who run major corporations," he said in an interview. "We ought not mislead each other or soft pedal the delivery of what our expectations are." But he is also a pragmatist who knows how to get a settlement, said Buzz Hargrove, former president of the Canadian Auto Workers, which merged with another union to form Unifor in 2013. Hargrove hired Dias as his assistant in 2007 after watching him craft deals that improved worker benefits at de Havilland's Toronto plant. "He's not shy. He'll pick up the phone and call the prime minister if he thinks it makes sense. And he may very well have to do that before this bargaining is concluded," Hargrove said. "He knows how to get out on a limb, but he also knows how to get back."

A recent history of exploding batteries; plus other infamous recalls By Laura Berman of The Street | < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 10 NEXT SLIDE > Companies have been plagued by safety concerns and large-scale recalls Samsung Electronics is in damage control mode. The world's largest smartphone retailer halted sales of its Galaxy Note 7 phone and recalled millions of units after 35 reports of the phones' batteries catching fire. The phone, universally well-received by reviewers, was released as Samsung rival Apple struggled to live up to its record of innovation. "As a gesture of appreciation, consumers will receive a $25 gift card or bill credit from select carrier retail outlets when choosing a Galaxy S7 family device or the Galaxy Note 7 within the exchange program," Samsung said in a Sept. 2 statement, noting that it was "taking great care" despite the "small number of reported incidents." At issue are the phones' lithium-ion batteries, which have forced product recalls in many products and companies over the years. While more efficient than conventional batteries, they're also more flammable, and have caused issues in everything from computing technology to automotive engines to cooling systems. Companies including Tesla and Boeing, Sony to Hewlett Packard to name a few have been affected. In Samsung's case, New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority is cautioning riders to turn the phones off before entering a subway station or boarding a bus. Click ahead for a look at some of the best-known cases of catastrophic product recalls, some of which also feature the dreaded lithium-ion battery. © TheStreet AdChoices AdChoices Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices More From The Street 20 Companies Pushing the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade The Street 10 Four-Wheel Drive Vehicles That Are All Set for the Snow The Street 10 Ways to Make Your LinkedIn Profile Stand Out The Street 25 Winter Warmer Beers Worth Enjoying This Season The Street The Street View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

After reading the speech, I was reminded of an old life lesson: no one rides for free. While the president discussed everything from foreign policy to education, the big focus of his address was on unrolling new economic plans for America. This new strategy focused on a few key points involving tax breaks for the middle class, tax hikes for the wealthy, new labor benefits, a higher minimum wage and two years free community college. For the past few years, people considered these ideas as “freebies” given out by the federal government. Truthfully, that is a very short-term view of this type of policy which ignores the fact that there are certain unspoken expectations to any favor being offered. Middle class economics, as Obama calls it, comes with a few unmentioned purse strings attached. Reduced taxes and new write-offs are done in order to develop a feeling of financial stability for the working class that was stolen during the 2008 recession. As many families lost their jobs and savings, tightened budgets meant less frivolous spending. In a capitalist-based economy when consumers don’t spend, then profits, companies and workers take massive blows. “To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest,” Obama said. An aspect not discussed on increasing education and labor protections is that it encourages more people to go to work. The yearly cost of two children in a daycare center is more than the cost of the median rent for a year in every state, according to a study done by Child Care Aware. By offering tax breaks, it encourages families to have two working parents, meaning more financial security and more income to tax. Offering free education and programs like Biden’s workforce training gives Americans who have been struggling for years new opportunities. “Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education,” Obama said. Basic mathematics tells us that it is impossible to work 40-hours a week on the current minimum wage and live above the national poverty line. After food and rent comes living expenses, leaving very little after to a splurge on a new pair of shoes. When a trip to Target seems out of reach, it also affects more than four million Americans who are employed by the retail industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those little trips to the mall or a restaurant fuel private industry and states, like Florida, that impose a sales tax. Everything you spend is revenue, which is why the government wants you to feel able to buy more. “And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it,” Obama said. President Obama claims that 17 of the 50 states raised minimum wages in his first interview after the speech with Hank Green. Some of the benefits of increased minimum wages are not only more money in the bank accounts of Americans, but also less turnover and training costs for companies as more workers are incentivized to stay in their positions. This was a concept implemented by the famous businessman Henry Ford, who paid twice the minimum wage in 1914 in order to allow his laborers to purchase the Ford product. It is as simple as this: the government will help you put more back in your pocket so you can go out and buy more, therefore improving our economy. Increasing taxes on the wealthy is not a permanent solution, but a Band-Aid to cover the real problem of funding this new fiscal policy. With all the loopholes in the tax code, the entire thing should be re-evaluated and rewritten, a fact Republican Joni Ernst agreed with in her response to Obama’s address. With different agendas at heart, both parties agree Uncle Sam wants Americans to pay their taxes. “Republicans think tax filing should be easier for you, not just the well-connected. So let’s iron out loopholes to lower rates — and create jobs, not pay for more government spending,” said Ernst in her GOP rebuttal. Early in 2014 there was a large controversy regarding a study published revealing that 26 of America’s largest corporations paid no taxes, including big names like Verizon and Boeing. Now this was released by an independent activist group, Citizens for Tax Justice, but it isn’t the first time the issue has been brought about. Unfortunately, the lack of money being brought in to government revenue is completely legal due to legislation that has historically been pushed for by lobbyists and special interest groups that hold the purse strings. “As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does, too.  But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight,” Obama said. Democrats are hoping to use these tax changes to fund this new economic plan, but I highly doubt that will manage to pass a Republican-dominated Senate without serious compromises along the way. In theory, middle-class economics will pay for itself over time. The wealthy tax increase will have a very short lifespan even if it does manage to succeed through the Senate floor. If this economic plan goes forward, it will go forward in a modified capacity with compromises on corporate tax incentives to help develop labor protections and create American jobs. Once consumer spending increases and expands the private market, tax cuts for the wealthy will once again pass through Congress.

So what happens in the long term? “If America cannot get its act together on the jobs front, its many other serious wounds will not heal,” wrote Bob Herbert, author of Losing Our Way. Unemployment and poor job opportunities aren’t the only problems facing us today but as Herbert points out in his book, the only way to fix this nation is through a strong middle class. A representative government has long since fallen to special interest groups and lobbyists to create policies that do nothing for the people. Right now, we may have to spend the money to get back to solid ground. Frankly, unless anyone else can come up with a bipartisan plan to help decrease the wage gap and stabilize the working class, Obama’s plan may be the only option to move the American economy back from barely surviving to thriving.   Doha Madani can be reached at doha.madani@theminaretonline.com   Share this: Twitter Facebook Google Like this: Like Loading...

While few expect Federal Open Market Committee to announce a rate hike this week, most bet they will do so later this calendar year. “Fears about the Fed increase and then dissipate, and all you can do is try to follow that news flow,” lan Higgins, chief investment officer at Coutts & Co in London, told Bloomberg. “The Fed is very aware of what the market is looking for and hopefully we’ll get no policy shock.” In 3.10pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.01 percent higher. In 2.55pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent. "The market has been all over the place. It’s been driven by the threat of higher interest rates," Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, told Reuters. "Most people feel the most unloved bull market in recent memory will be cut off at the knees by higher interest rates and the Fed is certainly threatening that in the near term.” The Dow moved higher as advances in shares of 3M and those of Boeing, recently trading 1.2 percent and 1.1 higher respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Merck and those of Intel, down 1.3 percent and 1 percent respectively. Some are keen for the Fed to move now. "Let's get on with it already," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Reuters. "It will cause some challenges to the market but I think that is healthy in context of a normal business cycle. It will increase the cost of capital, and flush out some riskier assets in the short term. But that is probably the right thing to do." Meanwhile, a report showed that a gauge of US home builder sentiment in September climbed to the highest level in almost a year, according to the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo. “As household incomes rise, builders in many markets across the nation are reporting they are seeing more serious buyers, a positive sign that the housing market continues to move forward,” NAHB Chairman Ed Brady, a home builder and developer from Bloomington, Illinois, said in a statement. “The single-family market continues to make gradual gains and we expect this upward momentum will build throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a gain of 1 percent from the previous close. Germany’s DAX index rose 1 percent, France’s CAC 40 index climbed 1.4 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index increased 1.5 percent.

Recent news shows that more Chinese are travelling and demanding more services. The stories show that, reflecting this, the Chinese travel industry is taking increasing global market share, developing digital strategies and services, and online companies are pulling in the money.  Even the economy, a key driver for outbound tourism, is producing positive numbers. Just out is that very accurate barometer of activity, power consumption: it rose by over 8% in August. While the outbound travellers figures are not rocketing in the way they have in the past (from a smaller base) they are still strong. According to the ChinaTravelNews website, travel agencies organised 13.7 million outbound trips in Q2 2016, up 17.3% quarter-by-quarter. Last year’s numbers were up ‘only’ 9.8% compared to 20% growth in earlier years, but they are forecast to rise by 11.5% this, it says. Fuelled by experience-hungry millennials and a growing middle class, the number of Chinese passport holders is forecast to swell by over 100 million over the decade ‘Dramatic increases’ in Chinese visitors to destinations across Asia, Europe and beyond, have been forecast in an oft-quoted Goldman Sachs industry report. Analysts at the international banking group point out, in their report ‘The Chinese Tourist Boom’, that as yet only 4% of Chinese have passports. The report says: ‘Fuelled by experience-hungry millenials and a growing middle class the number of Chinese passport holders is forecast to swell by over 100 million over the decade - equal to 1.5X all outbound US tourists today.’ Thus, by 2020 outbound numbers will, it states, rise from this year’s 120m by 220m by 2025. Moneybags The moneybags certainly seem happy with China travel. BlaTravel, an aggregator platform for tours and boutique hotels, said a few days ago that it has received millions of yuan from a group of investors. SaaS platform Zowoyoo got away another round of funding, raising an undisclosed amount from Guangdong Cable Network. The parent company of Joyu, which aims to be the China’s one-stop travel industry O2O group, is going for RMB1bn to help establish it. PMS provider Green Cloud pulled RMB 15 million and is looking for a further RMB 30m. China’s largest OTA Ctrip said that two of its existing shareholders, Baidu and Priceline, have put in more money to boost its $2.7bn cash pile. The moneybags certainly seem happy with China travel. The buoyant mood is shared by China’s airline industry, which is rushing to fill demand. Three Chinese airlines have filed applications (Sept 8) with the Civil Aviation Administration of China to launch new international services, according to China Aviation Daily. As China builds up to become a major transit hub, Air China, China’s flag carrier, announced on September 1 that it would be the first airline to launch a thrice-weekly flight from Shanghai to California. Beijing and Shanghai are presenting themselves as new alternatives to traditional stops like Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong. (And hope that more travellers will stop a few days.) At this rate, major aircraft manufacturer Boeing estimates, China’s will need 6,810 new aircraft in the next 20 years (costing $1 trillion-plus) - over 70% for growth rather than replacement. Those planes will make China the first $1 trillion aircraft market, and many of them will be for international travel. The strength of China Air has attracted Lufthansa, which has just finalised a JV for share revenue and co-ordinate routes with its Star Alliance partner. (Air France-KLM already has JVs with Skyteam alliance partner Southern Airlines, China’s largest airline by passengers.) The right ‘personal’ moves Everything seems to be pushing in the right direction - the government target is to increase wages across the board; the Chinese want to spend this extra income ‘having fun’, says Goldman’s, getting abroad to tour and shop. This is especially the case among ‘the young millennial travellers who make up two-thirds of outbound travellers’, adds the report.  Visa barriers are tumbling in the face of the anticipated wall of Chinese cash. Another change is that today’s Chinese travellers are becoming more sophisticated and increasingly travelling independently rather than in organised groups. This is what China’s largest online travel player, Ctrip, chairman James Liang told investors on a conference call in early September. Today the Chinese want to ‘personalise their travel experience’. Today the Chinese want to ‘personalise their travel experience’. Ctrip is responding by ‘..focusing on enhancing our one-stop travel platform, increasing our international inventory coverage...’ As the company centres in on travellers outside of China it is offering international products covering air tickets, hotels, rental cars, local attractions and shopping. In its package tour business (up 44% year-on-year) its tour-guide booking service enables customers to chose their own tour guide. To raise the game and its brand image overall it has become the first travel service management company to become certified for the British Standards Institute’s ISO 27001 standard. What if China’s growth is not as steady as this month’s numbers indicate? Goldman’s ‘do not expect economic slowdown in China to have major impact on tourist numbers’. Rather, it expects tourist numbers to increase given: the Chinese passport ratio; middle class income is rising; households are spending more and millenials are not adverse to foreign travel. To back up its view it points out that the Japanese did not stop holidaying abroad when Japanese economic bubble burst. Not only does there seem to be little of a link between the economy and foreign holidays in South Korea or even the UK, it notes, but not even a weak currency fails, it seems, to put off travellers.

WOOD brooke@southwesttimes.com “In the Army, we learned to go where they sent you, do your job and that was it,” Ronald Vaughan says. Vaughan, a 93-year-old Pulaski native, was among those who served stateside during World War II. Slightly more than a quarter of the men and women who served during that war served right here, protecting U.S. shores, and building, testing and inspecting the equipment being used by American soldiers fighting in the European, Pacific and African theaters. Vaughan inspected B-17s, B-24s and B-29s to make sure they were safe and ready before an American pilot ever stepped into the cockpit. Before he was inspecting planes, Vaughan was growing up in Pulaski. He was born on Pulaski Street and still lived there at the beginning of the Great Depression with his parents, Oscar and Nina McCroskey Vaughan. “My father had a good job at a local foundry, and then one day, he didn’t have anything. He was out of work.” After the plant closed, the Vaughans moved with Ronald and his sister into his maternal grandparents’ house on nearby Cliff Street. Today, he and his wife, Louise, live in a house beside that same house that they now own. As a teen, he developed a severe eye infection: “I was sitting in the movie theater one night, and I reached up to wipe my eye and everything went blank.” Vaughan ended up being treated by a Roanoke doctor for “inflammation of the right eyeball.” He graduated from Pulaski High School in 1941. He was eventually drafted, but the vision problems caused by his infection led to him being turned down twice. “I couldn’t see. But they did end up drafting me and sent me to Shepard Field, Texas for basic training,” he says. After that, he was sent for training to Kessler Field, Miss. He then went to Ypsilanti, Mich. for advanced training in B-24s. But his first assignment was working on B-17s. On his first furlough, he returned to Pulaski to marry Louise, a Radford native he had met through friends who set them up. They were married in his parents’ house. The Vaughans don’t remember where they went for their first date, but they think it may have been the Roundhouse in Fairlawn near the intersection of Route 11 and Pepper’s Ferry Road. A few years ago, the couple started eating out for every meal – and they celebrated their 72nd wedding anniversary last month by eating out. After marrying Louise, he headed to Alexandria, La., where he stayed until he was shipped to Andrews Field in Washington, D.C. He stayed there for the last six months of the war. Vaughan said he never thought about not being sent overseas since he did what they told him to do. Vaughan was trained on Boeing’s new B29, and was later selected for special mechanical training on the aircraft. The B29, sometimes called the “Superfortress,” was a four-engine propeller-driven heavy bomber. The high-tech plane was one of the largest aircraft used during World War II, and historians refer to it as the single most expensive aircraft project undertaken by the United States in World War II. This plane included a pressurized cabin, all-dual wheeled, tricycle landing gear, and a remote, computer-controlled fire-control system that directed four machine gun turrets that could be operated by a single gunner and a fire-control officer. They were later used in the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “I was on the flight line. We checked them out after every flight,” Vaughan explains. After the war, Vaughan worked at Jefferson Mills for 21 years. Vaughan adds, “Then I went to work at the Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RAAP) for another 21.” He retired a few months short of 65. Their two children both became doctors. Ronald O. Vaughan is a retired dentist, and Dennis Vaughan is a Radford orthodontist. According to Louise, “They were always good boys.” Today, they have six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren spread from Richmond to Panana City, Fla. In his younger days, Vaughan was a serious bowler, spending at least four nights a week strategically knocking down pins. “I was pretty good at it,” he says. He won competitions while bowling with several different teams, including one group from Jefferson Mills. Until this year, the couple spent several weeks at Myrtle Beach every year. Five years ago, the couple was standing in the living room of their Cliff Street home when the Pulaski tornado came through. “We were watching it happen, but didn’t realize what we were watching. We had no idea it was a tornado,” Vaughan explains. In fact, Vaughan remembers just thinking it was a very bad wind. “I told Louise, ‘There’s my shingles going.’ I knew it must be a bad wind, and it was.” The grandparents’ home next door received considerable damage. Some of their trees snapped, and a big pine tree broke the fence. “We felt lucky, overall,” Vaughan says. Written by: Editor on September 19, 2016.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Christian Davenport September 19 Follow @wapodavenport An artist’s rendering of the B-21 Raider, the Air Force’s future long-range bomber. (Air Force graphic) The Air Force’s secretive and stealthy new bomber has a name, the B-21 Raider, the Air Force announced Monday. The name was unveiled by retired Lt. Col. Richard Cole, a 101-year-old veteran who served as a member of the “Doolittle Raiders,” which embarked on an audacious plan to bomb Japan months after the attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II. Cole served as the co-pilot of Jimmy Doolittle, whom he has called “the greatest pilot in the world.” The naming of the aircraft, to be built by Northrop Grumman, marks a significant milestone in a program that has been controversial almost from the start. After Northrop won the contract, the losing team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin protested the award. Critics have taken aim at the secrecy surrounding its cost. Analysts have also said that it is going to have to fight for funding every year, as it competes with other high-profile Air Force projects, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the KC-46 tanker. [How much does the Pentagon’s secretive comber really cost?] “The bomber program has been progressing well, but critics have already painted a target on its back so large you could sail an Ohio-class sub or fly a Joint Strike Fighter through it,” Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in an op-ed at Real Clear Defense. Falls Church-based Northrop is working on building 100 of the B-21 bomber, which is designed to penetrate deep into enemy territory and is capable of carrying nuclear weapons.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday November 19, 2016 Opinion Larger / SmallerNight Mode NSW government vows to help protect and promote Defence jobs in the Hunter Anthony Roberts 19 Sep 2016, 10:30 p.m. The defence industry, as a vital part of the Hunter's economy, needs protecting. LANDING WORK: With support, the Hunter's growing defence industry sector can work to win future contracts to help bring more jobs, and investment, to the region. THE defence and security of a nation is the first order of duty for any national government and in Australia, NSW plays a most important role in that mission. We have more Defence bases and a larger defence industry than any other state. In fact, the defence industry is one of the most important industries for NSW, and a top priority for the NSW government. The industry is especially important here in the Hunter, the region with largest defence presence in NSW. The strength of the defence industry supply chain in the Hunter gives this region the competitive edge to feed into Australia’s major air, sea and land projects and the Australian government shares my confidence in this region. Only last month it awarded $300 million in procurement contracts for Williamtown and the Hunter. This month, Adelaide played host to Land Forces 2016, the nation’s premier land defence exhibition that attracts the leaders in defence technology from around the globe. One of the most impressive exhibitors was from the Hunter. Bohemia Interactive Solutions was showcasing its new simulator that replicates the experience of a soldier driving an Australian Defence Force vehicle over difficult terrain. The simulator trains our personnel to stay safe in hostile environments. NSW government support for Bohemia dates back to 2014 when we helped it become a foundation tenant at the Williamtown Aerospace Centre. Defence contributes $5.5 billion to the NSW economy each year and employs 30,000 people. For the Hunter, Defence plays a crucial role in the region’s economy. We want to see that continue, and with the Australian government’s Defence White Paper outlining programs and acquisitions worth more than $195 billion over the next 10 years, it’s vital that the Hunter positions itself to take advantage of the opportunities. My time at Land Forces was spent promoting our capabilities to the Australian government’s head of Defence acquisitions Kim Gillis, as well as meeting with ‘prime contractors’ like BAE Systems, Northrop and Boeing, who award sub-contracts worth many millions of dollars.  On Monday I attended the HunterNet Defence Conference, the largest of its type in Australia, to meet with local small and medium-sized business operators that fulfill sub-contracts for the major players. Because of the broad range of skills available across the Hunter they are in a prime position to tender for and win valuable Defence work. The Hunter is the centre of gravity for RAAF fast jet operations and maintenance activities by industry to support the fleet. With the introduction of the Joint Strike Fighter F-35 aircraft and their presence at Williamtown from 2018, further opportunities will arise for Hunter businesses. The NSW government is seeking to maximise those opportunities. As part of our efforts to boost the Hunter’s Defence sector, we’re also supporting the establishment of an Innovation Defence Hub at the Williamtown Aerospace Centre. The University of Newcastle was awarded $1 million to lead development of the hub. In June, I announced the appointment of retired air marshal John Harvey AM to the new position of defence advocate. He is working to grow Defence activities in NSW. Whether it’s vehicle simulators or jet maintenance, the NSW government is working to ensure the defence industry continues to bring jobs, innovation and diversity to the Hunter’s economy.

The study released on Monday by researchers at the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics illustrates how, even as the New York businessman pledges to boost growth and create millions of jobs, most mainstream economists view his economic policies as dangerous quackery. The study also offers a sceptical view of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s trade policies, and particularly her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a vast new Pacific Rim trade pact the US has negotiated with Japan and 10 other economies.  But Mr Trump’s threats to rip up existing US trade agreements and impose punitive 45 per cent tariffs on goods from China and a similar 35 per cent levy on products imported from Mexico would probably set off a trade war and wreak huge damage on the US economy, the study found.  “While [Mrs] Clinton’s stated trade policy would be harmful, [Mr] Trump’s stated trade policy would be horribly destructive,” said Adam Posen, the institute’s president. “His stated approach to the global economy of waging trade war and protecting uncompetitive special interests would be disastrous for American economic wellbeing and national security.”  Mr Trump in a speech last week pledged to boost US growth to almost 4 per cent and create 25m jobs if he was elected. But the Peterson study shows that if he delivered on his trade policy promises and America’s trading partners responded in kind, as would be likely, the US economy would end up in recession within two years as consumption, investment and government spending all contracted.  Such a trade war would also hit the blue-collar workers to whom Mr Trump has pitched his trade policies hardest.  The biggest trade-related employment impact, the researchers found, would be in manufacturing and on states such as Washington, home to aircraft maker Boeing, and places such as Los Angeles, where the city’s port is the arrival point for much of the trade with China. Were China to retaliate and stop purchasing US aircraft, for example, it would result in the loss of 179,000 jobs, they calculated.  But the biggest impact on jobs would come as the consequences of a trade war reverberate out across the economy hitting retail distribution hubs, grocery stores, restaurants and even hospitals, the study found.  It also would likely lead to shortages and higher prices of consumer goods — including popular products such as smartphones — and potentially even have an impact on US retirement savings.  Because China extracts relatively little of the value of Apple’s popular smartphone, which is assembled in the country, for example, “the iPhone could be China’s secret weapon in retaliation,” the researchers wrote. “China’s self-inflicted losses would be minimal, but cutting off supplies to Apple could severely disrupt the availability and increase the price of a beloved consumer product.”  “In light of the ubiquity of Apple stock in [US retirement] plans, this action could adversely affect Americans’ retirement plans as well,” they wrote.  The researchers cited studies that have shown it would be impossible to build an iPhone from scratch in the US and that even if Apple were able to do so the additional cost would be about $100 per phone.  “Moreover, with Chinese firms moving into the smartphone market, China could disrupt not only the production of iPhones but also supply the alternative models,” they wrote. “The collective howl of pain might induce even the most ardent protectionist to reconsider.”  In a statement, the Trump campaign called the Peterson study a “globalist hit job”. “The Peterson Institute dresses up propaganda in a wardrobe of “scholarship” that shamelessly promotes globalism and criticises anyone who dares oppose it,” Trump advisers Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro said. Rather than provoke a trade war, Mr Trump and his threats would lead to negotiations that would “end the undeclared trade war now being waged on American workers by cheaters like China”, they said. “This fear-mongering fails to understand the negotiating power of the US in the world economy.” US sectors that would be worst affected by a full trade war Sector Percentage of jobs lost High-speed drives and gear manufacturing 10.2 Construction equipment manufacturing 10.0 Iron and other metal ore mining 10.0 Semiconductor equipment manufacturing 9.7 Other metalwork manufacturing 9.6 Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

"We are negotiating and I hope that during the trip of President (Hassan) Rouhani to the US today or tomorrow, we can have some news on the subject (removal of banking obstacles)," Fakhrieh Kashan told foreign investors at the CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit in Tehran on Sunday, Reuters reported. President Rouhani will travel to New York to participate in the 71st Regular Session of the UN General Assembly which opened at the UN headquarters on Tuesday, September 13, 2016. IranAir Chairman Farhad Parvaresh is also travelling to New York as part of Rouhani's delegation for the UN General Assembly. Earlier on Sunday, Iran’s Roads and Urban Development Minister Abbas Akhoundi said that Tehran was complying with its obligations under the JCPOA, giving assurances that remaining obstacles put by the US in the way of global aviation giants to sell passenger aircraft to the country will be removed soon. “We are negotiating with all those big names …there are a lot of obstacles but I am sure that because we have respected all the international rules and regulations, all those problems are going to be resolved," Akhoundi told the Summit. The two-day CAPA Iran Aviation Finance Summit opened at Novotel Imam Khomeini International Airport on September 18 with the participation of business leaders and representatives of 150 aviation companies such as Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing following the removal of anti-Tehran sanctions. Later, the US House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a lasting nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers- came into force in January, some Iranian officials have complained about the US failure to fully implement the accord. Back in March, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said Americans have yet to fulfill what they were supposed to do as per the nuclear deal. Iran still has problems in its banking transactions or in restoring its frozen assets, because Western countries and those involved in such processes are afraid of Americans, the Leader said at the time, criticizing the US for its moves to prevent Iran from taking advantage of the sanctions removal.

By Kedar Grandhi September 19, 2016 06:18 BST The job cut move comes at a time when Rolls-Royce is planning to double the production of its jet engines for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350Reuters Rolls-Royce Holdings has announced that it is expanding its job cuts. The British company which makes power systems for the aviation and other industries said it will cut more than 200 jobs at the middle management level. The move is part of a larger restructuring programme announced by CEO Warren East in November 2015. It aims at rebuilding investor confidence in the engineering company after a series of earnings disappointments. It is expected to save between £150m ($195.53) and £200m annually beginning 2017. The current job cuts follow 400 management positions Rolls-Royce said it would eliminate in May. This takes the total trimming of management positions under East's leadership to more than 600. Overall, including job cut announcements across all levels, the latest move takes the total redundancy count to about 4,000 in less than two years. While the current job redundancies will be across the group, most of them are said to be at the company's aircraft engine business division, which has clients such as Boeing and the Airbus Group. This division has already seen about 2,600 other job cuts being announced. The Financial Times cited an unnamed company insider as saying that the move brings to an end the first stage of the restructuring programme that was aimed at streamlining the senior and middle management levels. The source added that additional job cuts could not be ruled out as the company continues to seek efficiencies wherever possible. Further redundancies could be done on a voluntary basis wherever possible, the source added. The move comes ahead of a meeting scheduled in November, where East is expected to update investors on further savings in the next stage of his restructuring plan in order to increase the group's competitiveness. It also comes at a time when the company is planning to double the annual production of its jet engines to meet demand for Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes and the Airbus A350.

The country’s national airline has provisionally agreed to buy U.S. and European aircraft worth over $ 50 billion at list prices, marking a high-profile test case for the reopening of its economy under a deal with world powers to ease sanctions. Nine months after the sanctions deal took effect, foreign banks are reluctant to get involved because of concerns that they could be caught up in restrictions applying to U.S. banks, which are still banned from doing business with Iran. Under the deal to lift nuclear-related sanctions, Iran can buy passenger planes and other goods but is not allowed to pay for them in dollars or to use the U.S. financial system, due to core U.S. sanctions that remain in force. The ban on paying in dollars is a particular headache for Boeing and international leasing companies, which usually account for their portfolios in the world’s leading currency. Paying in other hard currencies could generate fleeting movements in the U.S. financial system known as U-Turn transactions, which are also banned.

One pilot says he's been "blown away" by the controversial plane's capabilities.(Aug 12, 2016) 1. Soundbite: Lt.-Col. George Watkins, US Air Force pilot 2. Soundbite: Lt.-Col. Curtis PittsUS Air Force pilot Placeline: Abbotsford, British Columbia Credit: The Canadian Press Storyline: The new-age fighter jet once poised to replace Canada's aging CF-18 fleet, but whose ballooning price tag and controversial selection process threw its purchase into doubt, has made its inaugural visit to Canada. A pair of F-35 stealth fighters roared into British Columbia on Thursday in preparation for the annual Abbotsford International Airshow. The next-generation aircraft, whose development has been marred with delays and cost overruns, has been the source of ongoing angst in Ottawa as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government grapples with finding a replacement for the country's long-outdated fighter jets. Trudeau told the House of Commons in June that the F-35 "does not work and is far from working," two months before a surprise announcement last week that the aircraft is ready for combat. Lt.-Col. George Watkins, a pilot with the U.S. air force's 34th Fighter Squadron, flew one of two operational planes to B.C. from Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Speaking on the tarmac in front of one of the aircraft, he described flying the F-35 as "awesome." "I'm very confident in the combat declaration that we made, combat ready," Watkins said. "Being a combat commander in a fighter squadron, I personally wouldn't go to war with any other jet beside the F-35 right now. The stealth technology and the advanced radar and the threat detection system makes me more capable so I can strike first and it makes it so that my pilots are more survivable in war time." The federal Liberal government promised during last year's election campaign that it would hold an open competition to replace Canada's aging CF-18 fleet, but it also pledged not to buy the F-35. Former prime minister Stephen Harper said in 2010 Canada would buy 64 of the stealth fighters, a commitment that was derailed when the Liberals came to power last year. Lockheed Martin, the U.S.-based defence contractor overseeing the F-35's development, has since asked the Canadian government for the chance to compete in an open and fair competition to provide the next generation of airplanes to Canada's military. Still, the federal government paid more than $30 million earlier this year to remain part of a consortium of nine countries backing the development of the fifth-generation aircraft. Canada has contributed more than $311 million to the group, which ensures it an eventual discount to buy the jet as well as access in the meantime to lucrative development contracts. The government said Canadian companies have received US$812 million in contracts since Canada's first F-35 payment in 1997. The rival aircraft vying to become Canada's next fighter jet is Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, which was also scheduled to make an appearance at Abbotsford's air show. A published report earlier this year said the Liberals had decided to purchase the Super Hornet as an interim measure to buy time for landing on a long-term fix for the Air Force. That prompted an outcry from the Opposition Conservatives over what they described as a rigged process that allowed Boeing to "jump the queue." Canada bought its current fleet of CF-18s in the 1980s. The jets were designed to last 20 years, but the former Conservative government opted to spend $400 million to overhaul the fleet to keep the 77 aircraft in operation until at least 2025. — Follow @gwomand on Twitter You Might Like Facebook Page People Donald Trump Jared Kushner Barack Obama Kanye West José Mourinho Current Topics Attorney General Volkswagen Jeff Sessions Buckingham Palace Spotlight 📺 Live TV 📺 ONP TV Movie Reviews Totally Aesthetic Staff Stories DOCTOR WHO: Is Season 10 The Last For Peter Capaldi?

An Atlas 5 rocket was to carry WorldView-4 into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The satellite is designed to produce high-resolution images of Earth. The fire in a remote canyon didn’t immediately threaten the space launch complex, Col. Paul Nosek said on the base’s Facebook page. But he said firefighters were not available to stand by at the launch. Nearly 800 firefighters were trying to corral the fire that was slightly less than a square mile. The launch will be postponed until at least Sept. 26, according to United Launch Alliance, a joint venture by Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co. The satellite is the latest in a series of imaging satellites built by Lockheed Martin. Operated by Colorado-based DigitalGlobe, which provides images for government and private customers, it is designed to spot the make of a car from nearly 400 miles above Earth.

Back in January, we wrote about such an online marketplace called Hacker’s List, where buyers and sellers of hacking services of dubious legality can join up. Now, the New York Times has profiled the owner of Hacker’s List – and he’s not who you might expect to be engaged in such a business. Charles Tendell turns out to be a veteran of the 2003 Iraq War who runs his own cybersecurity consultancy called Azorian Cyber Security. It’s a strange pairing of enterprises – making a business out of defending against cybercrime while also abetting it. Tendell doesn’t see it that way, of course – he calls himself an ethical or “white hat” hacker, and denies that anything illegal is going on. “No one is going to complete an illegal project through my website,” Tendell told the Times. According to Tendell, job postings for things that are obviously illegal are taken down if “someone complains,” and a review process for Hacker’s List ensures only “professional hackers” get jobs through the site. The website’s terms and conditions plainly state that users shouldn’t use the service “for any illegal purposes.” Hacker’s List only collects a fee on completed jobs, which Tendell says are all legitimate. It’s not clear, however, if Tendell could prevent illegal acts from being carried out through bids on his website, as it offers strict confidentiality so that “only you and your hacker” know the details of the job. Some of the job postings on Hacker’s List could be legitimate, like one seeking a hacker to do a “website security check.” Many of the over 4000 hacking jobs offered up for bidders on Hacker’s List look far shadier – with people looking for someone to hack into iCloud, Gmail, Facebook and WhatsApp accounts and more, in what could only be an effort to spy on unwary victims. Tendell told the Times that the idea for Hacker’s List was “off the cuff,” and something he just wanted to “see if it works.” On his personal website it says that Tendell “performed his first hack into a telecom company before the age of nine.” He says he followed in his father’s footsteps by joining the US Army, where he “quickly rose to leadership roles,” consulting with the US Army Criminal Investigations Division on Cyber Crime, as well as military intelligence and military police. After his career in the Army, where he claims to have received numerous commendations, Tendell says went on to consult with big defense companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. He also claims to have led “thousands of investigations for local and federal law enforcement agencies nationwide,” and regularly appears on television and radio as a cybersecurity expert. With that impressive resume, it’s curious that Tendell would want to mix with such lowlifes as the poster who on May 13 offered $100 to $1000 for the purpose of “Identity Theft.” Tendell may need to explain to clients of his other cybersecurity business why he feels he isn’t profiting from cybercriminality, otherwise it might not just be the hacking victims who end up with damaged names and reputations.

The proposal is part of plans to refocus the group and give a clearer definition of its biggest unit's responsibilities under a new subsidiary name, likely to be Airbus Commercial, while cutting costs as it faces widening global competition. Currently president and chief executive of Airbus SAS, which is the planemaking division of Airbus Group, Bregier would take on the additional role of chief operating officer of the parent company under the proposals, which may be finalised in October. He would remain president of Airbus Commercial but drop the chief executive mantle in that part of his job, the people said, in a change of job description earlier reported by Bloomberg. Airbus declined to comment. Relations between German-born paratrooper reservist Enders and French former missile maker Bregier have long been seen as workmanlike but frosty, prompting speculation about Bregier's future at the world's second-largest aerospace company. His expanded role is likely to ease those tensions, at least for the time being, people close to the company said. Other senior managers may be given group-wide roles. "It does resolve some of those problems. It is never good to have senior managers fighting," a person familiar with the company said. The finance and human resources chiefs, who currently split their time between the group and airplane unit, will become unified bosses of their respective areas for the whole group. Frenchman Marwan Lahoud, the architect of previous governance changes which curbed French and German government influence and created the conditions for integration, would continue to oversee strategy and M&A. The governance changes in 2012 did away with awkward Franco-German power-sharing structures and led to a rise in shares. Shortly afterwards, Airbus Group changed its name from EADS to capitalise on its best known brand and create a tailwind behind Enders' efforts to unify the fragmented group. But under a clumsy compromise blamed by many on remaining personal and national sensitivities, the core Airbus brand remained with the planemaking unit, blurring efforts to present one voice to investors and customers across the world. Analysts say the changes should make it easier to drive through group-wide cost reductions without revisiting the political need for factories in several European countries. The company is considering whether to complete its rebranding by calling the whole group "Airbus" and getting rid of the planemaking unit's separate French "SAS" corporate structure, though that may also pose legal uncertainties. Another dominant figure, Airbus commercial sales chief John Leahy, 66, who has led the charge against Boeing in the $100 billion jet market for over 20 years and recently talked of retirement, will stay in his role at least through the end of 2017 or early 2018, the people said. His eventual successor has not yet been publicly designated but leading candidates include a lieutenant from within his department, Kiran Rao, signifying a change of style from Leahy's frequent public baiting of Boeing but no let-up in brutal jet-market competition, the people said. None of the executives could be reached for comment.

More here from The Wall Street Journal: “The cease-fire in Syria was in jeopardy on Sunday as clashes escalated the day after the U.S.-led coalition targeting Islamic State mistakenly killed dozens of Syrian government forces in an airstrike. Both the Syrian government and rebels accused each other of violating the truce. Rebels said the regime and its Russian allies restarted airstrikes on opposition fighters in the northern city of Aleppo, the epicenter of the war in recent months. Story Continued Below “The Russian defense ministry said Sunday the situation in Aleppo was ‘especially tense,’ but added Syrian government forces hadn’t broken the cease-fire or responded to fire from opposition forces. The airstrike added to the tension and led to charges and countercharges between Washington and Moscow, which back opposite sides in the conflict and brokered the cease-fire.” — U.S. SAYS STRIKE BELIEVED TO BE TARGETING ISIL: The U.S. Central Command issued a statement saying that U.S.-led forces “believed they were striking a Da’esh fighting position that they had been tracking for a significant amount of time before the strike.” “The coalition airstrike was halted immediately when coalition officials were informed by Russian officials that it was possible the personnel and vehicles targeted were part of the Syrian military,” the statement said. “Coalition forces would not intentionally strike a known Syrian military unit.” — AIRSTRIKE ON SYRIAN TROOPS WEAKENS U.S. EFFORTS TO CURB VIOLENCE, writes The New York Times: “The United States’ accidental bombing of Syrian troops over the weekend has put it on the defensive, undercutting American efforts to reduce violence in the civil war and open paths for humanitarian relief. The United States had thought that if a deal to ease hostilities in Syria, struck by Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart in Geneva nine days ago, fell apart, it would reveal Russia’s duplicity in the war, in which Moscow has supported the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. “Instead, the mistaken bombing — American pilots thought they were aiming at Islamic State jihadists but instead killed more than 60 Syrian soldiers, according to the Russian military — again exposed the White House’s struggle to put together a coherent strategy in a multisided war. The United States has conflicting aims in the war, from defeating the Islamic State to ultimately easing Mr. Assad out of office.” BOMBS IN NORTHEAST, STABBINGS IN MINNESOTA RAISE TERROR FEARS ON THE HOME FRONT: A pair of bombings in Manhattan and New Jersey on Saturday and stabbings at a Minnesota mall — along with more bombs found at a New Jersey train station Sunday evening — are heightening terrorism concerns in the U.S. The Associated Press has the latest on the Northeast bombings here: "Authorities are looking for a naturalized Afghanistan citizen for questioning in a weekend explosion in a Manhattan neighborhood that injured 29 people as the governor conceded Monday that investigators could no longer rule out international terrorism. "The man sought for questioning was identified as 28-year-old Ahmad Khan Rahami. Mayor Bill de Blasio said he could be armed and dangerous. 'We need to get this guy in right away,' de Blasio said on CNN. "My experience is one the FBI zeroes in on someone, they will get them." — MANHATTAN BOMBS DESIGNED TO BE DEADLY, writes the NYT: “A bomb that injured 29 people on Saturday in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, and another that failed to detonate, were filled with shrapnel and made with pressure cookers, flip phones and Christmas lights to set off a powerful explosive compound, law enforcement officials said on Sunday. Both bombs appeared designed to create maximum chaos and fatalities. They also provided a trove of clues.” — FIVE DEVICES FOUND IN NEW JERSEY, via NJ Advance Media: “An explosive device in a backpack detonated near the Elizabeth, N.J., train station early Monday as authorities were using a bomb robot to examine the item, officials said. … The explosion was not a controlled blast, but happened as the robot was cutting the device, according to Mayor Christian Bollwage. No one was injured in the blast, Bollwage said. Authorities found five devices inside a single backpack near the train station, including one that went off.” — THE ISLAMIC STATE CLAIMS CREDIT FOR MINNESOTA STABBINGS, writes the Star Tribune: “The claim, broadcast Sunday on social media, had a familiar ring: The man who stabbed nine people before being killed by an off-duty police officer in a St. Cloud mall on Saturday was ‘a soldier of the Islamic State.’ His attack, the message continued, was an ‘operation in response to calls to target the citizens of the crusader coalition.’ The Amaq News Agency, media wing of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, has used nearly identical language in taking credit for at least a half dozen other attacks in Western countries in recent months, analysts say.” IT’S MONDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we want to wish the Air Force a happy belated 69th birthday (It was on Sunday).

MORNING D TRIVIA: Shawn Barnes was the first to correctly answer that “Go for Broke” is the motto of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the highly decorated all Japanese-American unit in World War II. Among those who served in the unit was the late Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), whose right arm was amputated after a combat injury.

Learn more at acibc.org ** HAPPENING TODAY — AFA CONFERENCE KICKS OFF: The Air Force Association Air, Space and Cyber conference kicks off at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in Maryland, where the big news likely this morning will be the official name of the B-21 bomber. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James is expected to make the announcement in her “State of the Force” address. “Tune in to my keynote Monday morning at 1020 for an update on the state of the force. And maybe an announcement,” she tweeted, adding a winking emoji at the end. WHAT’S IN A NAME? We want to hear your thoughts about the name once it’s out. Email Morning D (jherb@politico.com) with your praise, criticism and perhaps some humor. ALSO TODAY AT AFA: James and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein speak this afternoon at an Air Force town hall, and Air Force Global Strike Command chief Gen. Robin Rand discusses the B-21 bomber on an afternoon panel. The full three-day conference agenda is here, and a livestream is here. Our colleague Ellen Mitchell will be on the ground at the AFA convention with the latest, and you can follow her on Twitter here. ALSO THIS WEEK — U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY IN NEW YORK: President Barack Obama is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, which will make for an interesting dynamic in the wake of the latest Syrian developments. In addition to the speeches — Obama’s last U.N. General Assembly address — the president will be holding a bilateral meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the White House said Sunday. He’ll also be meeting with the Iraqi prime minister to discuss Mosul. 2016 WATCH — TRUMP VS. ROBERT GATES: Donald Trump added a new target for scorn at his rally Saturday: former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. After insulting Gates on Twitter Saturday morning, Trump called him “a clown” Saturday evening. "We had a clown today, an absolute clown, Robert Gates," Trump said at his rally in Colorado Springs, adding he “probably has a problem we don't know about." Why is Trump going after Gates? The former defense secretary in both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal attacking Trump for being “cavalier about the use of nuclear weapons” and being “willfully ignorant” about the world. “When it comes to credibility problems, though, Donald Trump is in a league of his own,” Gates wrote. PROGRAMMATIC PROBLEMS — 15 F-35s GROUNDED OVER INSULATION ISSUE, via The Washington Post: “Less than two months after declaring the controversial F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ready for combat, the Air Force on Friday announced that it was temporarily grounding 15 of the jets after it discovered that insulation was ‘peeling and crumbling’ inside the fuel tanks. … In a statement, Lockheed Martin said that ‘the issue is confined to one supplier source and one batch of parts.’ It emphasized that ‘this is not a technical or design issue; it is a supply chain manufacturing quality issue.’” — AND THE FORD CARRIER HAS A POWER PROBLEM, reports Defense News: “For over a year, the U.S. Navy and its shipbuilders have been anxious to get the new aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) to sea and begin engineering trials of the first-of-class design. A number of publicly-announced target dates have come and gone, but the ship is still firmly moored at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia. “Now, however, a key factor in preventing the ship from casting off lines and getting underway is coming into view. A serious voltage regulator problem on the carrier’s four main turbine generators (MTGs) has prevented engineers from running the motors up to full power, and only now has the problem been identified and a fix decided upon.” EVENT ALERT- OUTSIDE, IN: Join POLITICO and featured guests: AARP Public Policy Institute’s Jean Accius, ChenMed’s Jessica Chen, NaviMed’s Bijan Salehizadeh, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Kenneth Shay, and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Edwin Walker for a discussion on whether tech can transform aging in America.

The SpaceX CEO took to Twitter Friday evening to say the Colonial Transporter needed a new name, as it might be travelling to different spots in the solar system besides Mars. “Turns out MCT can go well beyond Mars, so will need a new name.” Turns out MCT can go well beyond Mars, so will need a new name… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 17, 2016 Musk was flooded with suggestions with Twitter users proposing names like Heart of Gold, Zaphod Beeblebrox’s stolen ship in Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and Colonial One from Battlestar Galactica. Other suggestions include Millennium, Ultimate Mars Ship II, Snickers, Marathon, Indestructible II, from the game Orion Trail, and Booster McBoosterface. The next day Musk had his name; he dubbed his new spacecraft the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS). The ITS is capable of carrying 100 tons of cargo or 100 people to Mars or beyond. The red planet isn’t the only place in the solar system worth colonizing, its just the most popular. Humans could establish other offworld colonies in places like Venus, the moon, the asteroid Ceres, and possibly the moons around the outer planets. Musk didn’t go into further details about the range of the Colonial Transporter, nor did he imply SpaceX has any further goals of establishing more colonies on more worlds than Mars. He has, however, promised to reveal many of his plans for a Martian colony at the upcoming International Astronautical Congress in Mexico on Sept. 27. (Photo by NASA via Getty Images) During the conference, Musk is scheduled to deliver the keynote address entitled “Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species.” The SpaceX Colonial Transporter is slated to make an unmanned test flight to Mars, which will be followed by one with human passengers in 2024. Musk has warned would-be red planet settlers that the first Earth Mars transits’ will be difficult and dangerous, according to the International Business Times. “It’s dangerous and probably people will die – and they’ll know that. And then they’ll pave the way, and ultimately it will be very safe to go to Mars, and it will be very comfortable.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xaSimiNLJp4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The news about Musk renaming his Colonial Transporter comes after the recent explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on its launch pad during a test earlier this month, which rocked the space travel industry. The resulting fire destroyed the $62 million reusable rocket and the $200 million satellite it was carrying. The investigation into the cause of the explosion, caused when an anomaly in the rocket’s second stage sparked a massive fireball, is sure to delay the SpaceX launch schedule. That’s bad news for SpaceX customers who have been waiting to have their satellites flown into orbit, but it may also slow down SpaceX’s own test flight schedule and delay construction of a future Mars colony. SpaceX isn’t the only company looking to capitalize on the renewed interest in space travel. Already, one company is building an asteroid-mining spacecraft with the goal of extracting valuable resources from passing space rocks.

The partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing envisions 1,000 people living and working in space within our lifetime. With NASA planning to abandon the International Space Station in the 2020s and divert federal funds to a manned Mars mission, it will need a commercial interest to take over its responsibilities. The space station could find itself as the new hub of a cislunar economy, as it becomes a gas station in orbit receiving loads of cargo from ULA space trucks and trading supplies for resources mined from passing asteroids.
