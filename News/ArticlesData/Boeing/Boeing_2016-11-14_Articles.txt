By: Reuters | Washington | Published:November 15, 2016 7:05 am President Barack Obama waves while boarding Air Force One, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. Obama is traveling overseas and will visit Greece, Germany and Peru. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) President Barack Obama’s administration said on Monday he would veto legislation seeking to block financial transactions related to the export of passenger aircraft to Iran, saying it would undermine the nuclear deal implemented early this year. The legislation in the House of Representatives is the latest Republican-led effort to stop the sale of aircraft to Iran by Airbus and Boeing Co, allowed under the nuclear deal. Watch What Else Is Making News The White House said US partners would view the bill, if implemented, as a violation of the nuclear agreement. The United States plus Britain, Russia, France, China and Germany agreed to lift sanctions if Iran would curtail its nuclear program. The deals by Airbus and Boeing to sell or lease over 200 jets to IranAir would help modernize and expand the country’s elderly fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions. Some members of Congress have raised concerns that killing the sale could cost jobs. But opponents argue that the passenger aircraft could be used for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle US troops or allies in Syria. The measure would bar the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing a transaction by a US financial institution related to the export, or re-export, of commercial aircraft to Iran. And it would revoke any authorities enacted before the bill passed, such as those that allowed the Boeing and Airbus sales. The measure also limits the role of Export-Import Bank financing of sales to Iran. Some banks have been reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining sanctions prohibiting the use of the US financial system for Iranian business. The House is expected to take up, and pass, the measure as soon as this week. It is not expected to get through the Senate, where it would need Democratic support to advance. Lawmakers expect more efforts to stop the aircraft sale, and the broader Iran deal, after Donald Trump becomes US president in January. Trump has been critical of the nuclear agreement, which is seen by Obama supporters as one of the Democratic president’s signature foreign policy achievements.

Pilots on Flight 383 bound for Miami reported an engine-related mechanical issue, according to an airline spokeswoman. | Jose Castillo/Distributed by the Associated Press Mitchell Armentrout @mitchtrout | email Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter  Sign-Up Eighteen passengers have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and American Airlines after the airplane they were on caught fire last month on the tarmac of O’Hare International Airport when part of an engine failed. About 20 people were taken to hospitals after the right engine of Miami-bound American Airlines Flight 383 broke into four pieces about 2:30 p.m. Oct. 28, according to fire officials and the National Transportation Safety Board. The suit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court also names as a defendant General Electric Aviation, claiming it sold a faulty engine that Boeing used to assemble an unsafe 767 aircraft. The passengers also claim American Airlines employees should have done a better job inspecting the plane, and that they failed to provide “assistance, supervision and instruction” during evacuation. The National Transportation Safety Board released this photo of the pieces it recovered from a high pressure turbine disk that fractured inside the engine of an American Airlines jet that was about to take off from O’Hare International Airport on Oct. 28. | NTSB photo Spokesmen for Boeing and American declined to comment on the pending litigation. A representative for GE could not immediately be reached for comment Monday evening. An NTSB report issued a week after the fire said one of the fractures on the turbine disk of the engine was “consistent with fatigue cracking.” Takeoff was aborted due to the “uncontained engine failure” that led to fuel pooling under the plane’s right wing, which then burst into flames, authorities said. One piece of the turbine disk went through the inboard section of the right wing, over the fuselage and into a UPS warehouse facility more than a half-mile away. Another piece was found about 1,600 feet away, but it was still on O’Hare property, authorities said. No fire breached the cabin, and the 20 hospitalized passengers had been released a night after the fire. The five-count negligence suit seeks an unspecified amount in damages.   # Lawsuits O'Hare International Airport Previously from Chicago News Vrdolyak indicted on income tax evasion, impeding IRS | Chicago Sun-Times Cops: Arrest made in murder, decapitation of Kyrian Knox | Chicago Sun-Times Man shot on Eisenhower Expressway in critical condition | Chicago Sun-Times Madigan and Rauner meet, Republicans left scratching their heads | Chicago Sun-Times Currently Trending dear abby Dear Abby: For Thanksgiving, I'll come if she leaves | Chicago Sun-Times chicago State unveils new design, will replace faulty license plates | Chicago Sun-Times chicago news Man shot on Eisenhower Expressway in critical condition | Chicago Sun-Times chicago Vrdolyak indicted on income tax evasion, impeding IRS | Chicago Sun-Times chicago Killings up because mayor let CPD wither: police union official | Chicago Sun-Times Post to Cancel

A global trade war could be bad news for America's largest manufacturing exporter and its top supplier. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Nov 14, 2016 at 4:25PM Donald Trump rode a protectionist ideology to the U.S. presidency last week. While some aspects of his platform are business-friendly, such as lower corporate taxes and less regulation, his vehement opposition to various trade deals could be bad news for export-oriented companies. Boeing (NYSE:BA), as the largest manufacturing exporter in the U.S., clearly has a lot to lose. So does Spirit Aerosystems (NYSE:SPR), its largest supplier. Let's take a look at the potential risks a Trump presidency poses to these two companies. Boeing relies heavily on exports these days. Image source: Boeing. Trump could spark trade wars The biggest target of president-elect Trump's protectionist rhetoric has been the NAFTA treaty. Trump believes that free trade with Mexico in particular has cost the U.S. many jobs. If the U.S. withdraws from NAFTA, it could spark a trade war between the U.S. and Mexico. But this might not impact Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems much. Aeromexico is the only major Boeing customer in Mexico. While it has dozens of planes on order, even a complete loss of that business to Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) -- the worst-case scenario -- wouldn't have a material impact on Boeing's output. By contrast, a trade war with China, Donald Trump's other main rhetorical target, could have a severe impact on Boeing's business. Trump has said that as president, he will declare China a currency manipulator and penalize it for depressing the value of the yuan to boost Chinese exports. This accusation has no basis in fact. The yuan is losing value against the dollar due to market forces, and China's government is actually intervening to try to stabilize its value. Be that as it may, if the U.S. imposes big tariffs on imports from China, it would be natural for China to retaliate by slapping tariffs on imports from the U.S. That would be bad news for Boeing, given that China is expected to need more than 6,800 new commercial airplanes over the next 20 years, 17% of the global total. In addition to the usual competition from Airbus, Boeing will also face off against COMAC (a homegrown Chinese aircraft manufacturer) in the coming years. COMAC's C919, a direct competitor to the Boeing 737, is just a few years from entering service. Will Trump back the major airlines? Another risk for Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems is that the Trump administration will crack down on foreign airlines that are expanding rapidly in the U.S. The Partnership for Open and Fair Skies -- a lobbying group for the three largest U.S. airlines -- has already asked Trump to crack down on state-owned Middle Eastern airlines Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways. There's a fair amount of evidence that Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways are state-subsidized airlines. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's in the national interest to block them from expanding. The Middle Eastern airline giants have hundreds of Boeing airplanes on order, worth more than $100 billion at list prices. Middle Eastern airlines have ordered hundreds of Boeing wide-body planes. Image source: Etihad Airways. It's not clear if Trump's administration will side with the U.S. airlines and prevent the Middle Eastern airline giants from expanding further. But if it does, those airlines may retaliate by canceling some of their orders with Boeing and buying more Airbus planes. What it means for Boeing The good news for Boeing is that in the short run, airlines may not have any alternatives. Airbus is a fierce competitor, but it has a massive order backlog, especially for its most popular models: the A320neo single-aisle family and the A350 wide-body family. Airbus is in the midst of dramatically increasing production of both aircraft families. It could probably raise output further in 2020 and beyond if there were enough demand. But Airbus can't steal much business from Boeing over the next three to five years because it doesn't have many open delivery slots and doesn't have much near-term production flexibility. Smaller upstarts like Bombardier and COMAC could also steal some business from Boeing, but those are even longer-term threats. In short, the Boeing-Airbus duopoly is so firmly entrenched that rapid market share swings are nearly impossible. That said, in the long run, a return to protectionism in the U.S. could lead to permanent market share losses and a big decrease in profitability for Boeing. What it means for Spirit Aerosystems Bad news for Boeing is almost certainly bad news for Spirit Aerosystems, which is a spinoff of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Boeing aircraft programs represented 84% of Spirit's revenue last year. Spirit Aerosystems has been gradually gaining work on various Airbus aircraft programs and other programs at smaller aircraft manufacturers. It is even making a push to get more involved in defense programs. However, none of these growth opportunities would be enough to offset big production cuts at Boeing over the next 10 years. Donald Trump has said that he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. Sparking trade wars that could hurt Boeing and Spirit Aerosystems -- two key U.S. manufacturers -- would be inconsistent with that agenda. Nevertheless, shareholders of both companies need to watch carefully after inauguration day to see how Donald Trump's actions as president compare to his rhetoric as a candidate.

Story continues below Related Soft local economy empties shelves at Calgary Veterans Food Bank Cancelled corporate Calgary Christmas parties could benefit local charities The scale is set up alongside a Boeing 737 at SAIT’s Aero Centre at the Calgary International Airport  in a food drive the students call “Fill the Boeing.” “We’re planning on filling the Boeing to its maximum takeoff capacity,” student Liana Buessecker explained, “which is about 55,000 pounds of food.” “It’s mind-blowing,” student Matthew Holland said. “It’s a lot of food.” Student Mattew Granley got some perspective on the size of the challenge when he first brought it up with his family. “My dad flies (Boeing 737s) for Westjet,” Granley said. “He was, like, ‘what? That’s crazy. I doubt you’d be able to do that.’” But Granley feels it’s a challenge well worth taking on. “I do have a lot of friends, I do have a lot of family who have served in the military, so it hits home for me.” The students are collecting donations of food and money until Dec. 7, with collection points at the Aero Centre and on SAIT’s main campus. Volunteers can also pick up large donations – anyone who wants to contribute that way can call 403-284-7018 to make arrangements. “If there’s a will, there’s a way,” Holland said. And as for Granley’s doubting dad, the 737 pilot: “I told him, ‘you know what?” Granley said. “We’ll show you. We’ll do it.” © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

The multi-billion dollar deal is allowed under the nuclear agreement between the U.S., Iran and other countries. Congress has been debating the issue for months, and a National Review Online story from September noted that two-thirds of Boeing's political donations flow to Republicans who oppose the Iran deal but quietly support the Boeing deal.  Iran Air claims it would use the aircraft for commercial purposes but some think tanks and special interest groups have said Iran shouldn't be trusted. "We have no control over what goes on in Iran and we do know that civilian aircraft have been used for non-civilian aircraft," Diane Katz of The Heritage Foundation told OneNewsNow in September. "In fact, the carrier that's buying the planes is a government-owned carrier. So the government of Iran is going to have control of these aircraft." President Obama has expressed confidence in Iran but Katz said she doesn't trust the regime. "And I think there is a lot of other people, both in the United States and around the world," she says, "who also don't have much confidence in Iran."

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com KENNEDY SPACE CENTER VISITOR COMPLEX, FL – America’s pioneering astronauts who braved the perils of the unknown and put their lives on the line at the dawn of the space age atop mighty rockets that propelled our hopes and dreams into the new frontier of outer space and culminated with NASA’s Apollo lunar landings, are being honored with the eye popping new ‘Heroes and Legends’ attraction at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex (KSCVC) in Florida. With fanfare and a fireworks display perfectly timed for Veterans Day, ‘Heroes and Legends’ opened its doors to the public on Friday, November 11, 2016, during a gala ceremony attended by more than 25 veteran and current NASA astronauts, including revered Gemini and Apollo space program astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Jim Lovell, Charlie Duke, Tom Stafford, Dave Scott, Walt Cunningham and Al Worden – and throngs of thrilled members of the general public who traveled here as eyewitnesses from all across the globe. Aldrin, Scott, and Duke walked on the Moon during the Apollo 11, 15 and 16 missions. Also on hand were the adult children of the late-astronauts Alan Shepard (first American in space) and Neil Armstrong (first man to walk on the Moon), as well as representatives from NASA, The Boeing Company (sponsor) and park operator Delaware North – for the engaging program hosted by Master of Ceremonies John Zarrella, CNN’s well known and now retired space correspondent.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The stunning new ‘Heroes and Legends’ attraction is perfectly positioned just inside the entrance to the KSC Visitor Complex to greet visitors upon their arrival with an awe inspiring sense of what it was like to embark on the very first human journey’s into space by the pioneers who made it all possible ! And when every step along the way unveiled heretofore unknown treasures into the origin of us and our place in the Universe. Upon entering the park visitors will immediately and surely be mesmerized by a gigantic bas relief sculpture recreating an iconic photo of America’s first astronauts – the Mercury 7 astronauts; Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. “With all the drama of an actual trip to space, guests of Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida will be greeted with a dramatic sense of arrival with the new Heroes & Legends featuring the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame® presented by Boeing. Positioned just inside the entrance, the attraction sets the stage for a richer park experience by providing the emotional background and context for space exploration and the legendary men and women who pioneered our journey into space,” according to a description from Delaware North Companies Parks and Resorts, which operates the KSC visitor complex. “Designed to be the first stop upon entering Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, Heroes & Legends uses the early years of the space program to explore the concept of heroism, and the qualities that define the individuals who inspired their generation.” Astronauts cut the ribbon during Grand opening ceremony for the ‘Heroes and Legends’ attraction on Nov. 11, 2016 at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida, led by Kennedy Space Center Director Bob Cabana, a former space shuttle astronaut and member of the Astronaut Hall of Fame, during the ceremony. Credit: Julian Leek “I hope that all of you, when you get to see Heroes and Legends, you’re inspired,” said Kennedy Space Center Director Bob Cabana, a former space shuttle astronaut and member of the Astronaut Hall of Fame, during the ceremony. “The children today can see that there is so much more they can reach for if they apply themselves and do well.” “I think people a thousand years from now are going to be happy to see these artifacts and relics,” Apollo 15 command module pilot Al Worden told the crowd. “We have so much on display here with a Saturn V, Space Shuttle Atlantis. People will think back and see the wonderful days we had here. And I guess in that same vein, that makes me a relic too.” Grand opening ceremony for the ‘Heroes and Legends’ attraction on Nov. 11, 2016 at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida and attended by more than 25 veteran and current NASA astronauts. Credit: Julian Leek Furthermore, ‘Heroes and Legends’ is now very conveniently housed inside the new home of the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame (AHOF) – making for a unified space exploration experience for park visitors. AHOF previously was located at another off site park facility some seven miles outside and west of the Visitor Complex. The bas relief measures 30 feet tall and 40 feet wide. It is made put of fiberglass and was digitally sculpted, carved by CNC machines and juts out from the side of the new into the new 37,000 square foot U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame (AHOF) structure. To date 93 astronauts have been inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame spanning the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. “I don’t consider myself a hero like say, Charles Lindbergh,” said Jim Lovell, a member of the Astronaut Hall of Fame and Apollo 13 commander, when asked by Zarrella what it feels like to be considered an American space hero. “I just did what was proper and exciting — something for my country and my family. I guess I’m just a lucky guy.” The astronauts are also quick to say that they were supported by hundreds of thousands of dedicated people working in the space program to make Apollo happen. “It important to remember all the dedication and hard work that it took from those of us involved in the astronaut program, but also the support we received from Kennedy and all the contractors involved in Apollo,” said Apollo 16 moonwalker Charlie Duke. “400,000 people made it possible for 24 of us to go to the Moon.” “So dream big, aim high!” exclaimed Duke. “Hopefully this is an inspiration to you and your kids and grandkids.” Construction of the facility by Falcon’s Treehouse, an Orlando-based design firm began in the fall of 2015. “We’re focusing on a story to create what we consider a ‘launch pad’ for our visitors,” said Therrin Protze, the Delaware North chief operating officer of the Visitor Complex. “This is an opportunity to learn about the amazing attributes of our heroes behind the historical events that have shaped the way we look at space, the world and the future. “We are grateful to NASA for allowing us to tell the NASA story to millions of guests from all over the world,” Protze said. Visitors walk up a sweeping ramp to enter the Heroes and Legends experience. After visitors walk through the doors, they will be immersed by two successive video presentations and finally the Hall of Fame exhibit hall. Here’s a detailed description: • In the stunning 360-degree discovery bay, What is a Hero?, guests will explore how society defines heroism through diverse perspectives. Each examination of heroism starts with the following questions: What is a hero; Who are the heroes of our time; and What does it take to be a hero? During the seven-minute presentation, the historic beginning of the space race is acknowledged as the impetus for America’s push to the stars in NASA’s early years and the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. • Through the Eyes of a Hero is a custom-built theater featuring a multi-sensory experience during which guests will vicariously join NASA’s heroes and legends on the most perilous stages of their adventures. Artistically choreographed lighting and 3D imagery will be enhanced by intense, deeply resonant sound effects to create the sensation of being “in the moment.” The seven and one-half minute show takes guests on an intimate journey with four space-age heroes to fully immerse them in the awe, excitement and dangers of the first crewed space program missions. • The third experience, A Hero Is…, offers interactive exhibits that highlight the nine different attributes of our history making astronauts: inspired, curious, passionate, tenacious, disciplined, confident, courageous, principled and selfless. A collection of nine exhibit modules will explore each aforementioned attribute, through the actual experiences of NASA’s astronauts. Their stories are enhanced with memorabilia from the astronaut or the space program. A statue of astronaut Alan Shepard, America’s first person in space, stands just inside the doors to the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. The exhibit is housed in a rotunda and connects the visitor to each of the astronaut inductees through state-of-the-art interactive technology.

The Sigma 7 Mercury spacecraft piloted by astronaut Wally Schirra during his nine-hour, 13-minute mission of six orbits on October 3, 1962 mated to a human rated Mercury Redstone rocket (MR-6) is on display in the Heroes and Legends display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida.

Published: 08:16 November 15, 2016 Cleofe Maceda, Senior Web Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai: Etihad Airways has embarked on a major recruitment drive to hire additional crew, as it fleet expands. The UAE’s national carrier said it is looking for pilots in Europe to join both its Airbus and Boeing fleets, with new aircraft expected to arrive between this year and 2025. The main focus of the talent search is to fill posts for First Officers. Recruiters for the airline were scheduled to be in Europe on Sunday, November 13. They started in Romania and were expected to be in Bulgaria today, Tuesday. They will then make stops in Hungary, Lithuania, Greece, Poland, Belgium and Portugal. Etihad had earlier announced it would freeze the hiring of non-operational staff, as currency fluctuations, economic uncertainty and market competition are putting pressure on yields. Recruitment of pilots, cabin crew and engineers, however, will continue. The airline has a range of aircraft including Airbus 330s, 380s, Boeing 777s and B787s, and expects new A380 deliveries next year. “2017 will see further additions to our fleet as we continue our growth. We are seeking to recruit highly motivated, skilled and qualified pilots to come and join our team,” said Richard Hill, chief operations officer for Etihad Airways. Between 2016 and 2025, Etihad is expected to expand its current fleet of 123 to 179 aircraft, presenting more employment opportunities for aviation professionals. In 2016 alone, ten aircraft were added to the fleet. “It is exciting to be joining an airline that is growing rapidly and while we will recruit experienced pilots, we also put great focus on continued training and excellence in operational standards. This significant growth also creates opportunities for our existing pilots,” said Hill.

The British defense contractor Cobham Plc was recently awarded a contract to develop a refueling pallet for the tilt-rotor aircraft. (U.S. Marine Corps photo/John A. Hamilton Jr.) Posted By: Brendan McGarry November 14, 2016 A British defense firm has been tapped to develop a refueling pallet for the Marine Corps’ MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft made by Boeing Co. and Textron Inc.’s Bell Helicopter unit. Cobham Plc, based in Dorset, England, recently landed a contract from the service to develop the V-22 Aerial Refueling System, or VARS, according to a company announcement. The potential value of the deal wasn’t specified. The hose-and-drogue technology is a modified version of the company’s existing FR300 Hose Drum Unit that can be rolled on and off the aircraft on a standardized pallet, according to the statement. The system, to be manufactured at the company’s plant in Davenport, Iowa, will allow the Osprey to refuel the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter, a stealth fifth-generation fighter made by Lockheed Martin Corp., and the F/A-18 Hornet, a fourth-generation fighter made by Boeing Co., according to Cobham. “With VARS we continue the tradition of providing industry leading aerial refueling capability to war fighters,” Kevin McKeown, vice president and general manager of Cobham Mission Systems, said in a statement. “This program will enable the Marines to extend the flying range of their fighter aircraft and allow for efficient shipboard operations.” The contract for the refueling pallet comes as the military is looking at ways to reduce sustainment costs for the MV-22 — and just months after the first Osprey with 3-D printed parts took flight. An MV-22 equipped with a titanium link and fitting inside an engine nacelle performed a hover during a July 29 demonstration at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland. The historic test may pave the way for eventually helping to develop replacement parts in faster time and at less cost, officials have said. “That’s where the Rosetta Stone is going to be,” Rear Adm. (Sel.) Francis Morley, vice commander of Naval Air Systems Command, said earlier this year at the Navy League’s Sea Air Space conference outside Washington, D.C., according to a previous article on our Military.com sister blog DoDBuzz by my colleague, Hope Hodge Seck. “If we can start manufacturing flight-critical components, now you’re talking sustainment costs and speed and time; we have some really great opportunities to accelerate,” he added.

The legislation in the House of Representatives is the latest Republican-led effort to stop the sale of aircraft to Iran by Airbus and Boeing Co, allowed under the nuclear deal. The White House said U.S. partners would view the bill, if implemented, as a violation of the nuclear agreement. The United States plus Britain, Russia, France, China and Germany agreed to lift sanctions if Iran would curtail its nuclear program. The deals by Airbus and Boeing to sell or lease over 200 jets to IranAir would help modernize and expand the country's elderly fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions. Some members of Congress have raised concerns that killing the sale could cost jobs. But opponents argue that the passenger aircraft could be used for military purposes such as transporting fighters to battle U.S. troops or allies in Syria. The measure would bar the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing a transaction by a U.S. financial institution related to the export, or re-export, of commercial aircraft to Iran. And it would revoke any authorities enacted before the bill passed, such as those that allowed the Boeing and Airbus sales. The measure also limits the role of Export-Import Bank financing of sales to Iran. Some banks have been reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining sanctions prohibiting the use of the U.S. financial system for Iranian business. The House is expected to take up, and pass, the measure as soon as this week. It is not expected to get through the Senate, where it would need Democratic support to advance. Lawmakers expect more efforts to stop the aircraft sale, and the broader Iran deal, after Donald Trump becomes U.S. president in January. Trump has been critical of the nuclear agreement, which is seen by Obama supporters as one of the Democratic president's signature foreign policy achievements.

Victoria Kinney/U.S. Navy  Email  Print  Reddit  Tweet  Share  Google  More By Jerry Siebenmark | The Wichita Eagle (Tribune News Service) | Published: November 10, 2016 Spirit AeroSystems sees a chance to expand its business in military aircraft and even space structures, chief executive Tom Gentile told a packed Wichita Aero Club luncheon on Thursday. Gentile, who joined Spirit in April from a long career at GE, said Wichita’s largest employer recognizes that the current, record cycle for commercial airplane orders from Airbus and Boeing will someday slow. And there are a number of other industries within aerospace where Spirit can grow its business. Military aircraft structures is one, he said, including fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and tilt-rotors, and drones. “All of those markets seem to be fairly robust, and potentially with the election … thinking that maybe a Trump presidency might result in more defense spending,” Gentile said. “We will see. But the need for replenishment of military aerospace structures and craft definitely is there and will continue.” Gentile said Spirit estimates that business at $88 billion over the next 10 years for aerostructures alone. Among the types of military aircraft, drones “are a growing part of the industry,” and Spirit, he said, has something to offer since many of those craft are made of composite structures. Missiles, too, could be a new part of growth for the company, “a chance for us to leverage our commercial expertise and translate that into the military market,” he said. “We haven’t been very involved in military in the past, but this represents a very big opportunity for us.” Spirit’s current portfolio of defense work includes manufacturing fuselages, wing parts and engine structures for programs including the Navy’s P-8 Poseidon jet, the Boeing KC-46 air refueling tanker, the Air Force’s new B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber and the Sikorsky CH-53K heavy lift helicopter for the Marines. Gentile also said Spirit is looking at ways to get into building structures for rockets that travel to space. To that end, it is currently bidding for work on some space structures, he said. “Not because it’s a big market today,” he said. “It could be a very big market in the future.” He also said bidding on space work will inform the company about the industry and the skills it will need to have to expand its work in that sector. It’s “going to push us in terms of the scientific envelopes about what’s necessary from a standpoint of weight and heat absorption and other technical aspects to make us better,” Gentile said. ——— ©2016 The Wichita Eagle (Wichita, Kan.)

Resend activation e-mail Ministry of Innovation / Business of Technology China threatens to end iPhone sales if Trump imposes stiff tariffs China warns US president-elect it will nix Boeing orders, car deals, and food imports. by Tom Mendelsohn - Nov 14, 2016 1:13 pm UTC Login to bookmark 637 Gage Skidmore China has threatened to stifle American trade if US president-elect Donald Trump makes good on his campaign promise to impose massive tariffs on the country's imports. One of the most regular pledges that Trump made during the run-up to the election was to impose what he called "defensive" tariffs of 45 percent on Chinese imports and to have Beijing officially declare a currency manipulator, "the greatest in the world." At a rally in Florida in August, the Republican suggested these tariffs would force China to "stop the cheating." In an excoriating op-ed, China's state-run newspaper, Global Times, warned that the People's Republic would adopt "a tit-for-tat approach," and would simply stop buying American goods, including the Apple products that are so popular there. It said: A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. Trump as a shrewd businessman will not be so naïve. None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China. They all opted for a cautious line since it's most consistent with the overall interests of the US, and it's most acceptable to US society. There were an estimated 131 million iPhones in use in China at the end of 2015, more than any other manufacturer. Data released by the Chinese government suggests that Apple had 16.8 percent of the market, a point higher than Samsung, and 1.2 percent more than China-based Xiaomi. Trump has already spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping in a call to congratulate him on his election. A statement released afterwards said: "During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and president-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward." Shortly after Barack Obama was elected president for the first time, the US instituted a 35 percent import tariff on Chinese tyres, which prompted retaliatory tariffs on chicken and car exports. "Both China and the US suffered losses as a result," the Global Times said. "From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-US trade will be paralysed." Ars has asked Apple for comment. The state-backed editorial, which was released after the call between the one-time reality star and China's president, concluded: "If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired. Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance, and incompetence." China-based Foxconn—which employs nearly 1.5 million workers—is the main site where Apple's iPhone is produced. Arguably, China could step in and halt or disrupt production if Trump's threatened tariffs kick in. Expand full story Reader comments 637 You must login or create an account to comment.

IBTimes Staff Reporter November 14, 2016 16:42 IST China's President Xi Jinping delivers a speech at a conference commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Sun Yat-Sen, widely recognised as the father of modern China, at the Great Hall of the People in BeijingREUTERS/Jason Lee When on the campaign trail, Donald Trump singled out Mexico and China for some pretty harsh criticism: Mexico would pay for his wall, while China was referred to as a currency manipulator. Now the candidate has become the President-Elect, and all that political posturing seems a bit distant. That, however, hasn't stopped China from making sure that what is said on the campaign trail stays on the campaign trail. Why advertise with us? Related Jab they (India's Narendra Modi and Japan's Shinzo Abe) met Why the Russians and Chinese must fear this jacked-up US warplane An editorial in China's state-run newspaper, the Global Times, wrote: "China will take a tit-for-tat approach then [if Trump goes through with his threat of charging a 45% tariff on imports from China]. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US." The office of the US President-elect confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that Trump had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a Sunday night phone call in which the two leaders established a "clear sense of mutual respect". Chinese state news broadcaster CCTV elaborated on the call, citing Xi as saying that cooperation was the "sole correct choice" of the two nations, and that such cooperation in the past had yielded benefits for both. On the campaign trail, Trump had slammed US allies, including Japan and South Korea, of basically living under America's protective umbrella without paying for it. When Trump was elected last week, tensions rose in both Asian countries, especially as Chinese saber-rattling is at an all-time high, and North Korea continues to be as volatile as ever. In an interview last week following his election, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that while he had heard from most leaders, he had yet to speak with Xi. Chinese state media said Xi congratulated Trump by telegram shortly after his election. CCTV said both leaders would keep in contact and aim to meet soon.

Boeing said Friday the 29-year company veteran will succeed Jim O’Neill, who will retire in 2017 after more than 30 years with Boeing. “Pat’s experience across commercial and defense programs will help us grow a stable of strong development programs on the foundation that Jim put in place,” said Leanne Caret, who was appointed president and CEO of Boeing’s defense, space and security segment in February. Goggin, who previously served as VP of Boeing’s Development Program Excellence initiative, will take on his new role in December as part of the transition period. The BDS development segment is responsible for the pre-production stages of space and defense programs. Goggin’s appointment comes nearly two months after Boeing promoted Jim Chilton to president of the aerospace company’s network and space systems business that generates nearly $7.8 billion in annual revenue.

"China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US," said the editorial in the state controlled Global Times if Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. Throwing light on the incidents in the Barack Obama administration, the editorial read: "Not long after Barack Obama took office, US trade and commerce authorities announced a 35 percent import tariff on Chinese tires. In response, China took retaliatory steps of imposing tariffs on US chicken and automotive products. Both China and the US suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China." The editorial said that Trump as a shrewd businessman will not be so naive. "None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China. They all opted for a cautious line since it's most consistent with the overall interests of the US, and it's most acceptable to US society." Trump cannot change the pattern of interests between China and the US. "The gigantic China-US trade is based on mutual benefits and a win-win situation. Even as president, Trump can exert limited influence on it," it said. The article warned that if Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired which will lead to condemnation for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. To impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China is merely campaign rhetoric. The greatest authority a US president has is to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days on all imported goods and the limit can only be broken on the condition that the country is declared to be in a state of emergency. Other than that, a US president can only demand a tariff increase on individual commodities, it said. During the bitter race for the White House Trump repeatedly lashed out at China, vowing to punish Beijing with 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and to officially declare it a currency manipulator. "When they see that they will stop the cheating," the billionaire Republican, who has accused Beijing of "the greatest theft in the history of the world", told a rally in August. Meanwhile, in an interview on Friday, when questioned as to whether Trump will formally declare China a currency manipulator, Judy Shelton, one of Trump's economic advisers, said "he is someone going to carry through on what he says."  SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

They immediately switched off some non-essential electrical equipment in the cockpit and then managed to make a safe precautionary landing at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. "The pilots first saw some smoke in the cockpit and then there was a strong burning smell. They checked with the crew if the same was being reported by passengers. However, the problem seemed limited to the cockpit," said a source. The crew then declared an emergency and proceeded to Delhi. En route, they followed the check list and switched off some non-essential electrical items. "Following this, the smoke and smell did not increase. The plane made a safe landing in Delhi. Passengers alighted at the terminal and then the plane was towed to a remote bay," said the source. AI engineering then inspected the plane and immediately got in touch with Boeing. Preliminary check, said sources, suggested that the cabin air compressor(CAC), which pumps air inside the aircraft, of the cockpit may have failed. "We informed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation who asked AI to carry out the repairs on Monday as they want to oversee what will be done," said a source. AI has in recent days witnessed a number of CAC failures in its Dreamliners. However, Sunday's was the first instance of smoke and smell being caused due to that. "We are expecting to hear from Boeing on this issue and see how this can be resolved," said a source. In fact, AI's troubles with the Dreamliners have erupted after two to three years of relative quiet. The airline saw about five instances of windshield cracks of the B-787 in past few months. The airline has sought compensation from the US aircraft major for the windshield problem. AI started getting the Dreamliners four years ago and has now got 22 of the 27 B-787s it ordered. "The first batch of this plane AI got had some technical issues. Then Boeing upgraded all our first few deliveries and the subsequent ones were delivered after making the required changes. Last two years were okay but now we are again witnessing a rise in issues regarding B-787. While the aircraft is perfectly safe, snags grounding the aircraft time and again means a huge loss to AI," said a senior official.

Another thundered overhead, moments later, so low the local children could almost reach up and touch the wheels. Then another. In the village high street, nobody covered their ears. The earth didn’t shake from the battering of the four gigantic propellors on each plane. In fact, the blades of grass in the meadows didn’t even tremble. These weren’t actual World War II bombers, but computer-generated images, projected on to the scene like a digital slideshow. And they looked about as real as the trampolining foxes in the John Lewis ad. That proved to be the failure of this entire drama, a boyhood memoir set in 1943. None of it was quite believable. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Lily Donaldson shows off her cleavage and legs in a daring... 'I eat pasta a lot!' Amy Schumer posts selfies showing her... Share this article Share The situation was historically accurate: American airmen arrived at a base near the north-south border, and stirred tensions with the villagers — many of them IRA sympathisers who regarded the British, not the Germans, as their enemy. But the story was as computer-generated as the aircraft. Hattie Morahan played Rose, who ran the local stores, while her husband Michael (Owen McDonnell) took care of the pub. ITV's The Next Great Magician was as if a giant trick had been played on the viewer Rose was English, an outsider, so naturally the Republicans, with their cloth caps, scrawny scarves and glowers, would gather around her shop counter to buy tobacco in a threatening manner. Even Michael treated her as if she didn’t belong. Rose felt lonely — and being lonely, went for windswept coastal walks. Where, inevitably, she met a handsome American airforce captain with sad eyes. Aaron Staton, best known for playing the ad exec with an eyepatch in Mad Men, was the captain. He made a dutiful appearance on BBC Breakfast last Friday, when every question seemed to surprise him. WEEKEND'S BAD TIMING:  Dan Snow trekked to the northernmost peaks of the Rockies at the climax of Operation Gold Rush (BBC2).  Trouble was, there were better mountains over on BBC1’s Planet Earth II – with snow leopards and grizzly bears.  Sorry Dan, you peaked on the wrong day.  I thought that was just the actor’s ‘Aw shucks’ persona, but he’s exactly like that in the drama, too, so perhaps he was in character. While Aaron was being flummoxed by the Irish accents and everything else, the other airmen were wasting no time. They drank the pub dry, they taunted the menfolk over Eire’s neutrality, and fulfilled every Yanks-go-home cliche short of handing out nylons. Rose’s 16-year-old daughter was swept off her innocent feet, of course, to her parents’ disapproval. ‘She is far too young to even consider a serious relationship,’ declared Rose, lapsing into the jargon of 21st-century therapists. Meanwhile, her adolescent son watched it all, silently and quite creepily, as boys planning to write their memoirs do. If you ever find an unspeaking 12-year-old gazing intently at you, beware — he’s storing you up to be a character in a second-rate costume drama. Silent, intense schoolboys often grow up to become conjurors, and there were half a dozen of them on The Next Great Magician (ITV) — plus one ex-schoolgirl. Katherine Mills was easily the best of the acts, with a comic routine where she took an unsuspecting member of the public on a date that turned into an on-the-spot wedding. But the act crowned winners was a couple of Scottish stand-up comedians whose ‘magic’ consisted of vomiting up liquids. It was not just unpleasant, it was unimpressive. Why they were chosen was not explained. There were no judges, and no public vote: the magicians picked a winner among themselves, in a backroom. Since they were discussing the secrets of magic, we were not privileged to eavesdrop. That left the whole show feeling like a trick had been played on viewers. And probably it had, since the overall winner will be granted an hour-long TV special — ITV bosses are hardly likely to leave that to the whim of a bunch of illusionists. There were celebrities in the audience to add some pizzazz, though more care should have been taken to book people who actually like watching magic. Jim Carter, of Downton Abbey, stared at a series of card tricks, rumbling: ‘This is very annoying.’ Carson the butler wouldn’t have stood for such foolery either.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

Modifications to the attack helicopters now allow for the firing of the Rafael Spike anti-tank guided missile. The program began in 2014 following the halting by Washington of a shipment of Hellfire missiles to Israel during Operation Protective Edge. The offensive, which saw IDF forces conduct several weeks of operations in the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas rocket fire, has drawn international criticism on both sides. Keep reading for the whole story with recent events put in context Israeli AH-64D (click to view full) Israel’s attack helicopter fleet still flies AH-1 Cobras, but larger and more heavily armored AH-64 Apache helicopters began arriving in 1990, and have distinguished themselves in a number of war since. The country received 44 AH-64A helicopters from 1990 – 1993. Additional buys, conversions, and losses placed the fleet at 45 helicopters as of Flight Global’s World Air Forces 2013 report, split between AH-64As and more modern AH-64D Longbows. The AH-64D Longbow’s sophisticated mast-mounted radar can quickly pick up tanks and other dangerous targets, but isn’t designed to distinguish civilians from combatants, or to hover close over the deck in highly populated areas. Confronted by asymmetrical urban warfare and budget priority issues, and faced with a lack of cooperation from the Obama administration, the IAF decided in 2010 to forego AH-64D upgrades for their remaining helicopters. On the other hand, the type’s consistent usefulness has led Israeli to make extensive improvements of their own, to the point where Israel has effectively created their own improved AH-64A configuration… Advertisement Contracts & Key Events Israeli AH-64s November 14/16: AH-64 Apaches operated by Israel now have an anti-tank capability. Modifications to the attack helicopters now allow for the firing of the Rafael Spike anti-tank guided missile. The program began in 2014 following the halting by Washington of a shipment of Hellfire missiles to Israel during Operation Protective Edge. The offensive, which saw IDF forces conduct several weeks of operations in the Gaza Strip in response to Hamas rocket fire, has drawn international criticism on both sides. March 14/14: AH-64Ai. Israel has reportedly upgraded its AH-64As to its own improved configuration, which approaches the American AH-64D standard in sophistication but isn’t the same. Improvements reportedly include Israeli electronic warfare and self-protection systems, improved avionics, compatibility with modern Israeli battle management & communications systems, and “several new” Israeli missiles. Carriage of RAFAEL’s Spike-LR missiles as alternatives to AGM-114 Hellfires would be expected, along with Elbit Systems’ GATR-L laser-guided 70mm rockets. There are also reports that South Korea will be integrating the long-range Spike NLOS and its 25+ km reach onto its new AW159 Wildcat naval helicopters, and that kind of missile would be an equally excellent complement to Israeli AH-64s. All sources would say was: “They are based on the huge operational experience of the force in using the Apache Longbow in a variety of combat scenarios,” an officer, identified only as Maj. Yonatan…. The upgrade has been developed amid the U.S. refusal to modernize Israel’s Apache fleet, employed in attacks on the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. The sources said the administration of President Barack Obama blocked Israeli efforts to modernize the Apaches or purchase new helicopters from Boeing.” Sources: World Tribune, “Israel upgrades Apache helicopters after U.S. blocked their modernization”. Oct 8/13: AH-64A+. The commander of the IAF’s “Unit 22” says that Israel’s AH-64As are undergoing comprehensive upgrades in Israel. This includes replacing original wiring and some main computers, and a new unit-designed compartment beneath the fuselage that houses additional electronics. Israel still flies a number of AH-64A models, after deciding not to upgrade the entire fleet to the AH-64D standard. Flight Global’s Ascend databases places the number at 26 / 48 helicopters, but it may not fully account for casualties. Sources: FlightGlobal, “Israeli Apache upgrade adds avionics pod”. Dec 31/10: Weapons. Israel is reportedly looking to equip its AH-64 helicopters with guided 70mm rockets, and is reportedly considering whether tho use the American Hydra or Canadian CRV-7 as its base. That’s an odd contention, because Israel’s Elbit Systems Ltd. partnered with America’s ATK on July 9/08 to create a 70mm GATR-L laser-guided rocket. It’s based on the Hydra, and reportedly had successful Israeli flight trials in June 2009. Sources: Jerusalem Post, “Rapid-fire rocket system aims to reduce civilian casualties”. IAF AH-64 (click to view full) June 30/10. Israel abandons plans to upgrade its entire AH-64 fleet to the AH-64D Longbow configuration, and will choose to improve the helicopters’ weapon options instead. They’ll also continue operating their CH-53D helicopters until the CH-53K is available to replace them. Sources: Flight Global, “Israel ditches Apache upgrade plan, commits to CH-53K”. No more AH-64D upgrades Aug 4/09: After analyzing their AH-64D fleet’s participation during Operation “Cast Lead” against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, the IAF has decided to upgrade all of its AH-64As to the AH-64D configuration. That’s fine with Boeing, who has been urging customer to upgrade to AH-64D Block II standard before the US military stops supporting the AH-64A. Sources: Flight Global, “Israel, Boeing negotiate Apache Longbow upgrade”. May 27/09: US blocks AH-64s. The Obama administration blocks Israel’s request for 6 more AH-64D Apache Longbow attack helicopters, using the old “interagency review” gambit. Israel had lost 2 AH-64s during the 2006 war with Hizbullah. Sources: World Tribune, “Administration blocks helicopters for Israel due to civilian casualties in Gaza”. US blockage April 12/05: The left-wing Ha’aretz publishes an article debating whether or not new rotor aircraft platforms such as the AH-64 Apache Longbow – of which Israeli just bought 18 – are worth the cost. Their immediate security threats are widely considered to be terrorism-related these days, rather than the historic threat of Syrian tank columns. Given their cost, are the really necessary? The report says that the Israeli debate mirrors the U.S. debate that led to the shelving of Boeing and Sikorsky’s RAH-66 Comanche program. A cost of $600 million recently bought Israel the 18 Longbows, plus 9 new Apaches and newly-scheduled upgrades for previously purchased Apaches. Israeli Longbow purchase opponents – many who would like to see the money put into land forces and ground security purchases – point to the expensive mission in Karbala, Iraq during the campaign that overthrew Saddam Hussein, where small arms managed to seriously hurt 28 of 30 Apaches as they hovered to acquire targets. Among aviators, much of the Karbala damage has been blamed on intelligence that failed to alert pilots that the terrain south of Baghdad was so heavily populated. Apache and Longbow supporters have also used the Karbala incident to boost their case, pointing out just how much lead the craft were able to absorb while still remaining in the air. Sources: Ha’aretz, “The Longbow – yes and no”. Additional Readings IAF – Boeing AH-64 Apache (Hebrew nickname: ‘Peten’ (‘Adder’), ‘Saraph’). AH-64As are Adders. AH-64Ds are Saraphs.

Apple unveils $300 design tome Navy STEALS? US sailors dispute piracy claim Verizon pours cash into city Wi-Fi with LQD buy China says the rhetoric of US President-elect Donald Trump could lead it to block the sale of products by Apple and other US tech companies. An editorial from the state-run Global Times news outlet suggests that, should Trump make good on his campaign promise to declare China a currency manipulator and raise tariffs on imported goods, China's government could respond by blocking the import of US goods to the mainland, with the Apple iPhone in particular getting special mention. "China will take a tit-for-tat approach then," the article promises. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted." The paper goes on to urge Trump to back off from any planned sanctions on China, and instead keep the current trade scenario, which it calls a "win-win" for the two countries. "If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired," the editorial promises. "Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences." Not that China has been doing Apple many favors as of late, anyway. The last quarterly numbers to come out of Cupertino showed that revenues from China fell by 30 per cent from the prior year, and globally iPhone shipments were down 13 per cent. Still, CEO Tim Cook has to be wondering just what he did to end up in the middle of a Sino-Trumpian war of words, particularly when he recently issued a letter to employees in an effort to ease anxiety over the election. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 133 Comments More from The Register Tech Trump: Silicon Valley steps into the valley of unhappiness It's a long litany of problematic positions 61 Comments Donald Trump running insecure email servers But he's got a yuge firewall, folks... the best kind of firewall 85 Comments Criticize Donald Trump, get your site smashed offline from Russia Newsweek Cuban connection story enrages miscreants 128 Comments You think Donald Trump is insecure?

That is what I think this market has become all about," the "Mad Money" host said. Stocks initially rallied last week from the prospects of tax cuts and infrastructure and defense spending. On Monday, however, investors finally realized that President-elect Trump could crack down on trading partners who take advantage of the U.S. market without opening theirs, Cramer said. They are starting to see what it could mean if Trump does more than just talk tough about imports and dumping. "We are beginning to witness the other side of the trade of the Trump rally and it might hurt as many companies as it helps," Cramer said. © Provided by CNBC Stocks showed signs of weakness when technology plays fell out of favor and banks and domestic stocks rotated in. At the time, Cramer thought it might have just been managers raising money to buy winning stocks.  News out of China changed Cramer's mind when he read a story in the Global Times, which called Trump naïve if he started a real trade war with China. It said that if a trade war was launched, Boeing (BA) orders would be replaced by Airbus, auto and iPhone sales would have setbacks, and U.S. soybean and maize imports would be halted.

Cramer questioned whether President Trump will follow through on all of candidate Trump's rhetoric. Former Nucor (NUE) CEO Dan DiMicco is one of Trump's closest advisors. Cramer has interviewed DiMicco many times and says DiMicco believes China has been getting a better deal over on the U.S. for ages. "He's telling Trump to be more concerned about how Chinese trading chicanery impacts workers than about whether we lose their shampoo and soda market. In other words, a trade war might really be in the cards," Cramer said. "That is certainly what the stock market was saying today." Shares of Apple (AAPL) fell more than 2 percent on Monday, and pulled down the rest of technology with them. It was also another tough day for FANG — Cramer's acronym for Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google, now Alphabet (GOOGL). General Motors (GM) also fell, even after it was a winner last week. On the flipside, Boeing actually had a nice rally on Monday. FedEx (FDX), which needs strong Asian markets, rallied too. "I think it is worth pointing out that, after today, we have a newfound risk to this market, one that can only be described as the big downside of helping to keep jobs here in America," Cramer said. Companies that exported jobs overseas need those overseas markets to make profits. Ultimately, if Trump sticks with his campaign promises on trade, Cramer said to prepare for a brave new world.

They all opted for a cautious line since it's most consistent with the overall interests of the US, and it's most acceptable to US society. That's China's state-run newspaper, threatening to hit - among others - Apple where it hurts. I don't think American companies are going to, uh, just allow Trump and his administration to carry out this promise he made to voters - one of his core promises, I might add.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More Aerospace execs gear up to pitch their planes as Liberals expected to hold competition for CF-18 replacement David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen  11.14.2016 An F-35A fighter aircraft sits on the tarmac ahead of the Abbotsford International Airshow, in Abbotsford, B.C., on Aug. 11, 2016. A U.S. Navy F/A 18 Super Hornet performs at the Canadian International Air Show at the CNE in Toronto, Sept. 4, 2016. ShareAdjustCommentPrint Canadian firms have now won $1 billion worth of work on the F-35 fighter jet, a selling point that aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin hopes to use as it prepares for an expected competition to replace the CF-18 fleet. Cabinet officials met recently to discuss the way forward on a CF-18 fighter replacement and industry sources say they now expect the Liberal government to eventually proceed to a competition to buy new aircraft. Aerospace firms are shifting into high gear for that event, although the timing of an announcement is unknown. Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin’s CEO, will be in Ottawa Tuesday for a major aerospace conference and various meetings, while Pratt and Whitney officials will be highlighting details about the F-35 engine the firm builds. Shelley Lavender, the president of Boeing Military Aircraft, will be in Ottawa on Thursday for the same conference. Lavender was program manager for Boeing’s Super Hornet aircraft, one of the F-35’s rivals in any Canadian competition. Jordan Owens, spokeswoman for Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, said Monday that work is still underway on determining how to replace the CF-18. Sajjan has said the procurement strategy would be decided in months, not years, as the CF-18s need to be replaced quickly. The minister has noted he prefers an open competition. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power pledging the Liberals would hold a competition for a new fighter jet but, at the same time, said it would not buy the F-35. Trudeau has yet to explain that contradiction. Lockheed Martin said Monday that while in Canada, Hewson will meet with company employees and “numerous Canadian stakeholders to Lockheed Martin.” Jack Crisler, one of Lockheed Martin’s senior F-35 officials, told Postmedia in August that it looked like the F-35 would be included in any competition. The stealth fighter became a political nightmare for the Conservative government after it pledged to buy 65 of the planes. The F-35 was plagued with technology problems. U.S. lawmakers were complaining about its cost. Last year Donald Trump, then one of a number of Republican presidential candidates, complained about the cost of the F-35 and the technology issues affecting the aircraft. “I do hear that it’s not very good,” he said during an October 2015 radio interview. “I’m hearing that our existing planes are better.” But Trump, now president-elect, has not indicated what, if anything, he will do about the F-35 program. However, stock market analysts are seeing positive news for defence company stocks, including Lockheed Martin, because of Trump’s election, as he has promised to revamp the U.S. military. Lockheed Martin officials are keen for a competition since they believe their aircraft can readily beat other planes. The F-35 won in competitions in Denmark, Japan and South Korea, they add. In June, Lockheed Martin almost saw its hopes of selling planes to Canada disappear completely. The government was close to moving on an interim purchase of Super Hornet jets from Boeing and Trudeau claimed the F-35 “does not work and is far from working.” That prompted Lockheed Martin to warn that Canadian companies who had contracts on the F-35 would suffer. After that, plans for a Super Hornet interim deal seemed to disappear. The F-35 has been declared ready for combat by the U.S. Air Force although critics have pointed out that much work still needs to be done on the aircraft. Two F-35s visited Canada for the first time at the August airshow in Abbotsford, B.C. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

These extreme claims gathered support by those who were tired of the status quo and desired change. One of Trump’s claims was of a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods being imported into the US. The tax on Chinese goods can also negatively affect the sales of US goods as well as Apple iPhones. According to the Global Times (Chinese newspaper), “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback,” and as a response the Chinese government will take a “tit-for-tat approach” to combat the change in the trade between the two countries. So if we do happen to raise the taxes on imported goods from China to 45% then only time will tell how China will respond to the change. Luckily, the laws in the US limit tariffs to 15% on all imports and will last for up to 150 days if put forth by the President. Therefore, the chances of Donald Trump imposing the 45% tax on all of China’s imported goods is unlikely. In 2009 there was a tax tariff on imported tires from China of 35% and as a response China raised taxes on goods coming in from the US. According to the Global Times the trade between the US and China will be paralyzed as a result of the tax tariffs. This would further hurt our relations with the second largest economy in the world (China housing an $11.3 trillion economy) and in effect be detrimental to both economies. So far with President-elect Donald Trump proposing different plans in relation to his claims while on the campaign trail, we can’t be certain whether or not he was serious about imposing the 45% tax tariff on imported goods from China. Regardless, it would be good to keep in mind the results in proceeding either way. arterius2 ROFL. As a Chinese I almost wanted Trump to do it. DO IT TRUMP! For me though?

Possibly, warns an editorial from the Global Times, a Chinese state-run publication, if a Trump presidency follows through on its campaign promises when it comes to the Communist nation. As the GOP presidential candidate, Trump campaigned on getting tough on what he called “cheating China” when it comes to trade. He said he would impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. If that happens, a trade war would be certain. The editorial predicted: China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. Trump as a shrewd businessman will not be so naïve. None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China. They all opted for a cautious line since it’s most consistent with the overall interests of the US, and it’s most acceptable to US society. Trump cannot change the pattern of interests between China and the US. The gigantic China-US trade is based on mutual benefits and a win-win situation. Even as president, Trump can exert limited influence on it. If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired. Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. But since his election win, President-elect Trump has dialed down some of the rhetoric around foreign engagement, something the editorial noted. “Trump is not obstinate with regard to ties with China,” the editorial said. “Making things difficult for China politically will do him no good.” China’s president, Xi Jinping, spoke to Trump recently, congratulating him on his election victory. According to The Guardian, China experts say that Beijing is rattled by what a Trump presidency means but have learned that while candidates may campaign on an anti-China message, the tune changes once they are in office. While saber-rattling, the editorial may not represent the Chinese government’s positions, suggests Engadget: If China really wanted to drop some not-so subtle warnings about international relations, it’d use Global Times’ parent the People’s Daily, or Xinhua News. This byline-free editorial is more of a rebuke to the accusation that China is a currency manipulator. The stuff about blocking the iPhone and Boeing seem to be baseless conjecture than anything else. Photo: An Apple store in central Beijing, China.  (Alexander F.

By Michael Havis / Published 14th November 2016 GETTY FACE OFF: Donald Trump's tough talk has fallen foul of China The President elect previously pledged a 45% tariff to force up the cost of Chinese imports to the US. But now Beijing has issued a stinging rebuke, warning the billionaire businessman that if he wants a trade war, he’ll get one. An editorial in the regime-run Global Times newspaper warned that China would hit the US hard if Trump enacted new tariffs. GETTY READY FOR EXPORT: Chinese goods ready to be sent overseas from Lianyungang, China “The new president will be condemned... and bear all the consequences” Chinese government newspaper "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus.

The newspaper, quoted by CNBC, added that in 2009 Beijing had proved its willingness to respond to Barack Obama. It highlighted how a 35% tariff on Chinese tyres had been met with tariffs on US car parts and chicken.

"The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences," it said. "We’re very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by American media to trip up the new president." Trump has previously proposed the tariffs saying "the only power that we have with China is massive trade." Quotes by CBS News, he said: "I would tax China on products coming in. I would do a tariff, yes – and they do it to us." He has also proposed a 35% tariff on cars made in Mexico, in response to the suggestion Ford would move manufacturing south of the border.

Apple said in a lawsuit filed Monday, Oct. 17, 2016, that it has been buying Apple products labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them are counterfeit. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) 1 41 Follow Share Tweet The election of Donald Trump to the presidency has already had a major impact on United States trade policy, as President Obama announced over the weekend that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal — which was slated to be his signature second-term accomplishment — is all but dead, politically. President-elect Trump made criticism of trade deals a central plank of his campaign, and he repeatedly singled out the nations of China and Mexico as unfair trade partners while on the trail. In a controversial interview with the New York Times editorial board, Trump suggested that he would impose high tariffs on China, throwing out a rate of 45 percent as a hypothetical starting point for negotiations on a new trade deal. Many news media outlets reporting on the interview claimed that Trump supported a firm 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, a claim that Trump immediately denied on the campaign trail. The Chinese government has not waited for Trump’s inauguration to begin its public relations battle with the incoming Trump administration. According to CNBC, a Chinese state-run newspaper has published threats of retaliation if a Trump administration attempts to impose any punitive measures such as tariffs: A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S. Boeing’s corporate headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois, and they employ thousands of Americans at manufacturing and service facilities across the United States. Airbus is headquartered in France and has manufacturing facilities in France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. China is a major importer of food products from the United States; however, in recent years, China has gained ground as an exporter of certain food products as well. U.S. trade policy with respect to China has been a contentious political issue for decades, since the Chinese were granted “most favored nation” status in 1979. China’s record on human rights abuses have made this status a contentious one politically, especially since the Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989 angered the American public. The American business community has successfully lobbied the United States government to keep trade negotiations with China separate from human rights negotiations, because China is a major importer of U.S. goods. Former President Bill Clinton acceded to these lobbying efforts when he reversed a campaign pledge in 1994 and again granted China most favored nation status. The term “most favored nation” status was revised to “permanent normal trade relations” in 1998, and this status was granted to China in 2001. In recent years, the focus of controversy regarding United States trade with China has moved from China’s alleged human rights abuses to China’s alleged unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation and flaunting of international intellectual property law. Trump made these practices a central focus of his campaign, leading to speculation that he might start a trade war with China after his inauguration.

If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-US trade will be paralyzed. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback […] The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. Global Times also believes that Trump will not have the authority needed to apply a 45% tariff. To impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China is merely campaign rhetoric. The greatest authority a US president has is to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days on all imported goods and the limit can only be broken on the condition that the country is declared to be in a state of emergency. Other than that, a US president can only demand a tariff increase on individual commodities. In addition, The Guardian is reporting that it’s not just the Chinese who are hoping that the trade war threat was just a joke. Paul Haenle, a veteran US diplomat who is director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua centre at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, warned the introduction of protectionist measures would immediately “inject friction” into already fraught US-China ties as well as harming America’s own economy. “If he follows through on a 45% trade tariff then I think it will be damaging to our own interests and we will have fallout that will affect our own companies and our own economy and it won’t be effective. It will not achieve what he is setting out to achieve. So from that standpoint he is going to have to moderate some of that rhetoric as he puts together actual concrete policies.” Tags: Apple, China, Donald Trump, trade war About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Teamster UPS Aircraft Mechanics Vote To Strike The airline maintenance workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike after three years of negotiations during which UPS has continued to demand huge health care concessions. In total, 80 percent, 950 of the company’s 1,200 maintenance employees, participated in the strike vote, and 98 percent of those workers voted in favor of a strike. The workers voted in October and November by mail-in ballot. The strike vote comes after UPS announced earlier this month that it beat third quarter earnings expectations with revenue of more than $14.9 billion. UPS will ship some 700 million packages during the holiday shopping season, the peak period for UPS, and an increase of more than 16 percent over last year. The company also announced plans to purchase 14 jumbo aircraft from Boeing Co. between 2017 and 2020—the first such order by UPS since 2008. The 14 Boeing 747-8s cost a total of $5.3 billion before discounts that may have been negotiated. “We’re glad that UPS can afford to invest in beefing up its international fleet,” said Jim Kelley, a 29-year aircraft mechanic at UPS’s Louisville, Ky. gateway. “But if UPS can afford major capital investments and huge raises for top brass, then UPS can also choose to invest in the maintenance workers who do strenuous and dangerous work every day to make its success possible. No one wants to go on strike, but I voted to strike because UPS mechanics and our families deserve better from UPS.” UPS posted $4.84 billion in profits last year and is the world’s largest delivery company. The company’s stock was upgraded by many analysts following the strong third quarter and seven consecutive quarters of double-digit international profits. In September, UPS announced additional stock incentives and 10 percent raises for its top executives: Chairman and CEO David P. Abney, Senior Vice President and CFO Richard N. Peretz, CCO Alan Gershenhorn and President of U.S. Operations Myron A. Gray. Despite record profits, UPS is calling for massive reductions in health benefits for 1,200 maintenance workers who are critical to the company’s supply chain. UPS aircraft mechanics and other maintenance workers do physically demanding and often dangerous work around jet engine aircrafts and equipment and toxic chemicals and exhaust. UPS is also calling for a devastating reduction in benefits for retirees who spent their lives servicing the company’s planes. Under UPS’s proposal, health coverage for a retiree and his or her spouse would skyrocket to more than $19,000 per year in the first year with further increases each year thereafter. “We work hard to make sure UPS planes are operational, on time, and above all safe. It’s a responsibility we take seriously and don’t expect much in return,” said Juan Flores, a 15-year aircraft mechanic at UPS’s Dallas gateway, who voted to authorize a strike. “All we’re asking is to keep the health care we count on so we can stay healthy and keep UPS’s planes running for millions of customers around the globe. Voting to strike isn’t an easy decision, but I had to stand up for good, middle class jobs and the health of my family.” A UPS aircraft mechanics strike would halt UPS’s global shipping operation. Last month, dozens of UPS mechanics picketed outside a major Amazon distribution center in Jeffersonville, Indiana to show executives at UPS and Amazon—a major UPS customer—that workers were united and committed to protecting their health and jobs. Protests and informational pickets will continue throughout the holiday season at locations across the country. UPS pilots have expressed their support for the mechanics and other maintenance workers in their effort to settle a fair contract. In a recent letter to the mechanics, Independent Pilot Association President Robert Travis wrote, “Please be assured that you have the full support of the 2,600 professional airline pilots who fly worldwide for UPS.” “Dedicated aircraft maintenance workers are simply asking to keep the benefits they already have so they can keep UPS planes running effectively,” said Tim Boyle, President of Teamsters Local 2727, the workers’ union. “No one wants to strike, but members voted overwhelming to authorize a strike because UPS is refusing to work with us. We’ll do whatever it takes to protect good, middle class jobs, our health and our families.” Many UPS gateways operate with just one aircraft mechanic per shift, meaning he or she works alone around massive aircraft parts and equipment, sometimes for up to 39 hours straight. Lifting injuries and accidents are common. Repetitive stress injuries, hearing loss, inhaling toxic exhaust, and jet engine blasts are among other health risks UPS aircraft maintenance workers face. In 2008, OSHA cited UPS for violations that led to, among other injuries, a worker breaking his neck when a truck he was parked in was blown over by the jet blast of a Boeing 747 aircraft. Recent OSHA complaints assert these and other dangerous conditions persist.

Teamsters Local 2727 Nov 14, 2016, 11:19 ET Share this article LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Airline maintenance technicians and related classifications who maintain UPS's

The airline said it plans to introduce 10-abreast seating on 25 777s, increasing the economy-class cabin from 216 to 252 seats. It will trim the business-class cabin from 40 to 32 seats but double the premium-economy cabin to 48 seats. The company said the new 777 configuration, increasing its accommodation from 280 to 332 seats, will be introduced in early 2018, and will provide more economical unit seat costs compared with those on Norwegian´s Boeing 787s, which the Scandinavian carrier uses at Gatwick. British Airways is the flag carrier of the United Kingdom and is based in Waterside near its main hub at London Heathrow Airport.

Today, the country’s state-run Global Times warned such a move would result in repercussions that will affect the sale of iPhones and US cars in China. The Times says (via The Guardian) that the president-elect would be “naïve” to follow through on his election promises of introducing the tariff and officially declaring China a currency manipulator. "China will take a tit-for-tat approach then," the newspaper said in an editorial. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US." The paper goes on to say that maintaining the current trade agreement between the countries is “a win-win situation,” and if Trump does decide to change things, then “the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences." Trump spoke to Chinese president, Xi Jinping, just before the editorial was published. It was the first time that the two men had communicated with each other. In a statement, Trump’s staff said: “During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward.” As president, Trump could impose tariffs on specific goods, but no more than 15 percent and only for 150 days on all imported good – unless a state of emergency is declared. Like many of his pre-election statements, whether he follows through with the promise remains to be seen. Last week, Tim Cook become the latest silicon valley leader to address Trump’s presidency. The Apple CEO sent out an internal memo calling for unity among his employees. Trump spoke out against Apple’s decision not to help the FBI unlock the San Bernardino iPhone earlier this year, and said he would force the company to make all of its devices in the US if he became president.

During his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a "tit-for-tat approach", according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party. Apple iPhone 7 mobile phones being sold. Getty Images. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read. Apple has not responded to CNBC's request for comment. But the Chinese newspaper was not convinced Trump would go through with his suggestion, calling it "merely campaign rhetoric" and questioning its legal validity. U.S. law dictates that presidents can only impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days on all imports, As an example of earlier tariff-tit-for-tats, the Global Times pointed toward the 35 percent tariffs imposed in 2009 on Chinese tires by outgoing U.S. president Barack Obama. China retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. car parts and chicken. "Both China and the U.S. suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed," the Global Times said. The opinion piece said Trump was a "shrewd businessman" and would not be naïve, but, if he was serious with the policy, it would affect a number of U.S. industries. "The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president," the Global Times wrote. America's relationship with China is in focus after Trump slammed the world's second-largest economy during his campaign. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump spoke over the phone on Sunday. "During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward," a statement from Trump's presidential transition team said.

Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence,” the newspaper wrote in an editorial. The article listed Boeing airplanes, iPhones and crops such as maize and soybeans as goods that would be affected by Chinese countermeasures. It also stated that the number of Chinese students studying abroad in the U.S. could be cut if Trump adopted policies harmful to its trade with China, which the author described as "based on mutual benefits and a win-win situation." Trump claimed on the campaign trail he intended to limit China's influence on the U.S. economy by encouraging companies to manufacture at home. One of Trump's economic advisors, Judy Shelton, declared Friday that Trump would carry through with his campaign promises, but Wilbur Ross, one of Trump's senior policy advisors, told Yahoo Finance that the president-elect would avoid unnecessary conflict.

Chinese President Xi Jinping called Trump after his electoral victory Wednesday to congratulate the next president and discuss economic and military policies.

According to Chinese newspaper Global Times, these actions will not only negatively affect China's reputation, but "the trade atmosphere between China and the US will become more tense" (via The Guardian). In retaliation for the potential trade war, Global Times said that China "will take a tit-for-tat approach," and singled out the airline, automobile, and smartphone industries as some of the first potential targets of the tense relationship between the two countries if Trump decides to commit to his trade plan. Specifically, in regards to Apple and the iPhone, the newspaper said that China will cut iPhone sales in the country and subsequently the device "will suffer a setback" if all of this goes through. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. Trump cannot change the pattern of interests between China and the US. The gigantic China-US trade is based on mutual benefits and a win-win situation. Even as president, Trump can exert limited influence on it. Despite the potential for such a disruption, Global Sun thinks there's a possibility that the 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports could have simply been outlandish "campaign rhetoric" and won't be put into action during Trump's presidency. The newspaper ends noting that "the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences" if such a trade war does begin. For Apple, the company has been consistently bolstering its presence in China, most recently announcing a new R&D center in Shenzhen to attract software developers. This year, China lost ground to Europe as Apple's third most profitable market, but Tim Cook remains steadily "optimistic" about Apple's presence in China, saying that "China is not as weak as has been talked about. We may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's more stable than the common view of it."

If Trump really does proceed down such a reckless path, perhaps Apple (amongst other hi-tech companies) should consider relocating to Vancouver or Toronto? As a Canadian it sickens me that Americans like you think you can just hop across the border. You're not welcome here. We don't like people who abandon their countrymen when they disagree.

Trump has stated and clarified many times that during trade NEGOTIATIONS tariffs are ON THE TABLE to encourage WIN-WIN outcomes more so than the ONE WAY outcomes we have now. It was the policy of President Bill Clinton to enact GLOBALIZATION in order to export middle class lifestyles to communist and war ravaged countries like China, Vietnam, South Korea and others. It worked. It was never turned off or ramped down, and it resulted in WHOLESALE exportation of our manufacturing base to those countries and others like Mexico. Now to be fair those countries are now more civil, less warlike, and more interconnected with the world. Yes. However the cost to our domestic economy was two decades of wage stagnation and a long decline in GDP growth and money velocity. Check my links.

Chinese newspaper the Global Times, which has been accused of having a pro-government stance, has set out a short and sharp warning to Trump and other supporters of 45% tariffs imposed on Chinese goods and services entering the US; screw China and China will screw you harder. “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.” In short, tariff us and we will be tariffing you back hard and fast. The protectionist policy employed by Trump throughout the election campaign would appear to be more than a political soundbite to attract interest from citizens consumed by national pride or those who have found themselves unprepared for globalization and the emergence of the digital economy. Speaking during an interview with Bloomberg, Judy Shelton, economic advisor to President Elect Trump, indicated the policy would be taken forward: “He is someone going to carry through on what he says. He’s always very straight-forward and honest. I expect him to be consistent.” Let’s assume the Chinese market isn’t crucial for the growth of American businesses for the moment, Trump is not necessarily stopping with the Chinese, they have just felt the sharpest end of the stick. A 35% tariff has been proposed for other nations also. Like the Chinese, Korea, India, Japan, the EU, the UK, etc. are unlikely to take these tariffs lying down should the situation arise. Trump must have immense confidence in the strength of the US domestic market if it is to replace trade potential lost to these nations through tariffs. Risk to technology industry One of the biggest risks will be for the technology industry, not so much on the consumer side of things however. Sure, iPhone sales may suffer for a lack of international opportunity, however tariffs placed on foreign businesses could create a gap in the market for new US brands to enter the fold. Just because wallets are being squeezed a bit at the moment doesn’t mean the millennials are going to go that long without replacing their smartphones. The risk here will be undertaken by companies like Dell Technologies, VMWare, Intel, IBM etc. who are only looking internationally for growth. The US market is stagnant; new projects and customers are coming from the likes of China, India, South America and Eastern Europe, the very countries Trump is sizing up for a trade war. The US has a lot more to lose than the rest of the world. In a list of the top 20 US exporters for 2015, Apple, Qualcomm, Intel and Cisco Systems represent the technology world; only Oil & Gas has a higher number of representatives. Electronic equipment also represented $163.1 billion of outgoing international trade, an increase of 36.9% since 2011, and 11.3% of the total export of US industry last year. Risk to the Rest of the World Aside from the obvious risk to the US economy, China Topix points out there could be a significant risk to numerous other nations, as well as the possibility of a worldwide recession should a trade war escalate. A slowdown in China could see the country spending less internationally. The immediate ripples would be felt in countries like South Korea, Japan, and Brazil, where China is the biggest market for exports. Ripples would be felt further and it would only be a matter of time before they hit the US again. Trump could reverse years of progress achieved through free-trade and set into motion a downward spiral. It’s very doom and gloom, but a realistic possibility. “For many countries around the world, China is now the biggest trading partner, so this kind of tit-for-tat trade protectionism with China will dampen the atmosphere for the international trading community,” said Yorizumi Watanabe, Economics Professor at Japan’s Keio University. An escalating trade war is certainly a long-way off however it is becoming a distinct possibility. Before Trump angers the rest of the world, he and his administration would have to negotiate around other politicians, as well as an army of lobbyists who are unlikely to be thrilled by such an idea as pissing off the Chinese. All-in-all, protectionism is a simple policy to attract interest from some of the more short-sighted demographics in the electorate. If the US policy continues down this route it’s unlikely to be good news for anyone. Despite it being a long way off and there being significant hurdles in the way, if there was one person who is determined enough to do it, America has found him.

This completely misses the psyche of those voting Trump. They are the ones who have seen jobs exported abroad to cheap, unregulated countries in the Global corporations pursuit of ever increasing profits. These are the people who’s wealth has been stolen by the Financial industry and those at the top of the corporation ladder, paying themselves ever greater salaries for “performance” figures that are just about how many American workers they have fired. This is a disgraceful attemot to paint those frustrated and disenchanted men and women as some form of ill prepared or digitally illiterate class. Those working in the lower echelons of the various tech savvy companies do not fare that well with salaries in America but at least they have jobs. Your view that somehow this band of Technically literate millenials are embracing a successful future is rubbish. As with those in the many industries that have grown and then fallen, once their labour costs get too much, the corporations will simply offshore them using free trade agreements dreamt up by lobbyists working for corporate heads. Jamie Davies 14/11/2016 @ 2:21 pm Reply Hi Peter Western societies have shifted towards a service-driven economy with the majority of schools and training programmes built around working the same service-driven economy, so it should come as little surprise manufacturing jobs are being outsourced to countries where these skills are much cheaper. You have a valid point and there are disenfranchised populations in Western societies, however the point of the article is that protectionism will not lead to any positive outcomes for anyone involved. It sounds like you are pro-protectionism/anti-globalisation – do you think the corporations should be banned from outsourcing labour to cheaper international markets? The downside would be a more expensive product which would mean the organization is less competitive globally, ultimately limiting the potential of the organization in the long-run. Would be good to hear you thoughts Thanks Jamie Kenneth Hoyt 15/11/2016 @ 2:55 am Reply Excuse me, you are jumping the gun by 170 days. Trump is more than 2 months from inauguration. Then come his first 100 days. There is so much that will occur before he meets Mr Xi somewhere in the world. Please take a deep breath. Stop recycling the same old anti/Trump speculation. Start by watching for the coming surpises. Elections do have consequences as Barrack once reminded us all. Scott Bicheno 15/11/2016 @ 10:11 am Reply Thanks Kenneth, so does that mean we’re not allowed to commentate in the meantime?

Donald Trump’s 45% Tariff on China Exports Could Backfire Against the iPhone GO Communist party-backed Chinese newspaper warns that an import tariff imposed by the US could have serious consequences Nov 14, 2016 12:29 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  One of the promises made by president-elect Donald Trump during the presidential race was a 45 percent import tariff on Chinese products, as he wanted US companies to rely more on local workforce and less on overseas production. And now that Trump has been elected President, China warns that should the large import tariff go through, it can have serious consequences on the country’s relationship with China. An article published in the Global Times, a Communist party-backed newspaper, names the iPhone as one of the products that would be hurt if Donald Trump goes forward with his plan for the hefty tax on Chinese imports. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” the article reads, according to CNBC. How exactly the iPhone can “suffer a setback” is not yet known, but US companies could in their turn be forced to pay additional taxes, with Apple likely to suffer a major hit given the fact that it sources many of its parts from China. The article warns that China is ready to go for a “tit-for-tat” strategy with the United States, emphasizing that any US decision that affects the relationship with the country will be followed by a similar one from the Beijing government. “Trump won’t do that” The Chinese newspaper, which evokes the thoughts of the Communist party leaders, points out that Donald Trump is unlikely to propose the 45 percent tariff, as it believes that it was only a political move during the presidential campaign. “The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president,” the Global Times pointed out. Apple itself is already experiencing difficulties in doing business in China, partly because of the relationship with the Beijing government. Earlier this year, it was revealed that China wanted access to iOS source code, a demand that Apple quickly rejected, as the company pledged to protect users and refuse to collaborate with authorities on any efforts that could affect security. In April, Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks stores were banned all of a sudden for a reason that was not disclosed, while in May, the Chinese government started an investigation against the firm over unnamed security concerns. #Apple#China#Donald Trump#iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Trump Edition Gold-Plated iPhone 7 Up for Grabs for $3,000 Apple’s CEO on Trump Elected President of the US: It’s OK to Be Disappointed How Much Does an iPhone 7 Really Cost?

November 14 AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 China says iPhone sales ‘will suffer’ if Trump goes ahead with threatened trade war Ben Lovejoy - 2 days ago @benlovejoy Apple china Trump Apple Store, Shanghai View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Chinese government, through the state-run Global Times newspaper, has said that iPhone sales ‘will suffer’ if president-elect Trump follows through on his threatened trade war when he takes office. The comment was made in response to Trump’s campaign promise to apply 45% tariffs to Chinese imports. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-US trade will be paralyzed. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback […] The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. The Global Times editorial also claimed that Trump would not in any case have the authority needed to apply the 45% tariff … To impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China is merely campaign rhetoric. The greatest authority a US president has is to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days on all imported goods and the limit can only be broken on the condition that the country is declared to be in a state of emergency. Other than that, a US president can only demand a tariff increase on individual commodities. The piece appears to be pitched directly to Trump, stating that ‘a shrewd businessman will not be so naïve’ and even suggesting that ‘the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president.’ The Guardian reports that it is not just the Chinese who are hoping that the trade war threat was just empty talk. Paul Haenle, a veteran US diplomat who is director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua centre at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, warned the introduction of protectionist measures would immediately “inject friction” into already fraught US-China ties as well as harming America’s own economy. “If he follows through on a 45% trade tariff then I think it will be damaging to our own interests and we will have fallout that will affect our own companies and our own economy and it won’t be effective. It will not achieve what he is setting out to achieve. So from that standpoint he is going to have to moderate some of that rhetoric as he puts together actual concrete policies.” China is a hugely important market to Apple. A weak Chinese economy mean that predictions of China overtaking the USA as Apple’s largest market haven’t yet come to pass, but it has already happened on the software side. Apple has been working on developing ever-closer ties with China, with not just one but two R&D centers in the works. Also on the campaign rhetoric front, Trump claimed back in January that he would get Apple to start building ‘their damn computers and things’ in the U.S. rather than China. The editorial didn’t trouble itself with addressing this.

(CARLO ALLEGRI/REUTERS) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks on stage during a campaign event in Dimondale, Michigan, U.S., August 19, 2016. (CARLO ALLEGRI/REUTERS) KONRAD YAKABUSKI Gone for good: Why Trump’s jobs promise will fall flat Add to ... Konrad Yakabuski The Globe and Mail Published Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016 4:11PM EST Last updated Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016 6:18PM EST Comments Print / License AA So much for the new economy. Donald Trump’s path to the White House ran through a handful of old economy states whose voters are presumably now counting on the Republican president-elect to bring back all those auto, steel and coal-mining jobs that once powered their region. What are the odds of that? During the campaign, Mr. Trump identified the North American free-trade agreement as the main source of the Rust Belt ills. This struck a chord with working-class voters in Michigan, a state that hadn’t voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988, and which strongly backed President Barack Obama (who presided over the 2009 auto bailouts) in 2012 over native son (and auto-industry antagonist) Mitt Romney. Of all the economic challenges facing the Rust Belt, however, free trade may be the least threatening. Today, manufacturing accounts for 8 per cent of U.S. employment, compared to a quarter of all jobs in the 1960s. Factory output continues to increase, but manufacturing employment, at about 12.3 million in October, does not. For every manufacturing job lost to trade in recent years, eight have been lost to automation. At least free trade produces additional jobs in export-competitive sectors. Mr. Trump can’t unwind the robot trend any more than he can reverse the geographical shift of U.S. manufacturing from Rust Belt states to southern ones with friendlier (for business) tax and labour laws. From Boeing to BMW, corporations have displayed a net preference for building greenfield factories in the South. To make their states more competitive, Republican governors in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin have focused on cutting taxes, not renegotiating trade deals. They’ve claimed some success, boasting lower-than-average unemployment rates. Mr. Trump has vowed to renegotiate NAFTA, failing which he would scrap it and slap tariffs of as much as 35 per cent on Mexican goods entering the United States. Since NAFTA trade is bi- or tri-directional, increasingly so given the role of continental supply chains in North American manufacturing, this would whack U.S. exports as hard as it would imports. It would also raise prices for everything from cars to air conditioners, hurting American consumers. Similarly, the 45-per-cent tariffs that Mr. Trump has threatened to slap on Chinese goods, especially steel, would hurt low-income Americans most without repatriating many jobs. Employment would shift to other Asian countries. But such a move would be tantamount to kicking China when it’s down, throwing an economy already plagued by slowing growth and overcapacity into a tailspin that sucks the rest of the globe down the tubes with it. Besides, Pittsburgh will never again be the hub of the global steel industry. Nor would it want to be, having bet on more lucrative (and cleaner) technology and health-care jobs. It will take years to absorb the global steel glut, with more than 700 million tonnes of current excess capacity swishing around. Mr. Trump promises to end the “war on coal” waged by Mr. Obama, who has proposed strict regulations to limit coal-based electricity production – mind you, their implementation has been held up by the courts. The market, not Mr. Obama, is responsible for the U.S. coal industry’s decline, as cheaper natural gas displaces coal in power production. U.S. coal output slumped 10 per cent in 2015 and was down 20 per cent in the first 10 months of 2016. At 66,000, there are fewer U.S. coal mining jobs now than at any time since the Energy Information Administration began keeping employment records in 1978. This trend will accelerate if Mr. Trump carries through with his promise to ease fracking regulations, a move that is only likely to increase the cost advantage of natural gas over coal. Mr. Trump might extend the life of a few coal plants by scrapping subsidies and other incentives for renewable energy – although even some Republicans in Congress might not be especially eager to grant him his wish. But it would take a lot more than that to make coal king again. Perhaps some of the voters who backed Mr. Trump know intuitively that he can’t bring back those old economy jobs. Perhaps they’re just happy to see a politician give ‘em hell for a change, even if they recognize much of it as bluster. Unlike the news media, they don’t get hung up on the details. “The press takes [Mr. Trump] literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally,” the Atlantic’s Salena Zito wrote insightfully in September. So maybe it doesn’t matter to those supporters whether Mr. Trump can actually bring back the jobs. All they care about is that they’ve found a politician who takes them seriously. Maybe even literally, too.

During his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a "tit-for-tat approach", according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read. Apple has not responded to CNBC's request for comment. Thomas Peter | Reuters A man holds his new iPhone 7 at an Apple store in Beijing, China. But the Chinese newspaper was not convinced Trump would go through with his suggestion, calling it "merely campaign rhetoric" and questioning its legal validity. U.S. law dictates that presidents can only impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days on all imports. Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding. As an example of earlier tariff-tit-for-tats, the Global Times pointed toward the 35 percent tariffs imposed in 2009 on Chinese tires. China retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. car parts and chicken. "Both China and the U.S. suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed," theGlobal Times said. The opinion piece said Trump was a "shrewd businessman" and would not be naive, but, if he was serious with the policy, it would affect a number of U.S. industries. "The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president," the Global Times wrote. America's relationship with China is in focus after Trump slammed the world's second-largest economy during his campaign. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump spoke over the phone on Sunday. "During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward," a statement from Trump's presidential transition team said.

In Dubai, boards displaying the President-elect’s name and his support for a DAMAC project to build a gated community, spa and Trump-branded golf course can be seen from a road on the edge of the city. Gulf business links with Trump and other US firms are strong. The United States imported $32.4 billion of goods including oil from the six Gulf countries in 2015 and the region is the most important client base for Boeing and a number of US defence firms. The Gulf’s sovereign wealth funds also have hundreds of billions of dollars of US investments. Nevertheless, Arab business figures were angry about Trump’s campaign calls for Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, following the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by a Muslim couple in December 2015. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, head of investment firm Kingdom Holding which has stakes in US firms including Citigroup and Twitter, called him a “disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America”. However, the billionaire was among those wishing him well on Wednesday, tweeting: “President elect @realDonaldTrump whatever the past differences, America has spoken, congratulations & best wishes for your presidency.” Another billionaire businessman, Khalaf al Habtoor, who worked with Trump on a construction project that was halted in 2008, wrote an op-ed in a local newspaper in August last year backing Trump for the presidency. But Habtoor backtracked after Trump’s Muslim comments and said Gulf money would quit the US if he won. Speaking to Arabian Business on Wednesday, Habtoor insisted Trump’s comments on Muslims “were for the election only” and he would now tone down his rhetoric, something that would open the door to re-establishing good relations with the Gulf. FAIR COMPETITOR Some Gulf firms reassessed their links with Trump at the end of last year: DAMAC temporarily removed references to his name from advertising, and regional retailer Landmark Group pulled a Trump-branded line of homeware from its Lifestyle chain of department stores. But a spokeswoman for DAMAC on Thursday that Trump-linked projects still carried his name. Landmark Group declined to comment. Mohammed al Ardhi, Executive Chairman of alternative investment firm Investcorp, which has billions of dollars in US real estate and other investments, was complementary about Trump. “Investcorp knows that Trump is fair because we competed against him on the Tiffany acquisition and he did not mind us winning that deal,” Ardhi told an investor event on Wednesday, referring to its 1984 purchase of the New York jewellery firm. Gulf sovereign wealth funds have invested huge sums of cash into the American economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has the largest geographical weighting for its estimated-$792 billion portfolio in North America at between 35 and 50 per cent. It owns significant amounts of real estate for example, including a number of high-end hotels in major US cities. The Qatar Investment Authority said in September 2015 it would help the Gulf state invest $35 billion in the US over five years. UNCERTAINTY FOR AIRLINES Gulf airlines are waiting to see where Trump stands on a disagreement with US carriers. A group including American Airlines and United Airlines say United Arab Emirates-based Emirates and Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, have unfairly benefited from state subsidies, and have called for a review of the Open Skies trade agreement with those countries. Some Gulf airline executives had previously expressed concerns that Trump could favour US interests at the expense of the rest of the global aviation industry. “It’s so important for our business that the liberalization that spreads through from the Clinton era of politics on global trade continues,” Emirates President Tim Clark told reporters in Dubai on October 18, adding Trump “may go about the introduction of more constraints on global trade”. A spokeswoman for Emirates and spokesman for Etihad Airways declined to comment on the election result. However, Qatar Airways’ Group Chief Executive Akbar al Baker, who voiced support for Trump even after his comments about Muslims, welcomed his victory. “Our relationship goes way back, and I was one of the first to commend Donald on his well-deserved new leadership position,” he said in a statement. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Companies drilling black gold go a little green With Trump, focus may drift back to Fed, inflation → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Oman welcomes Yemen ceasefire HM receives greetings from Fahd Higher Committee for Conferences meets Kerry concludes oman visit Read More ...

In an editorial published on Sunday, the Global Times said it would be "naive" for Trump to follow through on his campaign promises to implement a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the US and to declare the country a currency manipulator. Trump repeatedly targeted China during his presidential campaign, vowing to take a tougher stance on trade in the hopes of reviving manufacturing in the US. In its editorial, the Global Times dismissed the notion that Trump alone could implement a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports, though it warned that any protectionist measure could leave trade "paralyzed." "China will take a tit-for-tat approach." "China will take a tit-for-tat approach then," the editorial reads. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US." As president, Trump would be able to implement tariffs on specific goods, though he can impose a tariff of no more than 15 percent on all goods — and only for 150 days — unless a state of emergency is declared. Trump has dismissed concerns from economists and policymakers over a potential trade war with China, the country's biggest trading partner, saying at a June rally: "We already have a trade war. And we’re losing, badly." As with many of his other campaign promises, it's unclear whether the president-elect will be as aggressive against China when he gets to office. In its editorial, the Global Times said that "as a shrewd businessman," Trump "will not be so naïve." "If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired," the paper said. "Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences." Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with Trump on a phone call Monday, telling the president-elect that "cooperation is the only correct choice for China and the United States," according to state-run media. The two men agreed to maintain close communication and meet "at an early date," Chinese media reported.

Political ties between the United States and the Gulf, in particular Saudi Arabia, have been strained by President Barack Obama's pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran, which has led to opinions that America has abandoned its long-term allies in favour of their regional rival. Relations were also damaged by the US Congress's approval in September of legislation which paves the way for families of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attack to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, whose citizens accounted for 15 of the 19 hijackers.

Photo: Reuters/Mike Segar/File Photo Reuters, San Francisco Apple's (AAPL.O) stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O), selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's .SPX 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of "tit-for-tat" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. "A batch of Boeing (BA.N) orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted," the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term.

After all, the Jamaican Government has demonstrated that it can maintain fiscal discipline, a particularly difficult achievement given Jamaica’s harsh economic climate that has had a severe impact on social conditions. The IMF announced on Friday that under the new stand-by arrangement Jamaica will have access to about US$1.64 billion. However, the Government has indicated that it will not draw on the arrangement “unless exogenous shocks generate an actual balance of payments need”. The executive board approval, the IMF pointed out, “will make about US$411.9 million (SDR 300.1 million) immediately available, and the remainder in six tranches upon completion of semi-annual programme reviews”. As we pointed out in this space a few weeks ago, in addition to maintaining fiscal discipline, this new agreement will seek to achieve the long-awaited public sector transformation, while focusing new expenditure on infrastructure, social protection and security. Other objectives include keeping inflation low, bolstering the resilience of the financial system, and tax reform. We have already discussed those objectives and the challenges the country will face in achieving them. While we accept that the task is difficult, we are encouraged by the measures being taken by the Government, particularly in the area of stimulating economic growth. For instance, the shift from direct to indirect taxation, which the IMF describes as “growth-friendly”, is most commendable because it will , as the fund so correctly noted, improve efficiency in the tax system and widen the tax base. Maintaining fiscal discipline, we accept, is good and vital, but, as we have seen in the recent past, holding the fiscal reins tight will not, by itself, improve conditions in the country. It must be accompanied by policies that spur economic growth that will, in turn, reduce debt. We have repeatedly used this space to highlight a number of initiatives in the United States that have encouraged businesses to invest and contribute to economic growth in that country. Among them was the case of Washington State, which competed intensely with more than 20 other states, offering a range of tax incentives to ensure that aircraft manufacturer Boeing kept its 777X assembly plant there. Essentially, Boeing was offered nearly US$9 billion in tax breaks as the Washington State authorities calculated that keeping the 777X plant there would result in US$21.3 billion in tax revenue for 15 years, based on a total of approximately 57,000 jobs. We also cited the case of New Jersey convincing Forbes magazine to move 350 jobs from New York with an offer of US$21.1 million in tax incentives over 10 years. The New Jersey Economic Development Agency had calculated that Forbes ’ move would result in a net estimated benefit to the state of US$72 million over 20 years. There are examples in the Caribbean of forward-thinking governments offering incentives to investors that have been mutually beneficial. As we have clearly stated before, we don’t expect the Jamaican Government to give away the country, but it needs to be bold in making these kinds of deals, as long as it is convinced they will redound to Jamaica’s benefit.

Employees are demanding fair healthcare as UPS cut benefits amid revenue growth and far reaching expansion plans. “In total, 80 percent, 950 of the company’s 1,200 maintenance employees, participated in the strike vote, and 98 percent of those workers voted in favor of a strike,” Teamsters Local 2727, a union representing UPS workers, said Monday.  With a reputation of being among the world’s leading delivery companies, United Parcel Service Inc’s success in shipping essentially lies in the hands of mechanics who maintain hundreds of its aircraft daily, working “sometimes up to 39 hours straight.” This holiday shopping season alone, the company is expected to ship some 700 million packages worldwide. ‘False charges’: Case against FedEx over drug trafficking dismissed https://t.co/cBiwuieIImpic.twitter.com/kDG5hozR1n— RT (@RT_com) June 18, 2016 It has been three years of negotiations between the Teamsters and UPS over its massive reductions in healthcare and benefits for retirees, who dedicated most of their time working for the company. “UPS aircraft mechanics and other maintenance workers do physically demanding and often dangerous work around jet engine aircrafts and equipment and toxic chemicals and exhaust,” the Teamsters said. Yet UPS wants a price tag of more than $19,000 on health coverage for a retiree and his or her dependent in the first year and increase that each year thereafter, according to the union. While cutting benefits, UPS has been adding to its revenue, in the third quarter earning $14.9 billion, up 4.9 percent over the same period of time in 2015. In late October, UPS also sealed a $5.3 billion multi-plane deal with Boeing, placing an order for 14 jumbo aircraft between 2017 and 2020. “We’re glad that UPS can afford to invest in beefing up its international fleet,” said Jim Kelley, a 29-year aircraft mechanic at UPS’s Louisville, Ky. gateway. “But if UPS can afford major capital investments and huge raises for top brass, then UPS can also choose to invest in the maintenance workers who do strenuous and dangerous work every day to make its success possible.” However, while the workers might be eager to strike, they can’t proceed right away. First, under the Railway Labor Act, before going on a strike, unions must obtain an approval of a federal mediator. With the presidential transition just about to go into full swing, it is likely that the Teamsters will have to deal with President-elect Donald Trump, but not sooner than his inauguration on January 20. The president may have to appoint an emergency board that will decide on whether to grant that permission. The process also includes several 30-day cooling off periods. All of those requirements mean that it is very unlikely that the potential strike may land UPS in a shipping disaster amid holiday season. UPS has issued a statement also assuring that its service would not be affected by its workers’ overwhelming support for the strike. “It’s important to understand that the vote does not give Local 2727 the right to strike under US labor law,” the company said. “A strike is not possible unless authorized by the National Mediation Board. The vote is simply a routine show of solidarity common in many negotiations.” The company has stressed that it keeps negotiating “in good faith for a contract that is good for our employees, our customers and our company.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2016.

Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday’s election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company’s stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday’s election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500’s .SPX 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of “tit-for-tat” retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,” the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple’s September quarter, worse than the Americas’ 7 percent decline. Apple’s China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country’s weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump’s campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. “You just don’t just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,” Morgan said.

Germany's police forces and other 1st responders (which include only 9% of the European police officers and 1st responders) are forecast by 2020 to procure 22% of the continent's market for police and 1st responder's related goods and services. The European police forces challenges were best stated in March 2016 by Mr. E. Walter, Chairman of the German Federal Police (DPoIG): "Germany's police (is) the first and last line of defense and response to any terror attack; they're simply not equipped for the challenge. Where we are not prepared is with the policeman on the street; normally the first to confront terrorists. (For example) we need modern weapons. We need armed helmets against shooting by a Kalashnikov. We have very old weapons in the German police force. The machine guns are the machine pistol MP5 it is about 50 years old". Present European police agencies' capabilities simply can't meet Europe's Terror & Migration Crisis challenges. Following the Paris and Brussels terror attacks a major overhaul of the European police forces infrastructure and funding is already in progress. The "European Police Modernization & First Responders Markets – 2016-2020" report is the most comprehensive review of the market available today. It provides a detailed and reasoned roadmap of this growing market. The market is set to undergo a major transformation from 2016-2022 through the following drivers: The Paris and Brussels 2015-2016 terror attacks shook the European police agencies, governments and public unlike any other recent homegrown or ISIS-Da'esh-inspired terrorist attacks since they were complex and well-planned. Western Europe, the largest economy in the world with a 2015 GDP of approximately $22 trillion (vs. the U.S. $17.5 trillion), can invest "whatever it takes" in its police forces to protect its citizens from the looming risks of terrorism and immigration. The Western European police forces are ill equipped to counter 21st century terrorists who use cutting edge encrypted communication, conduct remarkable pre-attack intelligence by jihadists who have been trained by ISIS ex-Iraqi military officers on planning and conducting modern day guerrilla warfare, and use modern weapons. Europol estimates that up to 11,000 European jihadists (5000 in Western Europe and 6000 in Eastern Europe) have returned to Europe after obtaining combat experience on the battlefields of the Middle East. The European Police Office (EUROPOL) estimates that there are 4 million unregistered illegal firearms in the Balkans, and over 30,000 military-grade weapons from the former Yugoslavia in circulation in Western Europe. The Law Enforcement, Police modernization & 1st Responder industry faces a considerable challenge in seeking to provide the necessary solutions to current and future threats. At the same time, this challenge presents immense opportunities for the defense and security industries able to deliver effective functions, integrate systems and maximize security and productivity per $ invested. The EU and the rest of the European police & 1st responders' market for products and services are served by local defense and security companies. Even with a preference for locally manufactured products, foreign products can usually strongly compete on the basis of cost-performance. They do not encounter any EU direct trade barriers or quotas. Non-tariff, indirect trade barriers may be the approval process of dual use goods, which include many security market products. This report is a resource for executives with interests in the market. It has been explicitly customized for the security industry and other decision-makers in order to identify business opportunities, developing technologies, market trends and risks, as well as to benchmark business plans. Questions answered in this 185-page report + one* report include: What will the market size and trends be during 2016-2022? Which submarkets provide attractive business opportunities? Who are the decision-makers? What drives the police and 1st responder agencies to purchase products and services? What are the customers looking for? What are the technology & services trends? What is the market SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats)? What are the challenges to market penetration & growth? With 185 pages, 21 tables and 32 figures, the "European Police Modernization & First Responders Markets – 2016-2022" report covers 12 countries and regions and 3 revenue source submarkets, offering for each of them 2015 data and assessments, and 2016-2022 forecasts and analyses. * Customers who purchase a multi-readers license of the report will get the "Global Homeland Security & Public Safety Industry – 2016 Edition" report free of charge.

The Western European police forces are ill equipped to counter 21st century terrorists who use cutting edge encrypted communication, conduct remarkable pre-attack intelligence by jihadists who have been trained by ISIS ex-Iraqi military officers on planning and conducting modern day guerrilla warfare, and use modern weapons. Europol estimates that up to 11,000 European jihadists (5000 in Western Europe and 6000 in Eastern Europe) have returned to Europe after obtaining combat experience on the battlefields of the Middle East. The European Police Office (EUROPOL) estimates that there are 4 million unregistered illegal firearms in the Balkans, and over 30,000 military-grade weapons from the former Yugoslavia in circulation in Western Europe. The Law Enforcement, Police modernization & 1st Responder industry faces a considerable challenge in seeking to provide the necessary solutions to current and future threats. At the same time, this challenge presents immense opportunities for the defense and security industries able to deliver effective functions, integrate systems and maximize security and productivity per $ invested. The EU and the rest of the European police & 1st responders' market for products and services are served by local defense and security companies. Even with a preference for locally manufactured products, foreign products can usually strongly compete on the basis of cost-performance. They do not encounter any EU direct trade barriers or quotas. Non-tariff, indirect trade barriers may be the approval process of dual use goods, which include many security market products. This report is a resource for executives with interests in the market. It has been explicitly customized for the security industry and other decision-makers in order to identify business opportunities, developing technologies, market trends and risks, as well as to benchmark business plans.

Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of "tit-for-tat" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. "A batch of Boeing  orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted," the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. "You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements," Morgan said. - Reuters -   Add comment Name (required) E-mail (required, but will not display) Website Notify me of follow-up comments Refresh Send Cancel JComments News National News International News Business News Sports News Documentary Links CNN News BBC News AseanMedia Channel News Asia Others About Us Contact Us Feedback Copyright © 2016 RTB News Website.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Avcorp Announces 2016 Third Quarter Financial Results VANCOUVER, Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ – Avcorp Industries Inc. (TSX: AVP) (the “Company”, “Avcorp” or the “Avcorp Group”) today announced its financial results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. All amounts are in Canadian currency unless otherwise stated. Q3 Financial and Operational Highlights Revenue was $41.0 million, up 89.6% from $21.5 million for Q3 2015. Including costs incurred from the Hitco acquisition that have yet to be recovered, loss from operations was $17.9 million. In Q3 2015, loss from operations was $2.0 million. Awarded multiple production contracts from Boeing consisting of complex metal bond and multi-material structural assemblies. Secured a US$5 million loan facility for use as working capital purposes. Order backlog at September 30 was $640 million, up 62% from $395 million at June 30, 2016. Signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of British Columbia to explore the creation of a Learning Factory for Advanced Composites. Highlights Subsequent to Quarter End Signed a long-term production contract with the Aerospace Company of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (“FHI”), a tier-one supplier to major original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) of commercial and defence aircraft around the world. Announced a restructuring at the Gardena facility which will result in significant annual cost savings for the Company, net of anticipated severance costs of approximately $260,000. As a subsequent event, the Company has amended and extended its existing credit facility. CEO Commentary “Our third quarter was among our most active ever as marked by our revenue growth and the signing of a major contract award with one our longest-standing customers,” said Mr. Peter George “We are sustaining this momentum into Q4 with the signing of a long-term production contract with Fuji Heavy Industries and efforts to improve operational performance and utilization at our facilities.” Mr. George added, “Looking ahead, we will continue to strengthen our relationships with OEM aircraft manufacturers and their related Tier 1 suppliers through our ongoing efforts to expand our composite manufacturing capabilities. These efforts will run in parallel with initiatives to improve our profitability and market valuation.” Review of Financial Results During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 Avcorp Group revenues totalled $41.0 million as compared to $21.6 million in revenue for the same quarter in the previous year.  The December 18, 2015 acquisition of the US based composite Aerostructures division of Hitco, a subsidiary of Frankfurt-listed SGL has added $26.0 million to current quarter revenues. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Avcorp Group recorded a loss from operations of $17,861,000, which includes costs incurred and yet to be recovered under the Hitco acquisition agreement, on $41.0 million in revenue; as compared to a $2.0 million operating loss on $21.6 million in revenue for the same quarter in the previous year.  Pre-Hitco acquisition operational events although indemnified under a service agreement and asset purchase agreement with Hitco and SGL, and on which Avcorp was required to assist, further adversely impacted operations and caused excessive personnel costs, and administrative and legal expenditures at ACF Avcorp’s Gardena facility during the third quarter. These costs have yet to be recovered and are included in all the costs for 2016. The Company has taken decisive steps towards reducing costs at its Gardena facility by way of issuing 60 day WARN notifications on October 24, 2016, as part of a restructuring initiative at its Gardena California facility that will result in a workforce reduction of 75 permanent employees by December 31, 2016.  This reduction is in addition to exiting 180 temporary workers during the last 90 days, which were added this year to support customers’ requirements arising from legacy product issues. Over the course of 2016 and into the first part of 2017 certain of the smaller loss making contracts, assumed with the Hitco acquisition, are being wound down thereby eliminating the associated losses.  What will be the remaining significant loss making contract has been the focus of a comprehensive Company initiative within which management has commenced discussions and planning with a major customer which would provide for an orderly and protected transition of this significant loss making contract from Avcorp’s Gardena facility. Contract revisions are in process which will ultimately improve Avcorp’s financial performance. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of changes in non-cash working capital, utilized $17.4 million of cash as compared to utilizing $0.4 million of cash during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Cash flows from operating activities were most significantly impacted as a result of operating losses incurred from the integration and productionization costs expended for the newly acquired Hitco operations, losses arising from unfavourable customer contracts assumed, and operational, administrative, and legal expenditures, incurred at Avcorp’s Gardena facility as a direct result of pre-Hitco acquisition operational events. The order backlog as at September 30, 2016 is $640.0 million, in consideration of attaining full award values; compared to $395.0 million as at June 30, 2016.  The primary factor underlying the change in order backlog is an approximately $277.0 million increase in order backlog due to increases in production rates, contract renewals for various existing programs, and new contract awards. The Company’s complete interim financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 can be found at www.avcorp.com or at www.sedar.com.

Nov 14, 2016, 19:59 ET Share this article VANCOUVER, Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Avcorp Industries Inc. (TSX: AVP) (the "Company", "Avcorp" or the "Avcorp Group") today announced its financial results for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. All amounts are in Canadian currency unless otherwise stated. Q3 Financial and Operational Highlights Revenue was $41.0 million, up 89.6% from $21.5 million for Q3 2015. Including costs incurred from the Hitco acquisition that have yet to be recovered, loss from operations was $17.9 million. In Q3 2015, loss from operations was $2.0 million. Awarded multiple production contracts from Boeing consisting of complex metal bond and multi-material structural assemblies. Secured a US$5 million loan facility for use as working capital purposes. Order backlog at September 30 was $640 million, up 62% from $395 million at June 30, 2016. Signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of British Columbia to explore the creation of a Learning Factory for Advanced Composites. Highlights Subsequent to Quarter End Signed a long-term production contract with the Aerospace Company of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. ("FHI"), a tier-one supplier to major original equipment manufacturers ("OEM") of commercial and defence aircraft around the world. Announced a restructuring at the Gardena facility which will result in significant annual cost savings for the Company, net of anticipated severance costs of approximately $260,000. As a subsequent event, the Company has amended and extended its existing credit facility. CEO Commentary "Our third quarter was among our most active ever as marked by our revenue growth and the signing of a major contract award with one our longest-standing customers," said Mr. Peter George "We are sustaining this momentum into Q4 with the signing of a long-term production contract with Fuji Heavy Industries and efforts to improve operational performance and utilization at our facilities." Mr. George added, "Looking ahead, we will continue to strengthen our relationships with OEM aircraft manufacturers and their related Tier 1 suppliers through our ongoing efforts to expand our composite manufacturing capabilities. These efforts will run in parallel with initiatives to improve our profitability and market valuation." Review of Financial Results During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 Avcorp Group revenues totalled $41.0 million as compared to $21.6 million in revenue for the same quarter in the previous year.  The December 18, 2015 acquisition of the US based composite Aerostructures division of Hitco, a subsidiary of Frankfurt-listed SGL has added $26.0 million to current quarter revenues. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Avcorp Group recorded a loss from operations of $17,861,000, which includes costs incurred and yet to be recovered under the Hitco acquisition agreement, on $41.0 million in revenue; as compared to a $2.0 million operating loss on $21.6 million in revenue for the same quarter in the previous year.  Pre-Hitco acquisition operational events although indemnified under a service agreement and asset purchase agreement with Hitco and SGL, and on which Avcorp was required to assist, further adversely impacted operations and caused excessive personnel costs, and administrative and legal expenditures at ACF Avcorp's Gardena facility during the third quarter. These costs have yet to be recovered and are included in all the costs for 2016. The Company has taken decisive steps towards reducing costs at its Gardena facility by way of issuing 60 day WARN notifications on October 24, 2016, as part of a restructuring initiative at its Gardena California facility that will result in a workforce reduction of 75 permanent employees by December 31, 2016.  This reduction is in addition to exiting 180 temporary workers during the last 90 days, which were added this year to support customers' requirements arising from legacy product issues. Over the course of 2016 and into the first part of 2017 certain of the smaller loss making contracts, assumed with the Hitco acquisition, are being wound down thereby eliminating the associated losses.  What will be the remaining significant loss making contract has been the focus of a comprehensive Company initiative within which management has commenced discussions and planning with a major customer which would provide for an orderly and protected transition of this significant loss making contract from Avcorp's Gardena facility. Contract revisions are in process which will ultimately improve Avcorp's financial performance. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of changes in non-cash working capital, utilized $17.4 million of cash as compared to utilizing $0.4 million of cash during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Cash flows from operating activities were most significantly impacted as a result of operating losses incurred from the integration and productionization costs expended for the newly acquired Hitco operations, losses arising from unfavourable customer contracts assumed, and operational, administrative, and legal expenditures, incurred at Avcorp's Gardena facility as a direct result of pre-Hitco acquisition operational events. The order backlog as at September 30, 2016 is $640.0 million, in consideration of attaining full award values; compared to $395.0 million as at June 30, 2016.  The primary factor underlying the change in order backlog is an approximately $277.0 million increase in order backlog due to increases in production rates, contract renewals for various existing programs, and new contract awards. The Company's complete interim financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 can be found at www.avcorp.com or at www.sedar.com.

In what analysts described as an early warning shot, Chinese state media suggested Beijing could slash imports of American goods -- including iPhones -- if the U.S. imposed steeper tariffs. "Large orders for Boeing planes would switch to Europe, U.S. auto sales in China would face setbacks, Apple phones would essentially be crowded out, and U.S. soybeans and corn would be eradicated from China," the Global Times wrote in an editorial. Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Trump on his election and said cooperation was the "only correct choice" for China and the U.S., the world's two biggest economies. "At present, there is an important opportunity and huge potential in China-U.S. cooperation," Xi told Trump, according to the reports.

On Tuesday, The Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on self-driving cars as apart of its Disruptors Series.  Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Texas), the chair of the subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade, is holding the hearing, which will be preceded by self driving car demos by Tesla Motors, BMW Group, and Audi of America, Inc. on Capitol Hill. ADVERTISEMENT "Members will explore the potential impact of self-driving cars on driver and roadway safety and how this emerging technology could improve mobility, increase vehicle efficiency, and create new opportunities including economic growth and transportation access for the disabled and underserved communities," according to a release. Congress is also set to have two tech hearings on Wednesday. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce will hold a meeting regarding last month's massive cyberattack against Dyn, a domain name system (DNS) provider.  The hearing will be jointly held by the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology chaired by Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade chaired Burgess. "Next week's hearing provides our members with an opportunity to learn more about the recent cyberattacks, how cyberattacks are evolving and what can be done to mitigate future attacks and risks," Walden and Burgess said.

TECH'S MESSAGE TO TRUMP: The Internet Association, a trade association representing major tech companies like Amazon, eBay and Google penned a letter to President-elect Donald TrumpDonald TrumpArmstrong Williams op-ed: Carson influential inside or outside of government Graham to Trump: Think 'long and hard' before nixing immigration program Overnight Healthcare: Insurers brace for ObamaCare upheaval | Carson won't join Trump Cabinet MORE Monday. The letter outlined suggestions that the tech industry has for the Trump administration when he takes office. The 12-page letter spanned policy recommendations on issues like STEM education, patent reform and encryption issues. Donald Trump has not addressed many tech policy issues yet, but when he has, he's taken positions unpopular with tech interests. COPYRIGHT OR COPYWRONG?: The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) and the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) voiced their concerns on internet service providers' responsibility for users who infringe copyright laws in an amicus brief today to the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The groups argued that Cox was wrongly held liable for not policing Internet content. The case involves Cox Communications, which was hit with a $25 million penalty, after a judge found it liable for illegal music downloads by its customers. "It is critical in a democracy that juries and our legal system correctly follow existing copyright law on secondary liability," CCIA President & CEO Ed Black said. "U.S. copyright law is balanced with liability protections for companies to respond quickly to infringement without resorting to policing all online sharing and commentary for copyright infringement. We value free speech and what it represents and it would be unwise to abandon that principle and balance for extremist copyright enforcement measures." TRADE WAR(NING): China will retaliate "tit-for-tat" if President-elect Donald Trump seeks to start a trade war, according to the Chinese Communist party-controlled newspaper, The Global Times. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus," the Global Times wrote. "US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted." Unsurprisingly, investors were not pleased by this. Traders unloaded Apple shares, causing the stock to fall by 2.5 percent, double the average S&P 500 loss on Monday. ON TAP: At 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday the Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing on self-driving cars. The event will be preceded by a self-driving car demo at 9:00 a.m. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Tech news was still happening while you thinking about the election. Fear not, here are some gems from it. Curious about what Obama regulations Trump could change? The Hill details 14 of them, including net neutrality. Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) made his debut as an Uber driver over the weekend. Facebook is denying a report they created a tool to stop fake news and then nixed it in fear of a conservative backlash. The company has faced substantial scrutiny in 2016 over fake news stories on their platform, conservative allegations of bias and liberal criticisms that they should have enforced hate speech policies on Donald Trump. Google is having fake news problems of its own. Searching "election results" on Monday showed users a story linking to incorrect election results favoring Trump. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told everyone how he really feels about whistleblower Edward Snowden. Spoiler: It's exactly what you think.  Tags Richard Blumenthal, Chuck Grassley, Patrick Leahy, Susan Collins, Donald Trump, Mark Warner, John Thune   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President-elect Donald Trump says he will forgo his $400,000 (£319,500) salary President-elect Donald Trump has announced he will give up his presidential salary of $400,000 (£319,500) and take just $1 a year. He revealed his plan to receive nominal pay during an interview with 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl on CBS News. Though he was unaware of how much a president made, Mr Trump said he thought he was required to take $1. After Ms Stahl told him it was $400,000, he said: "No, I'm not going to take the salary. I'm not taking it." The president-elect is following through on a promise he made while on the campaign trail. He told a crowd last September that salary was "not a big deal" for him. Have other leaders given up their annual salary? Mr Trump is not the first US leader to extend the symbolic gesture of forgoing a salary. Herbert Hoover, who made his fortune in mining before taking office, and John F Kennedy, who inherited his wealth, both gave up their salaries and donated them to charity. Image copyright PA Image caption JFK belonged to one of the 20th Century's most prominent US political dynasties Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney also gave up their executive pay for a buck. Mark Zuckerberg is Facebook's lowest-paid employee and among many billionaire CEOs earning $1 in pay. Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page have been taking a $1 salary for about a decade while Oracle's Larry Ellison took the same cut for several years while he was CEO. Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman also uses the same strategy. But it's worth noting these aforementioned business leaders received pay by other means, including equity stakes in their companies and other performance-based compensation. Jose Mujica: The world's poorest president How world leaders react to Trump's upset What do other international leaders make? In addition to the $400,000, the US president also has a tax-free expense account worth $50,000, according to a statute. By comparison, the Canadian Prime Minister took a salary of C$340,800 (£201,202) last year. German Chancellor Angela Merkel made $242,000 (£193,976) while French President Francois Hollande earned $198,700 (£158,000), according to a CNN Money report in August. Mr Hollande took a 30% pay cut when he assumed office in 2012. Image copyright Reuters Image caption UK PM Theresa May earns $186,119 (£143,462) The UK prime minister Theresa May earns $186,119 (£143,462) annually, although in the wake of the Brexit vote it has dropped in dollar worth. Former Prime Minister David Cameron faced sharp criticism for taking a 10% pay rise in 2015, but he said "the right thing to do is to be paid the rate for the job", adding that it "gives you the opportunity to do more in terms of charitable giving and things like that." When did the concept become popular? Though Apple founder Steve Jobs popularised the $1 salary concept in Silicon Valley after returning to the company's helm in 1997, business executives have sacrificed their salaries since WWI and WWII. Image copyright Justin Sullivan Image caption Apple founder Steve Jobs popularised the $1 a year salary The "dollar-a-year men" consisted of prominent executives, bankers and manufacturers who volunteered to serve in government roles to help the war effort during WWI. Since US law prohibits unpaid work, these leaders accepted a token salary of only $1 a year. The idea re-emerged during WWII, with executives hailing from such industry giants as Lockheed, Chrysler and Boeing stepping forward to serve their patriotic duty. Will Donald Trump have other sources of income? Yes, and some have already come under scrutiny. Mr Trump's financial arrangements have raised questions after he announced his three children - Donald Jr, Eric, and Ivanka - and Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner, were appointed to his transition committee. Mr Trump is not required to sell his assets, which are estimated in the billions, and has said he would leave his business empire in a blind trust managed by his children. However, the trust is arguably no longer blind, or under the control of an independent trustee, given that his children are involved his presidential transition. So far, Mr Trump has refused to release his taxes, and it is unclear if his holdings in foreign countries will impact on US relations or shape his policy, underscoring a host of potential conflicts of interest.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:20 AM, November 15, 2016 Updated: 6:50 AM, November 15, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO - Apple's <AAPL.O> stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Apple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com <AMZN.O>, Facebook <FB.O> and Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. In a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's <.SPX> 1.16 percent advance. Adding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of "tit-for-tat" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. "A batch of Boeing <BA.N> orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted," the op-ed said. China has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. Revenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. Apple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. Synovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. "You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements," Morgan said.

AirBaltic is the CS300 launch operator, with 20 of the 145-seat aircraft on order. Deliveries were delayed following challenges on the CSeries program. The Riga-based airline is expected to receive its first CS300 from Bombardier in early December, ahead of the commercial launch. AirBaltic operates 12 Boeing 737s and 12 Bombardier Q400s across 60 destinations, spanning Europe, Scandinavia, CIS and the Middle East.

(AAPL) Stock to the Core Beijing is making it clear that it will block iPhone sales if it has to -- the wrong news at the wrong time for AAPL stock By Dan Burrows, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Nov 14, 2016, 12:46 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 Bank of America Corp (BAC) Is an Even ‘Biglier’ Buy Under Trump Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Gaining Too Much Momentum to Ignore Recent Posts: Why GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Keeps Hitting Its Head on the Floor Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Could Have a Sluggish Year Ahead Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Needs a LOT More Than Activist Aid View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has enough problems with the iPhone. But a trade war with China would — ahem — trump them all. That’s why a recent editorial from a Chinese state-controlled newspaper is chilling if you’re invested in AAPL stock right now. Source: Yuanbin Du Via Flickr Global Times isn’t the most serious of newspapers in China, but it is influential, according to Financial Times. The nationalist tabloid has 15 million readers in print and online combined and counts itself as the third-largest news site in the country. Most troubling of all, it’s a government mouthpiece of sorts. From Financial Times: “The English-language edition has become a favored, if unofficial, platform for broadcasting Beijing’s version of events to an international audience, thanks to a bolder and more readable style than most other state media. That puts the paper at a historic high in terms of influence, [the editor claims].” So when this newspaper runs an editorial warning of the repercussions of a trade war, investors would do well to listen. On Monday, it recapped what happened last time the U.S. and China got into a trade spat and what would follow should it go this route again. From Global Times: “Not long after Barack Obama took office, US trade and commerce authorities announced a 35 percent import tariff on Chinese tires. In response, China took retaliatory steps of imposing tariffs on US chicken and automotive products. Both China and the US suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-US trade will be paralyzed. China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.” A New Risk for AAPL Stock None of these worries are new to investors in Apple stock. Shares in the company have been sliding since the election. Even if the new president is serious — and there’s reason to believe he is not — the office has limited control of trade policy. It could sting anyway.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, File) WASHINGTON - In a story Nov. 14 about President-elect Donald Trump's transition team, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Michael Meese is a former chief operating officer of American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association. He is currently the chief operating officer of the non-profit organization. A corrected version of the story is below: Trump's transition team signals return to GOP establishment President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is rich with lobbyists and includes a climate change-denier and an ex-federal prosecutor involved in the mass firings of U.S. attorneys By VIVIAN SALAMA Associated Press President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is rich with lobbyists and includes a climate change-denier and an ex-federal prosecutor involved in the mass firings of U.S. attorneys. Some of the individuals listed in an organizational chart of Trump's top transition personnel, obtained by The Associated Press: Defence AND NATIONAL SECURITY Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg has been working closely with Trump adviser and retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, advising the Trump campaign on matters relating to foreign policy and national security. He was chief operating officer of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, the interim governing body following the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. He previously worked as executive vice-president of research and technology for Virginia-based information technology firm CACI International, which works as a contractor for defence, intelligence and homeland security agencies. ___ Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has been named to the executive committee of Trump's transition committee. In the role, Nunes said he would help advise the president-elect on appointing individuals to Cabinet and other top positions in the next administration. ___ Retired Lt. Gen. Ron Burgess served in the Army for 38 years. He spent most of his tenure working in top military intelligence and security assignments. He was director of the Defence Intelligence Agency from 2009 until July 2012. In the fall, he lamented in a speech in Alexander City, Alabama, that new U.S. military recruits will likely be fighting in the Middle East for years to come. He wished current policymakers well and said, "We can't just keep playing this same military version of whack-a-mole." ___ Mira Ricardel has served as acting assistant secretary of defence for international security policy during the George W. Bush administration from 2003 to 2005. She is a former vice-president of business development for Boeing Strategic Missile & Defence Systems, a company that receives a steady flow of contracts from the Defence Department and is a major player in the defence industry. ___ Retired Brig. Gen. Michael Meese is among the individuals leading the transition for the Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2005, he served as executive director of the secretary of the Army's transition team. He is also the chief operating officer for the American Armed Forces Mutual Aid Association, a 136-year-old non-profit organization that assists the armed forces community with insurance, financial planning, survivor assistance and other benefits. ___ Mike Rogers is taking the lead on crafting Trump's national security team. The former Michigan congressman chaired the House intelligence committee. Rogers is a former U.S. Army officer and FBI special agent. He is a board member of IronNet Cybersecurity, a consultancy run by former NSA director Keith Alexander. STATE DEPARTMENT Jim Carafano is the Heritage Foundation's vice-president for foreign and defence policy studies and is tasked with transforming the State Department. A 25-year Army veteran, Carafano has been advising Trump on terrorism and border security. In a recent radio interview, Carafano said he told Trump that the next administration must pay more attention to transnational criminal cartels, work more closely with state and local governments to enforce border security, and fight al-Qaida globally. TREASURY DEPARTMENT David R. Malpass is the founder and president of Encima Global LLC, an economic research and consulting firm based in New York City. He served as deputy assistant treasury secretary under President Ronald Reagan and deputy assistant secretary of state under President George W. Bush. Malpass spent 15 years at Bear Stearns. In a 2007 Wall Street Journal editorial, published nine months before the collapse of his own firm, he wrote: "Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation. It's more likely the economy is sturdy and will grow solidly in coming months, and perhaps years." ___ Bill Walton is a senior fellow of the Center on Wealth, Poverty and Morality at the Discovery Institute and vice-president of the Council for National Policy. He is also chairman of Rush River Entertainment, which focuses on producing feature films. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT Kevin O'Connor served as U.S. attorney in Connecticut from 2002 to 2008, overseeing the office that secured a corruption guilty plea from ex-Gov. John Rowland. He served briefly as chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, a George W. Bush appointee who resigned from the Justice Department in 2007 amid a scandal over the firing of U.S. attorneys. After working as a partner at the Bracewell & Giuliani law firm, O'Connor is now managing director and general counsel for Point72 Asset Management, which manages the personal wealth of billionaire hedge fund executive Steven A. Cohen. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY Myron Ebell is the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Sometimes called a climate "denier-in-chief," he has long had ties to the fossil fuel industry. Ebell has called for abolition of the EPA and wants to scrap the Paris climate treaty, a deal Trump has vowed to withdraw from. Labour DEPARTMENT J. Steven Hart is a former Justice Department special assistant in charge of processing federal judicial nominations under President Ronald Reagan. He is the chairman of Williams & Jensen, a tax and business lobby group in Washington. His biography says he was named one of Washington's top lobbyists by Washingtonian magazine and The Hill newspaper. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Andrew Bremberg is a policy adviser and a member of the counsel on nominations for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A former policy director for the Republican presidential campaign of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Bremberg has also served as a chief of staff at the Office of Public Health and Science, Department of Health and Human Services, according to his LinkedIn profile. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT Shirley Ybarra previously served as Virginia's transportation secretary from 1998 to 2002, and was a senior policy adviser at the U.S. Department of Transportation under the George H.W. Bush administration. She is best known for her advocacy of "public-private partnerships" to raise money for major transportation infrastructure projects and she is a proponent of toll roads. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT Ray Washburne is a longtime Republican fundraiser and former finance chairman for the Republican National Committee. Based in Dallas, Washburne runs a boutique investment firm that owns shopping centres and a chain of Mexican restaurants. Before backing Trump, Washburne was the finance chief for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign. INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL REGULATORY AGENCIES Paul Atkins is an avowed opponent of regulating Wall Street and served as Securities and Exchange commissioner from 2002 and 2008. During that period, he backed lifting restrictions on leverage taken by investment banks, a move that some blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis. SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Michael Korbey was a senior adviser to the Social Security Administration under the tenure of President George W. Bush. He helped spearhead a public campaign to rally support behind privatizing Social Security. Before that, he worked for the lobbyist group United Seniors Association. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT Williamson (Bill) Evers was an adviser to U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings in 2007 under President George W. Bush. A fellow at the Hoover institution, Evers is a strong critic of the standardized curriculum known as "common core," which he has described as "undemocratic." AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Michael Torrey is a top Washington agriculture lobbyist and founder of Michael Torrey Associates. He served for one year as deputy chief of staff at the Agriculture Department under the George W. Bush administration and as a deputy assistant secretary of congressional relations at the department for a year prior to that. ___ Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann, Jeff Horwitz and Michael Biesecker contributed to this report.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       FILE - In this Aug. 17, 2016, file photo, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump participates in a roundtable discussion on national security in his offices in Trump Tower in New York, with Ret.

Will then President Trump adhere to promises that he made during the campaign or will he take a more measured approach to appease a larger slice of the American populace? But it’s not just those within the United States that are a little on edge; some nations around the world are concerned about the power that President Trump will wield. One of Trump’s frequent targets on the campaign trail was China. He relentlessly assailed the country and its trade practices, often in very unflattering terms. “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country and that’s what they’re doing. It’s the greatest theft in the history of the world,” said Trump in May. Trump even went so far as to say that China was manipulating its currency. When pressed to qualify his statement, he countered, “Frankly, as far as China's concerned, everyone knows that's true, and it gets the point across.” China’s state-run newspaper, the Global Times, has taken issue with Trump pledge to rein in China with respect to trade in an effort to revive the Unites States’ manufacturing business. In an editorial, the paper openly criticized the President-elect, stating that his currency manipulation accusations could mean that “China's reputation will be affected, and the trade atmosphere between China and the US will become more tense.” The proposed 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports is even greater than the 35 percent tariff that was enacted shortly after President Barack Obama first took office. That trade war didn’t last, however, after both countries found it mutually beneficial to call a truce. The paper goes on to state that China will be forced to cut off local sales of some of America’s hottest exports if these tariffs were to be enacted. In fact, China is willing to use the “nuclear option” with regards to trade. “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus,” writes the paper. “US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.” The Global Times doesn’t hold back, taking further swipes at the President-elect, stating that he is not “naive” and that as a “shrewd businessman” he should do what’s in the best interests of both countries. “If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired,” the paper continues. “The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences.” Those are some pretty harsh words for our incoming President, but perhaps we should take a wait and see approach on Trump’s trade policies.

Fuller The next helicopter in line for an Aurora Flight Sciences autonomy upgrade is the Bell Helicopter UH-1H Huey, the company said. The new Huey upgrade will include integration between the Autonomous Aerial Cargo Utility System (AACUS) program and its Tactical Autonomous Aerial Logistics System (TALOS). Demonstrations could be seen in the next year or two. Aurora demonstrated a manned Bell 206 performing an AACUS flight test Thursday in northern Virginia. The helicopter showed the perception and planning capabilities required for autonomous takeoff, transit and landing. Three piloted 206s were used previously to demonstrate TALOS, in addition to a Boeing H-6U Unmanned Little Bird. The Huey will be Aurora's third test platform frame. TALOS is being developed as a part of the Office of Naval Research’s AACUS program. However, Aurora is also researching commercial applications for TALOS.

During his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a “tit-for-tat approach”, according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” the Global Times article read.

My clients are "coastal elites" and "international elites." Most of us did not vote for Donald Trump last week, and none of us expected that he would actually win. I believe that Trump probably didn't think he'd win. For me, Election Day afternoon progressed from comfortable certainty about Hillary Clinton's chances, to concern around dinnertime, to disbelief by 11 p.m., to shock and horror by midnight. I went to bed at 2 a.m., woke up at 4 a.m. and arrived at my office by 6 a.m. to address what I knew would be a cascade of distraught phone calls and emails from my clients. Gabriel Bouys | AFP | Getty Images Here were some comments: "David, if you can call earlier than 8 a.m. tomorrow, please do so. Need to discuss liquidating first thing in the morning." "In the event my holdings are still worth a few coins, I'd like to touch base with you." "Please sell everything now. I'd rather miss further upside now than risk selling after an event that points to the long-term disaster that this administration could turn out to be." In times of stress — for example, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and after the failure of Lehman Brothers — one of the most important things a financial advisor can do is get out in front of the clients with information. To that point, advisors need to convey a plan. Here's what we know; here's what we don't know; here's what we're trying to figure out. For example, the team at my advisory firm had a bulletin out to our clients within 30 minutes of the Boston Marathon bombing a few years ago. We were proactive this time around, as well. Our commentary "Confounding All Expectations, Donald J. Trump Elected U.S. President" hit our clients' inboxes by 8 a.m. on November 9. More from FA Playbook: 6 ways Trump will affect your wallet Potential market impact of a Trump White House How Trump's tax plans might affect your return We then began returning clients' phone calls. Though we expected the markets to fall by 5 percent, perhaps even as much as 10 percent at the open, our counsel was: "There's no point in selling into this morning's decline. Ultimately, the stock market only cares about corporate revenues and earnings and interest rates. Just because we received bad news today doesn't mean that McDonald's stops flipping burgers, Pfizer stops researching medicine, Boeing stops building aircraft. Corporations will adapt to the unexpected new environment because that's what managers are paid to do." Our clients responded to our commentary. Here are some examples: "There go the paintings, silver and furniture. Thanks for the note. Feel somewhat better." "Well stated, David. A great perspective. I hope all is well." "Thank you, David. I needed your perspective today. Hugs, H." "THANK YOU FOR THIS!!!!! It is one of the few things that have made me feel better (at least for me, if not the country)." "Hi David, thanks for the comments, very interesting. You can tell others that one of your clients says 'the market goes up and down. The best strategy seems to be to buy companies which have value and where managers have a longer term view of their job. Good luck!' And BTW, I am also among the devastated!" "Buy into the hysteria! — Dave, wherever possible, please take advantage of this buying opportunity." "Our early morning commentary and rapid return of phone calls enabled us to calm clients to the point where we could make good decisions on their behalf." Unexpectedly, stocks rallied for two days straight. For every disappointed investor among the 60,467,245 Americans who voted for Clinton, there was an exhilarated investor among the 60,071,650 Americans who voted for Trump. There was another factor: For the last two months, U.S. stocks traded in a 1 percent to 2 percent range while investors waited for Election Day. Post-election, sidelined cash suddenly came back into stocks. Certainly, there is reason for concern over the next few years. Trump's proposed tax cuts, implemented without adjustment, would cause the national debt to soar 75 percent in four years. To implement such cuts, Trump has to earn the votes of debt crusaders like Paul Ryan, so it's not a foregone conclusion.

Privacy Policy. As we often tell clients, "It's always something." For the moment, we talked most of our clients out of precipitous selling and satisfied one by raising $100,000 in cash. Over the next several months, we'll see how Trump's transition team proceeds, get a sense of the Republican legislative agenda in 2017 and then, only after preparing an informed strategy, will we start selling and buying among our companies. Our early morning commentary and rapid return of phone calls enabled us to calm clients to the point where we could make good decisions on their behalf. Any advisor who can't do this for his or her clients shouldn't be in the business. — By David Edwards, founder/president of Heron Financial Group Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change MCD --- SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Microsoft, Apple and Google Aim to Extend Touch Technologies to a World of new Devices and Applications | Main | Samsung Aggressively Gets into Apple's Face with Moves into AI and Telematics with Harman Acquisition » November 14, 2016 Chinese State Publication Warns President Elect Trump that any Tariffs on Chinese Goods Would be bad News for Apple   Last week Patently Apple posted a report titled "Chinese Cyber Security Law goes into Effect in June 2017 that may Require Apple to surrender iOS Source Code." The report noted that "China has green-lit a sweeping and controversial law that may grant Beijing unprecedented access to foreign companies' technology and hamstring their operations in the world's second-largest economy." So unilaterally China appears to be threatening U.S. tech companies by such new legislation. With President Elect Trump wanting to push back against China's monetary manipulation and unfair trade practices, a Chinese state publication sent a message out to President-Elect Trump that they have the cards to hurt the U.S. in any trade war.   The fear mongering rhetoric has already kicked into high gear this morning in China as a State-backed newspaper decided to do a little saber rattling of their own towards President Elect-Trump. CNBC reports that the publication has clearly stated that "Apple iPhones and other U.S. goods could suffer sales hits in China if president-elect Donald Trump goes through with his 'naïve' plan of slapping a large import tariff on Chinese products." So it appears that China will use Apple as a bargaining chip in any negotiations with Trump.   During his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a "tit-for-tat approach", according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party.   "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read.   But the Chinese newspaper was not convinced Trump would go through with his suggestion, calling it "merely campaign rhetoric" and questioning its legal validity. U.S. law dictates that presidents can only impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days on all imports,   The report further noted that "If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed," the Global Times said.   Lastly the CNBC report stated that "The opinion piece said Trump was a 'shrewd businessman' and would not be naïve, but, if he was serious with the policy, it would affect a number of U.S. industries."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

So who are they? Bannon’s appointment caused concern: his website has been charged with carrying racist, antisemitic and sexist stories and peddling conspiracy theories. He was also accused by his ex-wife of making antisemitic remarks, faced domestic violence charges that were dropped and was found to have been registered to vote in Florida at an empty house where he did not live, though he subsequently changed his registration. He and Priebus were said to be working as “equal partners”. Reince Priebus and Stephen Bannon to lead Trump’s White House Trump talks deportation, supreme court picks Trump made a number of policy suggestions in an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, and also admitted that his promised wall on the border with Mexico will partially consist of fencing. He plans to deport as many as three million people, which seems at odds with statements made by House speaker Paul Ryan. Trump also said he wants to appoint supreme court justices who will send abortion rights “back to the states”, but said same-sex marriage was “done”.

Donald Trump’s immigration plans: start by deporting 3 million ‘criminals’ Facebook Twitter Pinterest 3 million ‘criminal’ immigrants to be deported, says Donald Trump Advocates worry for gun restrictions Advocates say they expect Congress to pass a federal right-to-carry law that would dismantle restrictions in states including New York, New Jersey, Maryland, California and Hawaii. Trump has endorsed a reciprocity law that would make concealed carry permits valid in all 50 states. Gun control groups call this “a threat to public safety”. Gun rights advocates say it would be a victory for civil rights. Local gun-carrying restrictions may be wiped out under Trump, advocates say Labor movement braces for three-front battle The labor movement fears that Trump, the Republican-controlled Congress and the supreme court will take steps to hobble unions, ranging from appointing a National Labor Relations Board that does business’s bidding to erasing an array of Obama administration regulations, including one making overtime pay available to millions more workers. Labor movement braces for three-front battle with Trump, Congress and courts Will Obama’s criminal justice reform progress survive? Barack Obama’s presidency has seen issues with the US criminal justice system gain national media attention and his administration has looked to address the problem. Jamiles Lartey considers the progress made and the limitations of Obama’s actions. Many of the president’s executive actions could be undone by Trump, whose campaign was openly hostile to progressive criminal justice reform. Obama made progress on criminal justice reform.

By: FE Online | Updated: November 14, 2016 6:19 PM During his campaign for presidential elections, Donald Trump had continuously lashed out at China saying that Beijing will be punished with ‘defensive’ 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and officially declared a currency manipulator.(Reuters) China’s state-run newspaper has said that if ‘naive fool’ Donald Trump launches an all-out trade war against China, it would reply with counter-measures. During his campaign for presidential elections, Trump had continuously lashed out at China saying that Beijing will be punished with ‘defensive’ 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports and officially declared a currency manipulator. President-elect Trump had then said,”When they see that they will stop the cheating. He accused China of doing ‘the greatest theft in the history of the world.’ An editorial came in a state-run newspaper right after Trump spoke to Chinese president Xi Jinping. Global Times, a State-run newspaper warned the US that it would be a grave mistake to take such measures. It said that such a move by a ‘shrewd businessman’, to change tariffs will be replied with a tit-for-tat approach. The newspaper wrote, “If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired. Finally, the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence. The paper added, “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US. Making things difficult for China politically will do him no good.” The newspaper wrote, “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.” Also read | Why Modi’s India & Xi’s China have best growth stories and will be the driver of world economy Meanwhile, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang had reportedly said, “I believe that any US politician if he takes the interests of his own people first, will adopt a policy that is conducive to the economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases United Airlines Further Improves Airport Security Experience with the Opening of Automated Screening Lanes at Chicago O’Hare “As the first and only U.S.-based airline to launch automated screening lanes in multiple airports, United continues its commitment to using the latest technology to meet the changing needs of our customers and improve the airport experience,” said Greg Hart, United’s executive vice president and chief operations officer. “We are very appreciative of the ongoing collaboration between TSA and our industry partners such as United,” said TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger. “Working together in our efforts to deploy effective, state-of-the-art technologies such as these automated lanes in Terminal 1 at O’Hare furthers TSA’s ability to fulfill its security mission while also enhancing the travel experience.” “Establishing these automated screening lanes at TSA checkpoints is an important part of sustaining the success we achieved since last spring,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “We’ve gone from an unacceptable 104 minute wait time at peak hours at O’Hare to some of the shortest in the country among major airports. With the will, and the right technology, we will continue this progress. And I want to thank United Airlines for opening the latest automated screening lanes here at O’Hare.” The opening of the newly redesigned security checkpoint and three automated screening lanes at O’Hare marks the latest step in United’s ongoing strategy to use the latest technology to ensure customers have a reliable experience during their travels. Last month, the airline launched automated screening lanes at its hub in Los Angeles and expects to open automated lanes at Newark Liberty International Airport, the airline’s premier Trans-Atlantic gateway, before Thanksgiving. When United, in collaboration with the TSA, completes the installation, the newly centralized security checkpoint at Terminal C in Newark Liberty will feature 17 automated lanes. In addition to installing automated screening lanes, United is building and redesigning checkpoints at several hubs throughout the airline’s network that will dramatically improve the customer experience. Key initiatives include: Installing audio and visual enhancements utilizing cutting-edge technology in the security queuing area to provide customers with more information. Consolidating four checkpoints into one new, centralized checkpoint at Newark Liberty. Redesigning security checkpoints at Chicago O’Hare. Constructing a new, state-of-the-art customer check-in area and a consolidated security screening checkpoint in Terminal 7 at Los Angeles International Airport. About United United Airlines and United Express operate more than 4,500 flights a day to 339 airports across five continents. In 2015, United and United Express operated more than 1.5 million flights carrying more than 140 million customers. United is proud to have the world’s most comprehensive route network, including U.S. mainland hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. United operates more than 720 mainline aircraft, and this year, the airline anticipates taking delivery of 21 new Boeing aircraft, including 737NGs, 787s and 777s, as well as six used Airbus A319 aircraft. The airline is a founding member of Star Alliance, which provides service to 192 countries via 28 member airlines.
