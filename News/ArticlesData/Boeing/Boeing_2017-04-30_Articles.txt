China’s answer to Boeing now just needs to sell The first C919 passenger jet made by the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) shows during a news conference at the company’s factory in Shanghai in November 2015. Photo: Stringer/Reuters When China unveiled a historic order for its first large commercial jetliner at a national air show in 2010, Western journalists were kept away, and only local media were allowed to witness a major turning point in China’s aviation ambitions. The Comac C919 jet is expected to stage its maiden flight in the coming weeks, and foreign media and potential buyers will be invited in force – illustrating how Beijing is adjusting to competition for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. But after three years of delays and almost a decade in development, China’s answer to the Boeing 737 and its state-owned designers face a daunting phase: selling the jet abroad in a market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “They will be trying to compete on price against people who are building aircraft at a much faster pace and with more experience, so there’s a risk of getting bled dry,” said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group. Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) has some cards to play: its plane has Western engines and avionics coupled with a new design; it’s rolling out a pilot training programme, expanding international staff and has strong, behind-the-scenes backing from Beijing, industry executives say. And though still unproven, Comac could be the single biggest threat over the coming decades to the dominance of Boeing and Airbus, both in China’s own huge aviation market and, longer-term, overseas. The C919 is the first step to this. Beijing’s backing for the single-aisle plane gives Comac a springboard in the world’s fastest-growing domestic market, even though the company acknowledges much bigger hurdles abroad. “You can’t compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they’re in a different strategic stage... We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue [of plane development], it will also take many years to solve the second [market] problem,” said Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for Comac. “After the first flight, we have to focus and research on how to improve the plane’s and Comac’s market competitiveness.” The safety certification of the new plane could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, welcomed the competition from Comac, and a China-based spokesman for Boeing congratulated the company on developing the C919. The C919 has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies, but says it is not able to give a breakdown. In comparison, the latest version of the Boeing 737 had more than 3,000 firm orders before it flew last January. Those types of numbers from the two big global planemakers come after decades of trimming costs and honing marketing pitches. The two have global support networks able to respond whenever a jet breaks down just about anywhere, and the number of jets flying makes it easier for airlines to raise loans to buy them. While Chinese financiers have muscled into the global aviation arena, Comac has a relatively low-key presence at international air shows and has said the C919 would initially be aimed at the domestic market. But there are signs it’s adopting a more outward-facing approach. While operating manuals for Comac’s smaller ARJ21 regional jet, which took its first flight in 2007, were written in Mandarin, the C919’s will be in English to support sales. Comac’s sales and support networks – it has at least 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, says Cheng – are, however, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus. Still, Comac’s home advantage is significant as Chinese airlines are likely to drive airplane demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes – mostly from Boeing and Airbus. “Their sales person is the government,” said a Chinese airline executive, who didn’t want to be named for risk of damaging business relationships. “As long as the government tells the state airlines to purchase planes, that will happen.” Airline executives say the first flight is when Comac can realistically start discussing deposits and firming up customers, even if the plane still faces years of testing. “We haven’t placed a deposit; at the moment it’s intentions,” said Che Shanglun, chairman of Xiamen Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines, which has committed to buying up to 50 of the 158-seat C919s. “We signed for 50, but we actually want to buy 30. We have to see if they’re able to produce it... They (Comac) are very enthusiastic, they meet us every month and send us updates.” Executives at two Chinese airlines which have not placed orders for the aircraft said they wanted to see the C919’s safety record, as well as the creation of a global support team. The safety certification of the new plane – which state media says will have a catalogue price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 – could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally. Having a plane certified to fly commercially is tough enough even for Western jetmakers as aircraft become more complex and supply chains expand. There is still uncertainty over approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold beyond China, with the US and the EU having the most influence. Although the EU has agreed to recognise some of the checks carried out by China, it is expected to insist on some of its own tests before issuing a safety certificate and is trying to understand where discrepancies between the two systems lie. “We are just at the start of the process,” said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency. The US Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Without Western approvals, China would only be able to sell to countries that accept its certification standards. Zimbabwe, Bolivia and Tajikistan have previously bought Chinese planes. Without Western certification, “sales of the aircraft in developed economies and many developing economies will be difficult to impossible”, said Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher at Aviation Week. The C919’s only real foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, whose parent General Electric co-built the plane’s engine with France’s Safran. “Only once our plane enters the market and is tested can we see what gaps it has,” Cheng said. « Brexit: everything is negotiable Advert See our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

April 28, 2017 by Ross Marowitts Topics General Industries Aerospace Government Manufacturing CSeries FTV2 during a test flight. Photo: BombardierMONTREAL — Bombardier and the federal government have rejected Boeing’s claim in a complaint filed with the US government that its Canadian rival has dumped its new CSeries commercial jet into the United States at below cost. “Bombardier structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those issues raised by Boeing,” the Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer said in an emailed statement. The world’s third-largest airplane maker said it spends about US$3 billion annually with US suppliers and employs about 7,000 people in dozens of facilities in both rail and aerospace across 17 states. The Seattle-based competitor said it petitioned the US Department of Commerce and the US International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It is also seeking an order to be issued against the sale of the plane in the important American market. Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains said the government objects to the allegations and vowed to mount “a vigorous defence.” “We are confident that our programs are consistent with Canada’s international obligations,” he said in a statement. Boeing said it asking the Trump administration to act “to end Bombardier’s illegal and unfair business practices before it is too late to prevent significant harm to America’s aerospace industry and thousands of good-paying aerospace jobs.” The aerospace giant said the threat against its suppliers will only grow as Bombardier increases the annual production rate of the CSeries to between 90 and 120 airplanes by 2020. It said more than US$3 billion in government subsidies so far have allowed Bombardier to engage in “predatory pricing” for an aircraft that competes directly against its 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 airplanes. Boeing claimed Bombardier has sold CSeries planes that cost US$33 million to produce for less than US$20 million each and at prices below what it charged in Canada. “It’s selling the aircraft in the U.S. at prices that are millions lower than those that they’re charging in Canada, which is the very definition of dumping,” Boeing spokesman Daniel Curran said in an interview. Boeing joins Brazil, which filed a similar complaint with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer. Delta Air Lines will become the first US CSeries carrier after placing a firm order a year ago for 75 CS100 aircraft valued at US$5.6 billion. It also has options for 50 more planes and can covert some of the aircraft to larger CS300s. Air Canada followed by ordering 45 CS300s for US$3.8 billion at list prices, plus options for 30 more planes. Airlines typically pay much less than list prices and early buyers of new planes usually get low prices. The latest challenge against Bombardier’s largest aircraft came just days after the US imposed preliminary duties of up to 24% on softwood lumber imported from Canada.

The new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner will operate the airline’s long haul routes, gradually replacing its Airbus A330s. A total of five Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft will have entered Gulf Air’s fleet by end-2018 with an additional two aircraft arriving by end-2019 and three arriving by end-2020. “We are 12 months away from welcoming the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner to the Gulf Air fleet – a historic moment in our trajectory and yet another important step in our strategic direction towards furthering Gulf Air’s fleet modernization process and supporting our network and overall passenger experience enhancement strategies. As we look to strengthen our presence across the globe, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners will also serve to enhance Gulf Air’s operational efficiency while offering enhanced passenger comfort. I am confident our guests will be delighted with the experience of flying with our newest aircraft,” said Maher Salman Al Musallam, Gulf Air chief executive officer. Gulf Air’s Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners will offer 282 seats in a two-class configuration, with 26 Falcon Gold Class seats and 256 Economy Class seats. The industry-leading technology of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner boasts superior fuel efficiency, environmentally friendly operations and range flexibility that will facilitate Gulf Air’s planned network expansion and fleet optimisation at a lower operating cost. “The 787 customer base is growing not just globally but in the Middle East as well with airlines such as Gulf Air taking delivery of the Dreamliner,” said Marty Bentrott, vice president – sales, The Middle East, Turkey, Russia & Central Asia, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We are confident that the 787-9 will help Gulf Air achieve a new level of efficiency and profitability and will contribute to their future growth and success.” The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an all-new, super-efficient family of commercial airplanes that brings big-jet ranges and speed to the middle of the market with 20 to 25 percent less fuel and 20 to 25 per cent fewer emissions than the airplanes they replace. Passengers enjoy many improvements with the 787 family such as the largest windows of any jet; air that is cleaner, more humid and at a higher pressure for greater comfort; large overhead bins with room for everyone’s bag; soothing LED lighting; and technology that senses and counters turbulence for a smoother ride. Gulf Air’s highly anticipated Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner orders will ensure it maintains one of the youngest fleets in the region while building upon its award-winning reliability, on time performance and product and service standards. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: Gulf | Boeing | Dreamliner | Air | 787-9 | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Nakheel inks hotel management deals with Hilton Saudi awards Jeddah airport contract to Singapore’s Changi InterCon introduces new experiential luxury travel offering BTEA Advisor honoured for hosting kingdom's first big wedding Debut Himalaya Airline flight lands at DWC Dubai gears up for Airport Show Emaar Hospitality launches apps for guest experience Sheraton Oman wins top award at Business Traveller France to form new tourism office APM Terminals Bahrain celebrates Annual Global Safety Day Qatar Airways plans fifth daily direct service to Bangkok WTTC announces departure of president Scowsill Copa Airlines, Turkish Airlines ink codeshare deal Royal Rose Abu Dhabi named "Best Family Hotel" Tourico posts 112pc jump in ME inbound hotel room nights Oman Air named “Best Arab Air Carrier supporting Arab Tourism” Sharjah welcomes 2.74m passengers in Q1 German tourism ends ATM on a successful note Majid Al Futtaim to build region's first cinema-themed hotel Slovenia eyes GCC visitor market Saudi Food, Hotel & Hospitality Exhibition concludes successfully United to offer passengers up to $10,000 to give up seats Magnificent seven win ATM awards Dubai Health Authority aims to drive medical tourism Middle East's first Mama Shelter to open in Dubai Most successful ATM to date for HMH Qatar Airways to fly third direct daily to Bali Emirates to go all A380 to Melbourne Fragrant Nature records 30pc growth in GCC visitor arrivals Emaar Hospitality Group launches five apps Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

The use of lightweight and very strong carbon fibre began as United States missile nozzles and heat shields before being adapted for military planes and then extensively used in new generation civil aircraft. More than 50 per cent of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner is carbon composite, a material that is up to 20 per cent lighter than the alloys and metals it replaces, making New Zealand a more viable destination for airlines which try to cut weight to save on fuel. Auckland Airport handles more than 70 per cent of arriving visitors and its chief executive Adrian Littlewood says the new lightweight, fuel efficient planes made by Boeing, and Airbus - with its A350 - were perfectly suited to the ultra-long distances that airlines must fly to New Zealand. ''The planes that are now rolling out into the market are far more efficient and more capable of getting to New Zealand than we've seen before,'' he said. ''For airlines they are relatively easy to fill and able to serve long thin routes so they can penetrate into many more cities in the world at a lower cost on a normalised basis.'' Fuel prices had been relatively low for the past two years and this had helped lead to 11 new carriers come to Auckland since the middle of 2015. ''It's fantastic and that's been the fuel for the tourism boom we've seen over the last couple of years,'' said Littlewood. Continued below.

''Travel is one of the first discretionary activities consumers go for once they've got the basics sorted out - China has been a really great example of this.'' India, the Philippines and Indonesia were emerging also. Listed tourism businesses have prospered, Auckland Airport's share price hit a record high of $7.62 in September, Air New Zealand reported a record full year result last year and Tourism Holdings has over the last 18 months several times upgraded earnings' outlooks. Littlewood, whose company is New Zealand's biggest by market capitalisation, said this country's tourism industry had got itself sorted out. ''It's got organised and is focusing on growth, it's co-ordinated its work with the government which has been very supportive.'' New Zealand was also appealing to what visitors increasingly wanted. ''Tourists are starting to look at the things that New Zealand has to offer - a shift away from material activities around shopping or activities such as theme parks to experiences - that's what New Zealand does tremendously well.'' Auckland Airport has been under pressure over the last year to build infrastructure to keep up with the influx of tourists and strong domestic growth which had boosted numbers through the airport to around 16.6 million a year. The airport was spending $1m every week day on new gates, aircraft stands and extensive remodelling of its international terminal departure area. Road traffic congestion around the airport is also a problem prompting temporary vehicle control measures to be imposed over summer. The planes that are now rolling out into the market are far more efficient and more capable of getting to New Zealand than we've seen before. Adrian Littlewood, Auckland Airport chief executive ''It doesn't take a long time for an airline to make a decision to send an aircraft to New Zealand - passengers immediately turn up. It takes a lot longer to build infrastructure to support that - right through from facilities and services to support the aircraft through to accommodation through to sites around the country.'' This has prompted a debate on how to fund infrastructure in other parts of the country. The airport along with Air New Zealand, Tourism Holdings and Christchurch Airport commissioned consultants McKinsey to investigate funding. The report suggested a bed tax and a $5 increase in the border levy to fund facilities and infrastructure growth. A $130 million annual fund would be half met by the Government. The report proposed a National Tourism Infrastructure Levy, made up of a 2 per cent national bed levy across the accommodation sector and a $5 increase to the border levy, to raise $65m a year. The government is not keen on raising taxes though and Littlewood says there is no simple solution. ''I don't think that's (the report) meant to be an answer to many different problems - it was done as a way to provoke the government into thinking about whether there are different ways to solve it.'' He said well-intentioned funds could result in distortions. ''You've got to be careful we don't try to repurpose it for other things. Look across the Tasman and see it hasn't worked as well, the passenger movement charge is now A$55 a passenger which includes a Sydney Olympics charge and Queensland flood relief charge,'' said Littlewood. ''I am hopeful the Government does have some strong answers coming up in the budget this year. I think tourism is earning its way and justifies additional support from the government.'' - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The risk of the United States imposing a tariff, which would likely depress sales of Bombardier’s newest jet, and concern over how big that tariff might be, unsettled investors, sending the Canadian company’s shares down just over 4 per cent. Boeing wants the US government to investigate what it describes as rock-bottom prices for Bombardier’s new C Series aircraft, including an “absurdly low” sum of $19.6 million it says Delta Air Lines Inc paid for a jet costing $33 million to build. “The allegation is absurd,” Bombardier spokesman Bryan Tucker said, in response to numbers contained in a petition sent to the US Commerce Department by Boeing on Thursday. The spat comes days after Washington imposed duties averaging 20 per cent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, prompting claims in Canada that Boeing was taking advantage of the Trump administration’s tougher stance on trade. Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said the filing against Bombardier was “an initiative we chose to take ourselves”. He declined to say whether Boeing also planned to ask the United States to pursue Canada through the World Trade Organization, as it has against European rival Airbus. Domestic cases, where companies can petition for duties on specific products, typically take around a year. That is much quicker than a 13-year-old transatlantic battle on jetliner subsidies at the WTO, an international forum open only to nations. Planemakers “often sell below costs to break into a new market or with a new product, particularly if it involves a significant launch customer,” said US-based trade policy expert Joel Johnson. Such tactics cause long-term harm by creating momentum that rivals find hard to reverse, Boeing’s petition said, although industry analysts say Boeing and Airbus both regularly offer discounts of 50 per cent or more. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Amazon’s moves beyond retail get Wall St thumbs up US to review trade pacts, looking at ‘violations’ → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Oman, Korea to further strengthen strong ties Pension Fund building opens in Salalah Cooperation in education discussed PACP warns against price hike during Ramadhan Read More ...

Boeing P-8A Poseidon. Photo: Wikicommons The US department of defence has announced it may sell the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) four new Boeing aircraft at a cost of nearly $1.5 billion. But the Defence Force said the government had not yet committed to any sale. The US said New Zealand had asked to potentially buy four P-8A Patrol aircraft, equipped with commercial engines, missile warning sensors, infrared and laser transmitter assemblies. They will replace the Defence Force's current fleet of P-3 Orion aircraft. The $1.47bn price included training and assistance, technical services, and repair. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said he was concerned the reduction from a fleet of six to four would cut the country's patrol aircraft by a third. He asked how four aircraft could cover the area New Zealand is responsible for, which extends from Antarctica to north of the equator and from the mid-Tasman Sea to east of the Cook Islands. Mr Peters said there should be competition between Boeing and other companies. The US defence department said the sale would strengthen collective defence, and enhance New Zealand's allied contributions. One of the New Zealand Defence Force's current P-3K2 Orion aircraft. Photo: Supplied / Defence Force But a spokesperson for the Defence Force said the US announcement was a non-binding part of the process and it was legally bound to inform the public. The spokesperson said the price was higher than it expected to pay and the offer would be considered over the next couple months. In June last year, the government announced it would spend $20 billion on the Defence Force in a long-term investment plan that also includes a new cyber security system for defence networks. It detailed plans to replace the Air Force Boeing 757, the C130-Hercules, the Orion maritime patrol aircraft and the ANZAC frigates, over the next 15 years.

Sean Rayford/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Sean Rayford/Getty Images President Trump addresses a crowd at Boeing's facilities in North Charleston, S.C., on Feb. 17. Sean Rayford/Getty Images President Trump has said over and over that creating jobs is at the top of his agenda. It may seem unfair to judge his progress on this goal in his first 100 days, but Trump has opened the door to scrutiny by making his own assertions on job creation. During a White House meeting with CEOs on April 11, Trump claimed his administration had already created over 600,000 jobs. "You see what's going on. You see the numbers," he said. "We've created over 600,000 jobs already in a very short period of time, and it's going to really start catching on now because some of the things that we've done are big league and they are catching on." Politics Trump Can't Bring Back All Those Jobs From China. Here's What He Can Do Since the beginning of the year, the Labor Department says, the U.S. has created 533,000 jobs. Of course, Trump only took office on Jan. 20, and the January numbers are generally attributed to the outgoing president, because the new president hasn't had a chance to put his policies in place. So, at most Trump could take credit for 219,000 jobs in February and 98,000 in March. That's a total of about 317,000 — about half his original claim. (The White House website now touts "over 500,000 new jobs.") And there's a good argument to be made that presidents shouldn't take credit for a role in job creation until well into their first term, after they've had a chance to influence the course of events with policies or leadership. Trump has announced a number of executive actions that he says will help create U.S. jobs, but so far the effect of those actions has been minimal. Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and top economic adviser to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, points out that Trump inherited an economy near full employment. "That's a very different world than his predecessor Barack Obama entered," says Holtz-Eakin. Obama faced "hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every month," and so "a lot of job creation needed to be done." Obama managed to get a big stimulus package through Congress, along with taking additional action to rescue automakers during his first 100 days. Politics What Trump Misses About Energy Jobs In America But, Holtz-Eakin says, "the task is different now." Trump's job is not faster job creation, but switching the focus to boosting the productivity of workers, which could support higher wages and make incomes grow more rapidly, Holtz-Eakin says. That will require passing complex plans like business tax reform and health care legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Holtz-Eakin says it remains to be seen whether Trump and the Congress can achieve those goals. What about Trump's flurry of activity during the presidential transition — after he was elected but before he took office? Trump has made a big deal of twisting corporate arms to save U.S. jobs at automakers and companies like Carrier. The Two-Way Shaming Firms That Export Jobs Has Worked For Trump So Far Business Carrier Got Cut A Deal, But Can Other Companies Expect The Same? In the case of Carrier, about 800 jobs were preserved in one factory. Trump was especially vocal, taking credit for car company announcements that they were expanding factories and adding thousands of workers. However, most of the companies said the expansions were in the works before Trump was elected. Holtz-Eakin says the "direct impacts [of Trump's arm-twisting] were modest." But Holtz-Eakin does believe Trump's election may have boosted confidence enough at some businesses that they added jobs anticipating a stronger economy and stronger demand for their goods and services. He says the quick rollback of a number of Obama-era regulations also likely boosted the spirits in the business community and led to more hiring. But, Holtz-Eakin says, there's still no hard evidence to back that up. And, he says, a 100-day report card on job creation really tells us very little about what long-term impact a president will have.

But the airline is in ambitious expansion mode, as Dublin is just one of 14 new cities it will add to its network in 2017/18. http://www.independent.ie/business/small-business/skys-the-limit-for-irish-in-middle-east-aviation-sector-35666799.html http://www.independent.ie/life/travel/article35666608.ece/d61ef/AUTOCROP/h342/10aviation Email This June, Qatar Airways will commence daily flights from Dublin to the Qatari capital Doha, the planned location of the Fifa World Cup in 2022. This is Ireland's first direct air link to the Gulf state - and Qatar Airways' first Irish route. But the airline is in ambitious expansion mode, as Dublin is just one of 14 new cities it will add to its network in 2017/18. According to forecasts from Moody's, the region is set to be the fastest-growing in the world for the airline industry in 2017. This is despite weak oil prices slowing economic growth in key Gulf states. In December 2016, Boeing announced that the Middle East's commercial aviation industry will need an additional 92,000 cabin crew, 58,000 pilots and 66,000 technicians over the next two decades. While the mega-carriers have strong in-house capabilities, there are opportunities for Irish companies to provide niche solutions. Equally, opportunities with the region's smaller national airlines and new low-cost carriers, such as Fly Dubai, Air Arabia and FlyNas, should not be underestimated. The requirements are many and varied - from wifi and passenger connectivity solutions to helping the airlines enhance the customer experience and brand perception to the development of e-commerce platforms to cross-sell offers such as car hire and hotels. There is also a need for innovation to manage the increasingly congested airspace throughout the region and address security issues in aviation. A number of airport expansions are planned or under way. Low-cost carriers are growing in popularity in the Middle East, and Ireland has a strong reputation in this area - alongside aircraft leasing, duty free and engineering. DAA is managing and operating the new Terminal 5 in Riyadh, and ARI has duty-free operations in the region. Heavy airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) works are predominantly carried out locally and in-house. However, Irish MRO companies that can guarantee minimum downtime, have flexibility accommodating schedule changes and achieve rapid response times will find themselves ahead of the competition. There are also opportunities for recruitment and training companies to ensure sufficient MRO skills are available locally. To get ahead in this market, it is important to understand the procurement process: the need to display a very high level of transparency can make decision-making arduous. It is also important to understand where the aviation customer is positioned in terms of life cycle and the landscape of the region; how they make money (if they do), and the market's perception of them, both inside and outside the Middle East. There are significant differences between each of the countries in the region - and even within different emirates in the UAE - especially in relation to cultural norms and the protocol for doing business. Irish companies' success to date means that suppliers can open doors for each other. While being specialised has its advantages, SMEs may find themselves up against larger international companies offering a full solution. Closer collaboration with Irish companies offering multiple, complementary solutions in one package could be a way forward. Enterprise Ireland is bringing a number of senior engineers and managers from the Middle East MRO and aircraft interiors sectors to the Dublin Aviation Summit in the RDS this May, and we will be hosting an Irish pavilion at the Dubai Airshow next November. As Iran's aviation industry comes out of the shadows, Enterprise Ireland has also produced a useful guide for this market. Given where Iran's carriers find themselves, there is strong potential to leverage Ireland's long experience helping airlines transition from older equipment to newer Boeing and Airbus airframes, especially in areas such as training, aviation English, MRO, aircraft delivery, leasing and ICT. For companies with the right offering and ambition, the sky is the limit.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Russia's New Spaceship Could Be Crewed by Robots Initially, at least. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 30, 2017 at 8:13AM Russia is forging a new era in space. Ever since the United States retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, NASA astronauts have had to hitch rides to the International Space Station (ISS) in Russian Soyuz spaceships -- paying Russian space agency Roscosmos for the privilege. The plan is for NASA to soon switch over sometime soon to using its own rockets -- built by SpaceX and Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) United Launch Alliance joint venture -- but it remains an open question when these companies will have their spacecraft ready for use. In the meantime, American astronauts must continue to fork over $82 million a seat in payment for rides aboard Soyuz. And what is Russia doing with all that money, you ask? It's using it to develop a new spaceship of its own -- a very interesting spaceship. Russia's next spacecraft could be crewed by robots. Image source: Getty Images. Going where no cosmonaut has gone before -- on Russia's Federatsiya Roscosmos is currently developing a new and improved spacecraft -- one capable not just of ferrying supplies and astronauts to ISS, but also of fulfilling Russia's dream of one day landing a cosmonaut on the moon, or even Mars.  In a move evocative of both Star Trek and Russia's own official name -- "the Russian Federation" -- it's calling the new spacecraft Federatsiya, or "Federation." (Side note: The current Soyuz spacecraft design was named for the Soviet Union, or Sovyetsky Soyuz). Now here's what we know about the spaceship that will replace the Soyuz. Energia, a publicly traded Russian "rocket and space public corporation," has been working on developing the Federatsiya for more than a decade. According to new reports, completing the effort will require another five years and cost a further $734 million. In a break from tradition, the Soyuz rocket-Soyuz capsule combination of current spaceships will be replaced by the Federatsiya capsule being carried atop a new heavy-lift rocket called Angara. Another change -- instead of launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Angara and Federatsiya will launch out of Roscosmos's new seven-launchpad spaceport in Russia's Amur Oblast, dubbed the "Vostochny Cosmodrome" (the "Eastern Spaceport"). The new Federatsiya capsule will stand 20 feet tall and weigh 14.4 metric tons. Larger than its predecessor Soyuz, Federatsiya will accommodate between four and six cosmonauts. Plans are for Federatsiya to make its first trip to space in 2021, unmanned. Crewed missions are expected to begin as early as 2023, and Russia plans to conduct a manned moon mission with Federatsiya as early as 2025.  No crew, but... Now here's where this story gets weird. Federatsiya's first trip to space in 2021 may be unmanned, but Russia's new spaceship won't be going into space entirely uncrewed. To the contrary, the spacecraft will carry a pilot -- a robot pilot. According to Russian news agency TASS, Russia plans to crew Federatsiya's first mission with a humanoid robot named FEDOR (short for "Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research") at the helm. FEDOR will be the sole passenger aboard Federatsiya's maiden flight. TASS reports that FEDOR is capable of screwing in a light bulb, unlocking and opening a door, and driving a car -- and apparently, a spacecraft, too. Developed by Russia's Android Technics Research and Production Association under contract to the country's Emergencies Ministry, FEDOR was designed to perform work "in extreme conditions." To accomplish its missions, FEDOR has been equipped with both "fine motor skills and decision-making algorithms." Russia plans to test that thesis by giving FEDOR control over Federatsiya. What comes next? That's already pretty amazing. Not only is Russia developing a new spaceship, but it's developing an entirely new way to crew spaceships, too. What could be even more interesting is what Russia plans to do next. For example, FEDOR doesn't need to breathe, and he won't require a spacesuit -- so might Russia also decide to send FEDOR out through the hatch on an extra-vehicular activity mission? A few years from now, could we see FEDOR, or multiple FEDORs, land on and explore the moon itself, no cosmonauts required? The upshot of all this, of course, is that Russia appears set on blazing new trails in space -- even as NASA under the Trump administration endures small but significant budget cuts. Adding insult to injury, Russia is doing all this on our dime -- and will continue to do so until SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed get their act together and begin launching their space shuttle replacements. Only then will NASA be able to stop paying Roscosmos for astronaut rides and begin spending that money on developing our own space program again.  Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Most Americans Want Trump to Slash Military Spending by $41 Billion Meanwhile, a 100% majority of recent presidents don't seem to care what voters think. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 30, 2017 at 10:09AM Last month, President Trump promised the American people that he would "rebuild the military, eliminate the Defense sequester, and [initiate] one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history." Fiscal 2018, promised the president, would feature a $54 billion increase  in defense spending, giving the Pentagon enough money to spend with abandon on everything from bombs and rockets from Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), to new warships from General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII), needed to build the President's promised "350-ship navy." But here's the thing: Most American taxpayers think we're spending too much on the military already. In fact, most Americans think we should be cutting the defense budget instead. Image source: Getty Images. Survey says ... That's the upshot of a new poll conducted by the University of Maryland's Program for Public Consultation (PPC). Surveying more than 1,800 registered voters, PPC presented the federal government's 2017 budget as a series of 31 line items. PPC then asked voters to tweak those numbers into their ideal federal budget for 2018 -- and then compared voters' ideal budget with the actual budget that President Trump proposed last month. In several areas, voters broadly agreed with the president's proposals. For example, both voters and their president agree that the U.S. spends too much ($36 billion) on the State Department and the Agency for International Development, and on NASA as well ($19 billion). On other items, they differ. For example, voters generally disagreed with the president's proposal to make steep cuts in education spending, and to cut funding for medical research. The biggest disagreement, however, was over funding for the military. Guns or butter? President Obama ended his term in office with fiscal 2017 defense spending budgeted at $584 billion.  That included both a base level of funding, extra funds for "overseas contingency operations" (OCO) -- primarily combat operations in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan -- and nuclear-weapons funding as well. But according to PPC's poll, that's too much money to be spending on defense. Given their druthers, voters surveyed by PPC said they'd prefer to cut the 2017 Obama defense budget by $41 billion -- not increase it by $54 billion. Voters recommended cutting the base budget by 5% ($26 billion), pulling back internationally and cutting OCO funding by 23% ($15 billion) in the process. And voters think the nuclear arsenal is fine as is and oppose spending more money to "greatly strengthen and expand it." What it means to investors So what cues should investors draw from these results? I see at least two ways of looking at all of this. In a follow-up analysis of the PPC survey, Salon.com pointed out that while the disconnect between President Trump's proposed budget and the budget favored by voters is large, voter attitudes toward defense spending haven't really changed all that much in recent years. Similar surveys of voter sentiment conducted in 2016, and even as far back as 2012, showed similar levels of voter antipathy to the high cost of defense. Yet after declining sharply with America's abbreviated withdrawal from Iraq in 2012, overall defense spending has largely held steady since. For whatever reason, it appears that no matter what their constituents say, Congress simply isn't willing to cut spending on defense. That's bad news for democracy -- but maybe good news for Boeing, Raytheon, and all the rest. On the other hand, with President Trump in the White House, it's possible we'll see a new dynamic take hold in Washington. Whatever else you may think of him, Trump is not a business-as-usual politician. Even his supporters agree that our new, unconventional president is extraordinarily sensitive to public opinion and poll numbers. It's possible, therefore, that if polling continues to favor cutting defense spending, future White House proposals will feature leaner budgets for the Pentagon. Only time will tell if that's the case, but for investors in the defense industry, it's something to bear in mind. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Russia’s New Spaceship Could Be Crewed by Robots Russia is forging a new era in space. Ever since the United States retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, NASA astronauts have had to hitch rides to the International Space Station (ISS) in Russian Soyuz spaceships — paying Russian space agency Roscosmos for the privilege. The plan is for NASA to soon switch over sometime soon to using its own rockets — built by SpaceX and Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin ‚s (NYSE: LMT) United Launch Alliance joint venture — but it remains an open question when these companies will have their spacecraft ready for use. In the meantime, American astronauts must continue to fork over $82 million a seat in payment for rides aboard Soyuz. And what is Russia doing with all that money, you ask? It’s using it to develop a new spaceship of its own — a very interesting spaceship. Russia’s next spacecraft could be crewed by robots. Image source: Getty Images. Going where no cosmonaut has gone before — on Russia’s Federatsiya Roscosmos is currently developing a new and improved spacecraft — one capable not just of ferrying supplies and astronauts to ISS, but also of fulfilling Russia’s dream of one day landing a cosmonaut on the moon, or even Mars. In a move evocative of both Star Trek and Russia’s own official name — „the Russian Federation” — it’s calling the new spacecraft Federatsiya, or „Federation.” (Side note: The current Soyuz spacecraft design was named for the Soviet Union, or Sovyetsky Soyuz). Now here’s what we know about the spaceship that will replace the Soyuz. Energia, a publicly traded Russian „rocket and space public corporation,” has been working on developing the Federatsiya for more than a decade. According to new reports, completing the effort will require another five years and cost a further $734 million. In a break from tradition, the Soyuz rocket-Soyuz capsule combination of current spaceships will be replaced by the Federatsiya capsule being carried atop a new heavy-lift rocket called Angara. Another change — instead of launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Angara and Federatsiya will launch out of Roscosmos’s new seven-launchpad spaceport in Russia’s Amur Oblast, dubbed the „Vostochny Cosmodrome” (the „Eastern Spaceport”). The new Federatsiya capsule will stand 20 feet tall and weigh 14.4 metric tons. Larger than its predecessor Soyuz, Federatsiya will accommodate between four and six cosmonauts. Plans are for Federatsiya to make its first trip to space in 2021, unmanned. Crewed missions are expected to begin as early as 2023, and Russia plans to conduct a manned moon mission with Federatsiya as early as 2025. No crew, but… Now here’s where this story gets weird. Federatsiya’s first trip to space in 2021 may be unmanned, but Russia’s new spaceship won’t be going into space entirely uncrewed. To the contrary, the spacecraft will carry a pilot — a robot pilot. According to Russian news agency TASS, Russia plans to crew Federatsiya’s first mission with a humanoid robot named FEDOR (short for „Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research”) at the helm. FEDOR will be the sole passenger aboard Federatsiya’s maiden flight. TASS reports that FEDOR is capable of screwing in a light bulb, unlocking and opening a door, and driving a car — and apparently, a spacecraft, too. Developed by Russia’s Android Technics Research and Production Association under contract to the country’s Emergencies Ministry, FEDOR was designed to perform work „in extreme conditions.” To accomplish its missions, FEDOR has been equipped with both „fine motor skills and decision-making algorithms.” Russia plans to test that thesis by giving FEDOR control over Federatsiya. What comes next? That’s already pretty amazing. Not only is Russia developing a new spaceship, but it’s developing an entirely new way to crew spaceships, too. What could be even more interesting is what Russia plans to do next. For example, FEDOR doesn’t need to breathe, and he won’t require a spacesuit — so might Russia also decide to send FEDOR out through the hatch on an extra-vehicular activity mission? A few years from now, could we see FEDOR, or multiple FEDORs, land on and explore the moon itself, no cosmonauts required? The upshot of all this, of course, is that Russia appears set on blazing new trails in space — even as NASA under the Trump administration endures small but significant budget cuts . Adding insult to injury, Russia is doing all this on our dime — and will continue to do so until SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed get their act together and begin launching their space shuttle replacements . Only then will NASA be able to stop paying Roscosmos for astronaut rides and begin spending that money on developing our own space program again. 10 stocks we like better than Boeing When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

SpaceX is now launching spy satellites for the U.S. government, with the first launch coming on Sunday, April 30 at some point after 7am EST. The contract for the launch, which was awarded confidentially, is the first for the futuristic reusable rocket company. It marks a turning point in government contracts for spy satellites as this will be the only launch out of 25 done since 2006 that is being not carried out by the United Launch Alliance, which itself is made up of the government contract stalwarts Boeing and Lockheed Martin. A report from Quartz says that this launch could net SpaceX $100 million or more which might not be more than a drop in the bucket for Elon Musk but is still a pretty chunk of change. Even though the company has carried out launches of its reusable rockets successfully multiple times at this point, this won’t be one of them. Unsurprisingly, the government isn’t completely comfortable with a launch mechanism that has been used once before. However, SpaceX says that even though this will be a fresh construction, they will recycle it for future private launches. Maybe the government can be won over once the company’s current two Air Force contracts are completed successfully and without any accidental incinerations of their payload. If all goes well with the launch, this satellite will be used for surveillance of “North Korea’s nuclear program, China’s island-building in the South China Sea, and other activities of interest to US officials.” (via Quartz) Share This Facebook Twitter EMAIL Around The Web TAGSboeinglockheed martinSpaceX Join The Discussion: Log In With Sign In With Facebook Sign In With Twitter Sign In With Email Profile By: Whitney McIntosh 04.29.2017 @ 9:53 AM "Elon Musk’s SpaceX Is Now Launching Spy Satellites For The U.S. Government" Cancel reply View all comments First 100 Days How The Trump Administration Has Impacted Women’s Rights Alyssa Fikse 04.27.17 4 days ago 4 Comments The Twisted, Ever-Morphing Timeline Of The Ties Between Donald Trump And Russia Kimberly Ricci 04.27.17 4 days ago 12 Comments What Will Happen If Trump And The Republicans Shut Down The Government?

Image courtesy NASA. For a larger version of this image please go here. Building on the ability to sequence DNA in space and previous investigations, Genes in Space-3 is a collaboration to prepare, sequence and identify unknown organisms, entirely from space. When NASA astronaut Kate Rubins sequenced DNA aboard the International Space Station in 2016, it was a game changer. That first-ever sequencing of DNA in space was part of the Biomolecule Sequencer investigation. Although it's not as exciting as a science fiction movie may depict, the walls and surfaces of the space station do experience microbial growth from time to time. Currently, the only way to identify contaminants is to take a sample and send it back to Earth. "We have had contamination in parts of the station where fungi was seen growing or biomaterial has been pulled out of a clogged waterline, but we have no idea what it is until the sample gets back down to the lab," said Sarah Wallace, NASA microbiologist and the project's principal investigator at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston. "On the ISS, we can regularly resupply disinfectants, but as we move beyond low-Earth orbit where the ability for resupply is less frequent, knowing what to disinfect or not becomes very important," said Wallace. Developed in partnership by NASA's Johnson Space Center and Boeing, this ISS National Lab sponsored investigation will marry two pieces of existing spaceflight technology, miniPCR and the MinION, to change that process, allowing for the first unknown biological samples to be prepared, sequenced and then identified in space. The miniPCR (polymerase chain reaction) device was first used aboard the station during the Genes in Space-1, and, soon to be Genes in Space-2 investigations, student-designed experiments in the Genes in Space program. Genes in Space-1 successfully demonstrated the device could be used in microgravity to amplify DNA, a process used to create thousands of copies of specific sections of DNA. The second investigation arrived at the space station on April 22, and will be tested this summer. Next came the Biomolecule Sequencer investigation, which successfully tested the MinION's ability to sequence strands of Earth-prepared DNA in an orbiting laboratory. "What the coupling of these different devices is doing is allowing us to take the lab to the samples, instead of us having to bring the samples to the lab," said Aaron Burton, NASA biochemist and Genes in Space-3 co-investigator. Crew members will collect a sample from within the space station to be cultured aboard the orbiting laboratory. The sample will then be prepared for sequencing, in a process similar to the one used during the Genes in Space-1 investigation, using the miniPCR and finally, sequenced and identified using the MinION device. "The ISS is very clean," said Sarah Stahl, microbiologist and project scientist. "We find a lot of human-associated microorganisms - a lot of common bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus and different types of familiar fungi like Aspergillus and Penicillium." In addition to identifying microbes in space, this technology could be used to diagnose crew member wounds or illnesses in real time, help identify DNA-based life on other planets and help with other investigations aboard the station. "The Genes in Space-3 process will increase the scientific capacity of the ISS by facilitating state-of-the-art molecular biology research for both current and next generation ISS researchers," said Kristen John, NASA aerospace engineer and Genes in Space-3 project engineer. "The team has put a strong focus on generating a spaceflight-certified catalog of general laboratory items and reagents, and developing common methods and easily customizable reaction conditions for miniPCR and the MinION to enable other ISS researchers to use this technology." This process will give scientists on the ground real-time access to the experiments going on in space, allowing for more accuracy and a more efficient use of the time on the space station. "If you could get a snapshot of the molecular signatures of your research as it was occurring on the ISS, how would you change your experiment?" said Wallace. "Would you change your time points? Provide a different nutrient? Alter growth conditions? You can imagine how, if you had that data, you could adjust your experiment to enhance the insight being gained." Closer to home, this process can be used to provide real-time diagnosis of viruses in areas of the world where access to a laboratory may not be possible.

The payload is from the National Reconnaissance Office, and is called NROL-76, Phys.org reports.

The NRO describes itself as the US's "eyes and ears" on its website. The company, owned by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, is scheduled to launch GPS satellites into orbit for the US Air Force sometime in 2018, after a fight to win government contracts that included filing suit against the government for the right to compete for such deals. The US military had previously only used United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, Phys.org points out. NASA, however, has used SpaceX to help resupply the International Space Station nine times since 2012. Only minutes after the launch, the 14-story first stage of SpaceX's rocket will power on and make a controlled landing at the same space center. SpaceX is attempting to make much of the hardware for space exploration reusable, and has so far landed rockets on solid ground successfully several times. © REUTERS/ Mike Brown Recycled Rocket Ready for Liftoff: SpaceX Set to Make 'Quite a Bit of History' The launch on Sunday will be the first since SpaceX's historic launch of a reused Falcon 9 booster at the end of March.

That particular rocket had been launched and had come back home in April 2016. Tomorrow's launch will use a new rocket, however. Creating workable reusable rockets is crucial to a sustainable space program: CNN Money reports that the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket represents about 70 percent of the roughly $62 million price tag for the device.

Politics Entertainment World U.S. Tech Arts + Culture Drink + Food Style Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast Airborne Antiques The Air Force Plans to Fly 100-Year-Old Planes Behind the front-line warplanes is a fleet of aging jets, including one designed over a single weekend in a hotel room during the Cold War. Clive Irving 05.01.17 5:00 AM ET Since we have an administration with a proclivity to drop bombs, very big bombs, this seems like a good time to talk about bombs, and how they are dropped. The United States Air Force has a lot of bombs, of many kinds. On the face of it, they are a modern force, conveying fearsome power. Look behind that impression, however, and there is an astonishing story of aging airplanes and a very expensive effort to keep them flying for as long as 100 years—in fact, the first ever warplanes to be in service for a whole century. This only-in-America story really begins in a suite at the Van Cleve Hotel in Dayton, Ohio, on a weekend in October 1948. The Boeing company faced a crisis. For two years they had been trying unsuccessfully to meet a demand from the U.S. Air Force for a new strategic bomber. It was a dangerous time in the Cold War. The Soviet Union was a year away from detonating its first atomic bomb. In order to checkmate the Soviet threat America needed a deterrent to demonstrate that it could deliver its own nuclear bombs anywhere and at any time from a fleet of bombers. Curiously, the Air Force was insisting that the new bomber should not be a jet but propeller-powered—even though the new Strategic Air Command was already flying a revolutionary Boeing jet, the B-47.  To carry a new generation of nuclear weapons they wanted an airplane twice the size of the B-47, and no jet of such a size had yet been attempted. Then, suddenly, in meetings at an air base near Dayton, the Air Force told Boeing that the new bomber should be a jet. Holed up in the Dayton hotel suite were two engineers who had transformed Boeing from a pre-war minor player to a wartime and post-war behemoth in military aviation: Ed Wells, the chief designer, and George Schairer, a visionary who in 1945 had discovered some of Nazi Germany’s most advanced aerodynamic research and put it to use in the B-47, which was twice as fast as any other bomber in the world. Wells and Schairer called four other Boeing engineers to the suite. Schairer took one of these out to a hobby store to buy balsa wood, glue, and model paint. Back in the hotel, as Wells drew the outlines of a new bomber, he called out its dimensions and Schairer carved and assembled it from the balsa as a 120th scale model—the scale was chosen because Wells was using a 12-inch ruler and 1 inch of the model represented 10 feet of the actual airplane. The model was boxed up and sent to the Pentagon together with a dossier drawn up by Wells and Schairer that predicted the bomber’s capabilities. In April 1952, that airplane made its first flight from a Boeing plant in Seattle. It was called the B-52 and its performance came within a whisker of the numbers calculated in the Van Cleve Hotel—in some respects better. Astoundingly, the B-52 is still the backbone of the Air Force’s strategic bombing fleet. Even though there are far more advanced bombers, the B-1 and a small unit of B-2 stealth bombers, it is the B-52 that flies most frequently and acts as a kind of airborne artillery barrage, capable of carpet-bombing on a terrifying scale (though, apparently, not of dropping the Mother of All Bombs deployed this month in Afghanistan). The Air Force plans to keep its B-52 fleet flying for another 30 years. And that is not all. To keep those bombers operational they also need to maintain another venerable jet, the KC-135 tanker that allows the bombers to stay aloft on long missions by refueling them in flight. General Carlton Everhart, commander of Air Mobility Command that operates the KC-135 fleet, told an air warfare conference in March that the tankers could be 100 years old before they are retired. No other military airplane anywhere in the world is going to be anything like that old and still flying. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason Guess who designed the K-135? The B-52 guys. Six days after the B-52’s first flight, Wells and Schairer presented Boeing’s board with a breathtaking idea: a passenger jet that would fly twice as fast as any existing propeller-driven airliner. But first they would get the government to pay for the development of the jet by producing it as a new generation of tanker to service the B-52s. At its own expense, Boeing produced a single prototype (it cost $16 million but by writing off the cost against taxes the actual cost was only $5 million). The Air Force bought the proposal and the KC-135 emerged from the prototype, which then later morphed into the legendary 707 airliner. It was a very smart two-for-one deal based on a relatively small investment, maybe the smartest deal the company ever made. As a result, the 707 established Boeing’s supremacy in passenger jets and the KC-135 became a perennial milk cow. The last KC-135 was delivered to the Air Force in 1965. The Air Force only began seriously looking for a replacement in 2001. What followed for more than a decade demonstrated everything that is wrong about the military procurement process: conflicting pressures from politicians with vested local interests in production plants; international free traders versus protectionists; ever-shifting Air Force requirements; and over-optimistic estimates of the cost. In 2008 the Air Force awarded the contract to the European Airbus consortium for a military version of its A-330 passenger jet. According to an Air Force source, Airbus beat a rival bid from Boeing “by a mile.” Boeing cried foul. The Government Accounting Office intervened and found corruption in the Pentagon, concluding that procurement officers had misled Boeing on the criteria that their airplane had to meet.   When the contest was resumed in 2011 Boeing won, with a version of its venerable 767 jetliner. At that point the Air Force ordered 179 new tankers at a total price of $35 billion. That has now risen to $52 billion, and Boeing is so behind in delivering the first batch of 18 airplanes that it has incurred $1.75 billion in overrun costs. (The Airbus tanker has been operational for several years and has been adopted by the Air Forces of 10 nations, including the United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea, France, and Spain.) In fact, Boeing’s poor performance on this contract is widely believed to have cost them the contract for the Air Force’s next major investment, the B-21 long-range strike bomber. Northrup Grumman beat out Boeing on a deal that could eventually be worth $80 billion. The Cold War ideas of strategic bombing that gave birth to the B-52 are obsolete (Strategic Air Command has become Global Strike Command). Technically the B-52 remains part of the nuclear triad (along with the B-2), able to carry and drop nuclear weapons, but it is impossible to see how or where they could still be used in that role. The B-52 can be used only against adversaries that don’t have sophisticated air defense systems, like ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban, and nuking them is unthinkable. (That is, to any sane person.) For sure, the B-52’s weapons bay has been upgraded so that it can deploy laser-guided conventional smart bombs, but the bomber’s most effective use is probably psychological: that it can still serve as it did during the Vietnam War as that bluntest of blunt instruments—the carpet bomber—or, in the vernacular of Trump, to bomb the crap out of adversaries. The opportunity for that is very limited if you have to worry about collateral damage, i.e., killing lots of innocent bystanders. However, age does bring one benefit. Despite other upgrades the B-52’s underlying structure remains as it was designed in the 1950s. As a result it is far simpler to maintain than the B-1 and B-2. Seventy-two percent of the 76-strong force is mission ready at all times. In contrast the B-2 stealth bomber is so complex to maintain and so tricky to operate that its mission readiness is the lowest in the Air Force, only 46 percent of the 20-strong force. (It is the only bomber equipped to deliver the Massive Ordinance Penetrator, otherwise known as the “bunker buster” that would be required to strike underground nuclear facilities, such as in North Korea or Iran.) Now, to give the B-52s yet another lease on life the Air Force is on the verge of spending up to $4 billion on re-equipping them with new engines. The existing engines are “dirty burners” with appalling emissions impact, expensive to service, and so old that at least one has actually fallen off the airplane. But the idea that these bombers will still have any purpose by 2050 seems bizarre. The only other powers committed to future bomber fleets are Russia and China. Northrop Grumman’s B-21 is intended to surpass anything those nations can produce, but warfare technology moves ahead far more nimbly than traditional Pentagon procurement programs. It’s not even certain that the B-21 will need a crew on board. It could be operated remotely from Kansas like a drone. And it’s more than likely that a whole array of unmanned aircraft, small and relatively cheap to produce, will end the age of the big bomber for good.

The one-page plan, unveiled on Wednesday, proposed deep tax cuts for many businesses, but offered no detail on how it would be paid for without increasing the deficit. U.S. stocks snapped a two-day rally to end lower on Wednesday after the plan was unveiled. The prospects of hefty tax cuts have been a major driver of the post-election rally since November. "Yesterday, you saw some selling but it didn't develop into an outright heavy pressure day," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. At 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.43 points, or 0.05 percent, at 20,986.52, the S&P 500 was up 0.14 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,387.59 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.55 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,031.78. Six of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, lead by a 0.35 percent gain in the technology index. PayPal jumped to an all-time high of $47.50 after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast. However, a more than 2 percent drop in oil prices weighed on the energy sector, which fell 0.8 percent. Investors are keeping a close watch on the first-quarter earnings season to gauge fundamental performance in the face of lofty valuations. Of the 181 S&P 500 companies that have released results so far, nearly 77 percent have reported earnings above analysts' expectations. In a typical quarter, about 64 percent of the companies top earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Comcast was the top stock on the S&P, with a 3 percent increase after the company's profit beat analysts' estimates on strong subscriber growth. Under Armour jumped 7.7 percent after the sportswear maker posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Bristol-Myers was up 2.4 percent after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and a jump in revenue. American Airlines tumbled 8.1 percent after the company said it had deferred the delivery of several Boeing and Airbus jets, in the latest sign of oversupply in the market for long-distance airliners. The news dragged down shares of other U.S. carriers, including Delta and United Continental . Microsoft, Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet are scheduled to report results after the bell. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,274 to 1,236. On the Nasdaq, 1,207 issues rose and 1,009 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 39 52-week highs and no lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 72 highs and 11 lows.

Source: AFP 1 May 2017 - 11:17 AM  UPDATED 5 HOURS AGO Tweet SpaceX has postponed the launch of a secretive US government payload known only as NROL-76 due to a "sensor issue" with the rocket, a spokesman said. "Out of an abundance of caution we have decided to scrub today's launch," a SpaceX spokesman said, describing the issue as relating to the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. The company said it will attempt another launch at 11.00am GMT on Monday. Standing down today due to a sensor issue; backup launch opportunity tomorrow morning. — SpaceX (@SpaceX) April 30, 2017 The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, will be the first military launch for the California-based aerospace company headed by billionaire tycoon Elon Musk. "As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts," a spokeswoman told AFP. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX stopped the launch of its Falcon 9 less than a minute before take off, citing an issue with one of the sensors. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force's practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches.  SpaceX was selected to launch NROL-76 "after a competition," said the NRO spokeswoman. She said she did not know when the contract was awarded. It was first announced last year. SpaceX regularly launches unmanned cargo ships to the International Space Station, and is working on a crew capsule that could carry humans into orbit as early as next year.

Print Story X Print Story National WAWaqar Ahmed May 1, 2017 Share Advertisement No halt to massive Indian weapon purchases There appears to be no end to the Indian defence purchases, especially since Narendra Modi came to power. Now there are reports that India is secretly purchasing weapons of billions of dollars on an emergency basis. The weapons that Indians are purchasing include anti-tank missiles, tank engines, rocket launchers, bullets of various calibers and different kinds of ammunition to be used in the battlefield. The secretive weapons shopping spree is more or less now in the open and would have strategic importance in the current scenario. Reports say that Russia is delivering several thousand anti-tank guided missiles, hundreds of T-90 main battle tank engines and other tank components. On the other hand, the Israelis are delivering unmanned aerial vehicles and several thousand missiles mainly for the Indian Navy. The Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) has mapped out that India needs $233 billion to meet its arms and equipment requirements in 11 years. This has been calculated according to the Long Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP) for 2012-2027.  The Indian Chief of Army Staff, General Bipin Rawat, has talked about the level of "hollowness" in the Indian Army "in case of a two-front war." Hollowness is a military term that describes both lack of stocks of critical items and obsolescence in weapon platforms. The army wants to equip all of its 382 infantry battalions and 44 mechanized infantry units with a fourth-generation shoulder-fired fire and forget anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system. India is procuring 321 ‘Spike’ systems, along with 8,356 missiles, from Israel and one medium-range surface-to-air missile (MRSAM) regiment, composed of 18 firing units.  The US defense contractor Boeing alone has won bids to supply the Indian military with 10 C-17 Globemaster-III strategic airlift aircraft (worth $4.1 billion), eight P-8I maritime patrol aircraft (worth $2.1. billion), 22 AH-64E Apache and 15 CH-47F Chinook helicopters (both helicopter deals have a combined worth of $2.5 billion).  Not to be left behind is the Indian Navy. Six Scorpene class are being built at the Mazagaon Docks expected to join the Navy by 2020. Purchase of six more was cleared in 2015. Also there is license production for Kamov 226 helicopters in India, purchase of 145 ultralight howitzer artillery guns from the US, purchase of 100 155mm tracked artillery guns, purchase of 280 aero engines from Honeywell for Jaguar aircraft and purchase of five units of Russian-made S-400 advanced air defense systems. The list goes on and on. One wonders with such massive military purchases, what kind of future India, where millions are still living below the poverty line and lack basic amenities including no proper shelters and toilets, would have. What message is the Indian prime minister giving to his neighbours? Would India not be better off today had these billions of dollars spent on the welfare of the Indian people?

But despite rumors to the contrary, she says she has no intention of leaving one for the other. “I am 150 percent committed to General Motors,” said Barra on a conference call announcing the company's first-quarter earnings, according to Motor Trend, when asked about the rumors of her departure. Barra sits on the President's Strategic and Policy Forum – an economic advisory council made up of some of America's top executives, past and present. Other members of the panel have included the heads of GE, IBM, Pepsi, Disney, and Boeing, as well as Elon Musk (Tesla) and Travis Kalanick (Uber). But as MT points out, it's often Barra that's positioned closest to the President in photos. Barra's participation and proximity have prompted some to speculate that she could leave for a senior position in the executive branch of the US federal government. Those could include chief administrator of the National Highway Traffic Administration, or (should the positions open up) even Secretary of Transportation, or of Commerce. However Barra, for the time being at least, remains fixated on her present job.

Here's what's known about the plan, which Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn debuted at a press conference, and its chances of eventually becoming law. It's only a loose outline This isn't like health care, where Speaker Paul Ryan put out a full bill ready to go with the White House's backing. The White House's tax plan leaves out a lot of important details, including basic information like which income ranges would fall into which tax brackets. Mnuchin said it represented their "core principles" but that they would fill in the rest with Congress.

Mnuchin boasted the proposal included "massive tax cuts" that would boost the economy. For individual taxes, it would shrink the number of brackets to three rates: 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent and double the standard deduction. Related: Here's What We Know About Those Tax Cuts But it would also raise revenue elsewhere by eliminating all deductions besides the ones on charitable donations and mortgage interest. The most contentious one to go would be the deduction on state and local taxes, which would disproportionately affect people in states and cities with higher tax rates. For corporate taxes, it would drop the current top rate of 35 percent to just 15 percent. Companies would be taxed under a territorial system in which they're only liable for income earned in America rather than the current worldwide system, which leaves them on the hook for income earned abroad as well. There would also be an unspecified one-time tax on corporate money held overseas. Especially notable is that the plan would allow "pass-through" entities, which let business owners treat their revenue as individual income, to qualify for the same 15 percent rate. It's big How big is unclear without more details, but outside groups estimated Trump's relatively similar campaign plan would have cost trillions of dollars and his new one is likely to do the same.

By his rough estimate, the new plan's new cuts would reduce revenues between $4 trillion and $6 trillion over the next decade while its offsets would bring in about $2.5 trillion. Mnuchin argues the plan will "pay for itself" by raising economic growth, but Cole is skeptical that's the case without significantly limiting its cuts. Maya MacGuineas, a leading fiscal hawk who heads the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, accused the White House in a statement of "using economic growth like magic beans" to hide their costs. Her group's early estimate of Trump's plan pegs its cost at $5.5 trillion without further offsets. People like Trump would benefit a lot "Pass-through" entities tend to benefit wealthy people like Trump, whose business empire includes a series of pass-throughs in which profits flow to him. The 15 percent rate would give the rich a giant incentive to route their income through pass-throughs to avoid the much higher 35 percent top rate on individual income. Mnuchin addressed this and said the White House would find a way to avoid letting wealthy people avoid paying higher rates, but he offered no details and some tax experts are skeptical this would be easy to accomplish in practice. "Ultimately, wealthy people with the best tax advisers will find ways around those rules," Lily Batchelder, a professor of law and public policy at New York University, told NBC News. The plan repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax, which is designed to ensure high earners pay at least some taxes even if they claim a large number of deductions. Trump's 2005 tax return, which journalist David Cay Johnston obtained in March, shows he paid $38 million in taxes on $152 million in income, but $31 million of his tax payment was due to the AMT. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks about the administration's tax reform plan during The Hill's Newsmaker Series at the Newseum in Washington on April 26. Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images Trump would eliminate the estate tax, which only affects inheritances larger than $5.5 million for individuals and $11 million for families and could save his children tremendous amounts of money. His plan would also remove a 3.8 percent surcharge on investment income created by the Affordable Care Act that only affects higher income taxpayers. By comparison, it's likely the benefits to middle and lower income taxpayers will be much more modest. While not a perfect comparison, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center of Trump's campaign plan found that the average gains for the top 0.1 percent of earners would be 14 percent of their after-tax income, versus just 1.8 percent for the middle fifth of earners and 0.8 percent for the poorest fifth. Depending on the details, Batchelder calculated that the proposed changes to deductions could increase taxes for many middle-income and lower-income taxpayers, including single-parent households and families with multiple children. Trump's tax returns are going to be an issue How much would Trump benefit from these changes? There's no way to know for sure. Trump has refused to make public his tax returns, breaking from decades of White House tradition, and Mnuchin said he had "no intention" to do so in the future. Democrats are already making this lack of information a key criticisms, saying the release of his returns should be a prerequisite for debating a package. It drops a crucial House Republican idea House and Senate GOP leaders put out a statement praising the president's proposals as "critical guideposts" and saying they shared the same goals of lowering rates and simplifying the tax code. But they're not all on the same page. Trump's plan abandoned a key part of the House Republican tax plan known as the border adjustment tax, which would have given greater tax preferences to American companies who primarily export goods in comparison to companies who import goods. The border adjustment tax provision divided the business community, with more import-heavy companies like Wal-Mart opposed and more export-heavy companies like Boeing supportive of the idea, and Republicans were split as well. But House GOP leaders argued it was necessary to raise revenue to help pay for the lower tax rates. Without it, some are skeptical they can afford deep cuts. "I'm a big supporter of the (border adjustment tax)," Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, a key Trump ally, told reporters on Wednesday. "If you take it out, that's all fine and good, but somebody's got to show me its still revenue neutral." Procedural rules could make it hard to pass Many Republicans are, like Trump, happy to assume big GDP growth from tax cuts will take care of concerns about the deficit even if most mainstream economists disagree. But another big reason Republicans are worried about offsetting cuts to corporate tax rates is procedural and it could complicate efforts to pass a bill. Just as they tried to do with health care legislation, Republicans are using a procedure called budget reconciliation that lets them pass a bill with only a simple majority in the Senate. The advantage is that they don't have to negotiate with Democrats, who Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he plans to ignore, but it comes with rules that limit what they can do.

This is why the Bush tax cuts, which passed through reconciliation, were only temporary. So could Trump do the same and settle for a major ten-year cut? There's actually more potential trouble: even temporary corporate tax cuts might allow companies to roll over savings beyond the ten-year window, thus increasing the deficit and triggering the Byrd Rule, which would scuttle a reconciliation bill. Ryan's own senior tax counsel, George Callas, warned at a panel discussion last week that the Byrd Rule made temporary tax cuts, even as short as three years, impossible without offsets. "Not only can that not pass Congress, it cannot even begin to move through Congress," Callas said. All of this creates a mess that could pit Republicans against the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation, which normally score legislation, and potentially create a showdown over Senate rules.

The passage of the bill requiring local police to help enforce federal immigration policy was a slam dunk for Republicans like Straus. But, in committee, the House had moved to soften a stricter measure approved previously by the state Senate that mandated that police only inquire about someone's immigration status after an arrest rather than after being just detained, which can include routine interactions like traffic stops. During 16 tense, sometimes tearful hours of floor debate last week, though, a key modification was approved moving the House version closer to what came out of the Senate. Authored by Rep. Matt Schaefer of Tyler, a leading conservative voice, the change was approved despite the bill's sponsor, Rep. Charlie Geren, and another top Straus lieutenant, Rep. Byron Cook, urging fellow Republicans to reject it. "Speaker Straus has always believed it is up to each member to decide how to vote in the best interest of his or her district," said Straus spokesman Jason Embry. Backing what opponents call the "show your papers" provision may say more about GOP lawmaker fears of appearing soft on immigration and facing 2018 Republican primary challenges than rebuking Straus. But it was his second setback of sorts in as many weeks. The other came when tea party House Republicans attached language to a bill on statewide regulation of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft that could supersede local ordinances in Austin and elsewhere. The change in the ride-hailing bill now defines "sex" as the "physical condition of being male or female." That's an indirect reference to the Legislature's hotly debated transgender "bathroom bill" — a separate piece of legislation which Straus has repeatedly opposed. Straus is far from facing a House mutiny like the one that felled his predecessor, Speaker Tom Craddick in 2007. He's crushed past, conservative activist-backed primary opponents in his San Antonio district and was re-elected unanimously to a record-tying fifth term as speaker to start the session. The House, meanwhile, has yet to pass the "bathroom bill," meaning Straus still has leverage over one of Texas' most closely watched issues. Still, it's a hint that Straus' traditional role as a moderate hand keeping the Legislature from drifting harder right may be facing more dissention than usual. Here are some other issues to watch this week in the Texas Legislature: ___ GUNS IN SCHOOL PARKING LOTS A bill allowing concealed carry permit holders to have guns in their locked cars parked outside schools could be approved for a House floor vote soon. The bipartisan proposal is aimed at teachers who want to keep guns in their cars. State law bans guns on school grounds, at least for now. The House Public Education Committee has heard the bill and a vote sending it to the full chamber could come this week. ___ IMMIGRANT DETENTION CHILD CARE A Senate bill that would classify immigration detention centers as child care facilities may have new life. The proposal had stalled in committee but was approved last week after a change that makes it expire after two years. It's now eligible for a floor vote, though the timing is uncertain. The bill would allow immigration lockups to hold parents and their children together for longer periods, something the Trump administration has committed to doing. Its most vocal proponent is GEO Group, the nation's second-largest private prison company, which operates a major family immigration detention center in Texas. ___ OPEN RECORDS BILLS Two bills approved by the Senate and designed to rollback Texas Supreme Court rulings that advocates say weakened open record laws have yet to hit the House floor — and the clock is ticking. One proposal mandates that governmental entities disclose contracts and other bidding process agreements. That would effectively undo the "Boeing decision" in 2016, when the court ruled that such records didn't have to be made public. A second softens a 2015 ruling which allowed fully or partially publicly funded entities to keep secret how they spend public money. Both remain stuck in the House Government Transparency and Operation Committee. Supporters worry they may not pass the committee, and the full House, with the May 29 end of the legislative session now looming. What to watch: Was 'sanctuary cities' vote a Straus rebuke?

Liftoff, which was scheduled for launch Sunday morning, is now slated for Monday at 7 a.m. ET from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch was scrubbed Sunday with just 52 seconds left in the countdown. SpaceX lead mechanical design engineer John Federspiel, who hosted the company’s webcast, said the SpaceX team decided to halt the launch “out of an abundance of caution” after noticing an issue with a sensor on the first-stage rocket booster. The customer for this launch is the National Reconnaissance Office, a U.S. government agency that develops and maintains spy satellites. The NRO says it surveys potential threats to the United States by tracking terrorists and monitoring the development of nuclear weapons in other countries. It can also provide an early warning of a potential missile strike. The payload for the Monday launch, which is being referred to as NROL-76, is classified. SpaceX shared no details on what type of surveillance the device will perform, how large it is or where in orbit it will be delivered. Sometime next year, SpaceX is scheduled to deliver GPS satellites into orbit for the Air Force. Musk has fought hard to win launch contracts with the U.S. government. Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) United Launch Alliance previously held a lock on that business, and Musk filed a lawsuit against the government in 2014 for the right to bid for military contracts. NASA is a longtime SpaceX customer. The company has conducted nine resupply missions to the International Space Station under NASA contracts since 2012. Monday’s launch is the first for SpaceX since the historic SES-10 mission last month. That mission marked the first time SpaceX launched a used first-stage rocket booster toward orbital space, marking a huge leap toward reaching SpaceX’s goal of drastically reducing the price of spaceflight. The ability to reuse rockets is key. The most expensive portion of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 which has a sticker price of $62 million — is the first-stage booster, which accounts for up to 70% of the cost, according to Musk. SpaceX will use a new rocket in Monday’s mission. But the company has plans to launch as many as six more missions with used rockets this year.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES MIAMI: SpaceX on Sunday postponed for 24 hours the launch of a secretive US government payload, known only as NROL-76, due to a “sensor issue” with the rocket, a spokesman said. “Out of an abundance of caution we have decided to scrub today’s launch,” a SpaceX spokesman said, describing the issue as relating to the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, will be the first military launch for the California basd aerospace company. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force’s practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches.

NEW DELHI: The proposed US H-1B visa restrictions may open a door for India’s IT industry in Russia with the two sides exploring cooperation in both software and hardware sectors during the visit of a Russian minister here last week. Rashid Ismailov, deputy minister of telecom and mass communication, who led a team of IT experts from Russia, not only explored cooperation with the Indian IT ministry but also held dialogue with members of NASSCOM, India’s apex software body on joint cooperation in software sector. Cooperation in the area of cyber-security to combat radical groups and other threats were also discussed between the visiting minister and Indian officials. St Petersburg International Economic Forum or SPIEF, to be held on June 1-3 and where India is the guest country this year, might witness certain concrete outcomes from the Indo-Russian partnership in IT sector, persons familiar with the developments said. Some members of NASSCOM are expected to take part in SPIEF where PM Narendra Modi is the guest of honour. It is no secret that neither Indian IT giants nor Russian IT industry have so far made inroads in each other’s countries notwithstanding their respective achievements over the past decades. While India has world class software industry, Russia has made substantial progress in the areas of computer programming, Artificial Intelligence and robotics. Skolkovo, the leading Russian technology hub, with partnerships with Boeing, IBM and MIT, is keen to partner Indian IT giants. This tech hub on the outskirts of Moscow comprises about 1,000 companies including startups. Indian oil companies have expressed interest in software for oil exploration developed by Rock Flow Dynamics, a Skolkovo-based company. Skolkovo is also known for developing technologies for smart cities and keen to enter Indian smart cities sector. Simultaneously, a lesser known fact is that India is establishing an IT cluster in Moscow. Russian officials point out that their IT firms have undertaken world class innovation but lack marketing and this is where Indian IT giants can assist creating a win-win situation for both sides. Recently the union cabinet approved a MoU to promote joint scientific and research activities between India and Russia. Under this MoU valid for five years, India and Russia will exchange information, establish direct connections between specialists, scientists and scientific organisations, form projects aimed at joint research and aim at development of interdisciplinary and multi-institutional projects with the involvement of industry.

Liftoff, which was scheduled for Sunday morning, is now slated for Monday at 7 a.m. ET from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX lead mechanical design engineer John Federspiel, who hosted the company’s webcast, said the SpaceX team decided to halt the launch “out of an abundance of caution” after noticing an issue with a sensor on the first-stage rocket booster. The customer for this launch is the National Reconnaissance Office — a U.S. government agency that develops and maintains spy satellites. The NRO says it surveys potential threats to the United States by tracking terrorists and monitoring the development of nuclear weapons in other countries. It can also provide an early warning of a potential missile strike. The payload for the Monday launch, which is being referred to as NROL-76, is classified. SpaceX shared no details on what type of surveillance the device will perform, how large it is or where in orbit it will be delivered. Sometime next year, SpaceX is scheduled to deliver GPS satellites into orbit for the Air Force. Musk has fought hard to win launch contracts with the U.S. government. Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s United Launch Alliance previously held a lock on that business, and Musk filed a lawsuit against the government in 2014 for the right to bid for military contracts. NASA is a longtime SpaceX customer. The company has conducted nine resupply missions to the International Space Station under NASA contracts since 2012. Monday’s launch is the first for SpaceX since the historic SES-10 mission last month. That mission marked the first time SpaceX launched a used first-stage rocket booster toward orbital space — marking a huge leap toward reaching SpaceX’s goal of drastically reducing the price of spaceflight. The ability to reuse rockets is key. The most expensive portion of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 — which has a sticker price of $62 million — is the first-stage booster, which accounts for up to 70% of the cost, according to Musk. SpaceX will use a new rocket in Monday’s mission. But the company has plans to launch as many as six more missions with used rockets this year. And SpaceX will attempt to recover the first-stage booster after Monday’s launch, setting up that rocket to potentially complete another mission in the future. 40.712784 -74.005941 Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

May 01, 2017 0657 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:191834 Publish Date: Sun, 30 Apr 2017 18:56:56 GMT Service: Iran Iran expects first ATR plane delivery soon Iran's national flag carrier Iran Air said it expects to receive the first of a series of planes purchased from ATR within two weeks. Iran Air Managing Director Farhad Parvaresh said this would be part of the first batch of four turboprops which would be delivered gradually to Iran over the next few months, Press TV reported. Parvaresh added that pilots had been sent to France for training. In April, Iran Air signed an agreement with the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer to purchase 20 medium-range turboprops. Parvaresh said the planes would be used for flights to Iran's provincial capitals as well as the islands in the Persian Gulf. He added that they could also be used for flights to Dubai or Baku. Last month, Iran's Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi said that providing small- to medium-range planes manufactured by the same company played a central role in the government's plan to rejuvenate Iran's air transportation fleet. Akhoundi added that the agreement with ATR had been devised to this effect. He further underlined that Iran Air would take delivery of all planes purchased from the European supplier within the next two years. US aviation giant Boeing has already signed a deal with Iran Air worth $16.6 billion to sell 80 planes to the company and has also concluded a $3-billion deal to sell another 30 to Iran's Aseman Airlines. Boeing's biggest European rival — Airbus — has signed another deal estimated to be worth $25 billion to sell 100 planes to Iran Air. Airbus has so far delivered three planes to Iran and more deliveries are expected in the near future.  Boeing's first delivery is to take place next spring.     KeyWords Iran ATR delivery   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News 3 candidates in Iran's pres. poll complain to election monitoring cmte.

(CNN) — Elon Musk’s SpaceX has pushed back its launch of a mysterious satellite for the U.S. intelligence community because of a sensor issue. Liftoff, which was scheduled for Sunday morning, is now slated for Monday at 7 a.m. ET from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX lead mechanical design engineer John Federspiel, who hosted the company’s webcast, said the SpaceX team decided to halt the launch “out of an abundance of caution” after noticing an issue with a sensor on the first-stage rocket booster. The customer for this launch is the National Reconnaissance Office — a U.S. government agency that develops and maintains spy satellites. The NRO says it surveys potential threats to the United States by tracking terrorists and monitoring the development of nuclear weapons in other countries. It can also provide an early warning of a potential missile strike. The payload for the Monday launch, which is being referred to as NROL-76, is classified. SpaceX shared no details on what type of surveillance the device will perform, how large it is or where in orbit it will be delivered. Sometime next year, SpaceX is scheduled to deliver GPS satellites into orbit for the Air Force. Musk has fought hard to win launch contracts with the U.S. government. Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) United Launch Alliance previously held a lock on that business, and Musk filed a lawsuit against the government in 2014 for the right to bid for military contracts. NASA is a longtime SpaceX customer. The company has conducted nine resupply missions to the International Space Station under NASA contracts since 2012. Monday’s launch is the first for SpaceX since the historic SES-10 mission last month.  That mission marked the first time SpaceX launched a used first-stage rocket booster toward orbital space — marking a huge leap toward reaching SpaceX’s goal of drastically reducing the price of spaceflight. The ability to reuse rockets is key. The most expensive portion of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 — which has a sticker price of $62 million — is the first-stage booster, which accounts for up to 70% of the cost, according to Musk. SpaceX will use a new rocket in Monday’s mission. But the company has plans to launch as many as six more missions with used rockets this year. And SpaceX will attempt to recover the first-stage booster after Monday’s launch, setting up that rocket to potentially complete another mission in the future.

Photo: AFP MIAMI - SpaceX on Sunday postponed for 24 hours the launch of a secretive US government payload, known only as NROL-76, due to a "sensor issue" with the rocket, a spokesman said. "Out of an abundance of caution we have decided to scrub today's launch," a SpaceX spokesman said, describing the issue as relating to the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. Another opportunity for launch opens on Monday at 7am. READ: SpaceX CEO Musk to present 'mind blowing' Mars plan The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, will be the first military launch for the California-based aerospace company headed by billionaire tycoon Elon Musk. "As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts," a spokeswoman told AFP. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force's practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches. SpaceX was selected to launch NROL-76 "after a competition," said the NRO spokeswoman. She said she did not know when the contract was awarded. It was first announced last year. SpaceX regularly launches unmanned cargo ships to the International Space Station and is working on a crew capsule that could carry humans into orbit as early as next year. AFP Comment Now!

Heathrow Airport. Reuters The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was the first time a near-miss incident involving more than one drone. The incident occurred over east London as an Airbus A320 was approaching Heathrow Airport on 20 November. The UKAB report concluded that the incident had "compromised the safety of the aircraft". "The board considers that the drone operator had endangered the A320 and its occupants," the report said. One pilot also said there would have been a "significant risk of collision" if the jet had been on a different approach path. The plane was flying at 5,500 feet when its crew spotted two white, orb-shaped drones nearby. The pilots "remained in constant visual contact" with the gadgets, which are estimated to have got as close as 500 metres to the aircraft, according to the report. Less than 30 minutes later, a Boeing 777 approaching Heathrow flew within 50 metres of what is believed to have been one of the drones, described as white, about 2 metres wide and with four prongs. It was believed to be one of the drones spotted earlier. According to the UKAB's monthly reports, there have been five near-misses between aircraft and drones in March, bringing the total to 62 over the past 12 months. Under CAA rules, drones must not be flown above 400 feet or near airports or airfields. Last year, more than 3,456 incidents involving drones were recorded, compared to only 1,237 in 2015. The incidents include invasions of privacy, disputes between neighbours and prison smuggling. #Boeing 777#Britain#Civil aviation authority#Drone#England#Heathrow airport#Near-miss#Newstracker#Scotland yard#Uk#Uk airprox board#United kingdom#United kingdon Published Date: Apr 30, 2017 03:55 pm | Updated Date: Apr 30, 2017 03:55 pm Also See Vijay Mallya arrested, granted bail: Extradition won't be easy, says legal experts Scotland Yard arrests man armed with knives near UK Parliament First 'Silk Road' train from London reaches China after completing 12,000-km journey T20 LEAGUE SCHEDULE Match Date Details 1 May 1 MI Vs RCB 2 May 1 RPS Vs GL 3 May 2 DD Vs SRH 4 May 3 KKR Vs RPS 5 May 4 DD Vs GL Full Schedule Top Stories That Vinod Khanna photograph: Obituary on the death of Human Decency and Privacy Don't Criticise Party in Media, Arvind Kejriwal Warns MLAs IPL 2017: Sandeep Sharma returns to dismantle Delhi Daredevils as Kings XI Punjab bowlers finally deliver Hindi debate: Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rejects DMK's charge of language imposition Multiple credit cards can knock down your credit score — use them well RERA myths busted: No big relief for stuck home buyers, house prices won't rise Turkey president Erdogan urges multilateral approach to Jammu and Kashmir; backs India, Pakistan for NSG Left-led Kerala govt will be first in country to provide insurance, free medical treatment for migrant workers Cricket Scores Current & Recent Upcoming Indian Premier League, 2017 HYD Vs KOL Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 48 runs Pakistan in West Indies, 3 Test Series, 2017 WI Vs PAK Live Now Indian Premier League, 2017 PUN Vs DEL Kings XI Punjab beat Delhi Daredevils by 10 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 GUJ Vs MUM Gujarat Lions tied with Mumbai Indians (Mumbai Indians win Super Over by 5 runs) Indian Premier League, 2017 PNE Vs BLR Rising Pune Supergiant beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by 61 runs Indian Premier League, 2017 PUN Vs HYD Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Kings XI Punjab by 26 runs Indian Premier League, 2017 KOL Vs DEL Kolkata Knight Riders beat Delhi Daredevils by 7 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 BLR Vs GUJ Gujarat Lions beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by 7 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 PNE Vs KOL Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rising Pune Supergiant by 7 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 BLR Vs HYD Match Abandoned Indian Premier League, 2017 MUM vs BLR - May 1st, 2017, 04:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 PNE vs GUJ - May 1st, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 DEL vs HYD - May 2nd, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 KOL vs PNE - May 3rd, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 DEL vs GUJ - May 4th, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Ireland in England, 2 ODI Series, 2017 ENG vs IRE - May 5th, 2017, 03:30 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 BLR vs PUN - May 5th, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 HYD vs PNE - May 6th, 2017, 04:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 DEL vs MUM - May 6th, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Ireland in England, 2 ODI Series, 2017 ENG vs IRE - May 7th, 2017, 03:30 PM IST Site Index हिंदी फर्स्टपोस्ट About Firstpost Newsletter RSS Twitter Facebook Sections Front Page Politics Sports India World Business Life Entertainment Photos Videos Plus India Open 2017 New Delhi Mumbai Photos Videos FP Exclusives Cartoons Video Room eBooks Weather Others Sample Papers Online Business Technology News MTV India Online Shopping in India Delhi MCD Elections 2017 Results - Live Counting Delhi MCD Elections 2017 South Delhi MCD Election Ward List 2017 North Delhi MCD Election Ward List 2017 East Delhi MCD Election Ward List 2017 IPL 2017 E-Learning Franchise Opportunity Tools RSS Feeds Apps iOS Android Copyright © 2017.

Robins, 84, who retired from the company 14 years ago, is understood to have hired defence lawyers as the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) considers pressing charges against individuals. Rolls-Royce, which makes jet engines for Airbus’s A380 double-decker and Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, was humbled in January when it was fined £671m for more than two decades of corruption in a dozen countries. The judge who approved the deferred prosecution agreement reached between the SFO and Rolls said the FTSE 100 giant’s “most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption” appeared to implicate “controlling minds of the company”.

Eric Gay The Associated Press State Politics April 30, 2017 7:50 PM Was ‘sanctuary cities’ vote a Straus rebuke? By Will Weissert The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story AUSTIN Was the Texas House “sanctuary cities” debate a defeat for Speaker Joe Straus? The passage of the bill requiring local police to help enforce federal immigration policy was a slam dunk for Republicans like Straus. But, in committee, the House had moved to soften a stricter measure approved previously by the state Senate that mandated that police only inquire about someone’s immigration status after an arrest rather than after being just detained, which can include routine interactions like traffic stops. During 16 tense, sometimes tearful hours of floor debate last week, though, a key modification was approved, moving the House version closer to what came out of the Senate. Authored by Rep. Matt Schaefer of Tyler, a leading conservative voice, the change was approved despite the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Charlie Geren of Fort Worth, and another top Straus lieutenant, Rep. Byron Cook, urging fellow Republicans to reject it. “Speaker Straus has always believed it is up to each member to decide how to vote in the best interest of his or her district,” said Straus spokesman Jason Embry. Backing what opponents call the “show your papers” provision may say more about GOP lawmaker fears of appearing soft on immigration and facing 2018 Republican primary challenges than rebuking Straus. But it was his second setback of sorts in as many weeks. The other came when Tea Party House Republicans attached language to a bill on statewide regulation of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft that could supersede local ordinances in Austin and elsewhere. The change in the ride-hailing bill now defines “sex” as the “physical condition of being male or female.” That’s an indirect reference to the Legislature’s hotly debated transgender “bathroom bill” — a separate piece of legislation that Straus has repeatedly opposed. Straus is far from facing a House mutiny like the one that felled his predecessor, Tom Craddick, in 2007. He has crushed past conservative-activist-backed primary opponents in his San Antonio district and was re-elected unanimously to a record-tying fifth term as speaker to start the session. The House, meanwhile, has yet to pass the “bathroom bill,” meaning Straus still has leverage over one of Texas’ most closely watched issues. Still, it’s a hint that Straus’ traditional role as a moderate hand keeping the Legislature from drifting harder right may be facing more dissension than usual. Here are some other issues to watch this week in the Texas Legislature. Guns in school parking lots A bill allowing concealed-carry permit holders to have guns in their locked cars parked outside schools could be approved for a House floor vote soon. The bipartisan proposal is aimed at teachers who want to keep guns in their cars. State law bans guns on school grounds, at least for now. The House Public Education Committee has heard the bill and a vote sending it to the full chamber could come this week. Immigrant detention childcare A Senate bill that would classify immigration detention centers as childcare facilities may have new life. The proposal had stalled in committee but was approved last week after a change that makes it expire after two years. It’s now eligible for a floor vote, though the timing is uncertain. The bill would allow immigration lockups to hold parents and their children together for longer periods, something the Trump administration has committed to doing. Its most vocal proponent is GEO Group, the nation’s second-largest private prison company, which operates a major family immigration detention center in Texas. Open-records bills Two bills approved by the Senate and designed to roll back Texas Supreme Court rulings that advocates say weakened open-record laws have yet to hit the House floor — and the clock is ticking. One proposal mandates that governmental entities disclose contracts and other bidding process agreements. That would effectively undo the “Boeing decision” in 2016, when the court ruled that such records didn’t have to be made public. A second softens a 2015 ruling that allowed fully or partially publicly funded entities to keep secret how they spend public money. Both remain stuck in the House Government Transparency and Operation Committee. Supporters worry they may not pass the committee with the May 29 end of the legislative session now looming.

Failing that, they asked friends to give their legs a good, hard pull as they dangled from the gallows to ensure their death. Their freshly hanged bodies, they knew, would be handed to scientists for anatomical studies. They didn't want to survive the hanging and regain consciousness while being dissected. If George Foster, executed in 1803, had woken up on the lab table, it would have been in particularly undignified circumstances. In front of an enthralled and slightly horrified London crowd, an Italian scientist with a flair for showmanship placed an electrode into Foster's rectum. Some onlookers thought Foster was waking up. The electrically charged probe caused his body to flinch and his fist to clench. Applied to his face, electrodes made his mouth grimace and an eye twitch open. The scientist had modestly assured his audience that he wasn't actually intending to bring Foster back to life, but added, "Who knows what might happen?" The police were on hand, in case Foster needed hanging again.

You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. Foster's body was being galvanised - a word coined for Luigi Galvani, the Italian scientist's uncle. In 1780s Italy, Galvani had discovered that touching the severed legs of a dead frog with two different types of metal caused the legs to jerk. Wrong in a useful way Galvani thought he had discovered "animal electricity", and his nephew was carrying on the investigations. Galvanism briefly fascinated the public, inspiring Mary Shelley's novel, Frankenstein. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Galvani discovered frogs' legs would twitch when touched by electrodes Galvani was wrong. There is no animal electricity. You can't bring hanged bodies back to life, and Victor Frankenstein's monster remains safely in the realms of fiction. But Galvani was wrong in a useful way, because he showed his experiments to his friend Alessandro Volta, who had better intuition about what was going on. The important thing, Volta realised, wasn't that the frog flesh was of animal origin. It was that it contained fluids which conducted electricity, allowing a charge to pass between the different types of metal. When the two metals connected - Galvani's scalpel touching the brass hook on which the legs were hung - the circuit was complete, and a chemical reaction caused electrons to flow. Volta experimented with different combinations of metal and different substitutes for frogs' legs. In 1800, he showed that you could generate a constant, steady current by piling up sheets of zinc, copper and brine-soaked cardboard. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alessandro Volta described his findings in a letter to the President of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks, in March 1800 Volta had invented the battery, and gave us a new word - volt. His insight won him admirers. Napoleon made him a count. The lithium breakthrough But it wasn't especially practical, not at first. The metals corroded, the salt water spilled, the current was short-lived, and it couldn't be recharged. It was 1859 before we got the first rechargeable battery, made from lead, lead dioxide and sulphuric acid. It was bulky, heavy, and acid sloshed out if you tipped it over. But it was useful - the same basic design still starts our cars. The first "dry" cells - the familiar modern battery - came in 1886. The next big breakthrough took another century. In 1985, Akira Yoshino patented the lithium-ion battery, later commercialised by Sony. Lithium was popular with researchers as it's very light and highly reactive: lithium-ion batteries can pack lots of power into a small space. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lithium-ion batteries power many popular devices. Unfortunately, lithium also has an alarming tendency to explode when exposed to air and water, so it took some clever chemistry to make it acceptably stable. Without the lithium-ion battery, mobiles would likely have been much slower to catch on. Consider what cutting-edge battery technology looked like in 1985. Motorola had just launched the world's first mobile phone, the DynaTAC 8000x. Known affectionately as "the brick", it weighed nearly 1kg. Its talk time was 30 minutes. More from Tim Harford Just google it: How one company came to dominate search Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff Rise of the robots: What advances mean for workers The technology behind lithium-ion batteries has certainly improved: 1990s laptops were clunky and discharged rapidly. Today's sleek ultraportables will last for a long-haul flight. Still, battery life has improved at a much slower rate than other laptop components, such as memory and processing power. Where's the battery that's light and cheap, recharges in seconds, and never deteriorates with repeated use? We're still waiting. But there is no shortage of researchers looking for the next breakthrough. Some are developing "flow" batteries, which work by pumping charged liquid electrolytes. Image copyright Harvard SEAS Image caption Harvard researchers working on "flow" batteries have identified a new class of organic molecules, inspired by vitamin B2, that can safely store electricity Some are experimenting with new materials to combine with lithium, including sulphur and air. Some are using nanotechnology in the wires of electrodes to make batteries last longer. But history counsels caution: game changers haven't come along often. Can batteries boost the grid? In the coming decades, the truly revolutionary development in batteries may not be in the technology itself, but in its uses. We think of batteries as things that allow us to disconnect from the grid. We may soon see them as the thing that makes the grid work better. Gradually, the cost of renewable energy is coming down. But even cheap renewables pose a problem - they don't generate power all the time. You'll always have a glut of solar power on summer days and none on winter evenings. When the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing, you need coal or gas or nuclear to keep the lights on, so why not run them all the time? Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Solar panels cannot deliver power all the time - even in sunny spots A recent study of south-eastern Arizona's grid weighed the costs of power cuts against the costs of CO2 emissions, and concluded that solar should provide just 20% of power. And Arizona is pretty sunny. Grids need better ways of storing energy to better exploit renewable power. One time-honoured solution is pumping water uphill when you have spare energy, and then - when you need more - letting it flow back down through a hydropower plant. But that requires conveniently contoured terrain. Could batteries be the solution? Perhaps. It depends partly on the extent to which regulators nudge the industry in that direction, and on how quickly battery costs come down. Elon Musk hopes they'll come down very quickly indeed. The entrepreneur behind electric car maker Tesla is building a gigantic lithium-ion battery factory in Nevada. Musk claims it will be the second-largest building in the world, after the one where Boeing manufactures its 747s. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Quick-charging car batteries are essential for electric cars Tesla is betting that it can significantly wrestle down the costs of lithium-ion production, not through technological breakthroughs, but through sheer economies of scale. Tesla needs the batteries for its vehicles, of course. But it's also among the companies already offering battery packs to homes, businesses and power grids. If you have solar panels on your roof, a battery in your house gives you the option of storing your surplus day-time energy for night-time use, rather than selling it back to the grid. We're still a long way from a world in which electricity grids and transport networks can operate entirely on renewables and batteries. But in the race to limit climate change, the world needs something to galvanise it into action. The biggest impact of Alessandro Volta's invention may be only just beginning.

What to watch: Was 'sanctuary cities' vote a Straus rebuke? Associated Press | AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Was the Texas House "sanctuary cities" debate a defeat for Speaker Joe Straus? The passage of the bill requiring local police to help enforce federal immigration policy was a slam dunk for Republicans like Straus. But, in committee, the House had moved to soften a stricter measure approved previously by the state Senate that mandated that police only inquire about someone's immigration status after an arrest rather than after being just detained, which can include routine interactions like traffic stops. During 16 tense, sometimes tearful hours of floor debate last week, though, a key modification was approved moving the House version closer to what came out of the Senate. Authored by Rep. Matt Schaefer of Tyler, a leading conservative voice, the change was approved despite the bill's sponsor, Rep. Charlie Geren, and another top Straus lieutenant, Rep. Byron Cook, urging fellow Republicans to reject it. "Speaker Straus has always believed it is up to each member to decide how to vote in the best interest of his or her district," said Straus spokesman Jason Embry. Backing what opponents call the "show your papers" provision may say more about GOP lawmaker fears of appearing soft on immigration and facing 2018 Republican primary challenges than rebuking Straus. But it was his second setback of sorts in as many weeks. The other came when tea party House Republicans attached language to a bill on statewide regulation of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft that could supersede local ordinances in Austin and elsewhere. The change in the ride-hailing bill now defines "sex" as the "physical condition of being male or female." That's an indirect reference to the Legislature's hotly debated transgender "bathroom bill" — a separate piece of legislation which Straus has repeatedly opposed. Straus is far from facing a House mutiny like the one that felled his predecessor, Speaker Tom Craddick in 2007. He's crushed past, conservative activist-backed primary opponents in his San Antonio district and was re-elected unanimously to a record-tying fifth term as speaker to start the session. The House, meanwhile, has yet to pass the "bathroom bill," meaning Straus still has leverage over one of Texas' most closely watched issues. Still, it's a hint that Straus' traditional role as a moderate hand keeping the Legislature from drifting harder right may be facing more dissention than usual. Here are some other issues to watch this week in the Texas Legislature: ___ GUNS IN SCHOOL PARKING LOTS A bill allowing concealed carry permit holders to have guns in their locked cars parked outside schools could be approved for a House floor vote soon. The bipartisan proposal is aimed at teachers who want to keep guns in their cars. State law bans guns on school grounds, at least for now. The House Public Education Committee has heard the bill and a vote sending it to the full chamber could come this week. ___ IMMIGRANT DETENTION CHILD CARE A Senate bill that would classify immigration detention centers as child care facilities may have new life. The proposal had stalled in committee but was approved last week after a change that makes it expire after two years. It's now eligible for a floor vote, though the timing is uncertain. The bill would allow immigration lockups to hold parents and their children together for longer periods, something the Trump administration has committed to doing. Its most vocal proponent is GEO Group, the nation's second-largest private prison company, which operates a major family immigration detention center in Texas. ___ OPEN RECORDS BILLS Two bills approved by the Senate and designed to rollback Texas Supreme Court rulings that advocates say weakened open record laws have yet to hit the House floor — and the clock is ticking. One proposal mandates that governmental entities disclose contracts and other bidding process agreements. That would effectively undo the "Boeing decision" in 2016, when the court ruled that such records didn't have to be made public. A second softens a 2015 ruling which allowed fully or partially publicly funded entities to keep secret how they spend public money. Both remain stuck in the House Government Transparency and Operation Committee. Supporters worry they may not pass the committee, and the full House, with the May 29 end of the legislative session now looming. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

PHOTO: REUTERS In a surprising incident, a passenger plane heading to Heathrow airport in London nearly missed colliding with two drones, the Independent reported. The white-orb shaped drones were spotted flying just below the airplane by crew members on the Airbus A320. According to the report issued by the United Kingdom Airprox Board [UKAB], “at first, the pilot thought they were toy balloons, but they appeared to be twice the size of a standard child’s helium balloon. As the turn onto the localiser continued, the objects did not move, despite the wind being 270/30kts, one was estimated to be at 5,500ft and the other at 4,500ft, both were hovering over the uniform stratus cloud layer, which was at 4,000ft.” Passenger drones to buzz across Dubai skies starting July “Although avoiding action was unnecessary, the proximity of the drones compromised the safety of the aircraft both due to their proximity but also because of the distraction that they created to ensure there was no collision risk,” the report concluded. Civil Aviation Authority told the Independent that it “was the first time a near-miss incident involved more than one drone.” The newspaper also adds that one of the drones was spotted half an hour later, flying some 50 metres away from Boeing B77. French army grooms eagles to down drones The UKAB has recorded 62 near-misses between aircraft and drone in the last 12 months with five in the month of March alone while the police claims drone related incidents to have increased by 352 per cent in one year.
