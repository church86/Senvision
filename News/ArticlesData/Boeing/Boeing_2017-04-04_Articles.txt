A March 20 audit by the VA inspector general had found that nearly a third of calls to the Veterans Crisis Line as recently as November were bounced to backup centers run by an outside contractor, as well as other problems including weak leadership and inadequate data to measure the quality of calls. The rollover calls happen when phone lines are busy, leading to possible waits of 30 minutes or more. It was an early test for new VA Secretary David Shulkin, who has made suicide prevention a signature issue at the troubled agency, riven with scandal in recent years since reports of delays in treatment at veterans' hospitals. Approximately 20 veterans take their lives each day. Testifying before a House panel, Steve Young, VA's deputy undersecretary for health for operations and management, pointed to a dramatic turnaround in calls answered by the hotline since November. He said it was now a "rare instance" that calls are bumped to a backup center and that calls are answered by live counselors within 8 seconds, on average. Boeing signs $3B deal with Iran airline TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm's work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran's third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. 59.6-carat diamond sells for record $71M Sotheby's sold a 59.6-carat pink diamond for about $71 million in Hong Kong, setting the world record for the top auction price for any gem. The stone has an an unusual distinction: It has attracted even higher bids in the past. Hong Kong-based jewelry retailer Chow Tai Fook had the HK$553 million winning bid for the Pink Star after a five-minute contest that included three phone bidders, Sotheby's said Tuesday. The oval-shaped diamond dethroned the Oppenheimer Blue, which fetched $58 million in May at Christie's. In a quirk of auction history, the record price for the Pink Star is some $12 million lower than the $83 million offer Sotheby's adjudicated it for in 2013. That sale collapsed because the buyer, diamond-cutter Isaac Wolf, never paid, and Sotheby's had to reclaim the stone. The sale gives the auction house some respite after it failed to sell other major gems last year, including the biggest rough diamond found in more than 100 years and a blue diamond ring that once belonged to Hollywood actress Shirley Temple. × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

The agreement also includes options for 32 additional aircraft, as well as money for long-lead parts for future orders. After exercising all options, the total contract value will be $6.8 billion. This comprehensive award reflects a commitment by Boeing and the Navy to achieve pricing and production stability, two keys of successful program performance. “The P-8A is a textbook example of Boeing’s commercial derivative expertise,” said Jamie Burgess, vice president of Boeing Military Aircraft’s Mobility, Surveillance & Engagement division and the P-8 program manager. “Every day our customers get to fly incredible aircraft that perform exceptionally well and are built by the best of Boeing.” The Navy will receive 11 aircraft, while Australia will expand its P-8A fleet with four more. The U.K.’s first two P-8A jets are part of the agreement, with first delivery set for 2019. Boeing so far has delivered 53 Poseidons to the Navy and two to the Royal Australian Air Force. Based on Boeing’s Next-Generation 737-800 commercial airplane, the P-8A offers the world’s most advanced anti-submarine, anti-surface warfare and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. The U.S. Navy has deployed multiple squadrons around the globe since operations began in 2013, accumulating more than 96,000 flight hours to date. The Indian Navy currently flies the P-8I variant of the aircraft. They have received eight aircraft to date and in July 2016 signed a contract for four additional P-8Is.

MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Ty Wright. By WP Bloomberg Apr 1, 2017 at 7:54 am | Print View If President Donald Trump gets confrontational with Chinese President Xi Jinping over trade at their Mar-a-Lago summit in Florida in April, the Chinese leader will have potential allies in some surprising places — namely, Austin, Sacramento and Olympia. The economic ties that bind China to the U.S. are primarily regional and run deep. Now, with a wild card in the White House, the Chinese want even more leverage should bilateral trade relations get hammered. China’s Ministry of Commerce says it’s working to expand various investment agreements with California, Texas, Iowa and other states, deals it estimates were worth $2.5 billion to U.S. and Chinese businesses in 2016 alone. “‘A good relationship between two nations is based on close connection between their peoples,’” said Sun Jiwen, a spokesman for the ministry, citing an old Chinese saying. “Province-state and intercity economic partnerships provide an important foundation for China-U. S. economic ties.” While the outreach is a continuation of regional ties promoted for several years by Xi, it’s taken on added urgency as Trump’s economic team weighs whether to follow through on campaign-trail promises of tariffs of as much as 45 percent on Chinese goods. Part of the thinking is that making more American friends outside Washington could slow the push for protectionist measures, according to a person involved in the ministry’s campaign who asked not to be identified discussing its internal deliberations. If such cooperation flourishes, “it will not be easy for anyone to shake,” says He Weiwen, a former ministry official who’s now deputy director of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization. Attention has focused on the massive trade deficit in trade of goods with China — $347 billion in 2016, almost half of the U.S. total. But China, with its 1.37 billion people, is also among the top three export markets for 33 states. Texas oil and gas producers, Michigan automakers and Georgia paper mills would all suffer if China were to impose import restrictions in response to American tariffs. China has also ramped up its investments in the U.S. — by one estimate, they tripled last year to $45.6 billion — which helps create the jobs Trump has promised. U.S.-China trade ties aren’t solely between Zhongnanhai and the White House. They’re forged in places like Moraine, Ohio, where American workers are employed by Fuyao Glass, a Chinese-owned company that bought part of a shuttered General Motors plant in 2014. Many of China’s cross-border investments are welcomed locally and aren’t the kind of deals that draw scrutiny from the U.S. government, which reviews foreign purchases for national security concerns. In Lancaster, California, a desert town north of Los Angeles hit hard by the financial crisis, the Republican mayor, R. Rex Parris, in 2008 began courting the Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co., which is part-owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. “Saved our city,” he says of BYD’s electric bus plant in Lancaster. BYD now employs almost 500 there and anticipates tripling that within three years. “I’m telling people, ‘you’re going to have to not want a job to not have one,’” says Parris, who expects the local unemployment rate to drop to 2 percent. China’s Ministry of Commerce began formalizing the provincial-state ties in 2012, when Xi visited the U.S. and talked with governors including Iowa’s Terry Branstad, an old friend from a 1980s cultural exchange, about boosting trade opportunities. California, Texas, Iowa, Michigan, New York, the state of Washington and the city of Chicago have since signed agreements with the Ministry of Commerce, calling for regular trade visits, business matchmaking and other exchanges. The deals cover 25 Chinese provinces and cities, which sent 22 delegations to the U.S. in 2016 while the U.S. organized 14 trips to China, according to the ministry. Officials and executives from Shanghai made two visits last year to Chicago, which helped convince the popcorn maker Garrett Popcorn to choose the city for its first store in mainland China, according to a statement from Shanghai’s commerce commission. In the manufacturing hub of Guangdong, officials plan a slate of cooperative activities this year, among them setting up a regional trade office in Los Angeles, hosting a biotech delegation from Massachusetts and sending representatives to an “Invest in America” summit sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Guangdong Commerce Department said in a written statement. Bob Honts, the owner of Texas Lone Star Enterprises in Austin, Texas, accompanied Texas governor Rick Perry on a trade mission to China in 2014. Honts, whose company raises investment money under the EB-5 visa program, says Chinese immigrants have put $200 million into real estate, oil exploration and other ventures in the state. “To ignore the Chinese is like you’ve got this racecar and you’re using three cylinders out of eight,” says Honts, a Republican. “You can’t do that. We need to work with China.” Trump hasn’t resolved tension in his administration between hard line advisers like Stephen Bannon, who has called for “economic nationalism,” and such moderate voices as Branstad, who’s now slated to become Trump’s ambassador to China. Few companies have more to lose from a trade war than Boeing, which makes most of its commercial jetliners in Washington state and has collected $60.2 billion from deliveries to China since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That far outweighs the $800 million to $1 billion that Boeing spends a year on aircraft parts made in the People’s Republic, joint ventures and other operations. At Boeing Field in Seattle, many of the 737s lined up for testing are Chinese domestic carriers. But if would-be Chinese buyers get caught in the middle of a trade war, “they will simply buy Airbus,” says Gary Locke, a former governor of the state who was also ambassador to China under former President Barack Obama. The state’s director of commerce, Brian Bonlender, went to China in preparation for a visit from provincial officials that had been planned for June but now has been pushed back to September and a planned trade mission led by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee in August. Bonlender says his counterparts at the ministry in China have been more “engaged” and “helpful” since Trump’s election — and seem especially focused on finding Chinese businesses with advanced ideas for investment projects and bringing them to the state’s attention. “We’re very encouraged” by the increased outreach, Bonlender says, adding that it’s likely due in part to the “changing tenor of international engagement” under Trump.

Most Popular ULA By David Grossman Apr 4, 2017 Proving that inspiration can come from all places, Boeing has adapted amusement park zip lines for use as emergency exit systems on its CST-100 Starliner crewed spacecraft. Boeing is working closely with United Launch Alliance (ULA)—the company's joint venture with Lockheed Martin to build rockets—to certify the Starliner for crewed missions to the International Space Station in the coming years. One thing they still need to do? Develop an emergency egress system. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The zip lines were installed by Terra Nova LLC, which has previously built the largest zip line in the world at 8,350 feet long in Mexico. If the hardware is good enough to take people a mile and a half over the hills of Chihuahua, Mexico, it's good for astronauts in an emergency. In the event of an emergency before the rocket engines are lit, such as a fire in the capsule, astronauts can leave though an emergency exit and zip line down to safety from the top of the rocket. Most Popular There's already an abort system in place for after the rocket engines are ignited—the astronauts are ejected from the capsule to parachute down to safety. But NASA also requires a method of escape for before the ignition. The requirement makes sense to ULA. "If we have pressure instability in tanks, I think that's probably the biggest one; shorts in an electrical system, things like that, things that could cascade and develop into a pretty significant event," said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president. Terra Nova's new zip lines are modified to suit ULA and Boeing's unique needs. The system would be mounted on the crew access tower, close to the rocket. In an emergency scenario, the astronauts could feel their way through the smoke (the system is designed to be navigable by touch), exit their hatch, strap themselves to a seat and pull a pair of brake-control handles to start down the wire. While less scenic than the forests of West Virginia, if the quick trip can meet NASA's rigorous standards than it might become a regular feature on future trips to space.

The Boeing 9N-ACB was flown to Bangkok airport last Friday and has remained grounded since then. Sources at NAC said that the management failed to replace “protective breathing equipment” that is installed on airplanes to supply oxygen to crewmembers. The breathing device should be replaced every 10 years. “Knowing that the device life has expired and it needed to be changed, the management did not show any concern,” said the source. It would not take more than an hour to install the protective breathing equipment if the device was brought in Nepal, said the sources. “However, the aircraft was flown to Bangkok airport last Friday knowing that that the life of the device has expired.”   According to NAC officials, the device has been ordered from Atlanta in the US. Sources said that the management negligence would cost millions in losses for the corporation. “The plane has been grounded at the peak tourist season and all its bookings have been cancelled.” Likewise, the corporation has to pay hefty parking charges at the airport. The issue was also discussed at the NAC’s board meeting on Sunday. “It’s sheer negligence from the management and also a serious issue that could cost dearly to the national flag carrier,” said Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, a board member of NAC representing Tourism Ministry. “The issue will be investigated.” NAC Spokesperson Rabindra Shrestha said that the 9N-ACB Boeing has been grounded at the Bangkok airport due to some technical reason. He did not elaborate the technical reason, but said that the device that needs to be replaced has been ordered already. The carrier to auction one of its Boeing 757 Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) has said an auction notice will be issued this week to sell one of its two vintage Boeing 757s. The corporation had received the go-ahead from its board of directors last month to sell the plane. The national flag carrier has set a minimum sale price of $1.7 million for its 30-year-old Karnali bearing registration number 9N-ACA. “All the documents required to issue auction notice has been finalized,” said NAC Spokesperson Rabindra Shrestha. “We have planned to issue global notice on Thursday.” The 9N-ACA arrived in Nepal in 1987 and flew on long-haul routes, displaying the national flag at world airports. The 757 holds 190 passengers and is of the ‘combi’ variety with a forward cargo hatch. The Boeing 757 is a mid-sized, narrow body twin-engine jet built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was in production from 1981 to 2004.

Olivier Douliery/Bloomberg Trump administration drops human rights in new Bahrain F-16 deal Turkish trader suspected of bypassing Iran sanctions hires Rudy Giuliani as attorney Indifferent to Assad, anti-Iran: Trump's Syria policy baffles experts Iran's Aseman Airlines has signed a tentative deal to buy at least 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets, in the first new business with the U.S. plane maker since President Donald Trump took office vowing to take a tougher stance towards Iran.  Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy.  Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said on Tuesday representatives of Aseman and Boeing had signed an agreement in Tehran covering as many as 60 jets, including options, after a year of negotiations.  Boeing described the deal as a "memorandum of agreement," meaning it is only outline for the time being and subject to government approvals. It covers plans for Aseman to buy 30 aircraft with options for a further 30, it added.  FILE PHOTO: A member of the media uses a smartphone to take a photograph of a Boeing Co. 737 Max aircraft during preparations ahead of the Farnborough International Airshow 2016 in Farnborough, U.K., Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg If completed, the main part of the deal for 30 jets would be worth $3.4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically pay around half that. Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities.  Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact, but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord, which the U.S. aerospace industry says would support his agenda for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs.  Washington last month imposed separate sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities following a ballistic missile test. Iran retaliated with its own sanctions.  In a statement on the Aseman deal, Boeing cited U.S. Department of Commerce data suggesting an "aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States".  Turboprop Talks Boeing deliveries to Aseman would start in 2022, although the U.S. plane maker must first apply for licenses from the U.S. Treasury allowing it to proceed with the sale.  One of the Boeing's 737 MAX 9 model, the company's newest commercial airplane, sits outside its production plant, in Washington, U.S., March 2017.Elaine Thompson/AP "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval," it said.  In December the European Union banned Aseman from flying to the EU due to safety concerns, highlighting gaps in Iran's ageing fleet following decades of sanctions.  The latest deal comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's government strives to highlight improvements resulting from the nuclear pact in the run-up to May presidential elections. So far IranAir has received three new Airbus jets under the deal.  Rouhani is likely to run a campaign highlighting economic benefits of the nuclear deal, which opened Iran to foreign investment. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Rouhani must do more to improve the economy.  Negotiators from European turboprop maker ATR were meanwhile due in Tehran to wrap up a deal to sell 20 aircraft to IranAir, industry sources said. The first aircraft has been sitting on the tarmac in Toulouse, France, for weeks, waiting for the talks to be completed.  A deal for the airframes has already been reached but there has been uncertainty over the status of a separate deal needed for the engines, to be supplied by Pratt & Whitney Canada.  The company is a subsidiary of United Technologies, one of a handful of aerospace and defense groups covered by last month's retaliatory sanctions by Tehran against U.S. firms, though Iran has not explicitly targeted civil aircraft engines. Iranian officials have told Reuters finalizing the ATR deal depends on getting a contract for engine spares and long-term maintenance of the engines once the planes are delivered.  Pratt & Whitney Canada had no immediate comment.  Reuters Reuters Send me email alerts for new articles by Reuters Send Close Email * Please enter your email Reuters For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

Boeing Co. announced Tuesday, April 4, 2017 that it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines for 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File ) TEHRAN, Iran – Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. “On the one hand, there’s the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. “They’ll have to make tough decisions.” Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation. Aseman is Iran’s third-largest airline by fleet. , flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran “on notice” when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. “This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran’s regional role,” Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” it said. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Stay Informed.

Roston - Apr 4, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Boeing has taken the wraps off its new Deep Space Gateway, a concept habitat that could serve as a crucial component for getting humans to Mars. According to Boeing, the company will use NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) to send the Deep Space Gateway up into space ‘in the early 2020s,’ doing so in four launches with components to assemble the habitat. Humans could use this as a stopping point of sorts on their way to Mars. The Deep Space Gateway can be thought of as something like the International Space Station, in that it could help with the exploration of space and accept shipments of various sorts, as well as accommodating humans who are on their way to other parts of space. For example, Boeing says this habitat could end up being ‘the waypoint for Mars missions.’ The company envisions a docking system not unlike what is found on the ISS, and it could be used to take on the Deep Space Transport vehicle for an eventual mission to Mars. The habitat would keep astronauts safe from space’s many harsh elements. That is all a vision for the distant future, however. On the immediate level, Boeing says the Deep Space Gateway will be sent into space near the Moon, where it’ll help provide a space for conducting critical research, and could also be used as part of commercial and government partnerships for the aforementioned mission (or others) into deep space. The habitat will be powered by a Solar Electric Propulsion system, the technology for which is partly being developed alongside NASA.

Unlike previous iterations of the Advanced Super Hornet—which Boeing was positioning to compete head-to-head with the stealthy single engine F-35—this version is a more modest effort designed to work with the Joint Strike Fighter and the Naval Integrated Fire Control Counter Air (NIFC-CA) network. “We’ve been working with the Navy over the last year—year-and-a-half—to understand what does the carrier air wing need from a complementary perspective with the F-35, with the [EA-18G] Growler, E-2D and Block III is that” Dan Gillian, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F program manager told The National Interest at the Navy League’s Sea Air and Space conference. “Block III is that complementary asset.” Compared to the 2013 version of the jet, Boeing is placing less emphasis on stealth, but the aircraft does retain some of the older concepts low observable enhancements, Gillian said. “That’s not what the future fight is about,” Gillian said. “The threat has migrated all over the place. Enough stealth is important but you don’t need it all the time all the stealth you could possibly get.” The major features that the new version retain from the 2013 concept are conformal fuel tanks. The new conformal fuel tanks add 3,500lbs of fuel to the jet and extend the aircraft’s range by nautical miles. “The conformal tanks are important since to need to get weapons out at range,” Gillian said. The new Block III also adds a new computer, new large-area cockpit display, a high-band width Tactical Targeting Network Technologies (TTNT) datalink, a new fuel tank-mounted long-wave infrared search and track system (IRST) and new integrated defensive electronic countermeasure Block IV suite. Additionally, the Block III Super Hornet will be built with a life-extended 9000-hour airframe life. Perhaps the most important upgrade is long-range IRST system—which is designed to be a counter-stealth sensor, Gillian said. the Navy considers to essential to countering new enemy stealth aircraft such as the Chinese J-20 and Russian PAK-FA. Gillian that Boeing and Navy solved many of the traditional issues associated with infrared sensors—but didn’t go into detail. Company officials have previously said the new IRST is able to derive accurate range data—enough to cue weapons. Gillian said that all of the new Block III aircraft Boeing delivers to the Navy will have these enhanced features, however, they could be retrofitted to older aircraft during a mid-life upgrade. The Block III could enter production in the 2020s, but that package of systems could begin retro fits shortly after. “By doing both those things, you could bring the inventory levels of the Block III up much faster,” Gillian said. The Navy has yet to decide how many Block III jets it will need, but the company can move relatively quickly in ramping up production. “We think we can get one squadron per carrier by the early to mid 20s,” Gillian said.

Boeing's Proposed Deep Space Explorer Will Be Our Stepping Stone To Mars Rae Paoletta Apr 5, 2017, 10:30am ⋅ Filed to:  boeing deep space mars space Share With everyone in such a rush to get the hell off this planet, we're gonna need some pretty sophisticated digs to ferry us to the Moon, Mars and beyond. Thankfully, Boeing's all over it: On April 3, the company revealed its concepts for a lunar outpost and a deep space explorer. I'm not one to dole out compliments, but damn do they look good. Image: Boeing While details are still pretty thin on the timeline for these bad boys, there are a few things we know for sure: Boeing plans to use NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) — which, upon completion, will be the most powerful rocket the agency has ever built — in order to send a habitat into the Moon's orbit. This outpost, dubbed the Deep Space Gateway, will be similar to the International Space Station (ISS) in that it will create a space to do scientific research while providing a destination for transportation vehicles to dock. In theory, Boeing's Deep Space Transport vehicle could stop there on its way to the Red Planet, likely carrying humans. "The ability to simultaneously launch humans and cargo on SLS would allow us to assemble the gateway in four launches in the early 2020s," Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing's space exploration division, said in a statement. Image: Boeing According to Boeing, both the Deep Space Gateway and the Deep Space Transport vehicle will utilise solar electric propulsion technology. The Deep Space Transport vehicle will have some sort of unspecified system to protect passengers from the harsh radiation from deep space, as it could pose a significant risk to their health. Then again, anything that has to do with the cold, unfeeling vacuum of the final frontier is going to come with some sort of risk. Though it will definitely take a while to get this space station and its intrepid explorer into space, I'm sure it will be worth the wait. WATCH MORE: Science & Health News Comments Peter Mullins Guest Apr 5, 2017, 1:22pm I don't get it. Really, why do we need a "Deep Space Gateway" - a mini ISS - orbiting the Moon? Other than enriching Boeing with billions of dollars of government revenue for years to come, it would serve very little purpose and absorb the $$$ that could be better spent on actually getting to Mars: 1) We could use it as a test bed for radiation shielding and other technologies needed for missions to Mars - but we can do that already on Earth or in high Earth orbit (cheaper and with less risk). 2) IF it were part of a Earth-Moon transportation system, obviating the need for a separate command module being sent with every crew (remember the Apollo missions) then it might make sense - but that is not the stated/intended purpose. 3) It makes sense as a stop on the way to Mars though, right? No. It requires more fuel to Lunar orbit and then to Mars than to go directly from Earth - and the journey would take longer (more radiation exposure, more complexity, more costs, more risks, etc.). The Deep Space Gateway might make sense if it were in high Earth orbit or perhaps Mars orbit - as part of an Earth-Mars transportation system - not in Lunar orbit. The truth is that NASA views manned Mars missions as too dangerous (consider the poor success rate of Mars missions to date - circa 50% - then add keeping people alive and returning them to Earth on top of that). Boeing knows this and is giving NASA a way to delay any real attempt at Mars for another generation or so while still sucking up huge amounts of government funding for relatively little return. I'm just calling it like I see it. Reply 0 anon @anon Apr 5, 2017, 4:42pm Bingo! This is just another distraction and dash for NASA funding. Sadly NASA have lost their way and the more money we pile into the moon the longer it'll take to really find signs of life. And as you say if it was in a Mars Orbit that would make total sense. Having a base from Mars would be a massive achievement, it also then opens the gateway to the rest of the solar system. One planet at a time. On habitats, the Bigelow B330 is much closer to reality and needs a smaller launch vehicle to get it into space. The SLS is unproven and is another Space Shuttle white elephant program, IMHO. Meanwhile SpaceX continues to do the impossible and yet this still isn't enough for a lions share of NASA's budgets. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Streaming music came not long after -- Spotify was founded in 2008, and competitors were close on its heels. In 2017, the answer you'd get could not be more different. Vinyl is cool again, as much as it ever has been if not moreso. The power of the internet, too, is changing the way that vinyl records are thought up and sold.

The Memorandum of Agreement, which includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAXs, is subject to government approval. Boeing in a statement said it had been authorised by the US government to negotiate the agreement following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord signed in 2015. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval,” the statement said. If the order is approved, deliveries would start in 2022. Boeing has already signed an order with an Iranian carrier since the US lifted restrictions on sales there. In December 2016 Iran Air ordered 80 Boeing aircraft including 50 737 MAX 8s and 30 777s. Delivery of those planes will start next year. Airbus has also done significant business in Iran recently with a December deal to sell 100 aircraft, worth up to USD$18 billion at list prices. Iran Air received the first of that order, an A321, in January.

(Associated Press files) By NASSER KARIMI and JON GAMBRELL, NASSER KARIMI and JON GAMBRELL, Associated Press Published: April 4, 2017, 4:50 PM A   A TEHRAN, Iran — Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. “On the one hand, there’s the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. “They’ll have to make tough decisions.” Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran’s third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran “on notice” when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. “This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran’s regional role,” Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” it said. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Aboulafia, the aviation analyst, said ultimately the sales wouldn’t change Iran’s status in the Gulf, already home to three major long-haul carriers, or greatly affect Boeing’s bottom line. “This is not a market that means a great deal anymore,” he said. “It attracts headlines — and it has all kinds of political headaches and conflicts associated with it — but Iran as a world hub of aviation isn’t what it was.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

The layoffs include 1,500 mechanics and more than 300 engineers. Back in December , the company told employees it would thin out the workforce by the end of the year because of dwindling sales prospects and tough competition. The company said competitors at Airbus were streamlining their own operations.  Right now, Boeing employs more than 71,000 workers at its Washington plant.  Just last month, President  Donald Trump traveled  to Boeing's South Carolina plant to tout the company's accomplishments.

The agreement, marking its first plane sale to Iran under President Trump, also provides the airline with purchase rights for 30 additional planes. *Read more*: Boeing hits back at Airbus claims it would relish Brexit fallout According to the US department of commerce, an aerospace sale of this size creates or sustains around 18,000 jobs in the US. There had been uncertainty over the new administration's tolerance for US business dealings in Iran. Boeing had previously agreed a $16.6bn sale in Iran after the nuclear deal struck with Tehran under the Obama administration, something Trump has been a vocal critic of. Boeing said it had negotiated the memorandum of agreement under authorisation from the US government, "following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord signed in 2015". Iran's deal with world powers, limiting its enrichment of uranium in return for the removal of some international sanctions, allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. The aerospace giant said it continued to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran's airlines and any contracts with the carriers are contingent upon government approval. At the very beginning of Trump's presidency, some of his policy announcements had caused uncertainty for the company; risking disrupting business relations with China which is Boeing's biggest single jetliner customer. And in December, Trump tweeted threatening to cancel plans for new presidential jets. Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg reached out to the President and has since developed closer ties. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072 The President visited Boeing's campus in South Carolina last month to attend the unveiling of Boeing's new 787-10 Dreamliner, cementing more positive relations. *Read more*: Trump wants Boeing's Air Force One contract cancelled over cost » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Recent related news Boeing Roundup: $3 billion 737 deal with Iran… Poseidon sub-hunter jet deal worth $2 billionChicago-based Boeing (NYSE: BA) has operations around the country.

More About: Trump and Manufacturing Getty Images Advertisement Boeing Co. landed its second jetliner sale to an Iranian airline since the 1970s, a $3 billion deal that sets up a test of the planemaker’s ties with President  Donald Trump. The pact with Iran Aseman Airlines to purchase 30 of Boeing’s 737 Max planes adds to a separate $16.6 billion agreement with Iran Air, which the Chicago-based manufacturer is still finalizing. If completed, the transactions would be the first U.S. aircraft exports to Iran since the Shah era. The latest jet transaction puts Trump’s policy of promoting U.S. manufacturing jobs into conflict with the administration’s vow to take a tougher stance on the Islamic Republic. If the White House thwarts Boeing’s dealmaking, it also risks tilting the playing field in favor of Europe’s Airbus Group SE just as global jet sales are slowing, said aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia. Boeing may be “setting themselves up for conflict with the Trump administration or Republicans in general,” said Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group. “To a certain extent they are imposing a level of conflict on Republicans because they are going to have to balance manufacturing jobs to export markets with getting tough on Iran. It’s tough to thread that needle.” Popular Now How to Build More Impactful Centers of Excellence Best Practices for Using Value Stream Mapping as a Continuous Improvement Tool 10 Strategies for Managing Suppliers Boeing shares rose 0.8% to $178.07 at 2:02 p.m. in New York. The gain was the third largest among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Iran Debate Airbus and Boeing have been making inroads in Iran since the Obama administration and other world powers agreed to lift sanctions on commercial-jet sales in reward for a nuclear agreement. Whether the U.S. manufacturer closes the transactions is far from certain, given the hostility by hard-liners in Iran and some Republicans in Congress to measures that would restore trade. “It’s concerning,” Senator Marco Rubio told reporters in the Capitol when asked about the deal. Asked if he could or would do anything to block it, the Florida Republican said, “Maybe.” Financing the multibillion-dollar purchases also will be a challenge given the restrictions still in place on lenders doing business with Iranian companies, Aboulafia said. Aircraft lessors may be hesitant to provide financing if the threat of renewed sanctions raises a risk they couldn’t reclaim the planes if Iranian carriers defaulted. While Iran wants to upgrade its museum-vintage fleet because of safety concerns, it isn’t clear the Middle Eastern country would be able to absorb the hundreds of aircraft it is ordering from Boeing and Airbus. “If you add it all up, Iran needs nothing like the number of jetliners they are committing to. It’s not clear they can afford them either,” Aboulafia said. U.S. Jobs The Iran Aseman deal, announced in a statement Tuesday on Boeing’s website, provides the airline with an option to buy 30 additional 737 Max planes. Deliveries of the single-aisle jet are scheduled to start in 2022. The value is based on list prices, which typically are heavily discounted. A sale of that size would create or sustain about 18,000 U.S. jobs, Boeing said, citing Commerce Department calculations. The company said it would seek purchase approval from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland who is the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said there is little Congress can do to block the plane sale as long as it meets the terms set out in the nuclear deal. That was echoed by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who has been a leading voice against the nuclear deal. No Involvement “I have opposed the Iranian agreement and I am not interested in doing anything to help the Iranians but what they’ve done is completely legal,” McCain said. “They’ve got the money and it’s not a weapons system, so it doesn’t require any involvement from the Congress.” The purchase would help modernize Iran Aseman’s fleet after the carrier in December was banned by the European Union for “unaddressed deficiencies.” The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has maintained a blacklist of airlines since 2006 after a series of crashes prompted European governments to seek a uniform approach to airline safety. The Iranian carrier operates 33 planes, including two Boeing 737s and five Boeing 727s, according to its website. Almost half of the fleet consists of Fokker 100 aircraft. The airline reached an earlier pact to lease seven Airbus planes. Airbus Rivalry Boeing’s December agreement with Iran Air was the first of its kind since the Islamic Revolution. The company’s last airplane deliveries to Iran were 747 jumbos that arrived in 1977, according to the company’s website. While Boeing and Iran’s flag carrier are still working out final terms for deliveries that would begin next year, Airbus has delivered the first aircraft for its separate $19 billion sale. “The contract agreement we signed late last year had contingencies on it that are still being worked,” Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman, said by email. On the campaign trail, Trump attacked a planned center to paint Boeing 737s in China and later blasted the contract for the Air Force One presidential aircraft as too costly. Subsequent meetings with Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg brought a significant thaw. Trump in February attended the rollout of a new Boeing jet from a factory in South Carolina, extolling the “beautiful” carbon-composite 787-10 and praising the CEO as “a very, very tough negotiator.” Congressional Moves The House in November passed legislation along party lines attempting to block Boeing from financing aircraft sales to Iran, but that measure didn’t move in the Senate before that session of Congress ended. The House hasn’t yet revived the bill this year.  Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee and at least a dozen other Republican and Democratic senators introduced a bill last month that seeks to expand sanctions on Iran over its ballistic-missile development, support for terrorism and human rights violations, according to a statement. Those would be targeted against people involved with Iran’s ballistic missile program and those that transact with them, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Republicans in Congress strongly opposed the 2015 agreement between the U.S. and five other nations, including Russia, designed to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran agreed to redesign and reduce its nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Trump campaigned against the deal, which he said was bad for American interests and security. He said during a series of election rallies that he would tear it up and renegotiate it, but he hasn’t yet taken public steps to scrap the accord.

(Jason Redmond/Reuters) By Aaron Gregg By Aaron Gregg April 4 at 6:45 PM Follow @Post_AG Boeing said Tuesday it has signed a $3 billion deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines for 30 new jetliners, building on a previous $16.6 billion order struck with another Iranian carrier. The deal, which must be cleared by the Treasury Department, is the first sizable U.S. business transaction announced with the Islamic republic since Donald Trump was elected president. It is made possible by the lifting of economic sanctions by the Obama administration last year in exchange for concessions on Iran’s nuclear program, an agreement that Trump maligned on the campaign trail as “horrible” and threatened to renegotiate. Boeing’s latest announcement puts the Trump administration in the awkward position of choosing between taking a harsher stance against Iran and boosting a major manufacturer, one of the United States’ largest exporters. The tentative agreement commits Boeing to delivering 30 of its 737 MAX airplanes starting in 2022 and gives the Iranian airline the option of acquiring 30 additional planes. The deal follows a $25 billion Iranian order with France’s Airbus, which competes closely with Boeing for international business. “Boeing has to be everywhere that Airbus is,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the nonprofit Lexington Institute, which receives funding from Boeing. If Aseman Airlines opts for all the extra aircraft, the value of the deal could balloon to nearly $6 billion, and deliveries to Iran could begin in 2019, a Boeing representative said. An Aseman Airlines spokesman told the Associated Press that deliveries would begin in 2019, suggesting the airliner will take advantage of some of the 30 extra planes. Some analysts have wondered whether the Iranian airlines can afford to buy so many Boeing and Airbus planes. And there is also the uncertainty about whether the Trump administration will clear the Boeing deal. Although the president has pledged to revive U.S. manufacturing, as a candidate he also frequently criticized the Iran nuclear agreement and threatened to renegotiate it. He has yet to take serious steps to do so, but as president he has continued to complain about the terms. Last month, Trump said on Twitter that the agreement gave Iran a $150 billion “lifeline,” presumably referring to previously held-up Iranian assets that some analysts say are actually closer to $100 billion. When he was still Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn said that Iran was “officially on notice” after it conducted a missile test in February. Frosty diplomatic relations between Washington and Tehran have already imperiled other U.S. companies’ business in Iran. Last week, Tehran slapped sanctions on 15 U.S. companies, including defense contracting giant Raytheon, as retaliation for earlier sanctions imposed by the United States. In its statement Tuesday, Boeing touted the potential of the 737 deal with Iran to boost U.S. jobs, saying the agreement “creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States.” The announcement comes as Boeing is laying off engineers in Washington, California and South Carolina amid broader cost-cutting measures. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval,” Boeing said in the statement. business capitalbusiness true Please provide a valid email address.

Republicans seeking to punish Iran oppose the agreement, though they may be powerless to stop it. Members of Congress opposed to a 2015 nuclear agreement – signed by Iran and the US, among others – that lifted some economic sanctions on Iran expressed dismay with the Boeing announcement. The 2015 pact limited Tehran's nuclear capabilities while easing sanctions imposed by the US on Iran and Iranian firms. US Senator Marco Rubio (R-Florida) said the deal with an Iranian company is "concerning," Bloomberg News reported, adding that he "maybe" will consider working to block it. Yet Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) and John McCain (R-Arizona) said there isn't much Congress can do to stop the deal. "I have opposed the Iranian agreement and I am not interested in doing anything to help the Iranians but what they’ve done is completely legal," McCain said, according to Bloomberg News. "They’ve got the money and it’s not a weapons system, so it doesn’t require any involvement from the Congress." #Iran's Aseman Airline signed big deal w/ @Boeing in #Tehran to purchase 60 '737 Max' planes pic.twitter.com/CISF0HhZtV— Reza Khaasteh (@Khaaasteh) April 4, 2017 On Tuesday, Boeing confirmed signing an agreement with Iran Aseman Airlines for the 737s, delivery of which would begin in 2022. The deal comes with an option of 30 or more 737 MAX planes at a later date. Citing the US Department of Commerce, Boeing said the deal "creates or sustains" around 18,000 jobs in the US. The deal must be approved by the US government before it is finalized, Boeing said. The announcement comes months after Boeing agreed to a separate, $16.6 billion deal with Iran Air for 80 passenger planes. Boeing's dealings with Iranian companies indicate the multinational aerospace and defense company wants to be the first in 40 years to sell and export American aircraft to Iranian entities. Boeing said its negotiations were authorized by the US government and based on Iran's compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement. Read more Tehran threatens clawbacks if Washington scuttles Boeing deal The deal came about after several rounds of talks between the two companies in the past year. He added that the two companies signed the deal on March 18, Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told AP. During his campaign for president, Donald Trump joined most congressional Republicans in opposing the nuclear agreement that involved a relief of sanctions. Two months ago, the administration levied new sanctions against certain individuals and businesses under Iran sanctions authority. "Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile. Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!" Trump tweeted in early February after reports of Iran missile test. Trump added: "Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion." In addition, Iran is part of the Trump administration's travel ban, currently undergoing legal challenges in multiple federal courts. However, Trump has also vowed to provide an additional boost to the American manufacturing sector. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control will ultimately decide the deal's fate. In November, the US House of Representatives approved legislation that aimed to bar  commercial airline deals with Iran, yet the US Senate did not address the legislation. Based on the beginning of a new congressional session in January, the House would have to pass another measure to revive the effort in 2017. Aseman was blacklisted by the European Union in December based on safety issues, AP reported. Aseman also recently entered into a seven-plane agreement with European company Airbus. Iran Air also recently signed an agreement with Airbus for 118 planes worth $25 billion.

Boeing landed its second jetliner sale to an Iranian airline since the 1970s, a $3 billion (NZ$4.3b) deal that sets up a test of the planemaker's ties with President Donald Trump. The pact with Iran Aseman Airlines to purchase 30 of Boeing's 737 Max planes adds to a separate $16.6b (NZ$23.8b) agreement with Iran Air, which the Chicago-based manufacturer is still finalizing. If completed, the transactions would be the first US aircraft exports to Iran since the Shah era. The latest jet transaction puts Trump's policy of promoting US manufacturing jobs into conflict with the administration's vow to take a tougher stance on the Islamic Republic. If the White House thwarts Boeing's dealmaking, it also risks tilting the playing field in favor of Europe's Airbus Group just as global jet sales are slowing, said aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia. Boeing may be "setting themselves up for conflict with the Trump administration or Republicans in general," said Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group. "To a certain extent they are imposing a level of conflict on Republicans because they are going to have to balance manufacturing jobs to export markets with getting tough on Iran. It's tough to thread that needle." Boeing shares rose 0.8 per cent to $178.07 (NZ$255) at 2:02 p.m. in New York. The gain was the third largest among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Airbus and Boeing have been making inroads in Iran since the Obama administration and other world powers agreed to lift sanctions on commercial-jet sales in reward for a nuclear agreement. Whether the US manufacturer closes the transactions is far from certain, given the hostility by hard-liners in Iran and some Republicans in Congress to measures that would restore trade. Continued below. Related Content Which is the biggest airline of them all? Annika Streefland: Pay equity is achievable Your Views: Readers' Letters "It's concerning," Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters in the Capitol when asked about the deal. Asked if he could or would do anything to block it, the Florida Republican said, "Maybe." Financing the multibillion-dollar purchases also will be a challenge given the restrictions still in place on lenders doing business with Iranian companies, Aboulafia said. Aircraft lessors may be hesitant to provide financing if the threat of renewed sanctions raises a risk they couldn't reclaim the planes if Iranian carriers defaulted. If you add it all up, Iran needs nothing like the number of jetliners they are committing to. It's not clear they can afford them either. Richard Aboulafia While Iran wants to upgrade its museum-vintage fleet because of safety concerns, it isn't clear the Middle Eastern country would be able to absorb the hundreds of aircraft it is ordering from Boeing and Airbus. "If you add it all up, Iran needs nothing like the number of jetliners they are committing to. It's not clear they can afford them either," Aboulafia said. The Iran Aseman deal, announced in a statement Tuesday on Boeing's website, provides the airline with an option to buy 30 additional 737 Max planes. Deliveries of the single-aisle jet are scheduled to start in 2022. The value is based on list prices, which typically are heavily discounted. A sale of that size would create or sustain about 18,000 U.S. jobs, Boeing said, citing Commerce Department calculations. The company said it would seek purchase approval from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Sen. Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland who is the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said there is little Congress can do to block the plane sale as long as it meets the terms set out in the nuclear deal. That was echoed by Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who has been a leading voice against the nuclear deal. The contract agreement we signed late last year had contingencies on it that are still being worked. "I have opposed the Iranian agreement and I am not interested in doing anything to help the Iranians but what they've done is completely legal," McCain said. "They've got the money and it's not a weapons system, so it doesn't require any involvement from the Congress." The purchase would help modernize Iran Aseman's fleet after the carrier in December was banned by the European Union for "unaddressed deficiencies." The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has maintained a blacklist of airlines since 2006 after a series of crashes prompted European governments to seek a uniform approach to airline safety. The Iranian carrier operates 33 planes, including two Boeing 737s and five Boeing 727s, according to its website. Almost half of the fleet consists of Fokker 100 aircraft. The airline reached an earlier pact to lease seven Airbus planes. Boeing's December agreement with Iran Air was the first of its kind since the Islamic Revolution. The company's last airplane deliveries to Iran were 747 jumbos that arrived in 1977, according to the company's website. While Boeing and Iran's flag carrier are still working out final terms for deliveries that would begin next year, Airbus has delivered the first aircraft for its separate $19 billion sale. To a certain extent they are imposing a level of conflict on Republicans because they are going to have to balance manufacturing jobs to export markets with getting tough on Iran. It's tough to thread that needle. "The contract agreement we signed late last year had contingencies on it that are still being worked," Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman, said by email. On the campaign trail, Trump attacked a planned center to paint Boeing 737s in China and later blasted the contract for the Air Force One presidential aircraft as too costly. Subsequent meetings with Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg brought a significant thaw. Trump in February attended the rollout of a new Boeing jet from a factory in South Carolina, extolling the "beautiful" carbon-composite 787-10 and praising the CEO as "a very, very tough negotiator." The House in November passed legislation along party lines attempting to block Boeing from financing aircraft sales to Iran, but that measure didn't move in the Senate before that session of Congress ended. The House hasn't yet revived the bill this year. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee and at least a dozen other Republican and Democratic senators introduced a bill last month that seeks to expand sanctions on Iran over its ballistic-missile development, support for terrorism and human rights violations, according to a statement. Those would be targeted against people involved with Iran's ballistic missile program and those that transact with them, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Republicans in Congress strongly opposed the 2015 agreement between the U.S. and five other nations, including Russia, designed to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran agreed to redesign and reduce its nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Trump campaigned against the deal, which he said was bad for American interests and security. He said during a series of election rallies that he would tear it up and renegotiate it, but he hasn't yet taken public steps to scrap the accord.

Boeing Co announced on April 4 that it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines for 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft. (AP) DUBAI/PARIS, April 4, (RTRS): Iran’s Aseman Airlines has signed a tentative deal to buy at least 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets, in the first new business with the US planemaker since President Donald Trump took office vowing to take a tougher stance towards Iran. Owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran’s third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy. Iran’s official Islamic Republic News Agency said on Tuesday representatives of Aseman and Boeing had signed an agreement in Tehran covering as many as 60 jets, including options, after a year of negotiations. Boeing described the deal as a “memorandum of agreement,” meaning it is only outline for the time being and subject to government approvals. It covers plans for Aseman to buy 30 aircraft with options for a further 30, it added. If completed, the main part of the deal for 30 jets would be worth $3.4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically pay around half that. Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities. Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact, but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord, which the US aerospace industry says would support his agenda for protecting US manufacturing jobs. Washington last month imposed separate sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities following a ballistic missile test. Iran retaliated with its own sanctions. In a statement on the Aseman deal, Boeing cited US Department of Commerce data suggesting an “aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States”. Boeing deliveries to Aseman would start in 2022, although the US planemaker must first apply for licences from the US Treasury allowing it to proceed with the sale. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval,” it said. In December the European Union banned Aseman from flying to the EU due to safety concerns, highlighting gaps in Iran’s ageing fleet following decades of sanctions. The latest deal comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s government strives to highlight improvements resulting from the nuclear pact in the runup to May presidential elections. So far IranAir has received three new Airbus jets under the deal. Rouhani is likely to run a campaign highlighting economic benefits of the nuclear deal, which opened Iran to foreign investment. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Rouhani must do more to improve the economy.

Iran agreed to redesign and reduce its nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Mr. Trump campaigned against the deal, which he said was bad for American interests and security. He said during a series of election rallies that he would tear it up and renegotiate it, but he hasn’t yet taken public steps to scrap the accord.

Print Email Lee Roop | lroop@al.com By Lee Roop | lroop@al.com The Huntsville Times Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 04, 2017 at 2:55 PM, updated April 04, 2017 at 2:59 PM comments Boeing unveiled preliminary design concepts this week for a deep space station that would orbit the moon as a base for humans to safely explore space from the moon to Mars. The concept drawings and details were released Tuesday at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colo. At the same time, Boeing also unveiled a first look at a transport system that could ferry astronauts from the deep space station to Mars. Boeing was one of six companies NASA selected in 2016 to develop prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats and transport vehicles. The others are Bigelow Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada and NanoRacks. This illustration shows Boeing's idea for a "Deep Space Transit Vehicle" that could ferry astronauts on missions from a moon-orbiting space station to the moon or Mars. (Boeing illustration)  Called the Deep Space Gateway, the habitat would be a base for research, a safe haven for astronauts in the dangerous radiation of deep space, and a dock for a transport vehicle that would ferry astronauts from the station to Mars and back. The transport vehicle drawing suggests NASA may not be looking to the Orion capsule to make the journey to Mars. "The ability to simultaneously launch humans and cargo on SLS would allow us to assemble the gateway in four launches in the early 2020s," Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing's space exploration division, said in releasing the drawings. SLS is the Space Launch System NASA is now building, and the space agency plans to fly it once a year after its first two proving flights. The vehicle is being designed in Alabama at the Marshall Space Flight Center. Both Boeing concepts unveiled this week use solar electric propulsion technology leveraged from Boeing satellites. Where Boeing might build the station and transport wasn't immediately clear. The company built major parts of the International Space Station in Huntsville at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.   Must-see concerts in Alabama this year ...

U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing said April 4, 2017 that Iran's Aseman Airlines had agreed to buy 30 737 MAX jets for $3 billion.  (JASON REDMOND / AFP/Getty Images)   By Nasser Karimi Jon GambrellThe Associated Press Tues., April 4, 2017 TEHRAN, IRAN—Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. U.S. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. “On the one hand, there’s the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice-president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. “They’ll have to make tough decisions.” Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran’s third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Article Continued Below Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some $25 billion. Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 per cent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran “on notice” when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. “This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran’s regional role,” Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” it said. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Aboulafia, the aviation analyst, said ultimately the sales wouldn’t change Iran’s status in the Gulf, already home to three major long-haul carriers, or greatly affect Boeing’s bottom line. “This is not a market that means a great deal anymore,” he said. “It attracts headlines — and it has all kinds of political headaches and conflicts associated with it — but Iran as a world hub of aviation isn’t what it was.” Read more about: Donald Trump, Boeing, Iran, United States Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

 Boeing just sold Iran another $3 billion of jets Benjamin Zhang Apr. 4, 2017, 2:22 PM 1,585 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing 737MAX 8 take off.Boeing On Tuesday, Boeing announced that Iran's Aseman Airlines has agreed to a deal for more than 30 next generation 737MAX airliners. The memorandum of understanding calls for the purchase of 30 Boeing 737s along with purchase rights for an additional 30 aircraft. At list prices, the 30 MAX airliners are worth more than $3 billion, although the carrier likely received significant bulk discounts that could cut the value of the deal in half. The agreement has not been finalized and will be reviewed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. Citing data from the US Department from Commerce, an aerospace deal of this magnitude creates or sustains roughly 18,000 jobs, Boeing wrote in a statement. Aseman is the Iran's third largest airline behind Mahan Air and flag carrier Iran Air. According to Airfleets.net, Aseman currently operates an older fleet of more than 30 Airbus and Boeing aircraft with an average age of 23.6 years of age. Sale of commercial aircraft to Iran has been a controversial topic. In December, Chicago-based company finalized a $16.6 billion deal with the Iranian government for 50 Boeing 737 and 30 Boeing 777 jets after being held up by members of Congress as well as the US Office of Foreign Assets Control.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint The Boeing Co. announced a tentative agreement on Tuesday to sell up to 60 737s to an Iranian airline, a transaction valued at $6 billion that appears very likely to test the Trump administration's avowed hostility toward Iran. Boeing, the nation's leading commercial aerospace company and a top exporter, said in a statement that the agreement, which requires U.S. government approval, would create about 18,000 American jobs. The company's agreement with Aseman Airlines, a privately owned Iranian carrier, is the first to be announced by any big U.S. company with Iran since Donald Trump took office in January. Boeing announced an agreement last December to sell 80 commercial aircraft to Iran Air, the national carrier, a deal valued at $16.6 billion. Commercial aircraft sales to Iran are permitted under the nuclear agreement reached in 2015 involving Iran and major global powers, including the United States. The agreement relaxed many economic sanctions against Iran in return for the country's verifiable pledges that its nuclear work would be peaceful in nature. Trump has repeatedly denounced the nuclear agreement, describing it as a giveaway to a country that he and his aides have called a leading state sponsor of terrorism and a destabilizing force in the Middle East. But Trump also has vowed to protect U.S. industries and workers from foreign competition. Aerospace analysts said that together, Boeing's deals with Iran amount to a test of the Trump administration's priorities. If Boeing is forbidden to sell the aircraft to Iran, plane makers in other countries might fill the gap. "There was always going to be a clash over this issue," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation research consultancy in Fairfax, Va. "Trump campaigned on getting tough with Iran," Aboulafia said, but "at the end of the day, these are manufacturing jobs. It's really hard to say, 'Yes, we are giving this work to the Europeans.' " The Boeing announcement contrasted with other signs of growing hostility between the Trump administration and Iran. Last month, the United States imposed sanctions on 25 Iranian entities and individuals over what the White House called illegal Iranian missile tests. Trump included Iran on the blacklist of Muslim-majority countries subject to his proposed visa ban, which is currently blocked in the courts. It was not clear from the Boeing announcement whether the tentative deal with Aseman Airlines had been negotiated under Trump or under President Barack Obama. Boeing officials did not immediately return e-mailed requests for comment. The announcement, posted on Boeing's website, said Aseman intended to purchase 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft valued at $3 billion, with rights to purchase an additional 30. Deliveries would be scheduled to start in 2022. Aseman currently has a fleet of 31 aircraft, a mixture of Boeing, Airbus and Fokker models with an average age of 25 years, according to the Planespotters.net website. The Boeing deal requires permission from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which has regulatory authority over such transactions with Iran. Not mentioned in the Boeing announcement, but still a significant hurdle for both sides, is how the company would be paid for the aircraft. Under sanctions that are still in place against Iran, the country cannot use the U.S. banking system, so transactions must be conducted overseas in currencies other than the dollar. Iran has one of the oldest commercial aircraft fleets in the world, a legacy of the prolonged estrangement with the United States that blocked the Iranians from refurbishing or replacing many of their American-built planes. U.S. critics of Iran in Congress and elsewhere have long objected to Boeing's plans to sell new aircraft to Iran, arguing that at least some of the planes could be diverted for illicit military use. Boeing says there are sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent that, and that the tentative deal announced on Tuesday is legal under the nuclear agreement. "This deal presents Trump with the mother of all dilemmas," said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy based in Washington, D.C. "It would create a lot of jobs — he's all about that," Kupchan said. "But planes are inherently dual-use, can ferry troops around, and Trump is dug in on curbing Iranian influence in the region. It's a big bet by Boeing, and the firm probably has an uphill fight on its hands."

"Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval." BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: April 4, 2017 11:45 am Follow @AuroraSentinel TEHRAN, Iran | Boeing Co. said on Tuesday it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines to supply 30 737 MAX aircraft to the carrier, the first major sale by a U.S. company to the Islamic Republic under new President Donald Trump. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck with Tehran under the Obama administration. Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. FILE -- In this March 7, 2017 file photo, the first of the large Boeing 737 MAX 9 models, Boeing's newest commercial airplane, sits outside its production plant, in Renton, Wash. Boeing Co. announced Tuesday, April 4, 2017 that it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines for 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File ) Chicago-based Boeing said the deal also includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes. It said the first deliveries of the single-aisle aircraft to Aseman would start in 2022. Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, which undergo final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” Boeing said in a statement. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks over the past year between the airline and Boeing. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019, contradicting Boeing. The European Union blacklisted Aseman from European skies in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal comes as part of the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. After the atomic accord, Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flag carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve this latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world, home to 80 million people. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wildcard is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to the Islamic Republic.

Suddenly the plane roars to life and sprints a mere 300 feet before abruptly lifting off and soaring into a cloudless, late-winter sky over Chesapeake Bay. A while later it zooms back into view, slows to a hover over the runway like a helicopter, then drops straight down to the concrete, where it lands with a gentle bounce. A U.S. Marine Corps test pilot is manning the controls. If he were Air Force or Navy, his version of the military’s highly anticipated new fighter jet wouldn’t have this capacity to take off and land on a dime—though it would come with other custom features. This is why Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan, who’s in charge of overseeing the acquisition of the F-35, brought three plastic models of the fighter jet to a December 2016 meeting with Donald Trump at his Florida residence. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 178.70 +2.05 +1.16% Lockheed Martin Corp LMT ▲ 269.56 +0.88 +0.33% IBC Advanced Alloys Corp IAALF ▼ 0.3000 -0.0049 -1.61% BS Ltd 533276 ▲ 1.91 +0.09 +4.95% Bogdan, a tall former test pilot who speaks in a raspy, authoritative voice, has been working with Lockheed Martin Corp., the plane’s manufacturer and the country’s largest defense contractor, since 2012. Nine days before their meeting, Trump had called Bogdan’s program “ out of control” in a tweet, so the three-star general knew that at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect would put him on the spot. But what he didn’t anticipate was Trump’s eagerness to demonstrate his own knowledge of aviation. Trump talked with pride about his personal Boeing 757, Bogdan says. “Anything about airplanes, he’s excited about, and he told me that the first time we met.” Amid the gold-inlaid, high-ceilinged splendor of the Jazz Age château in Palm Beach, Bogdan explained the F-35’s advanced sensor system and stealth capability. Trump listened respectfully, but the next day he was back on Twitter, complaining about the plane’s “ tremendous cost and cost overruns.” To Bogdan’s continued surprise, in the days before the inauguration, Trump twice telephoned the general at his office in an austere Pentagon annex in Arlington, Va. He wanted to discuss the allegations he’d heard that the F-35’s performance fell short of existing fighters. Bogdan hastened to reassure Trump that those claims were “myths,” “misinformation,” or “old information”—none of them worth believing. On Jan. 30, his 10th day as president, Trump markedly changed his tone. He took credit for knocking $600 million off the price of the latest batch of 90 fighters and told reporters the F-35 was “a great plane.” Since then, he’s made the F-35 an emblem of his dealmaking prowess. During his Feb. 28 address to a joint session of Congress, the president boasted he’d “saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter.” In truth, thanks to Bogdan’s negotiations with Lockheed, prices were going to fall with or without Trump’s intervention. And the plane, discounts notwithstanding, is still on its way to becoming the priciest military procurement in U.S. history. Trump’s self-congratulation serves as a distraction from the larger issue troubling the fighter jet: its performance. While the Pentagon’s official line is that, after years of difficulties, the F-35 is meeting high expectations, skeptics both outside and within the military say it’s turning out to be a two-decades-in-the-making, trillion-dollar mistake.  Full screen 1/7 SLIDES © Samuel King Jr./US Air Force/AP    2/7 SLIDES © Provided by AFP    3/7 SLIDES © US Marine Corps via Reuters    4/7 SLIDES © LM Otero/AP Photo    5/7 SLIDES © Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images    6/7 SLIDES © Photo via Michael Fitzsimmons/Shutterstock.com    7/7 SLIDES © Reuters     7/7 SLIDES The ambition to create the version of the F-35 that I watched on the tarmac at Patuxent River—one that can make short takeoffs and vertical landings—was what got the fighter jet’s development under way in the 1980s. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), the Pentagon’s tech arm, began working at the Marine Corps’ behest on an improved version of the Harrier, a crash-prone vertical-landing jet of British design. According to a Pentagon history of the F-35, Darpa quietly sought assistance from a research and development arm of Lockheed Martin known as the Skunk Works. By the early 1990s, the Darpa-Skunk Works collaboration had produced preliminary concepts, and the Marine Corps began pressing Congress for funding. The Air Force and Navy insisted that they, too, needed stealthy, supersonic fighters to replace aging Cold War-era models. Out of this clamoring grew a consensus that the only way to afford thousands of cutting-edge fighters was to build a basic model that could be customized for each service. “In terms of future tactical aircraft, this was the program,” says Frank Kendall, a senior Pentagon acquisition official during the Clinton and Obama administrations. “There was no other program.” In 2001 the Pentagon declared Lockheed the winner of a five-year competition against Boeing Co. for the opportunity to build the F-35. At the time, the contract was estimated to be worth $200 billion over three decades. Lockheed, which is based in suburban Bethesda, Md., not far from the Capitol and Pentagon, would assemble the plane in Fort Worth, in a mile-long facility that’s produced military aircraft since 1942. In addition to the Marine Corps F-35B vertical-landing jet, Lockheed agreed to manufacture the Air Force F-35A, which would take off and land conventionally, and the Navy F-35C, designed for aircraft carriers, with larger, foldable wings, more durable landing gear, and a tailhook. Not only was the F-35 going to offer a 3-in-1 cost savings for the U.S. military, the plane was supposed to help knit together the air forces of 11 American allies—including Britain, Israel, Japan, and South Korea—that have lined up to buy it. More on MSN: 20 companies profiting the most from war But this one-size-fits-all promise quickly led to problems. For the F-35B, the Marine Corps variant, Lockheed incorporated a novel propulsion system with a 50-inch-diameter “lift fan” positioned horizontally just behind the cockpit. When the plane goes into vertical mode, doors on the fuselage open, allowing the fan to draw in air from above and blow it toward the ground. Simultaneously, the plane’s main engine in the rear swivels 90 degrees to expel its exhaust downward. The combined force of fan and engine allows the plane to hover. The lift fan made the common fuselage bulkier than it otherwise would have been. That, in turn, increased drag and decreased fuel efficiency and range. Lockheed engineers also discovered they had to slim the F-35B by thousands of pounds to make it light enough to hover. The degree of commonality among the three versions of the F-35—the shared features—turned out to be not the anticipated 70 percent but a mere 25 percent, meaning that hoped-for economies of scale never materialized. A pattern of continual reengineering resulted in billions of dollars in cost overruns and yearslong delays. Beginning in 2007, the Pentagon accepted delivery of scores of planes, even as Lockheed continued to make design changes and address myriad deficiencies. The military “didn’t follow the old rule of ‘fly before you buy,’ ” says Michael Sullivan, director of defense acquisition oversight for the Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress. Once new weapons are in the hands of the military services, says Kendall, the former Pentagon acquisition official, “there’s a lot of inertia to continue, no matter what.” Michael Rein, a Lockheed spokesman, declines to comment on what he calls the “ancient history” of this period. The arrival of the Obama administration in 2009 brought new scrutiny to the F-35 program. Ashton Carter, a physicist and former Harvard professor of science and international affairs, took over as the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, known formally as undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics. (He went on to serve as secretary of defense in 2015 and 2016.) The dysfunction startled Carter. What was supposed to have been an economical plane at $50 million apiece had doubled in price, he recalled in a talk at Harvard in 2014. Part of the problem stemmed from a policy instituted in the mid-1990s aimed at reducing red tape. “This was a notion of trying to skinny down the acquisition bureaucracy,” says retired General Norton Schwartz, who served as Air Force chief of staff from 2008 to 2012. “In doing so, we regrettably lost much of the systems engineering ability that existed in-house.” The “cost plus” contracts the Pentagon signed with Lockheed only exacerbated the situation. The company received all its costs and was eligible for a performance-based bonus on top of that. Despite the program’s disarray, the military consistently awarded Lockheed 85 percent of its potential fee. In his Harvard talk, Carter described confronting the Pentagon program manager, a Marine Corps major general named David Heinz: “He looked me in the eye—I’ll never forget it—and he said, ‘I like the program manager on the Lockheed Martin side that I work with, and he tells me if he gets less than 85 percent, he’s going to get fired.’ ” Instead, it was Heinz who was fired, in 2010. Carter switched the Lockheed contract to a fixed-price arrangement under which the government and contractor split the cost of overruns. Carter declines to comment for this article, but confirms his earlier account. (Heinz, now chief executive officer of IBC Advanced Alloys Corp., an Indiana-based company that supplies Lockheed with the housing for one of the F-35’s targeting systems, also declines to comment, as does Rein, the Lockheed spokesman.) With the program about seven years behind schedule, the Pentagon estimates it will spend $379 billion over 40 years to develop and acquire more than 2,440 of the warplanes. Adjusting for inflation, that’s a 38 percent increase from the initial 2001 estimate. Add more than $600 billion for upkeep, and the total price tag approaches $1 trillion. But the aircraft has already paid off for Lockheed. Having delivered 210 F-35s so far—mostly to the Pentagon, but also to Israel and other privileged U.S. friends—the company is expected to derive more than 20 percent of its revenue in 2017 from the jet. For all its stumbles, the plane’s geographic and political heft make it too big to fail. The three versions of the plane require a total of some 300,000 parts, and Lockheed has parceled out the subcontracting to all but five unlucky states—Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Wyoming. Lockheed says the F-35 directly or indirectly supports 146,000 jobs across the U.S., ranging from minimum-wage broom-pushers to engineers paid well into six figures. Consider Arizona. In December 2011, Republican John McCain, the state’s senior U.S. senator and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, went to the Senate floor to declare that the F-35 program “has been both a scandal and a tragedy.” But less than a year later, the lawmaker, himself a former Navy pilot shot down over Vietnam, sounded mollified. The Marine Corps had decided to base a squadron of 16 early-production F-35Bs in Yuma, Ariz. Joining Lockheed executives and Marine Corps officers, McCain said at a dedication ceremony: “I am—after many years of frustration and setbacks—encouraged that the overall program is moving in the right direction.” The F-35, he added, “may be the greatest combat aircraft in the history of the world.” In addition to maintenance jobs at the Yuma base, the plane provides work for 24 subcontractors in Arizona, supporting a total of 4,620 jobs, according to Lockheed. Across the country in Vermont, the independent Senator Bernie Sanders has disparaged the F-35 in the Burlington Free Press as an example of the Pentagon’s “long record of purchasing weapons systems from defense contractors with massive cost overruns that have wasted hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars.” Nevertheless, Sanders has endorsed the idea of bringing 18 of the fighters to Burlington International Airport in 2019 to replace a squadron of aging F-16s flown by the Vermont Air National Guard. In the face of local opposition to noise and other environmental objections, Sanders said at a town hall meeting in 2014: “My view is that given the reality of the damn plane, I’d rather it come to Vermont than to South Carolina. And that’s what the Vermont National Guard wants, and that means hundreds of jobs in my city. That’s it.” Lockheed says the jobs total in Vermont will exceed 1,400. South Carolina won’t lose out: There’s a squadron of F-35s stationed at the Marine Corps air base in Beaufort. There are also detachments in California, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and Utah. Since Lieutenant General Bogdan took over the F-35 acquisition program five years ago, by all accounts he’s kept it from going further off the rails. A blunt, informal officer who leads a 2,000-person bureaucracy devoted exclusively to the F-35, Bogdan wears an olive one-piece flight suit to his office in suburban Virginia. He explains that the F-35’s stealthy profile and matte finish are designed to allow it to succeed against foes with sophisticated radar and surface-to-air missiles—the Chinese or Russians, for example. “You’re the guy who’s going to knock down the door by going very deep into enemy territory, survive, and go against the very toughest threats,” Bogdan says. When in stealth mode, the F-35 carries only two bombs and two air-to-air missiles in an internal weapons bay. But once the opposition’s defenses are eliminated, the plane can be outfitted to carry six additional weapons, three beneath each wing. “I can go and wreak a lot of havoc,” Bogdan says. He points to a three-week aerial exercise in February called Red Flag, which pitted dozens of U.S. warplanes against one another in mock battle over the Nevada desert. The F-35s, the stars of the show, recorded a 20-to-1 kill ratio, meaning they took out 20 opposing planes for each one they lost. And they dropped 51 practice bombs, with 49 direct hits—a level of accuracy Bogdan calls “incredible.” Other military leaders share his enthusiasm. “We can’t get into those aircraft fast enough,” Lieutenant General Jon Davis, the Marine Corps’ aviation chief, told a House Armed Services subcommittee in mid-February. “We have a game changer, a war winner, on our hands.” The F-35, in one of its most futuristic advancements, projects flight data—airspeed, altitude, heading, potential targets, and warnings—onto the curved visor of the pilot’s helmet. It’s almost a virtual-reality experience, pushing the skills of even today’s Xbox-weaned twentysomethings. Six infrared cameras mounted on the exterior stream real-time imagery, allowing the pilot to “see through” the skin of the plane, including straight down. In a process called “sensor fusion,” the main onboard computer can meld data from the exterior cameras, the plane’s powerful radar, and an “electro-optical” targeting system. “It’s always looking in every direction,” says Major John Dirk, a Marine Corps test pilot. The visor’s profusion of images and information takes getting used to, he adds, but “I can see threats I wouldn’t have been able to see before.” Some experts warn that test flights and mock battles are different from the real thing—and that the military’s enthusiasm should be viewed skeptically. “It’s groupthink,” says Pierre Sprey, who worked at the Pentagon during the Vietnam War. He belonged to a clique of aeronautical designers and engineers who called themselves the “fighter mafia” and helped design two respected aircraft: the F-16 Fighting Falcon, a maneuverable specialist at air-to-air duels, and the heavily armored A-10 Thunderbolt II, better known as the Warthog, which supports ground troops by flying low and slow, strafing the enemy with a seven-barrel 30-millimeter Gatling-type autocannon. “The F-16 and A-10 each do one thing well,” Sprey says. The Marine Corps’ “obsession” with short takeoff and vertical landing, he says, led to F-35 attributes that limit the plane’s maneuverability—the stout fuselage, which increases drag, and small wings, which cut weight but reduce the amount of lift the plane can generate. If F-35s “face the best Chinese or Russian fighters, they will be lucky if they can turn and run,” he adds. One could question Sprey’s objectivity, given that the F-35 is intended to put his creations, the F-16 and A-10, into retirement. Not so J. Michael Gilmore, who served from 2009 to January 2017 as the Pentagon’s director for operational test and evaluation—the military’s chief weapons tester. Gilmore, who has a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering, warned in a memorandum to the Air Force last August that the F-35 will need support from other planes “to locate and avoid modern threats, acquire targets, and engage formations of enemy fighter aircraft due to outstanding performance deficiencies.” According to Gilmore, the sensor-fusion system fails to display some potential threats clearly, and the plane’s electronic warfare capability—a reference to classified radar-jamming weapons—is weak. In a separate 2016 annual report released in January, Gilmore addressed the F-35’s protection of soldiers on the ground, saying the plane “does not yet demonstrate close air support capabilities equivalent to those of” the A-10 and other older aircraft. He cited the F-35’s limited weapons load while in stealth mode. The F-35 burns fuel fast, making it difficult for the jet to circle above a battlefield for long, Gilmore wrote. And he pointed out that test pilots aren’t unanimously enthusiastic about all aspects of the newfangled helmet. “Symbol clutter,” he wrote, obscures the visor representation of air-to-ground strafing, making that function unusable. Perhaps most troubling are the complexities of the autonomic logistics information system (ALIS), which hooks up to the plane in the hangar and provides the information technology backbone for maintenance of each aircraft. ALIS requires 16 million lines of code, compared with 8 million for the F-35 itself. When ALIS malfunctions, which it does somewhat regularly, maintainers have “to use time-consuming workarounds,” Gilmore said. Last April the GAO pointed out that all F-35 data from across the U.S. fleet are “routed to a central point of entry and then to ALIS’s main operating unit with no backup system or redundancy. If either of these fail, it could take the entire F-35 fleet offline,” threatening to ground the planes. Lockheed’s Rein declines to comment on Sprey’s assessment. As for Gilmore’s critique, the Lockheed spokesman refers to a Jan. 17, 2017, written statement by Bogdan. “The basic design of the F-35 is sound,” it said, but “we recognize there are known deficiencies that must be corrected.” “This plane has a long way to go before it’s combat-ready,” says Dan Grazier, a defense analyst at the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight in Washington. “Given how long it’s been in development, you have to wonder whether it’ll ever be ready.” In an interview, Bogdan responds to criticism of the F-35 with equanimity. He stands by the overall reassurance he offered President Trump but concedes the plane has kinks to be worked out. ALIS, he says, “is nowhere near as good as it should be,” and upgrades are under way, including building in the kind of redundancy the GAO noted is absent. Meanwhile, he acknowledges, F-35 maintenance personnel do have to “do a lot of workarounds.” Bogdan also worries that ALIS could be hacked. The planes themselves have been well-secured against cyberattack, he says, but ALIS connects to other government networks that are potentially vulnerable. This isn’t an abstract concern. A Chinese businessman pleaded guilty last year in the U.S. to participating in a conspiracy with hackers from the Chinese military who prosecutors said stole plans for the F-35 and other American warplanes. Beyond ALIS, Bogdan says the other sensor and software glitches Gilmore and the GAO identified are being addressed and will soon be fixed. The knock on the F-35 that it’s not maneuverable obscures a basic point about contemporary aerial warfare, Bogdan says: Up-close dogfighting is a thing of the past. “This airplane is very maneuverable,” he insists, “but it doesn’t have to be to kill another airplane air-to-air.” Its sensors can identify a foe long before the two pilots can see each other—and fire a missile with deadly accuracy at that distance, Bogdan says. By contrast, close air support of ground troops presents “a tricky question,” he says. The F-35 “doesn’t have all the capabilities it needs yet.” One feature that will be added to new planes—and retrofitted on older ones—is the equivalent of a laser pointer for tracking moving targets. Currently the F-35 has a surprising weakness in its inability to zero in on swift-moving enemy vehicles, Bogdan says. Only F-35As have internally mounted 25mm guns for ground strafing; in the future, similar weapons will be added in externally mounted belly pods on Bs and Cs. “When people are complaining about close air capability of the F-35,” he says, “they’re looking at what it can do today, and what it can do today is limited. What it can do tomorrow is going to be very, very good.” But not as good, he admits, as what the venerable A-10 already can do. “We designed the F-35 to be a decathlete,” he explains: versatile and adaptable, if not necessarily a medal winner in any one event. Grazier frames this another way: “You have a plane that at best is a jack of all trades, master of none.” On Feb. 3 the White House announced an $8.2 billion contract with Lockheed for 90 F-35s, the latest and largest batch yet. Based on a per-plane cost for the F-35A of less than $100 million, the deal trimmed $728 million from the last purchase. That savings exceeded the $600 million Trump took credit for after intervening with Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson. Since late last year, Hewson has met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower in New York, and the White House. But long before Trump began tweeting about the plane, calling Bogdan, or meeting with Hewson, negotiations last year between the Pentagon and Lockheed were pointing to a significant volume discount. Bogdan told reporters in December that the contract would be valued at about $8 billion overall and that per-plane costs would decrease—both of which happened. The president has balanced his praise for the plane with the admonition that Lockheed shouldn’t get too comfortable. He’s warned that he’d consider substituting some F-35 purchases with Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets. During a Feb. 17 tour of a Boeing plant in South Carolina, he said, “We are seriously looking at a big order” of F/A-18s. Lockheed’s rival as the second-biggest U.S. weapons contractor, Boeing has naturally tried to encourage Trump’s interest in the Super Hornet. “We’re excited to work with the new administration to bring the right capability to the war fighter,” says Dan Gillian, who heads the company’s fighter jet program. First flown in the 1990s, the twin-engine F/A-18 has seen action over Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s not really comparable to the F-35. The Super Hornet, which is designed to fly off aircraft carriers, lacks the F-35’s stealth characteristics and its array of advanced sensors. Still, the president wants Lockheed and the Pentagon to know he’s in touch with Boeing’s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg. When Trump telephoned Bogdan for the second time, on Jan. 17, Muilenburg was in Trump’s New York office listening in by speakerphone. Bogdan says he didn’t think Muilenburg’s presence was inappropriate: “The things I talked about in front of Mr. Muilenburg were clearly publicly releasable information. I understand the rules.” (In mid-March, Trump selected a senior Boeing executive, Patrick Shanahan, to serve as the Pentagon’s second-ranking official. If confirmed by the Senate, Shanahan would have to recuse himself from Boeing-related matters for two years.) Formalizing Trump’s fighter jet commentary, Secretary of Defense James Mattis has ordered a Pentagon “review” of the extent to which the F/A-18 could “provide a competitive, cost-effective fighter aircraft alternative.” But the review doesn’t constitute an existential threat to the F-35. Mattis limited the F/A-18 comparison to the Navy’s F-35C carrier-based model. The Navy is scheduled to receive only 260 of its version of the fighter, with the majority of planes—1,763—slated for the Air Force. Lockheed’s Hewson has become something of a Trump foil. At a Feb. 23 White House meeting with manufacturing CEOs, the president complimented her—and himself. “She’s tough, but it worked out well, I think, for everybody,” he said of the recently agreed-upon Lockheed contract. “She cut her price over $700 million, right? By over $700 million. Do you think Hillary would have asked for $700 million?” Bogdan, who’s announced he will retire in coming months, is already negotiating the next order of 130 F-35s. He expects the total price to exceed $10 billion. Looking further into the future, beyond the F-35, Lockheed’s Skunk Works is again collaborating with Darpa on what the company’s website heralds as “next-generation” planes that will “maintain U.S. air dominance capabilities in the post-2035 world.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The world’s second largest defense contractor will build 11 P-8A Poseidon for the U.S. Navy, four for the Royal Australian Air Force and two for the U.K. Royal Air Force, the country’s first versions of the aircraft. The deal, awarded March 30 and announced by Boeing on Monday, includes options for 32 additional aircraft and “money for long-lead parts for future orders,” which brings the potential contract value to $6.8 billion, according to a company announcement. ADVERTISEMENT The U.K. will receive the first pair of aircraft from the deal in 2019. Boeing has already delivered Poseidon aircraft to the U.S. Navy and two to Australia, while the Indian Navy flies eight of the P-8I variant of the aircraft. The plane is based on Boeing’s Next-Generation 737-800 commercial airplane and has anti-submarine, anti-surface warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. This is the second major Poseidon contract for Boeing in the last week. Norway in late March signed a contract with the U.S. for five P-8As for its air force to replace its Lockheed Martin-made P-3C/N Orion maritime patrol aircraft.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Boeing Unveils Deep Space Habitats For Moon And Mars Posted: Apr 4 2017, 9:45am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Boeing Deep Space Transit Vehicle on Approach Boeing reveals Ideas for Deep Space Exploration of the Earth’s Satellite and Mars   The Boeing corporation has revealed a set of exciting ideas for deep space exploration of the earth’s satellite and Mars. Boeing recently divulged some of its concepts for deep space exploration. These would corroborate and bolster NASA’s plans for human exploration of the Moon and Mars. NASA’s SLS  is something which Boeing is trying hard to develop. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com The habitat would be delivered to the space near the Moon. Termed the Deep Space Getaway, this habitat would support fundamental research. Also portals to world government and commercial partnerships in space would be opened up. Lunar missions would be a part of this plan.  All this would be powered by a SEP (Solar Electric Propulsion) system. The launching of human beings and cargo on SLS would lead to the gateway in four launches in the first half of the 2020s. The Deep Space Getaway would be the ideal midway point for Mars missions. A docking system rather in the same manner as that used in the ISS would be just the thing here. In case of the ISS, this docking system is used for commercial purposes. As for the Deep Space Transport vehicle, it would take people back and forth between the earth and Mars.  Once the crew has approached Mars within landing distance, surface missions and scientific and robotic experiments could take place in a manner of free exploration. These would be extant in orbit around the Red Planet. The system would be such that it would protect the passengers from the hostile environment of deep space. NASA has already hooked up with half a dozen deep space vehicles as a part of its NextSTEP program. This saw its inception take place in 2016. The lengthy journey to Mars will take all the resources at humanity’s disposal. This story may contain affiliate links.

The 737 MAX 9, which can carry up to 220 passengers, is the second of three variants of the popular single-aisle model. Boeing signed commercial aircraft deal valued at $3 billion to sell at least 30 jetliners to Iran's Aseman Airlines. In a statement, the company said it signed a "memorandum of agreement" with Aseman Airlines, which plans to buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX narrow-body jetliners. The Iranian carrier also has the purchase rights to buy an additional 30 Boeing jets. In December, Boeing announced an agreement for Iran Air, the country's flag carrier, to buy 50 of its narrow-body 737 passenger jets and 30 of the wide-body 777 aircraft. The earlier deal was valued at $16.6 billion, based on list prices for the planes. Financing details on the latest airplane agreement were not disclosed. Iran's aging fleet of passenger jets is among the oldest in the world due to commercial and financial sanctions that were in place for decades. For example, the average age of major Iranian carrier planes now exceeds 20 years and Tehran and been looking to Airbus, Boeing and other airplane manufacturers to modernize its fleet. Boeing said deliveries on the Aseman transaction are expected to begin in 2022; however, Iran's Tasnin news agency reported that the delivery of the first plane would occur in 2019. Boeing said in its release Tuesday that the new Iran agreement "creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States." According to Boeing, the deal was negotiated "under authorizations from the U.S. government following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord signed in 2015." show chapters A winning Boeing bet    Friday, 17 Mar 2017 | 5:30 PM ET | 03:13 The manufacturer said the deal still required approval from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, an agency of the U.S. Treasury Department that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions. The deal with Iran Air was approved by the U.S. agency during the Obama administration. In early trading Tuesday, Boeing's stock was up $1.67, or nearly 1 percent, to $178.36. The stock has soared more than 40 percent in the past year, making it one of the top-five stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during this period.

Both companies have designed built-in abort systems into their spacecraft, which can carry the vehicles up and away from a malfunctioning rocket. But now Boeing has another option in case emergencies aries at the launchpad: an astronaut zip line. Called the Starliner Emergency Egress System, it includes four cables that can rapidly carry astronauts away from Boeing’s launch site. The spacecraft Boeing is building, known as the CST-100 Starliner, is designed to launch on top of the United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket, which takes off from a launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida known as SLC-41. The cables are attached to the top of the crew access tower at SLC-41 — the structure the astronauts will use to climb to the Starliner when it’s on top of the Atlas V. Video: Boeing / NASA If for some reason the Atlas V starts malfunctioning just before launch, the astronauts can hop out of the Starliner and hop into specialized seats attached to the cables. They then ride down the cables, reaching speeds of up to 40 miles per hour during the trip. The riders are eventually deposited 1,300 feet from the launch site at a landing zone, and they can use hand brakes to slow down to a nice stop, according to Boeing. Otherwise, springs on the cables will automatically slow down the seats. While the system is mainly meant to help the crew, there are 20 seats available on the cables, so other personnel on the ground can also use the system if they’re nearby the launchpad. too bad it’s only meant to be used during emergencies — seems like fun! To create this system, ULA turned to the experts: a zip line company called Terra-Nova which creates a product known as the ZipRider. The same design for the ZipRider has basically been adapted for use by the astronauts when they ride on Boeing’s vehicles. “A modified, off-the-shelf product has been designed and constructed to meet our needs and reduce costs, while maintaining reliability and safety,” Gary Wentz, ULA’s vice president of human and commercial services, said in a statement. ULA just conducted the final test of the system, so it’ll be more than ready by the time Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner starts carrying astronauts sometime in 2018. It’s too bad it’s only meant to be used during emergencies, though; it seems like a good way to pass the time before launches begin.

Boeing, and five other companies, are already collaborating with NASA to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), which it is hoped will power a trip to Mars. Now, the firm has offered up conceptual designs for other accessories it will be useful for the mission, and a more general vision of how it could be achieved — and made easier on repeat visits. Of particular note are a deep space habitat design, and transport vehicle. #Boeing unveils deep space gateway + transport to help @NASA achieve Moon to Mars human space exploration https://t.co/b4flbvcf6N #33SS pic.twitter.com/q39TUJmBee — Boeing Defense (@BoeingDefense) April 3, 2017​ The former, the "Deep Space Gateway," is a space station Boeing wants positioned in Cislunar space, which is to say in or beyond the orbit of the Moon rather than in Earth orbit. The company has developed a design for the facility, that it says could be hauled into place by a mere four SLS missions. The NASA fact sheet for SLS explains its cargo-carrying variants will have sufficient capacity to launch a "small deep-space habitat module" — Boeing's own variation is likely to offer at least one module solution of its own. © Photo: Boeing Boeing Deep Space Gateway Boeing envisages man and machine spending some time orbiting the Moon, to ensure both are road-tested and space-ready prior to a visit to Mars. Moreover, the company proposes the construction of a Lunar base entitled "Gateway," that will both offer a launching point for a "Deep Space Transport" vehicle, and exploration of the Moon itself. Both the "Gateway" and "Transport" are real, confirmed projects worked on under NASA's Next Space Technologies for Exploration Technologies program and the High Power Solar Electric Propulsion technology development effort within the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate. Both the transport vehicle and the gateway habitat will be powered by solar electric propulsion, a promising technology NASA devised for the Dawn spacecraft. Boeing also puts its name to a timeline that would see the "Gateway" constructed on the Moon by the early 2020s — perhaps too late to make US President Donald Trump's dreams of "American footprints" being imprinted on "distant worlds" by 2026, the country's 250th birthday. The news follows the unveiling of radical NASA plans for reducing radiation levels on Mars via magnetic fields. © Photo: Pixabay Cancer-Causing Radiation Biggest Threat to Humans on Deep Space MissionsRadiation levels are one of the primary barriers to human exploration of Mars and space in general — although it remains the planet most hospitable to humans in the Solar System bar Earth. The planet is similar to Earth in many ways — a Martian day is 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35.244 seconds, Mars' surface area is 28.4% of Earth's (only slightly less than the amount of dry land on Earth), and the planet's similar axial tilt means it has seasons much like Earth's — although they are nearly twice as long, as a Martian year is about 1.88 Earth years. Moreover, Mars ranks just behind Venus as the easiest planet to reach from Earth — although Venus' extreme conditions (such as a surface temperature of 462 °C; 863 °F) likely preclude it from ever hosting human life.  As technology has advanced, and anxieties about the future prospects for humanity on Earth have increased, the race for space colonization has gained momentum. ...

The deal between Boeing Co and Iran Aseman Airlines is a Memorandum of Agreement for the latter to purchase 30 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes from the former. The deal will have these planes being sold for $3 billion. BA says that it will start delivering the new airplanes to the airline in 2022. Boeing Co’s deal with Iran Aseman Airlines also includes the right for the airline to purchase an additional 30 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes. The details of the Memorandum of Agreement were negotiated with authorization from the United States government. Boeing Co says that the deal was approved after it was determined that Iran was keeping its part of the nuclear accord that was signed back in 2015. BA also says that it will be seeking approval from the Office of Foreign Assets Control to perform under this transaction. Boeing Co also notes that this deal will create or sustain jobs in the United States. It says that according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, a deal of this size should support 18,000 jobs in the United States. Despite approval from the U.S. government for the deal with Iran Aseman Airlines, Boeing Co may still run into trouble with President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump’s White House has been looking to crack down on Iran. The issue may also make it hard for Iran Aseman Airlines to get funding for the purchase of the planes. BA stock was up slightly as of Tuesday morning.

Posted 04 Apr 2017 16:55 Updated 04 Apr 2017 22:50 Ground crew members escort a Boeing 737 MAX as it returns from a flight test at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington January 29, 2016. REUTERS/Jason Redmond/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A DUBAI/PARIS: Iran's Aseman Airlines has signed a tentative deal to buy at least 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets, in the first new business with the U.S. planemaker since President Donald Trump took office vowing to take a tougher stance toward Iran. Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said on Tuesday representatives of Aseman and Boeing had signed an agreement in Tehran covering as many as 60 jets, including options, after a year of negotiations. Boeing described the deal as a "memorandum of agreement," meaning it is only outline for the time being and subject to government approvals. It covers plans for Aseman to buy 30 aircraft with options for a further 30, it added. If completed, the main part of the deal for 30 jets would be worth US$3.4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically pay around half that. Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities. Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact, but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord, which the U.S. aerospace industry says would support his agenda for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs. Washington last month imposed separate sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities following a ballistic missile test. Iran retaliated with its own sanctions. In a statement on the Aseman deal, Boeing cited U.S. Department of Commerce data suggesting an "aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States". TURBOPROP TALKS Boeing deliveries to Aseman would start in 2022, although the U.S. planemaker must first apply for licenses from the U.S. Treasury allowing it to proceed with the sale. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval," it said. In December the European Union banned Aseman from flying to the EU due to safety concerns, highlighting gaps in Iran's ageing fleet following decades of sanctions. The latest deal comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's government strives to highlight improvements resulting from the nuclear pact in the run-up to May presidential elections. So far IranAir has received three new Airbus jets under the deal. Rouhani is likely to run a campaign highlighting economic benefits of the nuclear deal, which opened Iran to foreign investment. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Rouhani must do more to improve the economy. Negotiators from European turboprop maker ATR were meanwhile due in Tehran to wrap up a deal to sell 20 aircraft to IranAir, industry sources said. The first aircraft has been sitting on the tarmac in Toulouse, France, for weeks, waiting for the talks to be completed. A deal for the airframes has already been reached but there has been uncertainty over the status of a separate deal needed for the engines, to be supplied by Pratt & Whitney Canada. The company is a subsidiary of United Technologies , one of a handful of aerospace and defense groups covered by last month's retaliatory sanctions by Tehran against U.S. firms, though Iran has not explicitly targeted civil aircraft engines. Iranian officials have told Reuters finalizing the ATR deal depends on getting a contract for engine spares and long-term maintenance of the engines once the planes are delivered. Pratt & Whitney Canada had no immediate comment.

The decision on who will build the Air Force's next-generation jet trainer is not expected until later this year but pressure may have already eased on Boeing to score a must win against its rival Lockheed Martin. The two defense giants are the likely front-runners in the roughly $16 billion competition known as the T-X Trainer. The winning team will get an order for 350 jets to replace the Air Force's aging T-38 trainers that have been around since the 1960s. "It would be an important win for Boeing given that it does not have the F-35 and it didn't win the bomber program for the B-21," said Jonathan Root, an analyst at Moody's in New York. Last year, Boeing's tactical aircraft division suffered a setback when the government rejected the company's protest of Northrop Grumman winning the B-21, an advanced long-range strike bomber deal valued at more than $80 billion. Yet some analysts who earlier this year saw the competition as a "must-win" for Boeing now believe the pressure may have moderated since the Chicago-based defense contractor may be close to securing more orders on its F/A-18 fighters. "The pressure has been alleviated some because it looks like the F-18 is going to get a little bit of a resurgence here," said Richard Safran, a defense analyst at Buckingham Research in New York. He noted that recent reports have indicated that the government may do an additional buy of an upgraded F/A-18 so that would provide a boost for Boeing's tactical aircraft business. Even so, Boeing and its bid partner, Swedish aerospace manufacturer Saab, may need to absorb the development costs on the company's so-called clean-sheet version of the trainer aircraft. In contrast, Lockheed's entry in the competition is the T-50A in partnership with South Korea's Korea Aerospace Industries and uses a platform based off the existing T-50 Golden Eagle, a legacy plane introduced more than a decade ago. Overall, there are at least five separate bids in the T-X Trainer competition. Analysts estimate the Boeing team already has spent $1 billion to $3 billion on development costs associated with its new trainer. Source: Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin’s T-50A jet trainer, the company’s submission for the U.S. Air Force’s T-X advanced pilot training program. "They still have the problem of making all those upfront development costs disappear in their bid price — and that's challenging," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based industry consultancy Teal Group. He said Boeing's price on the plane could end up being higher "unless they just want to eat that." Aboulafia calls the T-X trainer contract "Lockheed Martin's to lose but not a slam dunk." That said, he believes Boeing could prevail if it puts in "an extremely aggressive bid." Lockheed, a Bethesda, Maryland-based defense contractor, touted its entry for the T-X contract on the company's website by noting the single-engine, two-seat trainer has registered more than 142,000 flight hours and "is ready to deliver on day one." The T-50 Golden Eagle was previously procured by several international air forces, including South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand, among others. If Lockheed wins the trainer contract, it is expected to build the aircraft in South Carolina. "We're excited to offer the U.S. Air Force a low-risk proposal that meets all their needs for advanced pilot training, and can help them achieve initial operational capability earlier," Mike Griswold, Lockheed Martin T-50A's business development director, said in a statement to CNBC. The Pentagon started accepting final request for proposals in late December for the T-X Trainer and the formal deadline was last week for submissions. The Air Force is expected to use the new trainer for pilot training for the F-35 as well as the F-16 and F-22 fighter aircraft. Boeing said on its website that its trainer jet features a single engine, twin tails, stadium seating and claims its entry is "more affordable and flexible" when compared against older, existing planes. Boeing has already built at least two of the jets and said it is prepared to build more. "We're confident that our all-new, purpose-built Boeing T-X advanced pilot training system — which includes the aircraft, ground-based training and support designed together from the ground up — is the right choice for the U.S. Air Force," Boeing said in a statement. Analysts say the Boeing trainer jet, which closely resembles the Super Hornet, is considered heavier and also might contribute to it costing more to produce than the Lockheed entry. Boeing's trainer jet had its inaugural first flight in December. Boeing could make a case to the Air Force that it should get the trainer jet contract because it has an advantage in manufacturing, or it could claim the plane is easier to assemble, industry experts suggest. Then again, Boeing also might be willing to accept a lower margin with the U.S. government if it believes a high-performance trainer might have potential in the export market with allies. In addition to selling 350 training jets to the U.S. Air Force, Aboulafia said the allies could potentially buy another 100 to 150 planes. Other T-X Trainer bidders include a unit of Italy's Leonardo in building its T-100 trainer at a factory in Alabama. Stavatti Aerospace proposed its Javelin T-X as a trainer, a jet originally designed as a civilian sport aircraft. Sierra Nevada Corp. and Turkish Aerospace Industries also are expressed interest this year in teaming in a joint venture to offer the Air Force an advanced trainer. Stavatti CEO Christopher Beskar said in an email response that the Javelin T-X entry is "a re-imagining of the original ATG Javelin aircraft that first flew in 2005." He said the aircraft's flyaway cost is $10 million per jet and the executive added that the company submitted a second bid offering for the SM-47 T-X, a jet costing $20 million each. Leonardo, Sierra Nevada and TAI didn't respond to requests for comment. In January, Raytheon ended its partnership with Leonardo for the T-X Trainer program. Northrop Grumman, maker of the legacy T-38 jet currently used as a trainer, had been partnered with U.K.-based BAE Systems but pulled out of the competition in February. Finally, Textron also had earlier been expected to participate with its Scorpion jet but ultimately exited the competition.

The deal, penned in the presence of Iran’s Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi, includes purchase of 50 narrow-bodied 737 planes and 30 long-range 777s, according to Parvaresh. The aircrafts will be delivered over 10 years, he added. Fletcher Barkdull, a Boeing regional director who attended the signing ceremony, said the aircraft manufacturer has received final approval from the U.S. government. 'Boeing contract first step to revive Iran’s air fleet’ The concluded contract between Iran Air and Boeing should be regarded as the first step taken to renovate Iran’s air fleet and the renewal procedure will speed up in future via finalizing other deals such as the one to purchase 100 Airbus aircrafts and also the contract to buy 20 ATR planes, Akhoundi said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony.  “Making the purchase of the Boeing planes will add 50,000 seats to the capacity of Iranian air fleet,” he added. Iran Air-Boeing agreement is the first of its kind since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and comes after most international sanctions on Iran were lifted as part of its nuclear deal with world powers. It also comes weeks before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has criticized the nuclear accord with Iran. Boeing said in June it had signed a tentative agreement to sell 100 jets to Iran Air after Iranian statements about the deal. In November, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill intending to block the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran that would bar the U.S. Treasury from issuing licenses that U.S. banks would need to finance sales of commercial aircraft. Congressional Republicans are making efforts to counter last year's nuclear accord between Iran, the United States and other world powers, that eased sanctions on the Islamic Republic.

About us Membership Contact us Wed April 5, 2017 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia Boeing says it signs sales agreement with Iran Air Economy June 21, 2016 DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP)— Boeing Co. said Tuesday it signed an agreement with Iran Air "expressing the airline's intent" to buy its aircraft, marking the first major deal with an American company in the Islamic Republic following its landmark nuclear deal last year with world powers. The Chicago-based manufacturer issued a statement to The Associated Press saying that it signed the agreement "under authorizations from the U.S. government following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord reached last summer." "Boeing will continue to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines will be contingent upon U.S. government approval," it said. Boeing offered no further details on the sale. Iran Air, the country's national carrier, said this week it wants to buy new generations of the Boeing 737, as well as the 300ER and 900 version of the Boeing 777. Earlier Tuesday, Iran's Transportation Minister Abbas Akhoundi said a possible deal between the Islamic Republic and Boeing could be worth as much as $25 billion, on par with the country's earlier deal with its European rival, Airbus. Boeing has been cautious about entering Iran's market as other sanctions remain in place against Tehran. American officials had said as recently as last weekend that the sale would need permission from the U.S. Treasury. It's unclear what changed in the last few days. Treasury officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Iranian airlines have some 60 Boeing airplanes in service, but most were purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Out of Iran's 250 commercial planes, about 150 are flying while the rest are grounded due to lack of spare parts. Parts and servicing remained nearly impossible to get while the world sanctioned Iran over its nuclear program. Included in last year's nuclear deal is approval for airline manufacturers to enter the Iranian market. However, American lawmakers have warned Boeing not to do business there as the Iran deal remains a hot topic in the ongoing presidential election. Boeing may need to run the sale through an overseas subsidiary and use a currency other than U.S. dollars in order to avoid running afoul of American laws.

April 05, 2017 0702 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:190257 Publish Date: Tue, 04 Apr 2017 17:54:53 GMT Service: Iran Iran's Aseman signs deal to buy 60 Boeing jets Iran's Aseman Airlines on Tuesday signed a deal to purchase dozens of passenger planes from US aviation giant Boeing. Under the agreement, the airlines will buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes worth $3 billion. The deal also gives Aseman the right to purchase another 30 of the Boeing’s twinjet narrow-body passenger planes. IRNA said that representatives of Aseman and Boeing signed the agreement in Tehran covering as many as 60 jets, including options, after a year of negotiations. Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy. Tehran-based Aseman Airlines has a fleet of 36 planes – half of them the 105-seat Dutch Fokker 100s. it operates them on flights to 40 domestic and 13 international destinations, according to its website. However, it was banned from flying into the European Union over safety concerns in December. Its three Boeing 727-200s are almost as old as the 1979 Islamic Revolution, having made their first flight in 1980. Boeing described the deal as a "memorandum of agreement," a type of transaction that falls short of a binding contract and is subject to government approvals. The Aseman deal still has to be approved by the US government. Boeing said it negotiated the agreement under government authorizations. If completed, the main part of the deal for 30 jets would be worth $3.4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically win discounts of around 50 percent for large deals. In the statement on the latest deal, Boeing cited US Department of Commerce data suggesting an "aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States". Deliveries to Aseman would start in 2022. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval," Boeing said. Boeing 737 MAX planes – that would enter service in the second half of 2017 – have a passenger capacity of 130 people and are specifically adequate for domestic and regional flights. The planes that Aseman Airlines has purchased from Boeing would increase the company’s passenger transportation capacity to above 8,000 seats, Aseman emphasized.  Even before the latest Boeing deal, Iran's Civil Aviation Organization said plane purchases would create 20,000 direct jobs, and thousands more indirectly. "Currently, 500-700 co-pilots are unemployed in Iran," CAO official Mohammad Reza Kazemipour said on Monday, adding that the new fleets would bring "tens of billions of dollars in revenues for Iran". The memorandum of understanding is the second big agreement Boeing has reached with Iranian airlines since sanctions were eased in January 2016 after an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type to Iran’s flag-carrier airline Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air’s order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion. Iran Air said in December 2016 that Boeing would start to deliver the planes in 2018 and the deliveries would be completed within 10 years. Iran has already received the first three of a total of 100 Airbus planes that it has purchased from the European company through an agreement worth around $18 billion. More deliveries are expected to take place in the coming months.        KeyWords Aseman Iran Boeing   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Zarif, Lavrov discuss issues of mutual interest on phone Sarmadi: JCPOA paves way for further cooperation with Singapore $2.3b goods exported from Mehran border terminal Rouhani strongly condemns bomb explosion in St. Petersburg metro Iranian airliner buys 60 Boeing airplanes Crude exports exceed 3mn bpd South Korea denies Iran 8th consecutive final spot Iran’s Rostami receives ‘Lifter of the Year’ award in Bangkok Iran’s Vafaei ascends 12 places in snooker world rankings Baqeri: Iran will never succumb to US, allies’ psywar Most Visited 86% of Trump counties earn less per year than 27 White House staff US will tackle North Korea alone if necessary: Trump Trump grants Pentagon greater warfighting control amid more deployments in ME war zones www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0724 sec

Pestano   |   April 4, 2017 at 9:25 AM Follow @upi Comments April 4 (UPI) -- Boeing on Tuesday said it has signed an agreement with Iran Aseman Airlines, which will purchase 30 of the Seattle-based company's 737 MAX jetliners for about $3 billion. Boeing and Iran Aseman Airlines signed a memorandum of agreement in which the airline expressed intent to buy the airplanes with a list price value of $3 billion with deliveries scheduled to start in 2022. The agreement also allows Iran Aseman Airlines the rights to purchase an additional 30 737 MAX planes. In a statement, Boeing said the U.S. Department of Commerce said the the sale would create or sustain about 18,000 jobs in the United States. Boeing said it negotiated the agreement with the approval of the U.S. government following the determination that Iran met its obligations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the nuclear agreement signed between Iran and China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, Germany and the European Union. Though negotiations were approved by the U.S. government, the final agreement needs further approval. "Boeing will look to the Office of Foreign Assets Control for approval to perform under this transaction," Boeing wrote. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval."

Share this article Share Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet Navy Jets (pictured) have had increasing problems with depriving fighter pilots of oxygen  Back in December, Trump praised the F-18 jets tweeting: 'Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!'  By switching from the F-35s to the F-18, taxpayers are estimated to save $29 billion according to CNN.  The report from a hearing before a House Armed Services subcommittee explains the F-18's oxygen problems. The testimony shows that over the past seven years, the models have shown a consistent increase in the number of physiological episodes. There have also been issues with the EA-18G Growler. The episodes are caused by either 'pilot breathing gas' or by problems with 'unscheduled pressure changes in the flight station'. Both of these issues put the pilot at risk and 'jeopardize safe flight' according to Rear Admiral Michael Moran.  Trump praised Super Hornets on Twitter for being a cheaper alternatives to Lockheed Martins Trump is shown a 781-10 Dreamliner during a tour of the Boeing South Carolina facility It is difficult to determine the root cause of these issues because 'depressurization, tissue hypoxia and contaminant intoxication overlap.'  Part of this is because hypoxic related events, or deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues, are not always noticeable during the flight.  The report shows since May 1, 2010: 'Of 382 cases adjudicated by the [Physiological Episode Team] so far, 130 have involved some form of contamination, 114 involved an [Environmental Control System] component failure, 91 involved human factors, 50 involved an [Onboard Oxygen Generation Systems] component failure, 13 involved a breathing gas delivery component failure, and 76 were inconclusive or involved another aircraft system failure.' Some of the problems may have been caused by more than one factor.   Read more: Trump uses Boeing Super Hornets to sting Lockheed - Dec. 22, 2016 Trump¿s Favorite Fighter Jet Keeps Starving Pilots of Oxygen - Bloomberg docs.house.gov/m...

The deal includes purchase rights for 30 additional 737 MAXs. Deliveries are scheduled to start in 2022. Boeing said it negotiated the MOA under authorizations from the US government following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord signed in 2015. Boeing said it will look to the Office of Foreign Assets Control for approval to perform under this transaction. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval,” the Seattle-based manufacturer said in a statement. In December 2016, Boeing announced it had firmed an MOA with Iran Air earlier that year for 50 narrowbody and 30 widebody aircraft in a deal valued at $16.6 billion at list prices. The contract covered 50 737 MAX 8s, 15 777-300ERs and 15 777-9Xs. In January this year, Iran Air took delivery of its first Airbus A321, which was part of historic order for 100 Airbus aircraft—46 A320-family single-aisle models, plus 54 twin-aisles consisting of a mix of A330s and A350s—signed in 2016. In March, the Iranian flag carrier received its first widebody A330-200 from that order.

Both of Boeing’s concepts leverage proven solar electric propulsion technology and hardware design from the 702 satellite family. Boeing Deep Space Gateway. Image credit: Boeing Company. NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS), which Boeing is helping develop, would deliver the habitat to cislunar space near the Moon. Known as the Deep Space Gateway, the spaceport would have a power bus, a small habitat to extend crew time, docking capability, an airlock, and serviced by logistics modules to enable research. The propulsion system on the gateway mainly uses high power electric propulsion for station keeping and the ability to transfer among a family of orbits in the lunar vicinity. The three primary elements of the gateway, the power and propulsion bus and habitat module, and a small logistics module(s), would take advantage of the cargo capacity of SLS and crewed deep space capability of NASA’s Orion spacecraft. “The ability to simultaneously launch humans and cargo on SLS would allow us to assemble the gateway in four launches in the early 2020s,” said Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing’s space exploration division. Boeing Deep Space Transport vehicle on approach. Image credit: Boeing Company. The Deep Space Gateway could be the waypoint for Mars missions. Utilizing a docking system akin to what the International Space Station (ISS) uses for commercial operations, it could host the Deep Space Transport vehicle. This spacecraft would be a reusable vehicle that uses electric and chemical propulsion and would be specifically designed for crewed missions to destinations such as Mars. The transport would take crew out to their destination, return them back to the gateway, where it can be serviced and sent out again. The transport would take full advantage of the large volumes and mass that can be launched by the SLS rocket, as well as advanced exploration technologies being developed now and demonstrated on the ground and aboard the ISS. This second phase will culminate at the end of the 2020s with a one year mission in the lunar vicinity to validate the readiness of the system to travel beyond the Earth-Moon system to Mars and other destinations, and build confidence that long-duration, distant human missions can be safely conducted with independence from Earth. Through the efforts to build this deep space infrastructure, this phase will enable explorers to identify and pioneer innovative solutions to technical and human challenges discovered or engineered in deep space.

By RobertWall AsaFitch Boeing Co. agreed to sell up to 60 of its most popular jets to an Iranian airline, doubling down on the country amid uncertainty over the Trump administration’s tolerance for U.S. business dealings in Iran. Boeing BA, +1.16%  said Tuesday it signed a memorandum of agreement with privately owned Iran Aseman Airlines for the sale of 30 Boeing 737 Max single-aisle planes, with options for another 30. The list price for all 60 jets is $6 billion. Plane makers typically offer steep discounts, and the real value of the deal could be significantly lower. Still, the sale is the first major deal between a U.S. company and an Iranian one since the inauguration of President Donald Trump, an outspoken critic of closer ties with Tehran. Boeing said it had received permission from the U.S. government to negotiate the sale, though it still needs signoff from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If approved, the first planes will arrive in Iran by 2022. Even with early consent from Washington, the deal could become a high-profile test case for the Trump administration over how far Washington will allow U.S. companies to go in doing business in Iran. Western powers more than a year ago removed sanctions on Iran in return for the country agreeing to constrain its nuclear program. After the deal, under the Obama administration, Boeing and rival Airbus SE won billion-dollar deals to sell planes to the Islamic Republic’s flag carrier Iran Air.

The Chicago-based company reached a deal in December to sell $16.6 billion in planes to Iran Air, the first pact of its kind since 1979. The agreements come after most international sanctions on Iran were lifted as part of its nuclear deal with world powers. Trump has criticized that arrangement but also has lauded Boeing as an important creator of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Iran Aseman Airlines signed an agreement with the intent to purchase 30 737 MAX planes, Boeing said in a statement on its website Tuesday. The value is based on list prices, which typically are discounted for large orders. The deal provides the airline with an option to buy 30 additional 737 MAXs. Deliveries of the single-aisle jet are scheduled to start in 2022. A sale of this size would create or sustain about 18,000 U.S. jobs, Boeing said, citing Commerce Department calculations. The company said it would seek purchase approval from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. The December agreement was the first of its kind since the Islamic Revolution, according to Iran’s Ministry for Roads and Urban Development. Boeing’s last airplane deliveries to Iran were 747 jumbos that arrived in 1977, according to the company’s website. On the campaign trail, Trump attacked a planned center to paint Boeing 737s in China and blasted the contract for Air Force One presidential jet as too costly. Subsequent meetings with Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg brought a significant thaw. Trump in February attended the rollout of a new Boeing jet from a factory in South Carolina, extolling the “beautiful” carbon-composite 787-10 and praising the CEO as “a very, very tough negotiator.” (c) 2017, Bloomberg Facebook Comment SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleAt least 58 dead in suspected chemical attack in Syria; hospital reportedly hit Next articleA Mississippi woman was on the phone with 911 when floodwaters swept her away - Follow Us 177,692FansLike 185,517FollowersFollow 857SubscribersSubscribe Breaking Teen asks grandma to prom, school says she’s ‘too old’ April 4, 2017 153 arrested during 12-day ICE operation targeting criminal aliens, illegal re-entrants April 4, 2017 World’s top cocoa grower is headed for a record harvest April 4, 2017 RAW VIDEO: Officer Shoots Pursuit Suspect Dead After He Places Pickup...

By RobertWall AsaFitch Boeing Co. agreed to sell up to 60 of its most popular jets to an Iranian airline, doubling down on the country amid uncertainty over the Trump administration’s tolerance for U.S. business dealings in Iran. Boeing BA, +1.16%  said Tuesday it signed a memorandum of agreement with privately owned Iran Aseman Airlines for the sale of 30 Boeing 737 Max single-aisle planes, with options for another 30. The list price for all 60 jets is $6 billion. Plane makers typically offer steep discounts, and the real value of the deal could be significantly lower. Still, the sale is the first major deal between a U.S. company and an Iranian one since the inauguration of President Donald Trump, an outspoken critic of closer ties with Tehran. Boeing said it had received permission from the U.S. government to negotiate the sale, though it still needs signoff from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If approved, the first planes will arrive in Iran by 2022. Even with early consent from Washington, the deal could become a high-profile test case for the Trump administration over how far Washington will allow U.S. companies to go in doing business in Iran. Western powers more than a year ago removed sanctions on Iran in return for the country agreeing to constrain its nuclear program. After the deal, under the Obama administration, Boeing and rival Airbus SE won billion-dollar deals to sell planes to the Islamic Republic’s flag carrier Iran Air.

The pact with Iran Aseman Airlines to purchase 30 of Boeing’s 737 Max planes adds to a separate $16.6 billion agreement with Iran Air, which the Chicago-based manufacturer is still finalizing. If completed, the transactions would be the first U.S. aircraft exports to Iran since the Shah era. An Airbus A321 arrives in Tehran on Jan. 12. Photographer: Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images The latest jet transaction puts Trump’s policy of promoting U.S. manufacturing jobs into conflict with the administration’s vow to take a tougher stance on the Islamic Republic. If the White House thwarts Boeing’s dealmaking, it also risks tilting the playing field in favor of Europe’s Airbus Group SE just as global jet sales are slowing, said aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia. Boeing may be “setting themselves up for conflict with the Trump administration or Republicans in general,” said Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group. “To a certain extent they are imposing a level of conflict on Republicans because they are going to have to balance manufacturing jobs to export markets with getting tough on Iran. It’s tough to thread that needle.” Boeing shares rose 0.8 percent to $178.07 at 2:02 p.m. in New York. The gain was the third largest among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Iran Debate Airbus and Boeing have been making inroads in Iran since the Obama administration and other world powers agreed to lift sanctions on commercial-jet sales in reward for a nuclear agreement. Whether the U.S. manufacturer closes the transactions is far from certain, given the hostility by hard-liners in Iran and some Republicans in Congress to measures that would restore trade. “It’s concerning,” Senator Marco Rubio told reporters in the Capitol when asked about the deal. Asked if he could or would do anything to block it, the Florida Republican said, “Maybe.” Financing the multibillion-dollar purchases also will be a challenge given the restrictions still in place on lenders doing business with Iranian companies, Aboulafia said. Aircraft lessors may be hesitant to provide financing if the threat of renewed sanctions raises a risk they couldn’t reclaim the planes if Iranian carriers defaulted. While Iran wants to upgrade its museum-vintage fleet because of safety concerns, it isn’t clear the Middle Eastern country would be able to absorb the hundreds of aircraft it is ordering from Boeing and Airbus. “If you add it all up, Iran needs nothing like the number of jetliners they are committing to. It’s not clear they can afford them either,” Aboulafia said. U.S. Jobs The Iran Aseman deal, announced in a  statement Tuesday on Boeing’s website, provides the airline with an option to buy 30 additional 737 Max planes. Deliveries of the single-aisle jet are scheduled to start in 2022. The value is based on list prices, which typically are heavily discounted. A sale of that size would create or sustain about 18,000 U.S. jobs, Boeing said, citing Commerce Department calculations. The company said it would seek purchase approval from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland who is the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said there is little Congress can do to block the plane sale as long as it meets the terms set out in the nuclear deal. That was echoed by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who has been a leading voice against the nuclear deal. No Involvement “I have opposed the Iranian agreement and I am not interested in doing anything to help the Iranians but what they’ve done is completely legal,” McCain said. “They’ve got the money and it’s not a weapons system, so it doesn’t require any involvement from the Congress.” The purchase would help modernize Iran Aseman’s fleet after the carrier in December was banned by the European Union for “unaddressed deficiencies.” The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has maintained a blacklist of airlines since 2006 after a series of crashes prompted European governments to seek a uniform approach to airline safety. The Iranian carrier operates 33 planes, including two Boeing 737s and five Boeing 727s, according to its website. Almost half of the fleet consists of Fokker 100 aircraft. The airline reached an earlier pact to lease seven Airbus planes. Airbus Rivalry Boeing’s December agreement with Iran Air was the first of its kind since the Islamic Revolution. The company’s last airplane deliveries to Iran were 747 jumbos that arrived in 1977, according to the company’s website. While Boeing and Iran’s flag carrier are still working out final terms for deliveries that would begin next year, Airbus has delivered the first aircraft for its separate $19 billion sale. “The contract agreement we signed late last year had contingencies on it that are still being worked,” Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman, said by email. On the campaign trail, Trump attacked a planned center to paint Boeing 737s in China and later blasted the contract for the Air Force One presidential aircraft as too costly. Subsequent meetings with Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg brought a significant thaw. Trump in February attended the rollout of a new Boeing jet from a factory in South Carolina, extolling the “beautiful” carbon-composite 787-10 and praising the CEO as “a very, very tough negotiator.” Congressional Moves The House in November passed legislation along party lines attempting to block Boeing from financing aircraft sales to Iran, but that measure didn’t move in the Senate before that session of Congress ended. The House hasn’t yet revived the bill this year.  The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee and at least a dozen other Republican and Democratic senators introduced a bill last month that seeks to expand sanctions on Iran over its ballistic-missile development, support for terrorism and human rights violations, according to a statement. Those would be targeted against people involved with Iran’s ballistic missile program and those that transact with them, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Republicans in Congress strongly opposed the 2015 agreement between the U.S. and five other nations, including Russia, designed to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran agreed to redesign and reduce its nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Trump campaigned against the deal, which he said was bad for American interests and security. He said during a series of election rallies that he would tear it up and renegotiate it, but he hasn’t yet taken public steps to scrap the accord.  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The flight arrived at Kuala Lumpur International Airport to traditional water fireworks and was met by Uzbek Ambassador Murad Askarov, Malaysia Airports’ Managing Director Datuk Badlisham Ghazali, Malaysia’s Deputy Tourism Director-General Dato’ Sri Abdul Khani bin Daud, and Malaysia Airports executives. Uzbekistan Airways’ executives, including Deputy Commercial Director Davronbek Niyazov, Tourism Chief Azizkhon Mukhamedjanov, and UzAirways Representative in Malaysia Sherzod Akmalov joined in the greetings. Mr Niyazov said Uzbekistan Airways is a company promoting economic and cultural ties between the countries. He said the carrier celebrated 25 years of the Uzbek-Malaysian flight and the launch of Boeing 787 Dreamliner on this route. “Twenty five years ago Uzbekistan Airways launched its first international flights. The first six destinations included Kuala Lumpur,” he said. “Today, [the carrier’s] flight geography includes 45 cities in 25 countries of the world. “Our passenger plane park includes modern Boeing and Airbus airlines with an average age of nine years. “The national airline company’s recent achievement was to buy two Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets, which we received in August and November last year. “Taking care of the high level of service and passenger safety, the airline contracted for the purchase of another four Dreamliners, which will join the fleet in 2019. “We pay much attention to your region as a tourism destination. Every year, the number of tourists wishing to visit Malaysia rises. “In turn, Uzbekistan, with its unique culture and history, is as attractive to the Malaysians. “We are sure the traffic between the two countries will rise, and the passengers will have a chance to appreciate the new airplanes and comfort on board, during flights to Malaysia and Singapore.” Mr Ghazali said: “2017 is rich in various events. This year we not only celebrate the 25th anniversary of our airports, but also 25 years of ties between our countries. I am confident Uzbekistan’s national airline company will prosper year on year and make its contribution to the strengthening of mutually beneficial cooperation between our states.” Uzbekistan Airways first flew Boeing 787 Dreamliner on 5 September, making its first international flight on 9 September to Almaty. The airliner is now flown to Dubai, Delhi, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, Almaty, Moscow, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. Soon the company will start non-stop long-haul transatlantic flights, to carry passengers with a high level of comfort.   Subscribe to UzReport.uz in Telegram, to be the first to know about the main news and important events of the day.   Поделиться Твитнуть <<< Go back   Other news   Babur Alikhanov appointed national broadcaster's deputy chairman   04.04.2017 16:03:02 • "UzReport"Babur Alikhanov, a journalist, has been appointed deputy director at Uzbekistan's National Broadcasting Company, following a Cabinet resolution.   Head of Uzbekiston pochtasi holds outreach reception of citizens in Zarafshan   03.04.2017 17:00:48 • "UzReport"Director General of Uzbekiston pochtasi Sh.

The agreement involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes as well as the "purchase rights" for an additional 30 planes of the same class, according to the report. The planes are expected to be delivered to Aseman Airlines from 2019. Boeing 737 MAX planes have a passenger capacity of 130 people and are specifically adequate for domestic and regional flights. The planes that Aseman Airlines has purchased from Boeing would increase the company's passenger transportation capacity to over 8,000 seats. On Dec. 11, Iran Air announced that it had finalized an agreement with the U.S. Boeing to purchase 80 commercial planes. The agreement envisaged the purchase of 50 twin-jet narrow-body Boeing 737 planes and 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft with a total value of 16.6 billion U.S. dollars. Iran Air has also signed another agreement with France's Airbus to purchase a batch of 100 jets worth over 18 billion U.S. dollars to renew its aged passenger fleet. On March 25, the third passenger plane, bought from the Airbus, landed in capital Tehran. The purchases for the passenger planes follow the removal of western sanctions against the Islamic republic's aviation industry over the past decades.

Called the Deep Space Gateway, it would hang about on the far side of the moon and act as a docking station for spaceships on their way to the red planet. It would allow ships to refuel and resupply before beginning the gruelling mission to Mars. Boeing says it hopes to launch the habitat in four different parts through NASA's powerful Space Launch System (SLS).

Using solar panels for power, the Deep Space Gateway would: "support critical research and help open opportunities for global government or commercial partnerships in deep space, including lunar missions."

Boeing said Tuesday it had signed an agreement to sell 30 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes worth $3 billion at list prices to Aseman Airlines. The agreement also gives the airline the right to buy another 30 of the aircraft. "According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States," Boeing said in a statement. The memorandum of understanding is the second big agreement Boeing has reached with Iranian airlines since sanctions were eased in January 2016 after an international agreement on the country's nuclear program. Boeing signed an $8 billion deal to sell 80 jets to Iran Air in December. The Aseman deal still has to be approved by the U.S. government. Boeing said it negotiated the agreement under government authorizations. However, there are still hurdles. Boeing will need the approval of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Relations between Iran and the U.S. have been getting worse under President Trump. Tehran slapped sanctions on 15 U.S. companies last month, in retaliation for American sanctions announced in February. Trump has long been critical of the Iran nuclear deal that was signed under the Obama administration. After assuming office, Trump said he was putting Iran "on notice" and his first move against the country was including its citizens on a travel ban. Tehran-based Aseman Airlines currently operates 33 aircraft on flights to 40 domestic and 13 international destinations, according to its website. However, it recently suffered a blow to its reputation -- it was banned from flying into the European Union over safety concerns in December.

REUTERS/Jason Redmond/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A DUBAI/PARIS: Iran's Aseman Airlines has signed a tentative deal to buy at least 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets, in the first new business with the U.S. planemaker since President Donald Trump took office vowing to take a tougher stance toward Iran. Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said on Tuesday representatives of Aseman and Boeing had signed an agreement in Tehran covering as many as 60 jets, including options, after a year of negotiations. Boeing described the deal as a "memorandum of agreement," meaning it is only outline for the time being and subject to government approvals. It covers plans for Aseman to buy 30 aircraft with options for a further 30, it added. If completed, the main part of the deal for 30 jets would be worth US$3.4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically pay around half that. Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities. Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact, but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord, which the U.S. aerospace industry says would support his agenda for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs. Washington last month imposed separate sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities following a ballistic missile test. Iran retaliated with its own sanctions. In a statement on the Aseman deal, Boeing cited U.S. Department of Commerce data suggesting an "aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States". TURBOPROP TALKS Boeing deliveries to Aseman would start in 2022, although the U.S. planemaker must first apply for licenses from the U.S. Treasury allowing it to proceed with the sale. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval," it said. In December the European Union banned Aseman from flying to the EU due to safety concerns, highlighting gaps in Iran's ageing fleet following decades of sanctions. The latest deal comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's government strives to highlight improvements resulting from the nuclear pact in the run-up to May presidential elections. So far IranAir has received three new Airbus jets under the deal. Rouhani is likely to run a campaign highlighting economic benefits of the nuclear deal, which opened Iran to foreign investment. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Rouhani must do more to improve the economy. Negotiators from European turboprop maker ATR were meanwhile due in Tehran to wrap up a deal to sell 20 aircraft to IranAir, industry sources said. The first aircraft has been sitting on the tarmac in Toulouse, France, for weeks, waiting for the talks to be completed. A deal for the airframes has already been reached but there has been uncertainty over the status of a separate deal needed for the engines, to be supplied by Pratt & Whitney Canada. The company is a subsidiary of United Technologies , one of a handful of aerospace and defense groups covered by last month's retaliatory sanctions by Tehran against U.S. firms, though Iran has not explicitly targeted civil aircraft engines. Iranian officials have told Reuters finalizing the ATR deal depends on getting a contract for engine spares and long-term maintenance of the engines once the planes are delivered. Pratt & Whitney Canada had no immediate comment.

Commenting on the new partnership with JPA, flydubai’s Chief Executive Officer, Ghaith Al Ghaith, said: “We have been committed to investing in product enhancements and technologies that exceed the expectations of the industry and our customers since day one. flydubai was the launch customer for the Boeing Sky Interior in 2009, we introduced a top of the line Inflight Entertainment system to our fleet in 2010 and in 2013 we launched our two-cabin configuration with the introduction of Business Class.” “We are teaming up with JPA, as one of the world’s leading design specialists, to deliver a new cabin interior reflective of the airline’s maturity, offering our more than 10 million annual passengers a more comfortable onboard experience across our growing network”, added Al Ghaith.

We've compared flight experiences on airlines in the region and have been getting to know the flydubai family of crew, engineers and management team.  They are a warm, friendly, smart and ambitious airline, have a clear vision of where they wish to go and value their customers highly. And we both share in the commitment to constantly innovative and strive for best in class solutions." "The Middle East region and the dynamism of Dubai in particular has interested us for some time and has led us to forming a local presence. There exists in Dubai a truly positive attitude and a desire to achieve great things in the 21st Century.  This approach reflects our own values and we were keen to establish and build on relationships in this fascinating region. Partnering with flydubai is a pleasure and an honour," said James Park founder and chairman of JPA Design. JPA Design's full scope of work takes in all cabin elements, including seat design and customisation for Economy and Business class, lavatories, full CMF (colour materials and finishes), soft furnishings - including curtains and carpets, service wear - bulkheads, lighting and Inflight Entertainment GUI (Interface) menu content.

REUTERS/Morteza Nikoubazl Reuters/Morteza Nikoubazl DUBAI/PARIS, April 4 (Reuters) - Iran's Aseman Airlines has signed a tentative deal to buy at least 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets, in the first new business with the U.S. planemaker since U.S. President Donald Trump took office vowing to take a tougher stance towards Iran. Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said on Tuesday that representatives of Aseman and Boeing had signed an agreement in Tehran covering as many as 60 jets, including options, after a year of negotiations. Boeing described the deal as a "memorandum of agreement," a type of transaction that falls short of a binding contract and is subject to government approvals. It covers concrete plans for Aseman to buy 30 aircraft with options for a further 30, it added. Advertisement If completed, the main part of the deal for 30 jets would be worth $3.4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically win discounts of around 50 percent for large deals. Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led last year to the lifting of most sanctions against Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear technology development activities. Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact, but has not explicitly stated a view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord, which the U.S. aerospace industry says would protect thousands of jobs. Washington last month imposed separate sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities following a ballistic missile test. Iran retaliated with its own sanctions. In a statement on the latest deal, Boeing cited U.S. Department of Commerce data suggesting an "aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States". Deliveries to Aseman would start in 2022. Boeing must now apply for licences from the U.S. Treasury allowing it to proceed with the sale. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval," it said. The latest deal comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to highlight improvements resulting from the nuclear deal in the run-up to May presidential elections. So far IranAir has received three new Airbus jets under the deal. In December the European Union banned Aseman from flying to the EU due to safety concerns, highlighting gaps in the country's ageing fleet following the decades of sanctions.

Nearly four months after Iran Air finalized a deal with Boeing to purchase 80 passenger planes, Aseman Airlines signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the US giant to buy 60 airplanes. The delivery of the first purchased airplane to the Aseman Airlines would take place in 2019, according to the airline. Also in a statement on Tuesday, Boeing confirmed that it had signed an agreement with Aseman Airlines on its intention to purchase 30 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes. "Boeing confirms the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Iran Aseman Airlines, expressing the airline’s intent to purchase 30 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes with a list price value of $3 billion. The agreement also provides the airline with purchase rights for 30 additional 737 MAXs," the US company said in the statement. Back in December, the chairman of Iran Air said the flag carrier had finalized an initial deal with Boeing to purchase 80 passenger planes. “Today, we signed a document with Boeing to buy 80 planes within 10 years,” Farhad Parvaresh said during the signing ceremony in Tehran on December 11. He added that the first deliveries are expected in 2018. The agreement envisaged the purchase of 50 twinjet narrow-body Boeing 737 planes and 30 long-range wide-body Boeing 777 aircraft at a total cost of $16.6 billion. Iran signed the initial plane purchase agreement with Boeing earlier in 2016, following the removal of anti-Iran sanctions with the coming into force of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The US Treasury Department has given the green light to Boeing to sell planes to Iran.   R1016170/P42410/S1193/CT18 Share this story: http://tn.ai/1370166 All Stories Death Toll in Landslide in Colombia Rises to 290 Daesh Attack in Iraq’s Tikrit Kills 15 Strong Earthquake Hits Norhteastern Iran (Urgent) Suicide Bombing Kills Six, Wounds 22 in Pakistan's Lahore Iranian, Russian FMs Discuss Ties, Regional Issues North Korea Test-Fires Missile into Sea ahead of Trump-Xi Summit UN Security Council to Hold Meeting on Idlib Attack Erdogan Says to Continue Making 'Nazi Remnants, Fascists' Remarks to EU Iran Fails to Qualify for Asian Boys’ U-19 Volleyball Championship Semis Putin, Merkel, Hollande Discuss Anti-Terrorism Data Exchange: Kremlin EU Ambassador Denounces Israel's West Bank Demolitions Policy Syria Denies Role in Idlib Chemical Attack War Heavily Damages Syria’s Agriculture: FAO NATO Chief Urges Germany to Spend More on Defense President: Iran Ready for Counter-Terrorism Cooperation with Russia Over 3,000 South Sudanese Flee to Uganda after Raid on Border Town: Refugees Aftab International Circus in Iran's Capital German Officials Meet with Journalist Imprisoned in Turkey × نمودار تغییر قیمت طلا و ارز تغییر قیمت لحظه نوع (0.03%) 1 3,758 price_dollar (-0.17%) -7 4,076 price_eur (-0.04%) -2 4,707 price_gbp (0.1%) 1 1,047 price_aed (-0.08%) -10,000 11,780,000 sekeb (-0.12%) -15,000 12,085,000 sekee (-0.22%) -15,000 6,825,000 nim (-0.27%) -10,000 3,750,000 rob (0.21%) 5,000 2,430,000 gerami (0.02%) 230 1,165,640 geram18 (0.02%) 300 1,554,170 geram24 (0.02%) 1,000 5,049,000 mesghal (0.04%) 50 1,256.80 ons (0.1%) 100 967.00 platinum (0.11%) 2 18.34 silver (0.12%) 100 810.00 palladium -- 51.34 oil (90%) 4,904 54.49 oil_brent (0.49%) 25 50.68 oil_opec (-0.01%) -4 77,719 bourse -- 1,059 price_try -- 584 price_cny (2.86%) 1 35 price_jpy (-0.07%) -2 2,901 price_cad (-0.17%) -5 2,920 price_aud (13.42%) 400 2,980 price_nzd (-0.1%) -4 3,848 price_chf -- 57 price_afn -- 420 price_sek -- 537 price_dkk -- 436 price_nok (0.4%) 50 12,350 price_kwd (-0.79%) -8 1,000 price_sar (0.48%) 5 1,045 price_qar (-0.2%) -20 9,800 price_omr -- 3 price_iqd -- 8 price_syp (22.86%) 16 70 price_inr -- 36 price_pkr (-0.7%) -20 2,830 price_sgd (-2.86%) -15 510 price_hkd (0.44%) 4 910 price_myr -- 116 price_thb (1.45%) 1 69 price_rub (-4.35%) -100 2,200 price_azn (-0.5%) -50 9,950 price_bhd بیشتر بروزرسانی: چهارشنبه ۱۶ فروردين - ۱۱:۳۴ × ثبت نام در خبرنامه خبرگزاری تسنیم برای دریافت خبرنامه آدرس ایمیل شما ضروری می باشد هر زمان که نیاز به ویرایش این اطلاعات داشتید، با وارد کردن ایمیلتان تغییرات را ذخیره کنید در صورتی که تمایل به ادامه اشتراک نداشتید، در ایمیلی که از سوی ما دریافت می کنید، عدم اشتراک را انتخاب کنید پس از ثبت نام، جهت تایید ایمیل/تلفن همراه ، برای شما پیامی ارسال می شود، لطفاً پیام را تایید کنید Name: Email: Mobile: نوع اخبار: اخبار برگزیده خبر فوری پیشنهاد سردبیر پوشش اخبار: کل سایت سرویس/حوزه ای خاص سرویس ها : Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Interview بازه زمانی دریافت خبر: هر 12 ساعتهر 24 ساعتهر 48 ساعتهفته ای یکبار Submit About Contact Us Archive Site map Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Cartoons Interview TASNIM NEWS .com   All Content by Tasnim News Agency is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

By Agamoni Ghosh April 4, 2017 11:13 BST The Boeing Deep Space Gateway will be orbiting the Moon Boeing Boeing, one of the six companies teaming up with Nasa to develop a deep space habitat, has released concept images of the docking station and a deep space transport vehicle that could hopefully send humans to Mars from a lunar base one day. The Deep Space Gateway as shown above aims to be a habitat that Boeing wants to send to cislunar space. It could house crucial research for space exploration and be a docking site for other space vehicles similar to the International Space Station (ISS). The plan is to dock the Deep Space Transport vehicle Boeing at the gateway to someday send humans to Mars from there. Depending on the atmospheric conditions on the red planet, astronauts can either stay on board or send a lander to Mars for surface missions. The transport vehicle will be built in such a way that astronauts are protected from deep space's harsh environment. The gateway will on the other hand be a long lasting, flexible, reusable and sustainable infrastructure that can operate for decades of human spaceflight. The orbital space near the Moon offers a deep space environment for testing new and emerging techniques for exploration. Missions to the lunar surface can be launched with the ability to return to Earth in days as against months as estimated by Nasa. The space agency plans to launch at least one Space Launch System (SLS) mission to the deep space gateway every year.

The agreement was signed between Iran's Aseman Airlines and Boeing and involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes. The agreement came after almost a year of negotiations between Aseman Airlines and Boeing. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type to Iran’s flag-carrier airline Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air’s order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion. The planes are expected to be delivered to Aseman Airlines from 2019. The Iranian airline is expected to receive at least five of the purchased aircraft during the same year. Boeing 737 MAX planes - that would enter service in the second half of 2017 – have a passenger capacity of 130 people and are specifically adequate for domestic and regional flights. The planes that Aseman Airlines has purchased from Boeing would increase the company’s passenger transportation capacity to above 8,000 seats. Iran Air said in December 2016 that it had finalized an agreement with Boeing to buy 80 new planes. The company accordingly announced that Boeing would start to deliver the planes in 2018 and the deliveries would be completed within 10 years. Iran has already received the first three of a total of 100 Airbus planes that it has purchased from the European company through an agreement worth around $18 billion. More deliveries are expected to take place over the next months.         Related News Iran Receives 3rd Airbus  Official: Airbus to Deliver 3rd A330 to Iran Next Week  Envoy: Iran to Receive 2nd Airbus Today  Iran Announces Deal with Foreign Financier on Purchase of 77 New Boeing, Airbus Planes  Envoy: Iran to Receive 2nd Airbus Soon  2 More New Planes to Join Iran Air Fleet Next Month  Airbus Officially Delivers 1st A321 to Iran Air  Iran Receives 1st Airbus 321 Passenger Plane  Iran Air, ATR to Ink $400mln Deal Next Week  Deputy Minister: Iran Air to Receive 8 New Passenger Planes from Airbus, ATR by Yearend  LATEST STORIES (20) Turkish Forces Kill 5 PKK Militants in Eastern Sirnak Province Child Trafficking in Britain Hits Record High Iraqi Army Starts Military Operation to Recapture Anbar Districts Damascus Blames Terrorist Groups for Using Chemical Weapons in Syria Syria Categorically Denies Using Any Poisonous Gases in Idlib Windows 10's Game Mode Makes Unplayable Games Playable New Invention Uses Bacteria to Purify Water Materials May Lead to Self-Healing Smartphones Future Climate to Be Warmest in 420 Million Years Quakes Hit Northeastern Iran Syria in Last 24 Hours: Army Inflicts Heavy Losses on Terrorists in Homs Province Syrian Gov't Forces Establish Security at Maardis Al-Nusra Suffers Heavy Losses in Syrian Armed Forces' Attacks in Hama Syrian Army Captures Abu Dhour Mountain in Eastern Homs Thousands Gather in Massive Protest to US-Sponsored Saudi Terrorism in Yemen Turkish Forces Kill 5 PKK Militants in Eastern Sirnak Province TEHRAN (FNA)- Turkish military forces killed five Kurdistan Workers’ Party militants during an operation in country's Eastern Sirnak province, local media said.

Middle East Online Deal made possible by 2015 Iran nuclear accord CHICAGO - US plane maker Boeing said Tuesday that Iran's Aseman Airlines has agreed to purchase 30 of its 737 MAX jets for $3.0 billion, with an option to buy 30 more. The deal was made possible by the 2015 Iran nuclear accord under which Tehran agreed to scale down substantially its nuclear activities and submit to ultra-close inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency in exchange for relief from painful sanctions. "Boeing confirms the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Iran Aseman Airlines, expressing the airline's intent to purchase 30 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes with a list price value of $3 billion. "The agreement also provides the airline with purchase rights for 30 additional 737 MAXs," the US group said in a statement. Delivery for the aircraft would be scheduled to start in 2022, Boeing said, adding that a contract of this magnitude "creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States." Boeing said it would continue to "follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran's airlines" and added that "all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon US government approval." US President Donald Trump said while campaigning for the presidency that he wanted to "dismantle" the July 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers including the United States.   Syria 'toxic gas' attack kills 58 civilians Kyrgyz suicide bomber staged Russia metro attack Bahrain king approves military trials for civilians Trump hails Sisi's 'fantastic job' in Egypt April fool's advert from Ulker backfires US lawmakers urge action on Syria after gas attack UK says Syria ‘chemical’ attack resembles Assad’s work Global chemical arms watchdog seeking information on Syria attack EU blames Assad regime for Syria chemical attack UN warns Syria refugee aid funds 'desperate' Turkey opposition journalists face long jail terms Syria opposition says chemical attack 'calls into question' peace process Erdogan tells Putin Syria ‘chemical’ attack could hinder peace talks Warplanes bomb hospital treating Syria chemical attack victims Britain's May heads to Saudi seeking deals Spanish police seize Assad family assets Turkey snubs Syria meeting in Brussels Arab leaders focus on Iran threat, reviving peace plan Kuwait to borrow more to plug budget deficit Evacuation of four Syria towns delayed Iranian Aseman Airlines agrees $3bn deal for 30 Boeing planes Iranian cleric says bad drivers are sinning Riyadh likely to push for continued oil output restraint Tribal clashes erupt in Sudan's West Kordofan state Turkey dismisses 45 more judges, prosecutors in latest purge Israel fears rising Iranian influence in region St Petersburg metro blast kills 'about 10' Africa intelligence officials discuss 'triangle of horror' Somali pirates seize Indian ship carrying 11 crew members Tunisia to hold first local elections since 2011 revolution Over 250 Turks seek political asylum in Germany EU says no future for Assad in post-conflict Syria Bahrain reduces sentence for opposition chief Qatar to boost gas output via world’s biggest field Turkish inflation hits highest rate in eight years Five charged with beating asylum-seeker in London EU nations, Israel eye longest undersea gas pipeline AIPAC still rules but alternative voices are growing louder Trumps sends son-in-law to Iraq Trump welcomes Sisi despite harsh criticism on rights record Emirates, Etihad to tighten screening on Australia flights Wide gap between Arab leaders’ official stands and facts on the ground Iran’s Arabs take to the streets in weekly protests Britain apologises to Saudi after egg thrown at visiting general Erdogan’s pact with Putin changes war in Syria

The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck with Tehran under the Obama administration. Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm's work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal also includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes. It said the first deliveries of the single-aisle aircraft to Aseman would start in 2022. FILE -- In this March 7, 2017 file photo, the first of the large Boeing 737 MAX 9 models, Boeing's newest commercial airplane, sits outside its production plant, in Renton, Wash. Boeing Co. announced Tuesday, April 4, 2017 that it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines for 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File ) Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, which undergo final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. "According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States," Boeing said in a statement. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval." Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks over the past year between the airline and Boeing. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019, contradicting Boeing. The European Union blacklisted Aseman from European skies in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal comes as part of the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. After the atomic accord, Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country's flag carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes' components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve this latest deal. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world, home to 80 million people. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wildcard is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to the Islamic Republic. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Plane deliveries would begin in 2022, the company said Tuesday.  The transaction still needs to be approved by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, an arm of the Treasury Department, Boeing said.  Boeing, the world's No. 1 plane maker, said Iran Aseman Airlines plans to buy 30 of the new narrowbody planes. The deal would have a list price value of $3 billion, though customers typically get discounts. The agreement also gives the Iranian carrier purchase rights for 30 more 737 Max planes.  Boeing and rival Airbus SE last year won billion-dollar deals to sell planes to the Islamic Republic's flag carrier Iran Air before Mr. Trump became the president in January.  Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

All Rights Reserved. Firm has offices in both Sittingbourne and Rochester and employs 260 people nationwide Share Comment Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. Usurv Aerospace and defence firm Aeromet International has securing a multi-million pound deal with airplane manufacturer Boeing in a deal which will boost its business sites in both Rochester and Sittingbourne. The firm is a leading supplier of airframe and aero engine components and has expanded its relationship with Boeing by securing the biggest set of orders in the company’s 40 year history. It has been awarded an extension to its existing long-term agreements covering the supply of parts for the Boeing 737, 767 and 777 airplanes. In addition to the extension of existing contracts, Aeromet has secured a new contract to supply parts for the 777X, Boeing’s next generation airplane which is due to enter service in 2020. The firm currently employs 260 staff at Worcester and the two Kent sites. Its Sittingbourne base is on Eurolink Way, its Rochester site on Laker Road. Simon Holliday, Aeromet’s managing director, said: “This agreement builds upon Aeromet’s 17-year relationship with Boeing and is a natural extension of a partnership that has seen the companies operational, engineering and quality teams collaborate on projects that have developed innovative solutions for complex parts. This win is a great example of what is possible for Aeromet when we focus on providing customers with innovative solutions and fantastic service.” The Aeromet deal was cemented following a UK suppliers’ trip hosted at Boeing’s commercial airplane production facilities in the US last year which was supported by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Department for International Trade. “Boeing and the UK aerospace industry have a long, mutually beneficial history,” said Sir Michael Arthur, president, Boeing Europe and managing director of Boeing UK and Ireland. “In the past year we have expanded our outreach to local suppliers to better prepare them to compete and win Boeing work. Aeromet’s recent contract award is evidence that together, Boeing and UK companies continue to win the marketplace.” Key to Aeromet’s success is support from the government-backed Sharing in Growth (SiG) programme. Endorsed by Boeing, SiG is designed to raise the productivity and competitiveness of the UK aerospace supply chain. The productivity improvements achieved as part of this programme were key to Aeromet securing an extension to its existing contracts in the face of global competition, according to Mr Holliday. Established in 2013 with £50 million from the Regional Growth Fund and endorsement from Boeing, Airbus, BAE Systems, Bombardier, GE, GKN and Rolls-Royce, SiG has already helped secure contracts worth just over £1.6 billion for the first 37 firms on the programme, equivalent to around 2,600 UK jobs. Ultimately the programme’s goal is to safeguard 10,000 UK jobs.

Boeing is already working with NASA to develop the Space Launch System (SLS), the very heavy lifter it's hoped will power a Mars shot. Now it's also offered up conceptual designs for other kit that it thinks will be useful for that mission. First, the “Deep Space Gateway”, a space station it's envisioned will be positioned in Cislunar space, which is to say in or beyond the orbit of the Moon rather than in Earth orbit. Boeing's developed a design for that facility it says could be hauled into place with just four SLS missions. NASA's fact sheet (PDF) for the SLS explains its cargo-carrying variants should have sufficient capacity to launch “a small deep-space habitat module” so we're guessing Boeing's singing from that hymn sheet with variation or two of its own. It's been ages since humans went beyond low Earth orbit so it's long been assumed we'll need to spend some time near the Moon to give deep space tech a good solid shakedown before trying to visit Mars. Boeing's announcements on Monday offer a glimpse of how that might happen, complete with visions of the Gateway as a base for lunar exploration. The Gateway would also be the staging point for the “Deep Space Transport vehicle” that would make the trek to Mars. Whether that's an SLS or something else isn't explained. We do know that both the Gateway and the Transport are real projects being worked on under NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Technologies (Next Step) program and the High Power Solar Electric Propulsion technology development effort within the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate. Boeing's concept illustration of a Deep Space Transport vehicle at Mars Boeing also puts its name to a timeline that would see the Gateway aloft and assembled “in the early 2020s”. That's probably a little late to meet United States president Donald Trump's wish that the nation's 250th birthday in 2026 might be marked by “American footprints on distant worlds”.

The service and Air Force have for years envisioned future V-22 weapons to aid special operators moving into and out of hostile territory. (U.S. Marine Corps photo/Koby I. Saunders) Posted By: Oriana Pawlyk March 30, 2017 The Air Force and Marine Corps have for years envisioned future V-22 weapons to better aid special operators moving into and out of hostile territory aboard the tilt-rotor aircraft. The list may now include lasers. “Think traditional rockets and guns,” John “Bones” Parker, Tiltrotor Business Development manager for Boeing Co. and a former Marine aviator, told Military.com on Tuesday. “But [the services] have said, ‘Anything new, we’ll entertain’ — so you can think [lasers] and even … non-lethal-type weapons, like sonic waves or sound waves.” Parker told reporters during a Boeing media event at the company’s facilities outside Washington, D.C., that officials have tested “forward firing weapons systems mounted [on] the fuselage” such as precision-guided 2.75-inch rockets, and the tube-launched AGM-176 Griffin missile “to demonstrate that the V-22 can fire both in the forward fight … and also 60 degrees.” He said the intent is not to turn the V-22 into a close-air-support, AH-64 Apache or AH-1W Super Cobra-style attack gunship, but to have reinforcements. “That would include a forward-firing gun, large caliber on the turret, precision-guided munitions out the front, out the back and out the hell-hole,” or in the hatch under the fuselage, he said. In 2015, the Marine Corps tested a non-explosive version of the Griffin missile on the MV-22. It traveled about 4.5 miles, according to Marine Corps Times. The Air Force flies the CV-22. The Bell-Boeing-built V-22 has the possibility of such capabilities, but Parker said the configuration differences between the variants are significant. Of the 300 or so V-22s already flying, there are about 75 different configurations per platform. The goal is to standardize, he said but didn’t elaborate. Whether lasers could enhance munitions, Parker reiterated, “It’s not a program of record yet, but it is something on the drawing board.” Navy V-22 Meanwhile, the Navy‘s V-22 program is on track to eventually produce 48 aircraft for the sea service, Parker said. “The requirement was always there,” he said. The Navy has since determined it only needs 44 of the aircraft, dubbed CMV-22 and designed to replace the C-2A Greyhound for carrier onboard delivery. Last year, Naval Air Systems Command awarded a joint venture between Textron’s Bell subsidiary and Boeing a $151 million contract to begin engineering on its variant. The main difference in the CMV-22 from its sister aircraft is the fuel capacity it will need to carry for the distances traveled, Parker said. “And some systems in the back to facilitate getting passengers on and off, and a couple different radio systems,” he said. Over the next two years, the firms plan to develop the fuselage in Boeing’s Philadelphia plant and wings at Bell’s Amarillo, Texas, facility, he said. Parker said the CMV-22’s delivery will likely be in the early 2020s, after systems integration and testing. The V-22 program’s “production line is hot and it’s going to stay hot and stay running,” he said. Boeing is hoping to expand the V-22 market in international sales. In 2015, Bell-Boeing was awarded a contract to produce five Ospreys through a Navy foreign military sales contract for Japan, marking the first foreign sale of the tilt-rotor aircraft.

Most Popular Boeing By Jay Bennett Apr 3, 2017 The maiden flights for both the Boeing 787-10 and the Airbus A319neo were carried out Friday, March 31. The two airplanes are the newest members of the 787 family for Boeing and the A320neo family for Airbus. The two aircraft manufacturers both cite efficiency as their primary reason for building the new planes, but these two jets take radically different approaches. The 787-10 is the longest of the 787 family, holding 40 more passengers or 15 percent more cargo than the 787-9, while the A319neo is the smallest jet in the A320neo family and relies on the new CFM International LEAP-1A engines to achieve efficient flight. Airbus Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Boeing's two-aisle 787-10 will fly transoceanic and other long-distance flights. The Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer has secured 149 orders for the twin-engine jet from nine airlines around the world. The longer fuselage and composite airframe are meant to improve fuel efficiency per seat, with capacity for up to 330 passengers. The stretched fuselage does come with the cost of a shorter overall range, however. The 787-10 will have a range of about 7,400 miles compared to 8,800 miles for the 787-9 and the 8,450 miles that the 787-8 can fly. This means Boeing's newest jet airliner will be able to comfortably hop between Europe and the United States, Europa and Asia, and Asia and North America, but it won't quite have the legs for flights between Australia and the Americas. Related Story 13 of the Most Incredible Boeing 747s Most Popular The single-aisle Airbus A319neo will be capable of trans-Atlantic flights, but will primarily be used for shorter routes more suited to its range of about 4,300 miles—roughly 60 miles more than the other A320neo variants. The A319neo will have capacity for just 124 passengers compared to the 150 that can fly on an A320neo and 185 for an A321neo. Airbus plans to retain fuel efficiency in the A320neo family by leveraging new, high-efficiency engines and taking advantage of aerodynamic airframe designs. The 787-10 flew for just under six hours over Boeing's South Carolina facilities, where the 787-10 will be manufactured, as the pilots tested flight controls, handling qualities and other systems on the aircraft. The A319neo flew from Hamburg-Finkenwerder Airport in Germany to Toulouse, France, staying aloft for five hours as the pilots tested the craft. Boeings first 787-10s will be delivered sometime in the first half of 2018 to launch customers Singapore Airlines, British Airways, and United Airlines, among others. Airbus has yet to announce a launch customer for the A319neo, and only about 55 planes have been ordered thus far. With a new long-haul airliner from Boeing and a new narrow-body jet from Airbus, these two aviation giants continue to duke it out for control of the skies.

"It is common knowledge within the defense industry that Lockheed Martin employees are not to complain about the Navy's plans to purchase another batch of Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets because of a deal worked out by the president to push for a multiyear block buy of Lockheed Martin F-35s," Dan Grazier, a defense industry expert at the Washington watchdog group Project On Government Oversight, wrote in a blog post Monday. A Lockheed spokesman called the report "100 percent false." Boeing and the Pentagon declined comment for this story. Analysts have previously said a multiyear block buy could help Lockheed change the economics on the aircraft and help improve margins and lower costs. It also would give the company more leverage with its partner companies and supply base by providing a steady flow of work over several years. Yet Grazier said the F-35 joint strike fighter program "legally does not qualify for a block buy. That's the big problem with this." The analyst said he hasn't seen any figures on a block buy price for the F-35. "If this [F-35] block buy goes through, the United States taxpayers will be committed to buying about 33 percent of the planned buy of F-35s," said Grazier. "We're talking nearly 800 aircraft." To date, more than 200 F-35s are in operation by the U.S. armed forces and seven partner nations. Earlier this year, Lockheed estimated that more than 3,000 of the aircraft would be purchased, with about 600 jets going to international allies. Until now, the government has purchased F-35 stealth aircraft under a series of so-called low-rate initial production agreements. "They're moving beyond low-rate initial production, but they're just not saying that they're doing it," Grazier said. "That's kind of the fuzzy gray area of legality that's going on here." The F-35A variant, a conventional takeoff and landing plane, is expected to represent the majority of the aircraft produced. There's also the F-35B variant for the Marines capable of short takeoffs and vertical landings, while the F-35C for the Navy is a carrier variant. Last month, Lockheed and the Department of Defense agreed on a deal involving the 10th batch of F-35 aircraft, resulting in a savings of $728 million — a nearly 8 percent reduction in the price on the F-35C variant of the joint strike fighter. Even so, the F-35C Navy variant under the 10th batch deal still was priced at $121.8 million, while the F-35A, or Air Force variant, was $94.6 million. Grazier said his source within the defense industry indicated that there's been a "tonal change" due to "a much larger deal worked out by President Donald Trump with Lockheed Martin and Boeing." The F-35 joint strike program, the largest weapons acquisition program in Pentagon history, is expected to cost more than a $1 trillion over its life cycle of an estimated 50-plus years. While Lockheed is the prime contractor on the F-35, one of the major partner companies is Northrop Grumman. In all, more than 1,300 supplier companies are involved in the F-35 program. Since December, Trump has met several times to discuss the F-35 program with Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson. He's also met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg to discuss the company's F/A-18 fighter and Air Force One replacement contact. Trump has criticized both programs for the costs. "The decision to purchase weapons should be based solely on the performance of the system, not on backroom political and business deals," Grazier said in his blog. If Boeing secures a new deal for its F/A-18 or gets an update on the plane, it could be good news for the company because it would be a shot in the arm for its tactical aircraft business and extend production of the jet. "Heavy F-18 use and F-35 delays are straining the Navy fighter fleet and so we could see the service seeking perhaps a dozen more F-18's annually over the next couple of years," JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a research note Friday. According to Grazier, the F-35 doesn't legally qualify for a multiyear block buy because it fails to meet all the required criteria. Specifically, one area it falls short in is a "stable design" requirement, the analyst said. The F-35 has not completed the development phase yet so the design "is inherently unstable," Grazier told CNBC in an interview. As an example, he said the F-35C engineers are having to "redesign the nose gear" due to a "vertical oscillation problem" during carrier launches. "It bounces a whole lot ... and gives the pilots whiplash." In January, Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 program and how the government can reduce costs and options it might have with Boeing's F/A-18. He also ordered a review of Boeing's presidential plane replacement program. Reports suggest an upgraded F/A-18 — sometimes dubbed the Advanced Super Hornet — could come in at a cost lower than the F-35C and feature new sensor technology and more range, among other things. But in testimony last week at her Senate confirmation hearing, Air Force secretary nominee Heather Wilson questioned whether the F/A-18 can provide stealth features such as the fifth-generation F-35. "The real thing I don't think you could do with an F-18 or a F-15 or a F-16 is give it stealth capability retroactively," Wilson said. She pointed out that the Chinese are developing stealth capability in fighters and added, "I don't see how we can stop modernizing and expect to win a near-peer fight. I'd rather have that fight be unfair and be on our side."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News Boeing Unveils Deep Space Concepts for Moon and Mars Exploration COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Apr. 3, 2017 – Boeing [NYSE: BA] today unveiled concepts for the deep space gateway and transport systems that could help achieve NASA’s goal of having robust human space exploration from the Moon to Mars. NASA’s Space Launch System, which Boeing is helping develop, would deliver the habitat to cislunar space near the Moon. Known as the Deep Space Gateway, the habitat could support critical research and help open opportunities for global government or commercial partnerships in deep space, including lunar missions. It would be powered by a Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) system. “The ability to simultaneously launch humans and cargo on SLS would allow us to assemble the gateway in four launches in the early 2020s,” said Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing’s space exploration division. The Deep Space Gateway could be the waypoint for Mars missions. Utilizing a docking system akin to what the International Space Station uses for commercial operations, it could host the Deep Space Transport vehicle, which would take humans to Mars. Once near Mars, crews could deploy a lander for surface missions or conduct other scientific and robotic missions in orbit. The transport vehicle would be equipped with a habitat specifically designed to protect passengers from deep space’s harsh environment and its own robust SEP bus. In fact, both of Boeing’s concepts leverage proven solar electric propulsion technology and hardware design from the 702 satellite family. The gateway and transport systems are partially being developed as part of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Technologies (Next Step) program and an ongoing High Power SEP technology development effort within the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD).

Elaine Thompson AP i By NASSER KARIMI and JON GAMBRELL Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TEHRAN, Iran Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. Some engine parts for the 737 MAX are designed and built by Boeing in North Charleston. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured Boeing’s North Charleston plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. “On the one hand, there’s the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. “They'll have to make tough decisions.” Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran’s third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi said the deal came following several rounds of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts.

(AP) TEHRAN: Boeing Co. said on Tuesday it has signed a deal worth $3 billion with Iran’s Aseman Airlines to supply 30 737 MAX aircraft to the carrier, the first major sale by a US company to Tehran under President Donald Trump. The new agreement comes on top of the sale worth $16.6 billion Boeing previously made in Iran following the nuclear deal struck with Tehran under the Obama administration. Boeing said the deal also includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes. It said the first deliveries of the single-aisle aircraft to Aseman would start in 2022. Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, which undergo final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. “According to the US Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the US,” Boeing said in a statement. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval.” Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told the AP that the deal came following several rounds of talks over the past year between the airline and Boeing. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019, contradicting Boeing.

Boeing, a leading commercial aerospace company and a top American exporter, said in a statement that the agreement, which requires U.S. government approval, would create about 18,000 American jobs. The company’s agreement with Aseman Airlines, an Iranian carrier described as the nation’s third-largest, is the first to be announced by any big American business with Iran since President Trump took office in January. Boeing announced an agreement last December to sell 80 commercial aircraft to Iran Air, the national carrier, a deal valued at $16.6 billion. Commercial aircraft sales to Iran are permitted under the nuclear agreement reached in 2015 involving Iran and major global powers, including the United States. The agreement relaxed many economic sanctions against Iran in return for the country’s verifiable pledges that its nuclear work would be peaceful in nature. Trump has repeatedly denounced the nuclear agreement, describing it as a giveaway to a country that he and his aides have called a leading state sponsor of terrorism and a destabilizing force in the Middle East. But Trump also has vowed to protect U.S. industries and workers from foreign competition. Aerospace analysts said that together, Boeing’s deals with Iran amount to a test of the Trump administration’s priorities. If Boeing is forbidden to sell the aircraft to Iran, plane makers in other countries might fill the gap. “There was always going to be a clash over this issue,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation research consultancy in Fairfax, Va. “Trump campaigned on getting tough with Iran,” Aboulafia said, but “at the end of the day, these are manufacturing jobs. It’s really hard to say, ‘Yes, we are giving this work to the Europeans.’ ” The Boeing announcement contrasted with other signs of growing hostility between the Trump administration and Iran. Last month, the United States imposed sanctions on 25 Iranian entities and individuals over what the White House called illegal Iranian missile tests. Trump included Iran on the blacklist of Muslim-majority countries subject to his proposed visa ban, which is currently blocked in the courts. It was not clear from the Boeing announcement whether the tentative deal with Aseman Airlines had been negotiated under Trump or under President Obama. Boeing officials did not immediately return emailed requests for comment. The announcement, posted on Boeing’s website, said Aseman intended to purchase 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft valued at $3 billion, with rights to purchase an additional 30. Deliveries would be scheduled to start in 2022. Aseman currently has a fleet of 31 aircraft, a mixture of Boeing, Airbus and Fokker models with an average age of 25 years, according to the website Planespotters.net. The Boeing deal requires permission from the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department. U.S. critics of Iran in Congress and elsewhere have repeatedly objected to Boeing’s plans to sell new aircraft to Iran, arguing that at least some of the planes could be diverted for illicit military use.

It is the first major sale to Iran by a US company under the new Trump administration. Reportedly the European Union has blacklisted Aseman from European skies in December last year due to safety concerns. It is not the first time Boeing has been active here. It previously agreed a $16.6bn sale in the Islamic Republic when Barack Obama was in power and after he struck a nurcear deal with Tehran  - an agreement which Trump has criticized. Boeing said today's deal includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes and revealed first deliveries would start in 2022.

During the test, which was conducted at Maryland's NAS Patuxent River recently, a US Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jet fired the stealthy missile for the first time, the media reported Monday. "The first time event of releasing LRASM from the F/A-18E/F is a major milestone towards meeting early operational capability in 2019," Mike Fleming, Lockheed Martin's LRASM program director, said in a statement. "The program is executing the integration and test contract, maturing subsystems and proving flight worthiness." According to Lockheed, the LRASM "is designed to detect and destroy specific targets within groups of ships by employing advanced technologies that reduce dependence on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms, network links and GPS navigation." The missile is based on the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile - Extended Range (JASSM-ER) and would be used both by the US Navy and the Air Force. According to Fleming, the missile would first be integrated onboard the US Air Force's B-1B strategic bomber in 2018 and then on the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet a year later. Boeing to make more sub-killer aircraft The Navy also announced on Monday that it had granted a $2.2 billion contract to Boeing for 17 new P-8A Poseidon Maritime Surveillance Aircraft, designed to track and destroy submarines. With a range of up to 7,200 kilometers (4,500 miles) without the need to refuel, the Poseidon aircraft can carry several types of bombs and torpedoes while reaching speeds of about 490 knots (900 kilometers per hour). Boeing plans to equip the Poseidon with a new system that allows it drop torpedoes from altitudes of 30,000 feet (9,100 meters) or higher. Overall, the Navy has purchased 78 of the aircraft, with around 50 of them already delivered. The aircraft would replace the force's ageing fleet of Lockheed P-3 Orion anti-submarine/maritime surveillance aircraft. US President Donald Trump has vowed to increase the country's military spending by over $50 billion next year. This is while, Washington often bars other countries from testing or purchasing similar weaponry, even for defensive purposes.

Rather than joyrides, the zip line is intended to give astronauts a superfast way to escape during a launchpad emergency. The system is similar to the slide-wire baskets NASA once used for space shuttle crews. ULA, which will provide launch services for crews riding aboard Boeing CST-100 Starliner capsules, mulled over several different options, including tracks and a gondola, before settling on a zip-line system and a partner to build it. That partner, Terra-Nova, has designed and built some of the most challenging recreational zip lines around, including an 8,350-foot (2,545 m) ride over Copper Canyon in Chihuahua, Mexico, the world’s longest zip line.

Credit: NASA This week, officials with Terra-Nova, ULA and Boeing gathered with reporters at the edge of the Royal Gorge canyon, southwest of Colorado Springs, where thrill seekers can take a 40-plus-mph (64 km/h) ride on a Terra-Nova zip line suspended 1,250 feet (380 m) over the deepest canyon in Colorado. To design a launchpad escape system, Terra-Nova built a launch tower mockup at its Utah headquarters and started testing how to adapt its patented system to accommodate the special needs of astronauts, who may be escaping in smoky or other hazardous conditions.

It was interfacing the astronauts into the system that was the challenge," said Terra-Nova founder and inventor Eric Cylvick. The biggest differences between the new zip line at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Pad 41 and Terra-Nova’s recreational systems are the seats, which are larger to accommodate the astronauts’ pressurized flight suits and bright orange, so they can be more easily seen. The company installed five lines at Pad 41, each of which has four seats. So as many as 20 people can escape from the launch complex if necessary. In addition to a typical four-member astronaut crew, Boeing and ULA expect that about six technicians will be on the launchpad to assist the crew into the capsule and close the hatch. The goal is to be able to evacuate everyone from level 12 of the Crew Access Tower, located 172 feet (52 m) above the launchpad, to the ground, in 90 seconds.

Credit: United Launch Alliance "In a lot of ways, it’s actually easier than the (shuttle) slide-wire system," said Chris Ferguson, a former NASA astronaut who now oversees Starliner crew and mission operations. The slide-wire system required three or four people to climb into a basket before it would release and glide to the ground, which made for some complicated logistics, Ferguson said. "This is going to be a whole lot easier." ULA and Boeing declined to release the system’s cost. NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to begin flying astronauts to the International Space Station in late 2018. When the private spaceships start flying, they will break the monopoly on crew transportation that Russia has held since the space shuttle's 2011 retirement. SpaceX, which plans to fly crew from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, has not yet unveiled its crew escape system. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+.

The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump has long criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm's work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. "On the one hand, there's the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran," said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice-president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. "They'll have to make tough decisions." Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran's third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesperson Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several rounds of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country's flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s.

KC-135 Stratotanker. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg The U.S. Air Force’s military transport chief is tapping Silicon Valley, the defense industry and the Pentagon’s new innovation office in search of electronic cloaking technologies out of “Star Trek” to shrink the profiles of aerial tankers on enemy radar. “I’ve got airplanes with big fat bodies and long wings,” General Carlton Everhart, head of the Air Mobility Command, said Tuesday in an interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in New York. “I’ve got first-generation tankers refueling fifth-gen fighters. The enemy doesn’t have to look for the fighter -- he just has to look for me.” Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Everhart said he’s spoken with technology companies, defense contractors, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and military service laboratories on an idea still in its earliest stage: Retrofitting tankers as old as the 1950s-era KC-135 and as new as Boeing Co.’s KC-46 with technology to alter the plane’s radar image, or waveform, so it appears to be “either in a different location in the air” or “reduced or disappears altogether: Now you see me, now you don’t.” “I asked industry for a cloaking device and they all laughed -- they said you’ve been watching too much” science fiction. “I said, ‘Listen to me -- this is what I want -- something that would be able to change the waveform.”’ “I’m piggybacking off industry,” Everhart said “If I put it in the military acquisition system, it would be 50 years before I get it out because of the regulations that we have.” Pilot Shortage Based in Illinois, the Air Mobility Command moves U.S. forces and equipment around the globe, fuels planes in midair and provides evacuation of wounded or endangered troops. On other topics, Everhart said: *The Air Force and commercial airlines have a concern in common: finding enough pilots to replace a generation nearing retirement age. Everhart is convening a conference May 18 at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland with representatives of 23 civilian airlines, top service officials and representatives of the National Guard and Air Force Reserve to discuss working together on recruiting and training. The Air Mobility Command has a shortage of 300 pilots currently, and that threatens to grow far worse by 2021 as 1,600 more pilots become eligible to leave the service. “We are in direct competition for the same product” and “I cannot outspend the airlines,” he said. “So I’ve got to be complementary with them.” * His command’s tankers fly 40 percent of aircraft sorties over Iraq and Syria against Islamic State terrorists. Air Force statistics indicate KC-135 and KC-10 tankers performed 81,000 aerial refueling operations last year, up from 29,000 in 2014 when operations began that August. “Everyone says this is a shooting war, but we are providing them all that gas,” Everhart said. Last year, Everhart’s aircraft flew the equivalent of 66 years, he said. * He wants to equip his tankers with lasers that can destroy ground-to-air missiles instead of just using the intense beams to blind the missile’s warhead as current defensive systems do. * He said he’d use some of the added money that President Donald Trump has proposed for the fiscal 2018 defense budget to bring up to flying status eight C-5M transports stored at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and Travis Air Force Base in California. They’re languishing over a lack of maintenance after $105 million had been spent on each to refurbish. * The Air Force program office is reviewing the current KC-46 tanker schedule with Boeing in light of a 14-month delay in delivering the first 18 aircraft by August. The latest schedule calls for delivering 20 by October 2018. The first transport is scheduled for delivery in September, and Everhart says he intends to fly it. “What is in the art of the doable -- are we going to meet all the milestones?” Everhart said. He said he told Boeing “I’m a very, very demanding customer.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

But it will go through, KIO said. Ministry said that the procedure was in accordance with Polish law and will appeal the decision. The timeline of the process is very complicated, yet crucial. The funds earmarked for buying the VIP planes were from the 2016 budget and would expire last Friday to be returned to the state coffers. On Thursday, KIO lifted the ban it placed on the transaction, which was put there, as three companies appealed the decision for not being allowed to submit their offers in a tender. The KIO examination was still ongoing at that time, and its results were supposed to be announced on Monday. The deal with Boeing was inked on Friday. Since the deal was signed when the ban was lifted, KIO can not annul it, and it stands. Still, the Chamber ruled that the Ministry of Defence broke the law by negotiating the deal only with Boeing without organizing a tender for the VIP planes. According to Polish law, Ministry of Defence can order equipment without tender, if due to technical reasons, there is only one supplier or to protect exclusive rights. According to the KIO this was not the case this time. In its decision, KIO awarded The Jet Business International and Altenrhein Aviation AG PLN 18,600 each, and dismissed the motion filed by Aerospace International Group as Polish military counterintelligence service issued a negative opinion regarding the company’s activity.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News Aviation News: Jeppesen and Garmin Expand Garmin Pilot App Wireless Data Capabilities AERO Friedrichshafen, Germany | 04 Apr 2017 | By Jeppesen Garmin International Inc., a unit of Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN), and Jeppesen, a Boeing Company, recently announced new wireless data transfer capabilities for Jeppesen terminal charts that are accessed through select Garmin avionics and the iOS-based Garmin Pilot app. This development enhances the integrated data capabilities from the two companies that advance cockpit technology and improve the flying experience for general aviation pilots. “The ability to provide wireless data updates streamlines the flight preparation process and allows pilots to take the skies more quickly,” said Scott Reagan, director, Jeppesen OEM Client Management. “This wireless data transfer capability illustrates how Garmin and Jeppesen work together to simplify the delivery of essential flight data to private pilots flying with Garmin avionics and Garmin Pilot.” Pilots using the GTN 650/750 touchscreen navigator or the G1000 NXi integrated flight deck with Flight Stream 510 will now be able to wirelessly transfer Jeppesen terminal charts through the iOS-based Garmin Pilot app to their avionics systems. The Flight Stream 510 MultiMediaCard (MMC) from Garmin includes Database Concierge, the tool that transfers Jeppesen aviation database updates from the app to supported Garmin avionics. “As we continue to pack more features and capabilities into Garmin Pilot, we’re excited to provide our customers around the world with a premier application that they can utilize throughout every phase of flight,” said Carl Wolf, Garmin vice president of aviation sales and marketing. “As our global customer base continues to grow, we are excited to further expand game-changing app capabilities, including wireless connectivity with Jeppesen and other enhancements that provide access to information for pilots to make the best informed decisions on the ground and in-flight.” Jeppesen terminal charts can be viewed within Garmin Pilot from the charts page and in split screen mode alongside the moving map. Geo-referenced Jeppesen charts can also be overlaid on the moving map for seamless navigation. An electronic Jeppesen chart subscription for Garmin Pilot is required to access Jeppesen terminal charts through the app. Customers interested in purchasing a Jeppesen electronic charting subscription may visit: www.Jeppesen.com/garminpilot.  Please visit www.garmin.com/aviation for additional information about the Garmin Pilot app for the general aviation community.

Without knowing the distinctions we are making here, everyone agrees that each aircraft should be a fully determined system. Every time the pilot pulls the control yoke back, the airplane should climb. Every time the pilot pushes the yoke forward, the airplane should descend.

The Chronicle did offer one example, an essay generated from just one keyword, "privacy." Here are a couple of example sentences from the paper: "Privateness has not been and undoubtedly never will be lauded, precarious, and decent. Humankind will always subjugate privateness." Whew.

Pollution is the mixture of poisonous materials into the natural resources. It affects the regular living off. Pollution can be of countless types such as air pollution, water pollution, sound pollution etc. Pollution is increasing day by day on account of the increasing number of automobiles, emissions of harmful gasses, from industrial firms, liquefied aerosols, and so forth. The air we breathe will cause lungs disorders. Contaminated water carries germs, viruses, dangerous chemicals, and so forth. Besides fungicides, chemical pesticides, herbicides, organic compounds such as Benzene, Ether, a few radioactive elements Radium, Thorium, industrial ashes, rubbish, garbage are also polluting the environment. What would it mean to look at intractable conflict through the lens of complex system theory? The first, and humbling, observation is that our present and future study of conflict can only provide us possibilities that might lead to resolution. Our work will never produce a deterministic set of formulae to create resolution. At the same time, our discoveries regarding complex systems validate the intuition of many dispute-resolution workers about humans in conflict. Among the notions that are validated are: «Essay about systems of government» in pictures. More images «Essay about systems of government». Contact | RSS feed | sitemap.xml | News

Lockheed Martin is competing with Boeing and Northrop Grumman to be the producer of the next generation of ICBMs, which will take the place of the Minuteman IIIs.  Additive manufacturing technology is touted as a way to bring costs down for the US military, but officials remain skeptical. The US Air Force is “very risk averse,” and consequently the applicability and functionality of 3D printing for ICBMs is something Lockheed must “prove to the customer,” John Karas of Lockheed Martin said.  “We’ll show the benefit of it during the design phase and recurring phase and the operation and sustainment phase,” Karas said on April 3, according to a Defense News report.  The way in which metal parts are manufactured impacts the material’s chemical properties, according to DARPA research. If differences between conventional manufacturing and additive manufacturing are not factored into the design process, problems are bound to ensue.  © Flickr/ Nelson Pavlosky Pentagon’s DARPA Develops Kit Turning Aircraft Into Drones However, “Uncertainties in materials and component manufacturing processes are a primary cause of cost escalation,” DARPA researcher Jan Vandenbrande said. The uncertainties are a byproduct of random variation in the manufacturing process, meaning 3D printing could play a huge role in bringing consistency to how ICBM pieces are made.  The trio of defense contractors are bidding on the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent missile program, a multi-decade deal to gradually phase out aging Minuteman ICBMs. The contract award amounts to a total of $62 billion. A majority of the program’s budget, about $48.5 billion, will go to missile construction, while the remaining funds will upgrade command and control systems and modernize launch control centers. It is not entirely clear whether Northrop and Boeing plan to incorporate 3D printing in their designs, too. ...

After selecting the LIFT by EnCore economy-class berth for its 737 narrow-body jet, Boeing has chosen a new model for the twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner, the companies said Tuesday at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg. The seat is scheduled to be available to customers by early 2019. “It’s not a secret that there have been challenges in the seat industry,” Beth Anderson, Boeing’s vice president for payloads and systems, supplier management, said in an interview at the German trade fair. “It’s not just Zodiac. There isn’t enough capacity.” Boeing’s expansion into helping to supply what’s usually regarded as “buyer-furnished equipment” -- chosen directly by airlines -- is a further sign that it’s intent on taking whatever steps are necessary to avoid production delays. Planemakers and suppliers are coming under pressure as they seek to boost output to record levels after running up order backlogs that stretch for years. ‘Different Concept’ Holdups at Plaisir, France-based-Zodiac have already delayed handovers of Boeing 777-300s to United Airlines, while issues with seats and lavatory blocks stymied production of Airbus Group SE’s A350 model. The 737 seat from Encore’s Huntington Beach, California-based LIFT unit found its first customer three months after the Boeing partnership was announced in April 2016, with the initial delivery scheduled for October this year, Anderson said, without disclosing the airline’s name. Such a timescale represents a “really accelerated schedule,” she added. “It’s a different concept, where we take an airplane and design a seat,” the executive said. “We’d be contracting with LIFT for the seat, so you get the benefit of the Boeing-supplied piece of equipment, but the airline can still negotiate the pricing directly.” Airbus said separately that it will establish a new unit to support airlines in their cabin-development plans. The Airbus Interiors Services business will draw on the expertise of the company’s corporate-jet arm and focus on bespoke products, aircraft upgrades and innovations such as a ceiling stowage area devised for the A320 jet, according to an announcement at the Hamburg show.

BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Updated: April 4, 2017 11:46 am Follow @AuroraSentinel WASHINGTON | Orders to U.S. factories rose in February amid a surge in demand for commercial aircraft, but a key category that tracks business investment spending slipped for the first time in five months. Factory orders increased 1 percent in February after a 1.5 percent gain in January, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Much of the strength stems from a second straight month of booming demand for commercial aircraft. But a key category that serves as a proxy for business investment slipped 0.1 percent. It was the first decline since investment orders fell by 1.5 percent in September. FILE - In this Friday, March 31, 2017, file photo, Boeing employees stand near the new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner at the company's facility in South Carolina after conducting its first test flight at Charleston International Airport in North Charleston, S.C. Orders to U.S. factories rose in February amid a surge in demand for commercial aircraft, but a key category that tracks business investment spending slipped for the first time in five months. (AP Photo/Mic Smith, File) American manufacturers are slowly recovering from a weak patch caused by falling demand for American exports, reflecting weak economies overseas and the strength of the dollar which makes U.S. products cost more in foreign markets. Orders for durable goods, items such as autos and airplanes designed to last at least three years, rose 1.8 percent in February after a 2.4 percent gain in January. Demand for nondurable goods, items ranging from food to paper and chemicals, edged up a slight 0.2 percent following a 0.6 percent January increase. The strength in durable goods was led by a 47.5 percent increase in orders for commercial aircraft, a gain that followed an even bigger 83.2 percent rise in January in this volatile sector. Demand for military aircraft fell 12.8 percent after a big gain in January. Demand was also up for primary metals such as steel, computers, construction machinery and oilfield drilling equipment. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management reported that American factories expanded for a seventh straight month in March but at a slightly slower pace than February. American factories have bounced back after being hurt in early 2016 and late 2015 by the weakness in exports and also cutbacks in the energy industry, a decline that reflected falling oil prices.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders advancing 1.0 percent in February after a previously reported 1.2 percent increase in January. Factory orders were up 4.6 percent from a year ago. Shipments of manufactured goods increased 0.3 percent after a similar gain in January. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is recovering in part as steadily rising oil prices reinvigorate the energy sector, leading to demand for machinery and other equipment. The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans -- dipped 0.1 percent as reported last month. Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, jumped 1.0 percent, also as reported last month. The rise in shipments suggests an acceleration in business spending on equipment in the first quarter after it increased at a 1.9 percent annualized rate in final three months of 2016. That was the first rise in a year. In February, orders for machinery rose 0.3 percent. Orders for transportation equipment advanced 4.4 percent, reflecting a 47.5 percent surge in civilian aircraft orders as well as a 0.3 percent rise in motor vehicle orders. Orders for computers and electronic products gained 0.1 percent and bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components jumped 1.9 percent. Unfilled orders at factories were unchanged after falling for three straight months. Inventories of goods at factories rose 0.2 percent in February. They have increased in seven of the last eight months. The inventories-to-shipments ratio was 1.31 in February, unchanged from January.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript A rare U.S.-Iran business deal. Boeing signed a tentative agreement valued at $3 billion to sell 30 737 MAX jets to Iran's Aseman Airlines. And Aseman has options to buy another 30 airplanes. It's the first major business deal between an American and Iranian company since President Donald Trump took office. Trump has been critical of Iran, saying he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact. Boeing said it negotiated the deal after getting permission from Washington. But this deal will still be subject to U.S. government approvals. After the Obama administration agreed to the sanctions deal, Boeing agreed to sell 80 aircraft to Iran's flag carrier, Iran Air. Trump so far has not weighed in the aircraft deals. Boeing cited something dear to Trump's heart - Commerce Department data suggesting that a sale would create or sustain about 18,000 jobs in the U.S. Boeing shares ascending at the market open, adding to their 14 percent gain this year.

Boeing said it has signed a memorandum of understanding to provide 30 of Boeing’s 737 MAX 9 planes to Iran Aseman Airlines, a deal made possible by President Barack Obama’s move to lift sanctions on Iran in exchange for increased constraints on the country’s nuclear program. The deal for 30 planes at about $3 billion is half of a larger deal Boeing is pursuing for 60 planes at $6 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports. Boeing completed another deal in December to sell 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion to Iran Air, the main airline in the country. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. Under the proposed deal, Aseman Airlines would receive the planes in 2022. The sale needs approval from the Department of the Treasury. President Donald Trump’s position on Iran and the Obama’s nuclear deal is unclear, but he has promised not to be as lenient with the country. (RELATED: Trump Warns Iran He Will Not Be As ‘Kind’ As Obama) “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” Boeing said in a statement. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Both Boeing and European rival Airbus have other deals pending to sell aircraft to Iranian companies. Several congressional leaders have warned that aircraft sold to Iran would end up being used to sponsor terrorism. Follow Thomas Phippen on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

About us Membership Contact us Wed April 5, 2017 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia Boeing offers details on Iran deal, saying all was done legally Economy June 24, 2016 The Boeing Company on Thursday offered new details on its proposed passenger aircraft deal with Iran and rejected suggestions that it had not done sufficient homework in identifying end users of the planes. In a letter to congressional critics of the politically delicate deal, Boeing said Iran Air, the national airline, intended to buy 80 passenger planes in a variety of models worth $17.6 billion and lease 29 of the company’s 737s, with deliveries projected to begin as early as next year. The letter, by Tim Keating, vice president of government operations, also said “we have a vigorous compliance mechanism at Boeing with regard to the screening of all parties with which we do business.” Keating wrote that Boeing had strictly adhered to dealings with Iranian entities approved by United States sanctions monitors. Boeing’s proposed deal with Iran Air, disclosed this month, is potentially one of the most significant economic outcomes of the international nuclear agreement with Iran that took effect in January, which rescinded or eased many sanctions in exchange for Iran’s verifiable commitments to peaceful nuclear activities. Among the eased sanctions was a relaxed prohibition on Iran’s ability to acquire aircraft for the national airline’s aging commercial fleet. Iran also has negotiated an agreement with Airbus, Boeing’s major competitor, to acquire more than 100 aircraft. The sale and lease of Boeing jetliners, if completed, would constitute the biggest American business transaction with Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Other nonnuclear sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran remain. They include a prohibition on the use of the dollar by Iran and its exclusion from the American banking system, complicating how Boeing would get paid. The sanctions designation against Iran Air was later dropped, the congressmen wrote. Keating said that Boeing had negotiated legally with Iran under the conditions allowed by the nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. He also wrote that Boeing had reached no decisions yet on how to handle the Iranian financing for the aircraft, and reiterated the company’s previous pledges to follow the United States government’s determinations of what is allowed.

MARS! Boeing unveils ‘deep space gateway’ designed to carry human passengers to Mars Aerospace giant working on a spacecraft which could one day help our species land on the Red Planet by Jasper Hamill 4th April 2017, 2:13 pm Updated: 4th April 2017, 2:19 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments THE aerospace firm Boeing has revealed plans for a spaceship designed to help carry humans all the way to Mars. It is working closely with Nasa to develop a craft called the Deep Space Gateway. 2 This craft will dock with the station before journeying to Mars – and hopefully back again 2 This is the vehicle which will actually travel to Mars – and hopefully back again This will orbit the moon and serve as a dock for a transport vehicle which will fly to Mars and back again. Dubbed the Deep Space Transit Vehicle, this ship will actually perform the long journey. Both craft use solar electric propulsion systems which means they can be powered by sunlight. The space station will probably be launched into space in the early 2020s aboard a rocket called the Space Launch System (SLS). It is so large that it will have to be flown up during four different missions and gradually assembled.

It’s the first Boeing deal with Tehran since President Donald Trump took office pledging to take a harder stance with the country. Read more Tehran gets cut-price Boeing deal Aseman is owned by Iran's civil service pension fund and operates as a private company. It is the third-largest carrier in Iran. The 30 jets are to be delivered as part of a larger deal, which implies a possible delivery of another 30 planes to Aseman. Boeing described the deal as a "memorandum of agreement." At current prices, the 30 jets are worth $3.4 billion. However, carriers usually enjoy about 50 percent discount for such deals. The deliveries will start in 2022. President Trump has said he opposes the cancellation of Iranian nuclear sanctions. However, he has not talked about the aircraft sales reached after the nuclear deal, which are saving thousands of American jobs. "According to the US Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States," Boeing said in a statement on Tuesday. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion deal Boeing signed with Iran under Barack Obama’s administration. Boeing has agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under the contract. In January, Iran signed a deal with Airbus to buy 118 jets from Airbus for an estimated €22.8 billion ($25 billion). Iranian officials later said the contract would be cut to 112 planes.

The carrier has applied for an air-operating certificate from authorities in the South American country and is now seeking rights to serve domestic routes there, Kjos said in an interview. The network would link up with planned flights to Buenos Aires from cities such as London, Paris, Barcelona, Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm using Boeing 787 wide-bodies. “We have delivered the papers and we have also applied for the routes,” Kjos said Tuesday in London. “We’re looking to serve a lot of cities domestically, but it depends on the concessions.” Norwegian Air formed an operating company at the beginning of 2017 to found a network in Argentina after earlier extending its discount model from European short-haul flights into North Atlantic operations. It has also been considering options for a second base in Asia with services from London and Paris to complement its Bangkok hub. The airline plans to expand capacity to the U.S. next winter by allocating some of its short-haul operating slots at London’s Gatwick airport to inter-continental operations, and will also start flights to smaller airports in North America using 737 Max aircraft this summer. Kjos spoke at the Skift Global Forum in the U.K. capital. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Boeing Co. announced Tuesday, April 4, 2017 that it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines for 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File ) TEHRAN, Iran — Boeing Co. said on Tuesday it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines to supply 30 737 MAX aircraft to the carrier, the first major sale by a U.S. company to the Islamic Republic under new President Donald Trump. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 178.70 +2.05 +1.16% Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA NWARF ▲ 27.85 +0.45 +1.64% The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck with Tehran under the Obama administration. Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm's work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal also includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes. It said the first deliveries of the single-aisle aircraft to Aseman would start in 2022. Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, which undergo final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. "According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States," Boeing said in a statement. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval." Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks over the past year between the airline and Boeing. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019, contradicting Boeing. The European Union blacklisted Aseman from European skies in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal comes as part of the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. After the atomic accord, Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country's flag carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes' components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve this latest deal. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world, home to 80 million people. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wildcard is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to the Islamic Republic. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

(NYSE: BA) on Tuesday confirmed that the company has signed a memorandum of agreement with Iran Aseman Airlines calling for the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes with a list price value of $3 billion. The airline also received purchase rights for an additional 30 planes. An order from an Iran-based carrier is certainly problematic. Iran Air and Boeing struck a deal at the end of last year for 80 Boeing jets, 50 737 MAXs, 15 777-300ERs and 15 777-9s. As of the end of February, the company has not added the planes to its order book. This deal, worth $16.6 billion at list prices, and the deal announced this morning are far from being real orders. In Tuesday’s press release Boeing said: Boeing negotiated the MOA under authorizations from the U.S. government following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord signed in 2015. Boeing will look to the Office of Foreign Assets Control for approval to perform under this transaction. Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval. The Trump administration has said little about Iran other than to reiterate campaign statements that the decision by the Obama administration and other nations to remove sanctions on Iran was the wrong choice. For its part, Boeing emphasized the job-creating power of the deal with Iran Aseman: According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States. Deliveries would be scheduled to start in 2022. How the president will react to this latest deal with Iran is unknown, but absent an initial negative reaction, it’s reasonable to assume that Trump will simply let the Boeing deal run its course. Reasonable, perhaps, but we wouldn’t bet the ranch on it.

(Photo: Elaine Thompson / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Tehran, Iran — Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. “On the one hand, there’s the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. “They’ll have to make tough decisions.” Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran’s third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran “on notice” when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. “This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran’s regional role,” Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” it said. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Aboulafia, the aviation analyst, said ultimately the sales wouldn’t change Iran’s status in the Gulf, already home to three major long-haul carriers, or greatly affect Boeing’s bottom line. “This is not a market that means a great deal anymore,” he said. “It attracts headlines — and it has all kinds of political headaches and conflicts associated with it — but Iran as a world hub of aviation isn’t what it was.” CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Source: IHS Markit/Patrick Allen Boeing has received a USD2.2 billion contract for 17 P-8A Poseidon Multimission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) that includes the first for the United Kingdom. The contract, which was announced by the company on 3 April but awarded on 30 March, covers 11 aircraft for the US Navy (USN), 4 for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and 2 for the UK Royal Air Force (RAF). It also includes options for 32 more aircraft which, if exercised, would bring the contract value up to USD6.8 billion. The UK government announced its plans to buy nine P-8As in the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in late 2015, and signed the formal order at the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2016. According to previous announcements, the total cost of the procurement is valued at GBP3 billion (USD4 billion) over the next 10 years. Further to the aircraft, the UK government has disclosed that the procurement includes off-the-shelf purchases of unspecified weapons, sonar buoys, and other 'consumables'. It has since been reported that the RAF's P-8As will field the same MK54 torpedoes and Harpoon ant-ship missiles as the USN's. With the fleet set to be delivered from 2019 through to early 2022, the RAF will operate the type out of RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. As well as the nine aircraft some 400 operational and support personnel will be located at the base, with GBP100 million being invested in new dedicated infrastructure. Billed as a 'Multimission Maritime Aircraft' (MMA), the P-8A will be employed primarily for maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare, but can also be used for anti-surface vessel warfare and overland intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Boeing so far has delivered 53 P-8A Poseidons to the USN (out of a programme of record of 117 aircraft, of which 109 have been approved) and two to the RAAF (which intends to buy 15), as well as eight P-8I Neptunes to the Indian Navy (with four more on contract).

The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm's work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. "On the one hand, there's the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran," said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. "They'll have to make tough decisions." Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran's third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country's flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes' components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran "on notice" when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. "This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran's regional role," Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. "According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States," it said. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval." Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Aboulafia, the aviation analyst, said ultimately the sales wouldn't change Iran's status in the Gulf, already home to three major long-haul carriers, or greatly affect Boeing's bottom line. "This is not a market that means a great deal anymore," he said. "It attracts headlines - and it has all kinds of political headaches and conflicts associated with it - but Iran as a world hub of aviation isn't what it was." ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The deal was concluded on Tuesday in Tehran. Under the deal, Iran will gradually receive the planes as of 2019, IRNA news agency reported. Iran has several private and public airline companies in operation, among which IranAir is the oldest one. The number of operational airports in the country is 46. Since sanctions imposed on the Islamic Republic were lifted last year, Iran began to take steps to upgrade its air industry, revamp an aging airline fleet, equipment and airports. When sanctions were eased in January 2016 after Iran certified that it had shelved its nuclear program, Tehran immediately opened talks with Boeing Co. and the European manufacturer Airbus to buy hundreds of aircraft. The deals represent the biggest commercial result of the nuclear accord. Iran signed a $16.6 billion deal for 80 Boeing passenger jets on December 11, 2016. The deal between IranAir and U.S. plane maker Boeing includes 50 narrow-body 737 MAX aircraft and 30 long-haul 777s, split equally between the 777-300ER, which is badly in need of an order boost, and the 406-seat 777-9, which is under development.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Boeing signs new $3 billion deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines Boeing signs new $3 billion deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines Boeing Co. said on Tuesday it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines to supply 30 737 MAX aircraft to the carrier, a new agreement on top of the $16.6 billion sale it made in the Mideast nation following the landmark nuclear deal. By: Associated Press | Tehran | Published: April 4, 2017 3:39 PM Chicago-based Boeing said the deal also includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes. (Reuters) Boeing Co. said on Tuesday it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines to supply 30 737 MAX aircraft to the carrier, a new agreement on top of the $16.6 billion sale it made in the Mideast nation following the landmark nuclear deal. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal also includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes. The airline could not be immediately reached for comment, though a semi-official Iranian news agency also carried a report on the sale. The European Union blacklisted Aseman from European skies in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. Watch this also: The new Boeing deal comes as part of the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. After the atomic accord, Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flag carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. The license approval clears the way for the two plane manufacturers to begin accessing one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world, home to 80 million people. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck with Tehran under the Obama administration. Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal also includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes. It said the first deliveries of the single-aisle aircraft to Aseman would start in 2022. Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, which undergo final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Online Chat: DJ Kachman, the Veterans Affairs Department’s director of mobile and security technology transformation lead, on April 10, at 1 p.m. Advertisement “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” Boeing said in a statement. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks over the past year between the airline and Boeing. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019, contradicting Boeing. The European Union blacklisted Aseman from European skies in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal comes as part of the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. After the atomic accord, Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flag carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. 19 agencies on chopping block only account for a small fraction of overall budget Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve this latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world, home to 80 million people. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wildcard is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to the Islamic Republic. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The pact with Iran Aseman Airlines to purchase 30 of Boeing’s 737 Max planes adds to a separate $16.6 billion agreement with Iran Air, which the Chicago-based manufacturer is still finalizing. If completed, the transactions would be the first U.S. aircraft exports to Iran since the Shah era. An Airbus A321 arrives in Tehran on Jan. 12. Photographer: Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images The latest jet transaction puts Trump’s policy of promoting U.S. manufacturing jobs into conflict with the administration’s vow to take a tougher stance on the Islamic Republic. If the White House thwarts Boeing’s dealmaking, it also risks tilting the playing field in favor of Europe’s Airbus Group SE just as global jet sales are slowing, said aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia. Boeing may be “setting themselves up for conflict with the Trump administration or Republicans in general,” said Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group. “To a certain extent they are imposing a level of conflict on Republicans because they are going to have to balance manufacturing jobs to export markets with getting tough on Iran. It’s tough to thread that needle.” Boeing shares rose 0.8 percent to $178.07 at 2:02 p.m. in New York. The gain was the third largest among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Iran Debate Airbus and Boeing have been making inroads in Iran since the Obama administration and other world powers agreed to lift sanctions on commercial-jet sales in reward for a nuclear agreement. Whether the U.S. manufacturer closes the transactions is far from certain, given the hostility by hard-liners in Iran and some Republicans in Congress to measures that would restore trade. “It’s concerning,” Senator Marco Rubio told reporters in the Capitol when asked about the deal. Asked if he could or would do anything to block it, the Florida Republican said, “Maybe.” Financing the multibillion-dollar purchases also will be a challenge given the restrictions still in place on lenders doing business with Iranian companies, Aboulafia said. Aircraft lessors may be hesitant to provide financing if the threat of renewed sanctions raises a risk they couldn’t reclaim the planes if Iranian carriers defaulted. While Iran wants to upgrade its museum-vintage fleet because of safety concerns, it isn’t clear the Middle Eastern country would be able to absorb the hundreds of aircraft it is ordering from Boeing and Airbus. “If you add it all up, Iran needs nothing like the number of jetliners they are committing to. It’s not clear they can afford them either,” Aboulafia said. U.S. Jobs The Iran Aseman deal, announced in a  statement Tuesday on Boeing’s website, provides the airline with an option to buy 30 additional 737 Max planes. Deliveries of the single-aisle jet are scheduled to start in 2022. The value is based on list prices, which typically are heavily discounted. A sale of that size would create or sustain about 18,000 U.S. jobs, Boeing said, citing Commerce Department calculations. The company said it would seek purchase approval from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland who is the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said there is little Congress can do to block the plane sale as long as it meets the terms set out in the nuclear deal. That was echoed by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who has been a leading voice against the nuclear deal. No Involvement “I have opposed the Iranian agreement and I am not interested in doing anything to help the Iranians but what they’ve done is completely legal,” McCain said. “They’ve got the money and it’s not a weapons system, so it doesn’t require any involvement from the Congress.” The purchase would help modernize Iran Aseman’s fleet after the carrier in December was banned by the European Union for “unaddressed deficiencies.” The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has maintained a blacklist of airlines since 2006 after a series of crashes prompted European governments to seek a uniform approach to airline safety. The Iranian carrier operates 33 planes, including two Boeing 737s and five Boeing 727s, according to its website. Almost half of the fleet consists of Fokker 100 aircraft. The airline reached an earlier pact to lease seven Airbus planes. Airbus Rivalry Boeing’s December agreement with Iran Air was the first of its kind since the Islamic Revolution. The company’s last airplane deliveries to Iran were 747 jumbos that arrived in 1977, according to the company’s website. While Boeing and Iran’s flag carrier are still working out final terms for deliveries that would begin next year, Airbus has delivered the first aircraft for its separate $19 billion sale. “The contract agreement we signed late last year had contingencies on it that are still being worked,” Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman, said by email. On the campaign trail, Trump attacked a planned center to paint Boeing 737s in China and later blasted the contract for the Air Force One presidential aircraft as too costly. Subsequent meetings with Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg brought a significant thaw. Trump in February attended the rollout of a new Boeing jet from a factory in South Carolina, extolling the “beautiful” carbon-composite 787-10 and praising the CEO as “a very, very tough negotiator.” Congressional Moves The House in November passed legislation along party lines attempting to block Boeing from financing aircraft sales to Iran, but that measure didn’t move in the Senate before that session of Congress ended. The House hasn’t yet revived the bill this year.  The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee and at least a dozen other Republican and Democratic senators introduced a bill last month that seeks to expand sanctions on Iran over its ballistic-missile development, support for terrorism and human rights violations, according to a statement. Those would be targeted against people involved with Iran’s ballistic missile program and those that transact with them, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Republicans in Congress strongly opposed the 2015 agreement between the U.S. and five other nations, including Russia, designed to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran agreed to redesign and reduce its nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Trump campaigned against the deal, which he said was bad for American interests and security. He said during a series of election rallies that he would tear it up and renegotiate it, but he hasn’t yet taken public steps to scrap the accord.  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Boeing Co. announced Tuesday, April 4, 2017 that it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines for 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft. Elaine Thompson, File AP Photo i By NASSER KARIMI and JON GAMBRELL Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TEHRAN, Iran Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm's work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. "On the one hand, there's the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran," said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. "They'll have to make tough decisions." Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran's third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country's flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes' components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran "on notice" when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. "This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran's regional role," Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. "According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States," it said. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval." Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Aboulafia, the aviation analyst, said ultimately the sales wouldn't change Iran's status in the Gulf, already home to three major long-haul carriers, or greatly affect Boeing's bottom line. "This is not a market that means a great deal anymore," he said. "It attracts headlines — and it has all kinds of political headaches and conflicts associated with it — but Iran as a world hub of aviation isn't what it was."

The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm's work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. "On the one hand, there's the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran," said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. "They'll have to make tough decisions." Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran's third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country's flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes' components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran "on notice" when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. "This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran's regional role," Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. "According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States," it said. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval." Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Aboulafia, the aviation analyst, said ultimately the sales wouldn't change Iran's status in the Gulf, already home to three major long-haul carriers, or greatly affect Boeing's bottom line. "This is not a market that means a great deal anymore," he said. "It attracts headlines - and it has all kinds of political headaches and conflicts associated with it - but Iran as a world hub of aviation isn't what it was." ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Try Sample Report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/557584-global-helicopter-blade-market-opportunity-2016-2021 The Global Helicopter Blade Market: Highlights The helicopter rotor blade performs the same function as an airplane's wing. It provides lift as the blades rotate. A helicopter pilot can affect the lift by changing the rotor's revolutions per minute or its angle of attack, which refers to the angle of the rotary wing in relation to the oncoming wind. Rotor blades are made out of various materials, including aluminum, composites, steel, or titanium, with abrasion shields along the leading edge. The composite materials' potential in the structural applications has been recognized since long by the Helicopter manufacturers. Military helicopters use composites ranging from 50% to 80% of the total airframe weight. The usage of composites varies significantly in civil helicopters. Some civil helicopter manufacturers are using composites extensively whereas some are using them mainly in the non-structural applications. But, in rotor and tail blades, composite materials are gaining market traction and replacing traditional materials, such as aluminum and steel. The global helicopter blade (rotor and tail) market offers a healthy growth opportunity during the forecast period of 2016 to 2021. Increasing demand of helicopters in the developing regions, such as China and India, technology advancement, recovering oil & gas prices are the key drivers in the global helicopter blade market.

Try Sample Report @ https://www.wiseguyreports.com/sample-request/557584-global-helicopter-blade-market-opportunity-2016-2021 The Global Helicopter Blade Market: Highlights The helicopter rotor blade performs the same function as an airplane’s wing. It provides lift as the blades rotate. A helicopter pilot can affect the lift by changing the rotor’s revolutions per minute or its angle of attack, which refers to the angle of the rotary wing in relation to the oncoming wind. Rotor blades are made out of various materials, including aluminum, composites, steel, or titanium, with abrasion shields along the leading edge. The composite materials’ potential in the structural applications has been recognized since long by the Helicopter manufacturers. Military helicopters use composites ranging from 50% to 80% of the total airframe weight. The usage of composites varies significantly in civil helicopters. Some civil helicopter manufacturers are using composites extensively whereas some are using them mainly in the non-structural applications. But, in rotor and tail blades, composite materials are gaining market traction and replacing traditional materials, such as aluminum and steel. The global helicopter blade (rotor and tail) market offers a healthy growth opportunity during the forecast period of 2016 to 2021. Increasing demand of helicopters in the developing regions, such as China and India, technology advancement, recovering oil & gas prices are the key drivers in the global helicopter blade market. Composite materials are increasingly used in both the rotor and tail blades of Helicopters.

The plane, which sells for $312.8 million at list price and rounds out a family of three carbon-fiber composite Dreamliners, flew well, the pilots said. "We had a great flight," Captain Tim Berg said at a news conference after the flight. "The plane performed exactly like we thought it would." The flight was one of three initial voyages on Friday, joining the Airbus A319neo jetliner and the Antonov An-132D, a light turboprop military transport developed with Saudi Arabia. Boeing's 787-10 is being built at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, due to its large size. The facility is Boeing's only jetliner assembly factory outside of Washington state and, in contrast to the others, is not unionised. Last month, the new plane provided a dramatic backdrop for President Donald Trump's visit to the Boeing factory, where he promised to boost US manufacturing and punish companies for moving jobs overseas. Companies in Japan, China, Italy, Sweden, France and Britain produce many of the 787's major components, such as wings, fuselage sections and the rudder. Airlines can choose engines from General Electric Co of the United States, or Britain's Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc. The first 787-10 took off at 9.38 a.m. EDT and landed at 2.35 pm EDT. The plane is a second and final "stretch," of the original 787-8, which debuted in 2011. It is 18 feet (5.5 metres) longer than the 787-9 and seats 330 passengers, 40 more than the 787-9 and 88 more than the 787-8. The 787 has been a top seller, with 1,200 firm orders as airlines use it to open new routes between smaller cities that can be profitable with the fuel-efficient 787. Airbus SAS competes against the 787-10 with its A330neo, a remake of its older, aluminium-hulled A330 equipped with fuel-efficient engines. Both jets are optimised for shorter flights compared with other mid-sized, twin-aisle planes. After brisk initial sales, orders for both have slowed, with Airbus selling just over 220 of its A330neo. So far, the 787-10 has booked 149 orders from nine customers, about 12% of the total of firm orders. The mid-sized 787-9 has captured just over half the total. After spending 2017 in testing, the 787-10 is expected to enter service with airlines in 2018.  RECOMMENDED STORIES LPG price on hold despite global drop Farmers sow rice on historic Rama IX land 213 stateless students granted Thai nationality NACC plays down Mahidol University exodus Govt boosts security after Russia blast Kiatisak blasts FAT and critics Popovic hails 'title contenders' Buriram Thailand vulnerable to 'boiling frog' crisis Student activist Netiwit seeks delay to conscription Most Viewed 66,133 Foreigner falls to death at ... 63,796 Thailand on Trump's trade hit list 36,957 Tourists flock to Phanom Rung for ... 27,497 Village chief gets death penalty ... 26,233 Rats dine at unhealthy parliament ...

The Russian, Victor Podobnyy, was one of three men charged in connection with a Cold War-style Russian spy ring. According to the court documents, Podobnyy tried to recruit Page, an energy consultant working in New York at the time, as an intelligence source. Page briefly served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump's campaign, though he split from the campaign before the election and the White House says the president has no relationship with him. The Senate began formal debate on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, hurtling toward a blistering partisan conflict this week over the selection itself, the chamber's future rules and the decaying standards of civility among lawmakers. Democrats have the votes they need to block a procedural vote and compel Trump and Republicans either to withdraw Gorsuch's nomination or to change Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote requirement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would take a procedural step to end debate, allowing Gorsuch to be confirmed on Friday. The Boeing Co. announced a tentative agreement to sell up to 60 737s to an ­Iranian airline, a transaction valued at $6 billion that appears very likely to test the Trump administration's avowed hostility toward Iran. Boeing said that the agreement, which requires U.S. government approval, would create about 18,000 American jobs. Commercial aircraft sales to Iran are permitted under the nuclear agreement reached in 2015 involving Iran and major global powers, including the U.S. Trump has repeatedly denounced the nuclear agreement, but he also has vowed to protect U.S. industries and workers from foreign competition. Aerospace analysts said that together, Boeing's deal with Iran amounts to a test of the Trump administration's priorities. If Boeing is forbidden to sell the aircraft to Iran, plane makers in other countries might fill the gap.

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) TOKYO (AP) — Shares advanced early Tuesday in Asia as markets in China caught up on gains following public holidays. Regional markets appeared to shrug off the latest North Korean missile test early in the morning. Trading was light ahead of U.S. data releases and meetings later in the week between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 0.3 percent to 18,856.81 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng also gained 0.3 percent, to 24,333.05. The Kospi of South Korea was flat, at 2,160.72. Australia's S&P ASX 200 inched up 0.1 percent to 5,858.50 and the Shanghai Composite index advanced 0.8 percent to 3,246.55. Markets in Southeast Asia were mostly higher. TRUMP CHINA: Trade agreements and regional tensions will be in focus as Trump and Xi meet Thursday and Friday at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. While some analysts expect the two sides to keep friction to a minimum by following a carefully worked on script, others worry Trump's past harsh criticism of China and mounting dissatisfaction with Beijing in American business circles augers ill for the summit. QUOTABLE: "To some extent, the market's imagination appear to be running wild with the possibilities of the outcome from this meeting, especially given the impulsiveness we have seen from President Donald Trump thus far on issues regarding China. This will likely cause many to stay on the side-lines ahead of the meeting," Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary. U.S. DATA: The Commerce Department said U.S. factory orders kept growing in February thanks to greater demand for commercial aircraft. Boeing said it will sell $3 billion in aircraft to an Iranian airline, and its stock gained $2.05, or 1.2 percent, to $178.70. WALL STREET: The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged nearly 0.1 percent higher to 2,360.16. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2 percent to 20,689.24 and the Nasdaq composite eked out a 0.1 percent gain, to 5,898.61. Despite the gains, slightly more stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Russell 2000 index, which contains smaller-company stocks, lost 0.1 percent to 1,368.18. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 16 cents to $51.19 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained 79 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.03 per barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 12 cents to $54.29. On Monday, it gained $1.05, or 2 percent, to $54.17 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 110.75 yen from 110.96 yen. The euro edged up to $1.0679 from $1.0665. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

Investors are taking a slightly more cautious stance on the health of the U.S. economy after weak car sales in March. Energy companies are rising with the price of oil and major stock indexes haven’t moved much. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor’s 500 index was unchanged at 2,358 of 3:10 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,671 after Boeing said it will sell $3 billion in aircraft to an Iranian airline. The Nasdaq composite lost 2 points to 5,892. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks fell than rose. Trading is quiet Tuesday as investors wait for a series of reports on the U.S. economy this week and the meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping starting Thursday. On Monday, stocks fell after car makers reported weak sales for March, which raised concerns about sales of other goods. The Russell 2000 index, which contains smaller-company stocks that are more U.S.- focused, lost 3 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,366. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.35 percent from 2.33 percent. However banks took losses for the second day in a row following a sharp drop in bond yields on Monday. Lower bond yields force interest rates on loans lower, which cuts into banks’ profits. KeyCorp slid 18 cents, or 1 percent, to $17.56 and Discover Financial Services lost 98 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.97. RETAIL SLUMP: Ralph Lauren dropped $3.99, or 4.9 percent, to $77.38 after it said it will close stores and cut jobs in an effort to save money. The company will close its Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan less than three years after it opened.

Department store Kohl’s fell $1.53, or 3.9 percent, to $37.62 and Gap shed 62 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $23.09. Online rival Amazon gained $13.89, or 1.6 percent, to $905.40. Handbag and accessories maker Kate Spade slumped after Reuters said the company will take more time to negotiate a possible sale. The report cited anonymous sources and said that if Kate Spade is sold to a buyer like Michael Kors or Coach, it will likely be for less than the company’s recent valuation of $2.9 billion. Kate Spade sank $3.30, or 14.5 percent, to $19.50. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 79 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.03 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.05, or 2 percent, to $54.17 a barrel in London. Anadarko Petroleum added 73 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $62.52. TELECOM TIE-UP: Alaskan telecommunications company General Communications agreed to be bought by holding company Liberty Interactive for $32.50 per share, or about $1.1 billion. Its stock jumped $13.21, or 64.3 percent, to $33.77. STAPLES TRYING AGAIN? Office supply company Staples climbed after the Wall Street Journal reported that Staples is talking to private equity firms about a potential sale. Staples tried to buy competitor Office Depot for $6.3 billion, but gave up on that effort last May after regulators opposed it and a federal judge agreed, saying it would reduce competition. Staples jumped 81 cents, or 9.4 percent, to $9.48. LIGHTS OUT: Lighting maker Acuity Brands tumbled after its second-quarter profit and sales disappointed analysts. The company said the market for smaller projects remains weak, while sales in Europe, Mexico, and some other international markets were down and manufacturing costs were higher.

OTHER ENERGY TRADING: The price of natural gas jumped 4.6 percent to $3.27 per 1,000 cubic feet, and Southwestern Energy climbed 57 cents, or 7.2 percent, to $8.46 while Range Resources gained $1.03, or 3.6 percent, to $29.60.

Stocks are edging lower in early trading on Wall Street with banks and energy companies taking the biggest losses. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks hardly moved Tuesday as investors were slow to dip a toe back into the market, although energy companies did climb with the price of oil and natural gas. Banks and retailers took losses. Stock indexes flickered between tiny gains and losses throughout the day before they mounted a small rally over the last half hour of trading. Energy companies rose the most, and companies that make drinks, packaged foods, and other household items also rose. Retailers and department stores slumped after Urban Outfitters warned of weak first-quarter sales and Ralph Lauren said it will close stores and cut jobs. That came a day after car makers reported weak sales for March, which raised concerns about sales of other goods. Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve, said consumers are very confident in the economy according to surveys, but considering high levels of employment and hiring, they're not spending that much. "We would like to see that confidence reflected in their actual consumption and that's been somewhat mixed," he said. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 1.32 points, or almost 0.1 percent, to 2,360.16. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 39.03 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,689.24. The Nasdaq composite added 3.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,898.61. Slightly more stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Russell 2000 index, which contains smaller-company stocks, lost 1.49 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,368.18. This week investors will pore over reports on the U.S. economy, including the monthly jobs report on Friday. Trade agreements will be in focus as President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet Thursday and Friday. Ralph Lauren dropped $3.63, or 4.5 percent, to $77.73 after it said it will close stores and cut jobs in an effort to save money. The company will close its Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan less than three years after it opened. Urban Outfitters lost 7 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $22.49 after it said sales at older stores have fallen over the last two months. Other retailers also lost ground. Department store Nordstrom fell $2.56, or 5.5 percent, to $43.92 and L Brands, the owner of Victoria's Secret, shed $2.03, or 4.4 percent, to $43.77. But their online nemesis Amazon gained $15.32, or 1.7 percent, to $906.83. Amazon stock is up 21 percent this year. Handbag and accessories maker Kate Spade slumped after Reuters said the company will take more time to negotiate a possible sale. The report cited anonymous sources and said that if Kate Spade is sold to a buyer like Michael Kors or Coach, it will likely be for less than the company's recent valuation of $2.9 billion. Kate Spade sank $3.34, or 14.6 percent, to $19.46. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 79 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.03 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.05, or 2 percent, to $54.17 a barrel in London. Anadarko Petroleum added 92 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $62.71. The price of natural gas jumped 4.6 percent to $3.27 per 1,000 cubic feet, and Southwestern Energy climbed 70 cents, or 8.9 percent, to $8.59 while Range Resources gained $1.19, or 4.2 percent, to $29.76. Wholesale gasoline rose 3 cents to $1.72 a gallon and heating oil added 3 cents to $1.59 a gallon. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.36 percent from 2.33 percent. Banks took losses for the second day in a row following a sharp drop in bond yields Monday. Lower bond yields force interest rates on loans lower, which cuts into banks' profits. Capital One Financial slid 54 cents to $85.26 and Discover Financial Services lost 90 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $67.05. The Commerce Department said U.S. factory orders kept growing in February thanks to greater demand for commercial aircraft. Boeing said it will sell $3 billion in aircraft to an Iranian airline, and its stock gained $2.05, or 1.2 percent, to $178.70. Manufacturers have been recovering recently from a rough patch that was caused by weak economies overseas and the strong dollar, which made U.S. goods more expensive. A measurement of business investment spending decreased for the first time since September. Staples climbed after the Wall Street Journal reported that the office supply company is talking to private equity firms about a potential sale. Staples tried to buy competitor Office Depot for $6.3 billion, but gave up on that effort last May after regulators opposed it and a federal judge said it would reduce competition. Staples jumped 85 cents, or 9.8 percent, to $9.51. Gold rose $4.40 to $1,258.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $18.32 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $2.61 per pound. The dollar slipped to 110.65 yen from 110.96 yen. The euro edged up to $1.0670 from $1.0665. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 in France rose 0.3 percent. In Germany, the DAX added 0.2 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 percent as the yen gained against the U.S. dollar. The South Korean Kospi slipped 0.3 percent. Markets in Hong Kong were closed for public holidays. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
