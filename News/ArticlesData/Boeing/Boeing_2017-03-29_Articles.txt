(David Ryder / Bloomberg News, 2015) Boeing makes billion-dollar bet on the 747 hauling cargo Wed Mar 29th, 2017 12:41pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Julie Johnsson / Bloomberg News Boeing has a temporary plan to save the iconic but slow-selling 747 jumbo jetliner: buying its own planes and leasing them to cargo haulers. With the effective shutdown by Congress of the Export-Import Bank — which traditionally has helped overseas carriers purchase planes — Boeing lost a key sales tool. Making matters worse, leasing companies have been hesitant to finance a plane with a dwindling customer base. So Boeing is now renting out the massive, hump-backed 747s to cargo carriers in countries such as Russia and Azerbaijan, which increases the company’s exposure to potential defaults on payments. Through the end of last year, Boeing had provided financing valued at $1.26 billion to 747 customers through Boeing Capital Corp., regulatory filings show. That’s about a fivefold increase from the close of 2012. In fact, 747-related loans and operating leases now account for about one-quarter of the portfolio managed by Boeing’s lending arm. As the air-cargo market recovers, the strategy may pay off for Boeing. The manufacturer recently landed a crucial 747 order from United Parcel Service Inc. that could serve as a bridge to the future for the wide-body plane. But tomorrow’s 747 — a symbol of luxury travel when it made its debut with Pan-American World Airways in 1970 — most likely won’t be flying globe-trotting tourists. It will instead haul oversize cargo like oil-drilling equipment as demand fades for bulky four-engine passenger carriers. “We believe in the long-term need for this aircraft,” said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flight Ascend Consultancy. “As long as they don’t over-produce, which Boeing aren’t doing at the current rate, we believe there will be long-term demand.” Boeing recorded more than $2.1 billion in losses on the 747-8, the latest version, in 2015 and 2016 as it slowed production to keep pace with dwindling sales. The company received a big boost last year when UPS ordered 14 of the jumbo freighters and took options that would double the original order size. The sale was the largest Boeing has landed for the redesigned 747 since November 2007, according to the manufacturer’s website. It’s unusual — and risky — for a planemaker to buy and lease its own product on a large scale. If the cargo carriers default or don’t renew operating leases, it would be Boeing Capital’s responsibility to line up other customers, a challenge in a niche market. If the plane experiences a greater-than-expected decline in value, Boeing’s earnings or cash flow could be “materially adversely affected,” according to the filing. Boeing’s shares were little changed at $177.56 in New York Wednesday. They have gained 14 percent this year through Tuesday’s close. It’s also a shift for Boeing Capital, which has whittled down its loan portfolio by two-thirds from $12.2 billion at the start of 2004 as the unit shed its ambitions of becoming Boeing’s answer to GE Capital. Since selling the General Electric unit a $2 billion commercial loan portfolio in 2004, Boeing Capital has focused on supporting the company’s aircraft sales and managing a portfolio of loans and operating leases aimed primarily at out-of-production aircraft. The recent spate of 747-related operating leases isn’t a reversal of that strategy, Timothy Myers, president of Boeing Capital, said in an interview. His division stepped in to close the 747 deals after a financier had difficulty lining up equity, Myers said. With cargo traffic growing, he expects to find buyers for those aircraft. “We are in the process of doing that right now: offloading some of those transactions that we’ve done in the past,” Myers said. “This year most likely there will be multiple parties taking those assets.” The Export-Import Bank has been dubbed the “Bank of Boeing” for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by foreign carriers unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it’s been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10 million because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a Senate committee since 2015. Conservative Republicans are opposed to the agency’s mission. “We may step in and support a few more deliveries,” Myers said. “But what we’re trying to do is find more third-party financiers to do that.” Uncertainty over the global economy and freighter demand are complicating that task. Nippon Cargo Airlines parent Nippon Yusen KK announced March 24 that it was canceling its final two orders of the 747 freighter variant, which has a list price of $387.5 million. Although buyers typically negotiate steep discounts, it was “just too big, too expensive,” said Neel Jones Shah, a consultant who formerly headed cargo operations for Delta Air lines. While the four-engine 747 is one of the best-selling jets in Boeing’s history, the latest version has struggled to gain sales as airlines shift to more-efficient twin-engine aircraft for long-range flying. The planemaker had a backlog of just 26 unfilled orders through the end of February, 19 of them freighter models, while its order tally for the year stands at two cancellations. There are also five “white tails” — the nickname for jets built without an airline buyer — taped up and sitting in storage. Boeing’s shares were little changed at $177.56 in New York Wednesday. They gained 14 percent this year through Tuesday, the third-biggest advance among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To market analysts like George Hamlin, the UPS order is a sign of more deals to come, barring a global recession or other market turmoil. That deal alone could keep Boeing’s 747 in production for another four years. A generation of older air freighters will soon need to be retired, and the Boeing jumbo has standout technology, from its fuel-efficient engines to nose that flips open to load oversize freight, said the Hamlin Transportation Consulting president. “UPS is a bellwether or bell cow, whatever term you want to use,” said Hamlin, a former Airbus Group executive. “In the intervening time period with UPS bridging the gap, it’s possible other orders may appear.” Global air freight in January increased by 6.9 percent from a year earlier, down from the 10 percent growth in December but far outpacing the 3 percent average annual pace recorded over the past five years, according to the International Air Transport Association, an aviation trade group. “The 747-8’s future is closely tied to the cargo market, and we’re keeping a close eye on that segment as it continues to show signs of improvement,” said Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president for marketing.   Most Read Aerospace blog Smaller, more efficient 787 has been a boon for airlines SEATAC — Virgin Atlantic started regular service between London and Seattle on… Mar 29th, 2017 by Dan Catchpole Gov.

This modern aircraft was introduced on services to the Cook Islands in October 2016. Air New Zealand’s Boeing 767-300ER touched down from Sydney at 6.30am before departing for Auckland at 8.10am as NZ60 on its final flight to Rarotonga International Airport. Air New Zealand Cook Islands manager Marisa Newman said the aircraft’s final flight was an emotional one for the airline. She said the introduction of the newer Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner and their refitted Boeing 777-200 aircraft on the route meant they could offer customers a much more consistent inflight experience. “The Boeing 767 has been an incredibly important part of Air New Zealand’s fleet for more than 30 years and has been a regular sight in the Cook Islands skies for just as long,” Newman said in a statement, Air New Zealand operates up to 11 flights into Rarotonga each week using a combination of Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, 777-200 and Airbus A320 aircraft. Cook Islands Tourism Corporation chief executive Halatoa Fua shared similar sentiments, adding there was a real sense of occasion as they bid goodbye to Air New Zealand’s last Boeing 767-300 flight from the Cook Islands.  “The aircraft has played an enormous role in our tourism industry, carrying so many visitors from New Zealand, Australia and the US to the Cook Islands since it first started operating more than 30 years ago,” Fua said. “We thank Air New Zealand for deploying its larger Boeing aircraft to the Cooks,which will benefit our tourism industry significantly.” The airline will operate its final scheduled Boeing 767-300 service on Friday before the final two 767s in its fleet are retired.             - Rashneel Kumar/Release Tweet Leave a comment Message Enter the two words you see below Please subscribe to continue reading.

Founded in 1916 by William Boeing as Pacific Aero Products Co., it was renamed Boeing Airplane Co. the next year. It soon began making planes for the military as the U.S. entered World War I.

This aircraft has replaced a Boeing 777 that was flying in this route for several years. The aircraft features a brand new first-class cabin. Mumbai is the second route after Delhi to have this latest aircraft, a top British Airways official said. British Airways operates two daily flights each to Mumbai and Delhi. Besides the 787-9 aircraft, BA also operates 787-8 on the Mumbai and Delhi routes. Robert Williams, British Airways’ head of sales - Asia Pacific and the Middle East, said, “Mumbai's international travellers are always on the lookout for great travel experiences and better travel options. We have been hearing a lot of encouraging feedback from our Delhi customers who have flown the 787-9, and I’m sure our customers from Mumbai will also come to love this amazing aircraft, the most technologically advanced in our fleet.” Configured in four-class, the aircraft is 20 feet longer than its 787-8 predecessor. The First cabin has eight seats compared to the 14-seat first class cabins available on other long-haul aircraft. British Airways is fast replacing its Boeing 777 fleet with a brand new Boeing 787 fleet which are fuel efficient and provide better value to the airline. The airline has ordered a total of 42 787s which will be delivered by 2020. British Airways has been flying to India for over 90 years. The airline currently operates 49 flights a week from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad to London. Mr. Williams said that the airline is continuously evaluating new routes and no final decision has been made tom open any new route in India. Meanwhile, the airline has started eyeing customers from the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) segment and has offered them business loyalty programmes so that they can upgrade to higher classes and enjoy the benefits.

Boeing has taken the risky step of buying and leasing its own jumbos as sales stagnate.

However, while the unsold aircraft will have rattled the US plane maker, it has a temporary, if risky, plan to save the hump-backed jet: buying its own planes and leasing them to cargo haulers. While the four-engine 747 is one of the best-selling jets in Boeing’s history, the latest version has struggled to gain sales as airlines shift to more-efficient twin-engine aircraft for long-range flying. The plane maker had a backlog of just 26 unfilled orders through the end of February, 19 of them freighter models, while its order tally for the year stands at two cancellations. There are also five "white tails", or "ghosts" – the nickname for jets built without an airline buyer – taped up and sitting in storage. With the effective shutdown by Congress of the US Export-Import Bank – which traditionally has helped overseas carriers purchase planes – Boeing lost a key sales tool. Making matters worse, leasing companies have been hesitant to finance an ageing plane with a dwindling customer base. So Boeing is now renting out the huge, hump-backed 747s , which feature a nose that opens for freight, to cargo carriers in countries such as Russia and Azerbaijan, which increases the company’s exposure to potential defaults on payments. Through the end of last year, Boeing had provided financing valued at us$1.26 billion to 747 customers through Boeing Capital, regulatory filings show. That is about a fivefold increase from the close of 2012. In fact, 747-related loans and operating leases now account for about one-quarter of the portfolio managed by Boeing’s lending arm. As the air-cargo market recovers, the strategy may pay off for Boeing. The manufacturer recently landed a crucial 747 order from United Parcel Service that could serve as a bridge to the future for the wide-body plane. But tomorrow’s 747 – a symbol of luxury travel when it made its debut with Pan-American World Airways in 1970 – most likely will not be flying globe-trotting tourists. It will instead haul oversize cargo such as oil-drilling equipment as demand fades for bulky four-engine passenger carriers. "We believe in the long-term need for this aircraft," said George Dimitroff, the head of valuations for Flight Ascend Consultancy. "As long as they don’t over-produce, which Boeing aren’t doing at the current rate, we believe there will be long-term demand." The jumbo quickly become the world’s favourite big jet, a position cemented when it was chosen to carry the Space Shuttle on test flights in the US. The first flight took place in 1977, with a test version of the spaceship aboard. The last ferry flight took the shuttle Endeavour from Kennedy Space Center to Los Angeles in September 2012. But since then, the grandaddy of air frieghters has fallen on hard timesBoeing recorded more than $2.1bn in losses on the 747-8, the latest version, in 2015 and 2016 as it slowed production to keep pace with dwindling sales. The company received a big boost last year when UPS ordered 14 of the jumbo freighters and took options that would double the original order size. The sale was the largest Boeing has landed for the redesigned 747 since November 2007, according to the manufacturer’s website. It is unusual – and risky – for a plane maker to buy and lease its own product on a large scale. If the cargo carriers default or do not renew operating leases, it would be Boeing Capital’s responsibility to line up other customers, a challenge in a niche market. If the plane experiences a greater than expected decline in value, Boeing’s earnings or cash flow could be "materially adversely affected", according to its filing. The Export-Import Bank has been dubbed the "Bank of Boeing" for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by foreign carriers unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it has been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10 million because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a US senate committee since 2015. To market analysts such as George Hamlin, the UPS order is a sign of more deals to come, barring a global recession or other market turmoil. That deal alone could keep Boeing’s 747 in production for another four years. A generation of older air freighters will soon need to be retired and the Boeing jumbo has standout technology, from its fuel-efficient engines to its nasal ability to load oversize freight, said the Hamlin Transportation Consulting president. "UPS is a bellwether or bell cow, whatever term you want to use," said Mr Hamlin, a former Airbus executive. "In the intervening time period with UPS bridging the gap, it’s possible other orders may appear." Global air freight in January increased by 6.9 per cent from a year earlier, down from the 10 per cent growth in December but far outpacing the 3 per cent average annual pace recorded over the past five years, according to the International Air Transport Association, an aviation trade group. "The 747-8’s future is closely tied to the cargo market, and we’re keeping a close eye on that segment as it continues to show signs of improvement," said Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president for marketing. * Bloomberg with The National business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation A hospital service for aircraft engines in Abu Dhabi – in pictures Laptop ban is ‘not acceptable’, says head of global airline group Future of industry: Strata to create jobs with Al Ain plant investment ‘Ghost’ jumbo jets spur rattled Boeing’s risky plan MOST VIEWED Business | All Hyperpanda to shutter its doors in Dubai Festival City Laptop ban is ‘not acceptable’, says head of global airline group Amazon purchase of Souq.com gets warm reception from consumers in UAE A hospital service for aircraft engines in Abu Dhabi – in pictures Selling private data comes with a risk in the UAE Abu Dhabi renter is confused whether animals are allowed on property Show me the money: A 20-question quiz on March business news Vice to start hiring as it targets Middle East millennials Emirates mulls loaning laptops to passengers amid US ban Future of industry: Strata to create jobs with Al Ain plant investment More Most Viewed Officials backtrack on move to reduce speed limits on Emirates and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed roads Watch Dubai Crown Prince help pull stuck lorry out of the desert Yemen and allies close to dealing ‘debilitating blow’ to Iran, Hadi tells Arab League Hyperpanda to shutter its doors in Dubai Festival City Laptop ban is ‘not acceptable’, says head of global airline group Three-day mourning period in Fujairah after death of Deputy Ruler Algal bloom the size of Mexico could threaten UAE marine life, experts say UAE gamers voice anger as Discord chat app blocked by Etisalat Iran sends Afghan proxy forces to Yemen as support for Houthis increases More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Emirates mulls loaning laptops to passengers amid US ban Devoted UAE residents finding ways to monetise their popular Facebook groups Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Officials backtrack on move to reduce speed limits on Emirates and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed roads Watch Dubai Crown Prince help pull stuck lorry out of the desert Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

(Jon Gambrell / AP) Roxana Tiron and Tony CapaccioBloomberg Privacy Policy As President Donald Trump pushes for the Pentagon to buy more of Boeing's F-18 aircraft, the U.S. Navy is grappling with an escalating problem: Pilots suffering potentially dangerous oxygen deprivation or a loss of cabin pressure in the fighter jets. All F-18 models, including the Super Hornet that Trump has championed, have shown steady annual increases in what the Navy calls "physiological episodes," according to service testimony obtained by Bloomberg News. What's more, the data show that incidents of oxygen deprivation and cabin decompression have escalated in the last year, while service officials work to determine the root cause of the in-flight problems. Trump's promotion of the Super Hornet began in December, when the president-elect said in a Twitter posting, "Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!" Translating Trump's request into action, Defense Secretary James Mattis commissioned a review of improvements that would "provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative" to the F-35C, the Navy version of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Joint Strike Fighter. Boeing 'paper plane' wins over skeptic as United takes peek Julie Johnsson United Continental Holdings has taken a close look at an all-new jetliner that Boeing engineers are developing for trans-Atlantic flying, and the airline likes what it sees.

United Continental Holdings has taken a close look at an all-new jetliner that Boeing engineers are developing for trans-Atlantic flying, and the airline likes what it sees. "What we've seen so far is very, very interesting to us," Andrew Levy, United's chief financial officer, said in an interview.... (Julie Johnsson) "Since May 1, 2010, all models" of the F-18 "show steady, yearly increases in the number of physiological episodes," according to a staff memo prepared in advance of a hearing Tuesday of a House Armed Services subcommittee. Navy officials testifying before the committee called the problem the "No.1 safety issue." "I am concerned about this growing trend -- one that has a significant effect on readiness and one that needs to be fixed," Rep. Mike Turner, the Ohio Republican who leads the Tactical Air and Land Forces subcommittee, said in his opening statement. Despite good-faith efforts, the "lack of overall progress" is "of great concern," said Rep. Niki Tsongas, the panel's top Democrat. This isn't the first time a high-performance U.S. military aircraft that flies at high altitudes has run into such episodes. In 2012, the Air Force had to track down a mystery after at least a dozen pilots flying Boeing's F-22 Raptor fighters became dizzy and disoriented. The service eventually determined a valve that regulated oxygen flow into the Raptor pilot's pressure vest was too weak to prevent the vest from inflating unnecessarily and restricting the pilot's ability to breathe. Trump nominates Boeing executive for Pentagon's second-in-command Thomas Gibbons-Neff President Donald Trump has nominated six individuals to fill some of the top posts at the Pentagon, including a Boeing executive who will serve as the department's second-in-command, according to a news release put out Thursday by the White House.

President Donald Trump has nominated six individuals to fill some of the top posts at the Pentagon, including a Boeing executive who will serve as the department's second-in-command, according to a news release put out Thursday by the White House. Aside from the deputy secretary of defense, the... (Thomas Gibbons-Neff) The newest versions of the F-18 -- the Super Hornet and the Growler, which is tailored to jam an adversary's electronics -- "appear to have challenges in regards to hypoxia," according to the memo on the problem written by staff members of House subcommittee. Hypoxia is a deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the body's tissues. Older versions of the plane, the A through D models, have problems with cabin pressure. Decompression sickness occurs due to cockpit depressurization at altitude and the resulting formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body's venous system and other organs. The incidents point to the plane's environmental control system. The rate of reported occurrences of the physiological episodes per 100,000 flight hours almost doubled in the year ended Oct. 31 from the previous year on older F-18 models. They doubled on the newest Growlers and increased 11 percent for the newer Super Hornet. That resulted in 45 instances for the Super Hornet versus 39 the previous year, according to Navy statistics obtained by Bloomberg. The trend continued in the three months since Nov. 1, with nine incidents reported by Jan. 31 during 28,600 hours of flying. The Super Hornet and Growler issues "would appear to point to the onboard oxygen generating" system to which the Navy has made changes, the staff memo said. "We are working closely with the Navy's Physiological Episode Team to help identify root causes of physiological episodes and their solutions," Caroline Hutcheson, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Boeing, said in an email. "We take safety in flight very seriously and will continue to assist the Navy on the way forward." For Boeing chief, how cozy is too cozy in access to Trump Richard Clough and Julie Johnsson Few companies have been as successful as Boeing Co. in building a cozy relationship with President Donald Trump.

Few companies have been as successful as Boeing Co. in building a cozy relationship with President Donald Trump. The question is how close is too close. The company found itself in an awkward position this week after Bloomberg reported that Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg had listened... (Richard Clough and Julie Johnsson) The Navy is conducting "fleet awareness" briefings for pilots and "has enhanced reduced-oxygen training so that pilots can more quickly determine when he or she is having symptoms of hypoxia," according to the congressional staff memo, which said the service has installed chambers on two aircraft carriers to provide therapy "to pilots that have been exposed to decompression." "Moving forward, we will continue to fly while applying every resource to solve this challenging problem," the top aviation officials for the Navy and Marine Corps said Tuesday in a prepared statement. A 62-person "Physiological Episode Team" set up in May 2010 continues assess root causes and solutions, the service officials said. Of the more than 380 episodes evaluated by the Navy team so far, 130 "have involved some form of contamination," 114 involved an environmental control system component failure, 91 involved "human factors" and 50 concerned a component failure with the on-board oxygen generating system, the officials said. An additional 13 involved a breathing-gas delivery component failure and 76 were inconclusive or involved another aircraft system not directly related to the breathing system, the officials said, with more than one cause found in a number of instances.

The Skyview Panoramic, developed for Boeing by aerospace firm Fokker Technologies, will offer unrivalled views from 35,000 feet. But not everyone will get the chance to enjoy the vistas – plans are only in place to install them on corporate planes. The giant window from the outside Following a 2018 launch, all new Boeing Business Jet (BBJ), BBJ2 and BBJ Max aircraft will include the giant apertures, which can sit in multiple locations to the aft of the wing. They may also be added to Boeing’s existing corporate aircraft at the request of owners. Fokker first proposed the Skyview Panoramic several years ago but had been waiting for FAA and EASA approval. 10 things Ive learned working as a VIP air stewardess "We are proud to announce the next step for the Skyview Panoramic window together with Boeing Business Jets," said Peter Somers, President of GKN's Fokker Services business. "The innovative technology applied in the largest window in the market, enhances passenger comfort and is now also available for BBJ MAX airplanes." One of the most notable features of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which launched in 2009, is its larger windows. But at just 1.5 feet in length they pale in comparison to the Skyview Panoramic. The Dreamliner's windows pale in comparison Credit: © 2014 Bloomberg Finance LP/Bloomberg The world’s private jets are already packed with lavish features - even without this latest addition. Speaking to Telegraph Travel, photographer Nick Gleis, who has snapped inside more than 800 such aircraft, said he had seen everything from a domed ceiling that changed colour to simulate dawn, day, dusk and night (including star constellations) to a “living wall” of plants.  Private jets are hardly short of luxury features For a glimpse of the plane cabins of the future, it’s hard to beat the annual Aircraft Interior Expo. This year’s event takes place in Hamburg from April 4, but a shortlist of award nominees has already been released. As with the Skyview Panoramic, it’s the wealthiest travellers that look set to benefit. Highlights include the first business-class cabin to feature a sliding door for each passenger, courtesy of Delta Air Lines, and the first underfloor heating system for a private jet, the work of Austria’s F.List GmbH. The Delta One Suite US-based Kestrel Aviation Management, meanwhile, has been praised by Expo judges for its Dreamjet concept, which sees the 787 Dreamliner (which ordinarily carries between 240 and 335 passengers) turned into a 40-passenger plane so spacious it resembles an airborne penthouse apartment. It features an entertainment and study lounge, dedicated dining spaces, and en-suite master bedroom, and is finished with hardwood floors and hand-tufted carpets.

Continue Reading Below Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, with troops fighting in neighboring Yemen and participating in allied air strikes against Islamic State, already have some of the region's most advanced forces. But they are limited in their ability to maintain and repair sophisticated military equipment -- let alone manufacture it. The rulers want to become l ess dependent on the U.S. and other Western countries, and they see defense as a sector that can help diversify their oil-based economies. The Saudi government, the world's No. 3 defense spender after the U.S. and China, last year announced it wants half the money it allots for military equipment to go to local firms by 2030, up from 2% today. Even if the kingdom only partly achieves its goal, the impact will reverberate through the global defense industry. In 2015, Saudi Arabia military expenditures totaled around $87.2 billion, according to the research firm Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. "We spend more than Britain, and France, and don't have industry. We have a strong demand that we should meet inside Saudi Arabia," Saudi Arabia's defense minister, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, said in a televised interview last year.

That message is trickling down. AM General, the South Bend, Ind.-based maker of the Humvee, said in February it was starting to export commercial chassis abroad. That allows customers, including partners in the Gulf, to assemble customized versions of their armored vehicles locally. "The bottom line is they want to spend more of their money in their country," says Nguyen Trinh, an executive at AM General. Saudi Arabia's Advanced Electronics Company, a Riyadh-based supplier of defense equipment like signal jammers and lasers, recently entered a new partnership with Raytheon Co. for a Saudi-government contract to develop cybersecurity capabilities. Raytheon declined to comment on the contract. Local defense firms cite the deal as evidence foreign suppliers are scouting for new or expanded partnerships. "Instead of us pulling them, they are the ones pushing -- they are approaching us," says Mohammed Al Khalifa, the vice president of AEC, which is jointly owned by British weapons maker BAE Systems and Saudi investors. Big global contractors such as Boeing Co. (BA) say they see opportunities for opening new production lines in the Middle East. "Boeing will continue to look for potential partnership opportunities for mutual growth of business," Bernard Dunn, president of Boeing Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, said in an email. But such opportunities are no simple matter for the foreign contractors. Policy rules in the U.S. and Europe would allow the manufacturing of some components to be out-sourced, but the rules are stricter for sensitive military technology. In Abu Dhabi two years ago, a senior U.S. Department of Defense official told potential Gulf buyers and industry executives that they wouldn't be allowed in the foreseeable future to buy Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMC) radar-evading F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , according to Danny Sebright, president of the U.A.E.-U.S. Business Council and a former Defense Department official, who was there. The official alluded to rules to ensure Israel maintained a competitive military edge in the region. The Emiratis decided to turn to Russia. The U.A.E.'s defense ministry said in February it would jointly develop a light combat fighter with Russia's state-run defense corporation Rostec. "It was completely a statement to the Americans and to the Europeans that, if you don't give us what we need, if you don't help us with what we need, we have no choice but to try to get it somewhere else to protect our legitimate security needs," said Mr. Sebright. Saudi Arabia reached a deal earlier this month with China to jointly manufacture drones. "It's a very important marketplace -- and we have to adapt to it," said a Gulf-based executive with a U.S. defense firm. Many Gulf-based defense companies were established decades ago under offset programs that required foreign suppliers to invest part of their compensation locally. The push into manufacturing, however, is new Alsalam Aerospace Industries, a firm based in Riyadh and partly owned by Boeing Co., wants to manufacture its first complete aircraft by 2030. Last year, with Boeing's help, the company started assembling wings and forward fuselages in its factory to upgrade F-15 jet fighters for the Royal Saudi Air Force. "We want to be the Lockheed Martin or the Boeing of Saudi Arabia," says Yehya Al Ghoraibi, the company's chief executive. The company is expanding into helicopter maintenance and repair. In the more distant future, Mr. Ghoraibi is considering expanding into areas ranging from tank manufacturing to bomb making. The U.A.E. is already producing armored vehicles. In February, the country's armed forces awarded a contract of 1,750 armored vehicles to an Emirati company, NIMR Automotive. It was a rare example of a local business securing a deal of such size. In 2014, the U.A. E. merged more than a dozen state-owned firms under a conglomerate called the Emirates Defence Industries Company, It is led by Luc Vigneron, the former head of Thales SA, Europe's leading defense electronics maker. NIMR, one of the conglomerate's subsidiaries, produces around four vehicles a day and looking to export to Eastern European and Asian markets. In a sign of how the development of the local defense industry is shaping career perspectives, many of NIMR's engineers are Emirati. "My father thought a successful path would be in oil and gas," recalls 29-year-old Omran Alhashemi. What do you think? Click the button below to comment on this article.

"We’ve established a vision and we are delivering it," said Ismail Ali Abdullah, who added that with the contract wins from Boeing and Airbus at last summer’s big international air show at Farnborough, in the United Kingdom, Strata’s order book is now is at a record US$7.5 billion, enough work to take both the new and planned plants through to 2035 at least. Indeed, with other orders Strata has won from Italy’s Leonardo (formerly Finmeccanica), Facc Austria, Sabca Belgium and Sweden’s Saab, the company requires outside help to keep up while it undergoes expansion. "Today, my hands are 100 per cent full and we need to outsource some of the work packages," said Mr Abdullah, on the sidelines of the Global Manfacturing and Industrialisation Summit (GMIS) in Abu Dhabi, adding that two of Strata’s 10 work packages are currently outsourced. As well as the planned new 60,000 square metres plant in Al Ain, where Strata has an existing 30,000 square metres facility, the company is also scouting locations to expand in Morocco or another North African location, as well as in North America. The Al Ain expansion marks a move to a new level of skills and a much higher production level, Scott Fancher, Boeing’s head of development worldwide told The National. "Not too many years ago [Boeing’s contract with Strata] started as building a handful of parts, fairly simple parts," said Mr Fancher. The new plant, which is expected to break ground next year and be completed in 2020, will run two new production lines, one of which will be to build 50 per cent of Boeing’s requirements for vertical tail fins for its mid-size, wide-body 787 Dreamliner. "What Strata is doing for us now is a foothold, they’re demonstrating their ability to be a great supplier," said Mr Fancher. "The next step is to go up the food chain to more complex structures, which is what this vertical fin represents ... If they are successful in bringing that online – not if, but when – then they’ll be a first-tier aerospace manufacturer." The Strata plan to achieve tier-one manufacturer status is a central part of the UAE’s aerospace project, which leverages the "hub and spoke" business model of the country’s two main airlines, Emirates and Etihad Airways, to build complementary manufacturing and service facilities, mainly focused on the Nibras Aerospace Park in Al Ain, where the aim is to create 10,000 jobs over the next decade. Mubadala Development, Abu Dhabi’s strategic investment company, which owns Strata, is expected to report today that aerospace showed steady financial progress last year. Mr Abdullah said revenue targets have been "stretched" now that new business has been won, although achieving financial break-even will now not be achieved until after 2018 instead of this year, as previously forecast. Strata started manufacturing in 2010 with product lines that have included wing and fin parts for the Airbus A330, A340 and A380 aircraft, as well as Boeing’s 777 and 787. The second production line in the expanded facility also represents a step up for Airbus, with a contract to make horizontal tail planes for the A320. The UAE dominates airline traffic growth in the region and the aerospace strategy is built on a sound assessment of the market, Mr Fancher said. "Eight per cent of the world’s population is within eight hours’ flying time [of the UAE] and the geography is not going to change," he said. "At the same time, airline traffic growth is running at 2 per cent above world GDP growth year-on-year ... The market is here, it’s really just a question of whether Mubadala/Strata continue to perform and all indications are that they will." Boeing and Strata also announced this week at GMIS joint venture R&D projects that will entail training Strata workers in facilities in the US and Russia, and today are expected to announce their first joint engineering projects for the UAE. amcauley@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Economy Future of Industry: Mubadala looks to TS&S for aircraft engine plans Show me the money: A 20-question quiz on March business news UAE visitors boost UK tourism Retailers not alone in gaining lift from post-Brexit pound MOST VIEWED Business | All Hyperpanda to shutter its doors in Dubai Festival City Laptop ban is ‘not acceptable’, says head of global airline group Amazon purchase of Souq.com gets warm reception from consumers in UAE Selling private data comes with a risk in the UAE A hospital service for aircraft engines in Abu Dhabi – in pictures Abu Dhabi renter is confused whether animals are allowed on property Emirates mulls loaning laptops to passengers amid US ban Future of industry: Strata to create jobs with Al Ain plant investment Vice to start hiring as it targets Middle East millennials FGB shares to be delisted on Thursday ahead of merger with NBAD More Most Viewed Officials backtrack on move to reduce speed limits on Emirates and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed roads Watch Dubai Crown Prince help pull stuck lorry out of the desert Yemen and allies close to dealing ‘debilitating blow’ to Iran, Hadi tells Arab League Hyperpanda to shutter its doors in Dubai Festival City Laptop ban is ‘not acceptable’, says head of global airline group Three-day mourning period in Fujairah after death of Deputy Ruler Algal bloom the size of Mexico could threaten UAE marine life, experts say UAE gamers voice anger as Discord chat app blocked by Etisalat Iran sends Afghan proxy forces to Yemen as support for Houthis increases More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Emirates mulls loaning laptops to passengers amid US ban Devoted UAE residents finding ways to monetise their popular Facebook groups Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Officials backtrack on move to reduce speed limits on Emirates and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed roads Watch Dubai Crown Prince help pull stuck lorry out of the desert Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Bush as it travels toward the Strait of Hormuz. The arrival of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf marks the first such deployment under new U.S. President Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell) As President Donald Trump pushes for the Pentagon to buy more of Boeing's St. Louis-made F-18 aircraft, the U.S. Navy is grappling with an escalating problem: Pilots suffering potentially dangerous oxygen deprivation or a loss of cabin pressure in the fighter jets. All F-18 models, including the Super Hornet that Trump has championed, have shown steady annual increases in what the Navy calls "physiological episodes," according to service testimony obtained by Bloomberg News. What's more, the data show that incidents of oxygen deprivation and cabin decompression have escalated in the last year, while service officials work to determine the root cause of the in-flight problems. Trump's promotion of the Super Hornet began in December, when the president-elect said in a Twitter posting, "Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!" Translating Trump's request into action, Defense Secretary James Mattis commissioned a review of improvements that would "provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative" to the F-35C, the Navy version of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Joint Strike Fighter.  (Trump's budget recommendation to Congress includes $2.4 billion for 24 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets — 10 more than the U.S. House of Representatives approved on March 8 in its 2017 base spending bill.) "Since May 1, 2010, all models" of the F-18 "show steady, yearly increases in the number of physiological episodes," according to a staff memo prepared in advance of a hearing Tuesday of a House Armed Services subcommittee. Navy officials testifying before the committee called the problem the "No. 1 safety issue." "I am concerned about this growing trend — one that has a significant effect on readiness and one that needs to be fixed," Rep. Mike Turner, the Ohio Republican who leads the Tactical Air and Land Forces subcommittee, said in his opening statement. Despite good-faith efforts, the "lack of overall progress" is "of great concern," said Rep. Niki Tsongas, the panel's top Democrat. This isn't the first time a high-performance U.S. military aircraft that flies at high altitudes has run into such episodes. In 2012, the Air Force had to track down a mystery after at least a dozen pilots flying Boeing's F-22 Raptor fighters became dizzy and disoriented. The service eventually determined a valve that regulated oxygen flow into the Raptor pilot's pressure vest was too weak to prevent the vest from inflating unnecessarily and restricting the pilot's ability to breathe. The newest versions of the F-18 — the Super Hornet and the Growler, which is tailored to jam an adversary's electronics — "appear to have challenges in regards to hypoxia," according to the memo on the problem written by staff members of House subcommittee. Hypoxia is a deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the body's tissues. Older versions of the plane, the A through D models, have problems with cabin pressure. Decompression sickness occurs due to cockpit depressurization at altitude and the resulting formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body's venous system and other organs. The incidents point to the plane's environmental control system. The rate of reported occurrences of the physiological episodes per 100,000 flight hours almost doubled in the year ended Oct. 31 from the previous year on older F-18 models. They doubled on the newest Growlers and increased 11 percent for the newer Super Hornet. That resulted in 45 instances for the Super Hornet versus 39 the previous year, according to Navy statistics obtained by Bloomberg. The trend continued in the three months since Nov. 1, with nine incidents reported by Jan. 31 during 28,600 hours of flying. Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher The Super Hornet and Growler issues "would appear to point to the onboard oxygen generating" system to which the Navy has made changes, the staff memo said. "We are working closely with the Navy's Physiological Episode Team to help identify root causes of physiological episodes and their solutions," Caroline Hutcheson, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Boeing, said in an email. "We take safety in flight very seriously and will continue to assist the Navy on the way forward." The Navy is conducting "fleet awareness" briefings for pilots and "has enhanced reduced-oxygen training so that pilots can more quickly determine when he or she is having symptoms of hypoxia," according to the congressional staff memo, which said the service has installed chambers on two aircraft carriers to provide therapy "to pilots that have been exposed to decompression." "Moving forward, we will continue to fly while applying every resource to solve this challenging problem," the top aviation officials for the Navy and Marine Corps said Tuesday in a prepared statement. A 62-person "Physiological Episode Team" set up in May 2010 continues assess root causes and solutions, the service officials said. Of the more than 380 episodes evaluated by the Navy team so far, 130 "have involved some form of contamination," 114 involved an environmental control system component failure, 91 involved "human factors" and 50 concerned a component failure with the on-board oxygen generating system, the officials said. An additional 13 involved a breathing-gas delivery component failure and 76 were inconclusive or involved another aircraft system not directly related to the breathing system, the officials said, with more than one cause found in a number of instances.

An additional 13 involved a breathing-gas delivery component failure and 76 were inconclusive or involved another aircraft system not directly related to the breathing system, the officials said, with more than one cause found in a number of instances.   Most Read Aerospace blog Smaller, more efficient 787 has been a boon for airlines SEATAC — Virgin Atlantic started regular service between London and Seattle on… Mar 29th, 2017 by Dan Catchpole Gov.

Bush as it travels toward the Strait of Hormuz. The arrival of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf marks the first such deployment under new U.S. President Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell) As President Donald Trump pushes for the Pentagon to buy more of Boeing's St. Louis-made F-18 aircraft, the U.S. Navy is grappling with an escalating problem: Pilots suffering potentially dangerous oxygen deprivation or a loss of cabin pressure in the fighter jets. All F-18 models, including the Super Hornet that Trump has championed, have shown steady annual increases in what the Navy calls "physiological episodes," according to service testimony obtained by Bloomberg News. What's more, the data show that incidents of oxygen deprivation and cabin decompression have escalated in the last year, while service officials work to determine the root cause of the in-flight problems. Trump's promotion of the Super Hornet began in December, when the president-elect said in a Twitter posting, "Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!" Translating Trump's request into action, Defense Secretary James Mattis commissioned a review of improvements that would "provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative" to the F-35C, the Navy version of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Joint Strike Fighter.  (Trump's budget recommendation to Congress includes $2.4 billion for 24 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets — 10 more than the U.S. House of Representatives approved on March 8 in its 2017 base spending bill.) "Since May 1, 2010, all models" of the F-18 "show steady, yearly increases in the number of physiological episodes," according to a staff memo prepared in advance of a hearing Tuesday of a House Armed Services subcommittee. Navy officials testifying before the committee called the problem the "No. 1 safety issue." "I am concerned about this growing trend — one that has a significant effect on readiness and one that needs to be fixed," Rep. Mike Turner, the Ohio Republican who leads the Tactical Air and Land Forces subcommittee, said in his opening statement. Despite good-faith efforts, the "lack of overall progress" is "of great concern," said Rep. Niki Tsongas, the panel's top Democrat. This isn't the first time a high-performance U.S. military aircraft that flies at high altitudes has run into such episodes. In 2012, the Air Force had to track down a mystery after at least a dozen pilots flying Boeing's F-22 Raptor fighters became dizzy and disoriented. The service eventually determined a valve that regulated oxygen flow into the Raptor pilot's pressure vest was too weak to prevent the vest from inflating unnecessarily and restricting the pilot's ability to breathe. The newest versions of the F-18 — the Super Hornet and the Growler, which is tailored to jam an adversary's electronics — "appear to have challenges in regards to hypoxia," according to the memo on the problem written by staff members of House subcommittee. Hypoxia is a deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the body's tissues. Older versions of the plane, the A through D models, have problems with cabin pressure. Decompression sickness occurs due to cockpit depressurization at altitude and the resulting formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body's venous system and other organs. The incidents point to the plane's environmental control system. The rate of reported occurrences of the physiological episodes per 100,000 flight hours almost doubled in the year ended Oct. 31 from the previous year on older F-18 models. They doubled on the newest Growlers and increased 11 percent for the newer Super Hornet. That resulted in 45 instances for the Super Hornet versus 39 the previous year, according to Navy statistics obtained by Bloomberg. The trend continued in the three months since Nov. 1, with nine incidents reported by Jan. 31 during 28,600 hours of flying.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives The Super Hornet and Growler issues "would appear to point to the onboard oxygen generating" system to which the Navy has made changes, the staff memo said. "We are working closely with the Navy's Physiological Episode Team to help identify root causes of physiological episodes and their solutions," Caroline Hutcheson, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Boeing, said in an email. "We take safety in flight very seriously and will continue to assist the Navy on the way forward." The Navy is conducting "fleet awareness" briefings for pilots and "has enhanced reduced-oxygen training so that pilots can more quickly determine when he or she is having symptoms of hypoxia," according to the congressional staff memo, which said the service has installed chambers on two aircraft carriers to provide therapy "to pilots that have been exposed to decompression." "Moving forward, we will continue to fly while applying every resource to solve this challenging problem," the top aviation officials for the Navy and Marine Corps said Tuesday in a prepared statement. A 62-person "Physiological Episode Team" set up in May 2010 continues assess root causes and solutions, the service officials said. Of the more than 380 episodes evaluated by the Navy team so far, 130 "have involved some form of contamination," 114 involved an environmental control system component failure, 91 involved "human factors" and 50 concerned a component failure with the on-board oxygen generating system, the officials said.

Latest news headlines from Zimbabwe Situation Skip to content Home Latest TEXT ONLY Sources Lists Archives About “Zimbabwe Situation” Friends Support us Advertise AirZim deal collapses By ZimSitRep_M | March 23, 2017 7 Comments Source: AirZim deal collapses | The Financial Gazette March 23, 2017 By Shame Makoshori, Senior Business Reporter PLANS by the country’s beleaguered airline, Air Zimbabwe (AirZim), to lease modern passenger aircraft from Malaysia Airlines have hit a brick wall after the two parties could not agree on terms underpinning the multi-million dollar deal, the Financial Gazette can exclusively report. Zimbabwe had made giant strides in negotiating the acquisition of Boeing 787 Dreamliners from Malaysia Airlines to turn around the fortunes of the troubled AirZim, which is wallowing in debt estimated at about US$300 million. The two parties had opened discussions on the deal after President Robert Mugabe had led a delegation to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, last year to scout for opportunities for the landlocked southern African country. His delegation comprised Transport and Infrastructure Development Minister Joram Gumbo and aviation experts from AirZim who used the visit to the south-east Asian country to engage Malaysia Airlines with a view to either acquire or lease long-haul planes while parallel efforts back home focussed on identifying routes that would help the national flag carrier return to the black. Government had shown interest in the Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are basically long-haul, mid-size wide body, twin engine jet airliner manufactured by the United States’ Boeing Commercial Airplanes. AirZim board chairperson, Chipo Dyanda, could not be drawn into commenting on the latest development saying: “This is a shareholder matter. I refer you to the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development.” Gumbo confirmed this week that the discussions with Malaysia Airlines had fallen through and that AirZim had since shifted its focus elsewhere. “I am still talking with potential airlines and we may agree soon,” said Gumbo. “At the moment I do not want to say who they are. We were talking to 11 airlines in Singapore, in Ethiopia and other countries and there was nothing special about Malaysia. I only mentioned Malaysia (last year) because I went there to see planes that they were not using but we could not agree on certain issues,” he added. A new and efficient fleet would be crucial in AirZim’s struggle to return to profitability after meddling by government and years of mismanagement pushed the airline into its current crisis. It has been operating old aircraft that have been guzzling fuel and piling up expenses. AirZim has battled to compete for market share with regional competitors such as South African Airways, among others, which have invested in modern aircraft to save costs and attract the industry’s demanding clientele. Sources said AirZim was making progress on acquiring at least four Boeing 777s (B777s) aircraft from an undisclosed supplier. It also emerged that the AirZim board was exploring the possibility of establishing a new company to house the new fleet and start on a clean slate. Although this idea has not been officially communicated to government, the new airline could be called Zimbabwe Airways and would have the four aeroplanes as its first major assets. AirZim’s debt burden is one of the impediments to its ability to acquire new planes, as well as reaching agreement with a technical partner to steer the parastatal out of the woods. A new company is therefore seen as the most viable alternative to circumvent the problem, and even insulate the new planes from seizure by creditors. It was not immediately clear if the deal involves an outright acquisition or a lease, although indications are that AirZim would take delivery of the first batch of the B777s planes in the coming few months. If the national flag carrier is to acquire the planes, it could spend almost US$1 billion. The lowest priced model of the 777 family, the Boeing 777-200ER, costs US$261,5 million, while the Boeing 777-300ER goes for US$320,2 million. This, apparently, is costly for AirZim, whose shareholder, government, is broke and has spent the past year battling to pay its bloated civil service. It therefore does not have the financial wherewithal to fund the acquisition. The latest information appears to suggest that the AirZim board has ignored recommendations from consultants that it acquires two Dreamliner B787s and Brazilian assembled Embrear jetliners. The Embraer was briefly operated by AirZim on domestic and regional flights under a lease agreement three years ago. A report by audit consultants, EY, on the airline’s operations three years ago had recommended that AirZim should acquire or lease two B787 jetliners, which are smaller than the B777s. This was in addition to AirZim’s existing fleet. A feasibility assessment committee report came up with similar recommendations, according to sources familiar with the discussions. The committee had recommended that the airline procures a fleet of the Brazilian assembled 60-seater Embraer jetliners for domestic and short regional routes to significantly reduce costs on domestic routes, where AirZim has been operating the B737s, or even the much bigger B767s. There have been reports that AirZim has been flying with as low as three passengers on the Johannesburg-Harare route. The 150-seater Airbus A320 has also been flying on domestic and regional routes. AirZim is currently leasing two Airbus planes, one of which has been grounded ever since its delivery to the parastatal. Currently, AirZim has been grappling with declining load factors, and chief executive officer, Ripton Muzenda, has ordered that flights on the Harare-Kariba-Victoria Falls route should immediately be discontinued. A Chinese made MA60 plane, which is fuel efficient aircraft but costly to maintain, had been servicing the route. Passenger numbers have plummeted to about 230 000 per annum in the past few years, from a peak of one million in 1996, as travellers opt for other airlines on the four domestic destinations it services. The airline, currently flying into South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania, has been planning to re-launch the cash-spinning Harare-London flights, but airline executives have warned that without modern jetliners, it would be a waste of time because it would most certainly face stiff competition. AirZim’s aged fleet comprises of two Boeing 767s, three B737s, three MA60s and two Airbus A320s. Out of these planes, only four are flying – one airbus, one Boeing 767, one 737 and an MA60. Only two were in operation last week. The airline came close to liquidation when it stopped flights in 2011 before its sole shareholder took the decision to resume operation in November 2012. AirZim was also struggling due to a debt overhang; outstanding salaries/wages; collapsed administration systems; bloated staff complement; top-heavy management and limited route network consisting of local and two regional flights, namely South Africa and Tanzania that would inevitably affect its revenue. The Dyanda-led board has addressed the top-heavy management by putting in place a lean structure. Currently, a staff audit and restructuring exercise is underway to ensure the right people are in the right places and the airline carries a wage and salary bill it can afford and for the right kind of skills, knowledge and technical expertise. “We have also restructured the executive to ensure efficiency and reliability and to also upgrade and modernise systems that had collapsed and were outdated. Two new posts of chief operating officer and an executive manager (systems and administration) were created to achieve efficiency, reliability and modernisation of airline systems. We have also appointed an executive with the right technical skills, commitment and vision that the airline can be revived, can be viable and profitable to enable it to significantly contribute to national development by complementing road and rail transportation,” said Dyanda. “Above all, we are crafting a new three-year strategic plan with a different operational and business model so that we redirect the company to become a competitive airline in the next three years. In addition, these proposed changes are being done in a holistic, forward-looking and visionary manner to give the airline a new robust foundation for growth and development. In crafting this strategic plan, we have engaged our stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations from the airline, re-engaged the shareholder on the airline mandate as the national carrier and re-engineered the business model and systems. “As for the payment of retrenched workers’ packages, they are being paid monthly to the capacity of the airline. As a board, we are cognisant of their struggle to fend for their families, but we are limited by the funds available from a limited route network and the need to balance their needs with the operational requirements of the company. Some of them, with the right skills and expertise, may be re-absorbed in the company through the restructuring process currently underway. In addition, as the airline begins to have a good footing, more manpower may be required and more will be absorbed. The business model being proposed has the capacity to grow the business, but in some cases human resources will need upgrading to cope with the new demands.” Regarding EY’s recommendations, Dyanda said these were being considered as part of the 2017-2020 strategic plan. “Some recommendations from this report will be integrated with other strategies that have since come on board due to the developments in airline management, viability and profitability,” she said. Dyanda said no single solution was the magic wand for the revival of the airline, adding that money was not the only solution to the problems besetting the airline. “There are several strategies that are being put in place among them searching for a strategic partner by the shareholder, upgrading employee skills, knowledge and attitudes, changing the culture of the organisation, modernisation of the airline systems, rebranding to change the negative perceptions the airline has earned over the years and energising commitment and the vision of those running the organisation,” she said. The planned acquisition of B777 planes has already sparked heated debate within the airline, with questions being raised over the rationale behind purchasing long haul airliners during at a time when debts in London have meant that the national flag carrier cannot operate on this most lucrative route, for instance. “The bigger and the more the planes, the more cash those behind the acquisitions would get…. This has nothing to do with AirZim’s requirements. It only needs two big 787s. But four planes will give them more kickbacks. They want to make money out of aircraft acquisitions,” said a source.

It introduces new sensors suites, range extension and potentially stealthier attributes that Boeing says will make it a perfect companion for the F-35. A half-decade ago, U.S. Navy communicators were using defense journalists to send a clear message to Boeing: We love our F/A-18 E/Fs, but we’re done buying any more Super Hornets. Now, that plan has been turned on its head. Not only is the Navy planning to buy more of its mainstay aircraft, but Boeing is working on upgrades and technology that will not only keep the jets flying into the coming decades, but make them very much a major component of the service’s aerial strategy. And there’s every indication the Navy is on board with such plans for its favorite aviation weapon. A series of advanced technologies are being introduced into what Boeing calls its Block 3. It introduces new sensors suites, range extension and potentially stealthier attributes that Boeing says will make it a perfect companion for the F-35. “There will be real complementary capabilities,” Dan Gillian, Boeing F/A-18 and EA-18G Growler programs vice president. told Scout Warrior in an interview. He compared the future Super Hornets with JSS and EA-18G Growler electronic attack and warfare aircraft. “This is what it needs to be viable in the 2020s and 2030s.” Here’s what Boeing has in mind. The aircraft will have enhanced network capability with a system that improves computing power (DTP-N), network throughput (TTNT) and integration between the sensor and platform, which will allow large amounts of data on and off the airplane and make F/A-18 a smart node on the network.  This also will help It also increase ability to receive targeting information from platforms like the F-35, EA-18G and the E-2D Hawkeye. The aircraft will have longer range with low-drag, stealthy conformal fuel tanks.  The shoulder-mounted tanks can carry 3,500 pounds of fuel and reduce drag, allowing the aircraft to operate longer, go faster, and/or carry more weight. The Block 3 Super Hornet also will feature long-range detection with Infrared Search & Track (IRST). The long-range sensor can detect and target threats without having to depend on radar, generating a multi-ship, common tactical picture at long range and allowing the Super Hornet to operate as a smart sensor node on the network. Pilots will be able to manage of the enhanced situational awareness with a new Advanced Cockpit System --   a 10 x 19-inch touchscreen display provides the pilot with the capability to see, track and target multiple long range targets generated by the common tactical picture. If some of this sounds familiar, that’s because part of the package was what Boeing a year or so ago had called its “Advanced Super Hornet” offering. “We have matured our thinking,” Gillian says. “We’re thinking of how to complement with Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air (NIFC-CA) in the future fight. We’re making the F-18 a smart node on the NIFC-CA network … to contribute and share.” He adds, “We’re embracing the power of the networked carrier network. With the DTP-N, we’ve got the distributed targeting processor, a big computer that’s a Growler program of record. With TTNT, we’ve got a big data pipe that we’re moving over from Growler and E-2D. The IRST sensor is a key aspect of Block 2, with the AESA it can fuse information. So, we have a big computer and a big data pipe that can move data around.” “Foremost in our minds are readiness and capacity,” he says. Boeing is now “tearing apart” the two “learning aircraft” it brought to St. Louis to inspection and “destructive testing” to validate the company’s engineering work on extending aircraft life. “We have had some great learning about how to do the service life modification program,” Gillian says. “We’ve learned we’re going to have to remove some fuel tanks to do inspection. We have to make sure we have good fuel tank repair and a support supply chain to handle the (future) churn.” And there was a surprise. “We learned that airplanes that fly a lot for the Navy are in pretty good shape from a corrosion perspective.  We knew that airplanes that spent a lot of time not flying have corrosion problems – we see that at Cecil Field.” These lessons-learned and Super Hornet life-extension work has become of greater importance with the greater need for Navy aviation operations and continual slips in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Indeed, the talk has moved away from how Super Hornets could be used to supplement the JSF squadrons to how the two could complement one another in the coming decades. Right now, though, the emphasis is getting the aircraft the Navy needs now in the air and ready for deployment. Boeing is focusing on addressing the Super Hornet shortfall, Gillian. To that end, he tells Scout Warrior, the company is addressing readiness issues for existing aircraft and getting ready to meet new Navy orders. “The Navy is buying additional airplanes,” he said in an interview earlier this month. “We saw in the supplemental budget they were getting up toward 24 in fiscal year 2017.” But, he notes, Boeing is still working on current modification programs to extend the service lives of the existing 568 aircraft to 9,000 hours from 6,000. Indeed, he says, the plan is to build in a 9,0000-hour- service life to the production line aircraft starting in 2020. Some of the Boeing investments being made to address the Navy’s Super Hornet needs, he says, include the establishment of production lines in St. Louis and San Antonio as well as the bolstering of spare parts and engineering services, particularly at the Navy facility in Cecil Field, Fla.

All F-18 models, including the Super Hornet that Trump has championed, have shown steady annual increases in what the Navy calls “physiological episodes,” according to service testimony obtained by Bloomberg News. What’s more, the data show that incidents of oxygen deprivation and cabin decompression have escalated in the last year, while service officials work to determine the root cause of the in-flight problems. Trump’s promotion of the Super Hornet began in December, when the president-elect said in a Twitter posting, “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Translating Trump’s request into action, Defense Secretary James Mattis commissioned a review of improvements that would “provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative” to the F-35C, the Navy version of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s Joint Strike Fighter. “Since May 1, 2010, all models” of the F-18 “show steady, yearly increases in the number of physiological episodes,” according to a staff memo prepared in advance of a hearing Tuesday of a House Armed Services subcommittee. Navy officials testifying before the committee called the problem the “No.1 safety issue.” “I am concerned about this growing trend -- one that has a significant effect on readiness and one that needs to be fixed,” Representative Mike Turner, the Ohio Republican who leads the Tactical Air and Land Forces subcommittee, said in his opening statement. Despite good-faith efforts, the “lack of overall progress” is “of great concern,” said Representative Niki Tsongas, the panel’s top Democrat. Past Problem Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up This isn’t the first time a high-performance U.S. military aircraft that flies at high altitudes has run into such episodes. In 2012, the Air Force had to track down a mystery after at least a dozen pilots flying Boeing’s F-22 Raptor fighters became dizzy and disoriented. The service eventually determined a valve that regulated oxygen flow into the Raptor pilot’s pressure vest was too weak to prevent the vest from inflating unnecessarily and restricting the pilot’s ability to breathe. The newest versions of the F-18 -- the Super Hornet and the Growler, which is tailored to jam an adversary’s electronics -- “appear to have challenges in regards to hypoxia,” according to the memo on the problem written by staff members of House subcommittee. Hypoxia is a deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the body’s tissues. Older versions of the plane, the A through D models, have problems with cabin pressure. Decompression sickness occurs due to cockpit depressurization at altitude and the resulting formation of nitrogen bubbles in the body’s venous system and other organs. The incidents point to the plane’s environmental control system. The rate of reported occurrences of the physiological episodes per 100,000 flight hours almost doubled in the year ended Oct. 31 from the previous year on older F-18 models. They doubled on the newest Growlers and increased 11 percent for the newer Super Hornet. That resulted in 45 instances for the Super Hornet versus 39 the previous year, according to Navy statistics obtained by Bloomberg. The trend continued in the three months since Nov. 1, with nine incidents reported by Jan. 31 during 28,600 hours of flying. The Super Hornet and Growler issues “would appear to point to the onboard oxygen generating” system to which the Navy’ has made changes, the staff memo said. “We are working closely with the Navy’s Physiological Episode Team to help identify root causes of physiological episodes and their solutions,” Caroline Hutcheson, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Boeing, said in an email. “We take safety in flight very seriously and will continue to assist the Navy on the way forward.” ‘Reduced-Oxygen Training’ The Navy is conducting “fleet awareness” briefings for pilots and “has enhanced reduced-oxygen training so that pilots can more quickly determine when he or she is having symptoms of hypoxia,” according to the congressional staff memo, which said the service has installed chambers on two aircraft carriers to provide therapy “to pilots that have been exposed to decompression.” “Moving forward, we will continue to fly while applying every resource to solve this challenging problem,” the top aviation officials for the Navy and Marine Corps said Tuesday in a prepared statement. A 62-person “Physiological Episode Team” set up in May 2010 continues assess root causes and solutions, the service officials said. Of the 383 episodes evaluated by the Navy team so far, 130 “have involved some form of contamination,” 114 involved an environmental control system component failure, 91 involved “human factors” and 50 concerned a component failure with the on-board oxygen generating system, the officials said. An additional 13 involved a breathing-gas delivery component failure and 76 were inconclusive or involved another aircraft system not directly related to the breathing system, the officials said, with more than one cause found in a number of instances.

But Europe is finding legacy problems and new challenges to address cyber risks for its air transportation systems. Sources consulted by EURACTIV.com describe a fragmented landscape, with a poor understanding of the threat by officials, and substantial differences within the industry when it comes to the involvement of the EU. “For the time being, it is extremely difficult to exchange information,” said Pascal Andrei, who has been responsible for aircraft security at Airbus for fifteen years. After years of being neglected as a major issue, cyber security is now becoming a priority in Europe. Inspired by US efforts, the EU is trying to catch up. However, officials and the private sector are still trying to calibrate the right level of cooperation, as the industry considers that EU authorities, mostly the Commission, are “far from reality” on this matter. “There is too much bla bla bla,” an industry source said. “Cybersecurity and cyber attacks are a rapidly developing issue,” said Dirk Polloczek, president of the European Cockpit Association. “We need to invest more on what could be done, but the question is also who is responsible and who is leading,” he added. Late and duplicated The US created an Aviation Information Sharing and Analysis Center (A-ISAC) in September 2014. Its goal is to exchange sensitive information about incidents and vulnerabilities in a “secure trust network”, the A-ISAC website says. The group includes airlines, Boeing and intelligence agencies such as the National Security Agency, the FBI and the CIA. Airbus and Lufthansa are the only European voices in the association, according to one of the members. While in the US all the efforts to tackle cyber attacks have been channelled through the A-ISAC, in Europe government and industry are developing different initiatives. Last February, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) set up a European Centre for Cyber Security in Aviation (ECCSA). EASA invited aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other stakeholders to become members of ECCSA (free of charge) in order to benefit from intelligence sharing of cyber attacks. The EU agency also offered operational means to face these threats. “It is not so easy to connect all these actors because they tend to work in isolation most of the time”, said Davide Martini, aviation cybersecurity officer at EASA and responsible for the implementation of ECCSA. “We saw in the past not really efficient dynamics in information exchange relevant to cybersecurity,” he commented. But companies remain wary of the EU’s role in dealing with cyber risks. Some players decided not to wait for the EASA’s initiative and, in November, set up a European Strategic Coordination Platform. The platform will include key industry stakeholders, but also member states and EU institutions. A first meeting is scheduled for 2017. The new platform will substitute an existing informal group including Airbus, airlines and other actors. Not with you But the participation of the EU institutions could impact on the free flow of sensitive information, some industry sources feared. The largest aircraft manufacturers also hold different views on the EU authorities’ involvement. “We support Boeing’s approach of having a closed-door system to exchange sensitive information, but in order to face a threat which is organised and worldwide, you need to talk to other people. So it should work both ways,” said Airbus’s Andrei. “Boeing is among the members of the aviation industry actively participating with government agencies and industry partners in efforts to make commercial aviation, already the safest form of transportation, even safer,” according to Boeing’s Vice President for Safety, Security & Compliance, Elizabeth A. Pasztor. “Developing and agreeing upon cybersecurity standards for airliners and advancing information sharing both across industry and governments are some of those efforts,” she replied in a statement. Andrei argued that EU institutions should play a role as a “music director” in order to harmonise specifications and requirements for manufacturers, airlines, airports, suppliers and air traffic management systems. “Today, most EASA regulations are for aircraft manufacturers. However, security is a chain. You need to harmonise the specifications and requirements and address all stakeholders.” He hoped that stakeholders would exchange a lot of information also once the EU institutions are part of the new industry-led platform. But he stressed that officials also needed to be more in contact with experts with operational knowledge to draft operational directives in order to bolster their proposals. Other industry voices bluntly commented that, in order to guarantee that companies continue sharing sensitive information once the Commission and EASA are involved, that they should have the appropriate skills and competences, which is not the case today in the case of the executive. “Probably we will be more exposed to cyber-security information than we are today,” EASA’s Martini said. “That will mean that EASA will be successful because this is exactly the purpose of the enterprise but not only for us, for every [ECCSA] member.” The Commission did not respond to EURACTIV’s request for a comment. EASA believes that the EU institutions’ approach (‘top-down’) and the industry-led effort (bottom-up) are “complementary initiatives” and are both needed, a spokesperson said. Mistrust Mistrust exists not only between the EU and the aviation industry but also between member states This hampered the exchange of sensitive information in the past because countries “don’t share the US mindset when it comes to the security culture”, Andrei explained. Working with the A-ISAC may be easier not only because all the intelligence agencies belong to a single country, but also thanks to the stakeholders’ “patriotic” stance that inspires them to address common threats, the Airbus official said. Once the new industry-led platform is set up, he commented that the European platform would “not compete with but rather complete” what the US group is doing. Andrei recalled the “high level of cooperation” between Boeing and Airbus when it comes to physical and cyber-security and safety. The US-based Boeing and Europe’s Airbus control most of the aircraft manufacturing market. The tough competition between the two companies has led to mutual accusations of illegal state subsidies. “Since 11-S, we exchanged a lot sensitive info. We are not in competitive mode with Boeing” on these issues, Andrei concluded.

Peruvian Airlines said in a statement that the Boeing 737-300 jet drove off the runway for unspecified reasons during the scheduled landing, after swerving to the right. It said that all 141 people on board the flight, which originated in Lima, were evacuated safely. Authorities are investigating the incident, which occurred about 4:30 p.m., involving the Boeing 737-300 jet at the high-altitude airport in an agricultural valley some 265 kilometers from Lima, the capital. The fire likely started when the wing scraped the runway, Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio said. "The plane couldn't stop on the runway and they made a maneuver to stop it with the wing and that appears to have caused the fire," Basombrio told reporters on local broadcaster RPP. Television images showed a large cloud of black smoke streaming from an airliner in flames. Boeing said it was aware of the reports of the incident and was gathering information.   Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 10:20 • 30/03 Hypnodog!

Peruvian Airlines said in a statement that the Boeing 737-300 jet drove off the runway for unspecified reasons during the scheduled landing, after swerving to the right. It said that all 141 people on board the flight, which originated in Lima, were evacuated safely. Authorities are investigating the incident, which occurred about 4.30 pm local time, involving the Boeing 737-300 jet at the high-altitude airport in an agricultural valley some 265 km from the capital Lima. The fire likely started when the wing scraped the runway, Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio said. "The plane couldn't stop on the runway and they made a manoeuvre to stop it with the wing and that appears to have caused the fire," Basombrio told reporters on local broadcaster RPP. Television images showed a large cloud of black smoke streaming from an airliner in flames. Boeing said it was aware of the reports of the incident and was gathering information.

Image courtesy Blue Origin. For a larger version of this image please go here. NASA recently marked a decade since it began a new era in commercial spaceflight development for low-Earth orbit transportation. The space agency inked agreements in 2006 to develop rockets and spacecraft capable of carrying cargo such as experiments and supplies to and from the International Space Station. The first development agreements for elements of commercial crew spacecraft followed the initial commercial cargo agreements by about three years. Soon after that, NASA's Commercial Crew Program was created to shepherd human-rating requirements into existence and certify designs of spacecraft, launch pads and ground systems. The aerospace companies NASA partnered with during the commercial crew and cargo development phases have infused expertise and innovation into the marketplace. These capabilities have set a foundation of new space-related industries with specialties in everything from engines and life support systems to complete spacecraft designs. "With cargo, we wanted the capability to cost-effectively deliver research experiments, hardware and supplies to the space station. With crew, we needed continued U.S. human access to low-Earth orbit," said Phil McAlister, director of NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. "But another one of the rationales was to stimulate new markets. Seeing that emerge has been really gratifying." Today, Boeing and SpaceX are deep into final testing and manufacturing of independent spacecraft and launch systems that will carry astronauts to the International Space Station. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner will fly into space on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. SpaceX is building the Crew Dragon spacecraft to launch on the company's Falcon 9 rocket. Both spacecraft are designed to take up to four astronauts on NASA missions, a number that will give the station a full-time crew of seven, ensuring maximum research time aboard the orbiting laboratory. Through a combination of funded and unfunded space act agreements, NASA continues to provide its expertise to help advance the burgeoning commercial human space transportation industry. Blue Origin and Sierra Nevada Corporation, partners with NASA since 2010, continue to develop and refine their respective crew spacecraft and launch systems. Under these agreements, NASA provides expertise and insight into their spaceflight designs. The benefits to NASA include a more diverse market of competition and capability. Blue Origin and NASA worked together on the testing of the company's BE-3 thrust chamber, Space Vehicle spacecraft and subsystems of the New Shepard rocket. The BE-3 has powered several flights of a prototype New Shepard rocket designed to loft its spacecraft on suborbital missions. Later rockets are designed to be more powerful to launch satellites and its Space Vehicle spacecraft into orbit. For Sierra Nevada Corporation, NASA provides assistance as the company refines its Dream Chaser spacecraft for future human spaceflight missions. SNC currently is developing its Dream Chaser Cargo System to fulfill a NASA contract to carry supplies to the space station and return them to Earth beginning in 2019. The winged spacecraft is designed to launch inside a payload fairing on an Atlas V rocket and at the end of the mission will glide back to Earth and land on a runway. "We have a massive wealth of knowledge about human spaceflight, some of it gained with great sacrifice, so we set out to create a framework that could leverage that experience while allowing the companies to be innovative in developing their systems," McAlister said. "Then we built in a way to give industry the incentives to produce reliable and cost effective vehicles that could be used by private citizens as well as government astronauts."

With the effective shutdown by Congress of the U.S. Export-Import Bank — which traditionally has helped overseas carriers purchase planes — Boeing lost a key sales tool. Making matters worse, leasing companies have been hesitant to finance a plane with a dwindling customer base. So Boeing is now renting out the massive, hump-backed 747s to cargo carriers in countries such as Russia and Azerbaijan, which increases the company’s exposure to potential defaults on payments. Through the end of 2016, Boeing had provided financing valued at $1.26 billion to 747 customers through Boeing Capital Corp., regulatory filings show. That’s about a fivefold increase from the close of 2012. In fact, 747-related loans and operating leases now account for about one-quarter of the portfolio managed by Boeing’s lending arm. As the air-cargo market recovers, the strategy may pay off for Boeing. The manufacturer recently landed a crucial 747 order from UPS Inc. that could serve as a bridge to the future for the wide-body plane. But tomorrow’s 747 — a symbol of luxury travel when it made its debut with Pan-American World Airways in 1970 — most likely won’t be flying globe-trotting tourists. It instead will haul oversize cargo such as oil-drilling equipment as demand fades for bulky four-engine passenger carriers. UPS ranks No. 1 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest U.S. and Canadian for-hire carriers. “We believe in the long-term need for this aircraft,” said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flight Ascend Consultancy. “As long as they don’t overproduce, which Boeing aren’t doing at the current rate, we believe there will be long-term demand.” 1 2 3 Next >> By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg News Follow Transport Topics on RSS Twitter Facebook © 2017, Transport Topics, American Trucking Associations Inc.

The plane offers seating for up to 469 passengers. Two other foreign airlines plan to add similar service later this year. Credit: Sipa USA BIG BIRD COMING: The A380-800 offers seating for up to 469 passengers. prev next         comments British Airways’ delayed Airbus A380 flights to Logan International Airport are set to start tomorrow as the first regularly scheduled service to Boston aboard the world’s largest passenger airliner. The first of British Airways’ thrice-weekly flights of the 469-seat, double-decker, wide-body plane is expected to arrive from London’s Heathrow Airport around 1:30 p.m. The other flights will operate on Mondays and Fridays. British Airways’ A380-800 has four cabins, and its upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage. The plane has 50 percent more floor space and 60 percent more headroom than the Boeing 747-400, and its wings are 54 percent larger. The A380 measures 238 feet, 8 inches long, with a wingspan of 261 feet, 10 inches, and a height of 79 feet. British Airways had planned to begin its A380 Boston service in February, but postponed the start as work continued on its new passenger club lounge next to the gates in Logan’s Terminal E, where the A380s will arrive. The airline currently uses Boeing 747, 777 and 787 aircraft for the route. Logan has welcomed A380s in the past, but those flights were either diverted from other airports or occasional arrivals to change out planes. “We were accommodating them, but obviously it wasn’t the ideal situation,” said Thomas Glynn, CEO of the Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs Logan. A380 boarding and deplaning works better and faster when there are two jet bridges per plane rather than one, he added. But Massport recently added a pair of jet bridges to each of the three gates in Terminal E to accommodate the aircraft. The additions were among $186 million in Terminal E improvements that included reconfigured and expanded waiting areas. “We were approached by three different airlines several years ago about their interest in having the option of using the A380 either on a regular basis or on a periodic basis,” Glynn said. Emirates and Lufthansa are the other two airlines. Emirates, which flies between Boston and Dubai, tested Logan’s new A380 gate improvements on a one-off A380 flight in January at Massport’s invitation. The airline normally uses Boeing 777s for its Boston flights. “We wanted to make sure that everything works, and that everything lines up, and also that the ground crews are familiar with the new procedures,” Glynn said. Emirates and Lufthansa, which has flights to Germany (Frankfurt and Munich) from Boston, haven’t committed to starting dates for their A380 service to Logan, but Glynn expects them to begin this year.

(NYSE: BA): the costs to build a fleet of two new presidential planes designated as Air Force One need to come down. The Air Force has created a new position for a program executive officer for the Air Force One program, pinned another star on Brigadier General Duke Richardson’s shoulder, and named the new Major General to the new post. Richardson’s appointment comes following a review to finalize requirements for the Air Force One program ordered by Defense Secretary James Mattis. According to a report at Aviation Week, the Air Force “has made some changes to the requirements” that could lower the cost of the program. No specifics were given. Barely a month following his election in November, then President-elect Trump tweeted out his displeasure with what he said was the $4 billion cost of the Air Force One program. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the total project cost is $3.2 billion, of which $2.87 billion has been budgeted for research and development through 2021. Boeing has received only $170 million for development costs so far. The new planes, based on Boeing’s 747-8, are scheduled for delivery in 2024. An Air Force spokeswoman said that the service created the new two-star position in order to place the Air Force One program “under strong and effective senior general officer leadership.” Aviation Week calls Richardson, who has been the program officer for the KC-46A tanker program, an “apt choice.” Richardson also will continue with the tanker program until his replacement, Colonel Donna Shipton, assumes the role in early June. Richardson’s promotion and assignment to the Air Force One program indicate that the Air Force has gotten Trump’s message, sent even before he took office in January, that he expects costs for some defense programs to be watched carefully and reined in where possible. Putting a senior general officer in charge shows that the Air Force is playing toward the only audience it believes counts. No general officer wants to be the subject of a disapproving presidential tweet, nor does the Air Force, even for something as relatively reasonably priced as Air Force One.

The WGS-9 satellite was funded through an agreement between the United States and Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and New Zealand, and will also serve Australia (which funded the WGS-6 satellite). Each partner country gains access to the capabilities provided by the full WGS system, which include flexible and secure communication transmissions in the X and Ka-band frequencies. “This unique international collaboration increases military interoperability and expands affordable high-data-rate communications for U.S. and allied partners around the globe,” said Rico Attanasio, executive director, Boeing Department of Defense/Civil Satellite Programs. “WGS-9 is among the most capable military communication satellites on orbit today.” WGS-9 launched on a United Launch Alliance Delta IV rocket. Boeing is on contract for 10 WGS satellites, the last of which is tentatively scheduled for launch in 2018. The eighth, ninth and tenth WGS satellites include upgraded digital channelizers that nearly double the available bandwidth of earlier satellites in the series.

(Kevin P. Casey/Bloomberg News) Boeing Co. has a temporary plan to save the iconic but slow-selling 747 jumbo jetliner: buying its own planes and leasing them to cargo haulers. With the effective shutdown by Congress of the U.S. Export-Import Bank -- which traditionally has helped overseas carriers purchase planes -- Boeing lost a key sales tool. Making matters worse, leasing companies have been hesitant to finance a plane with a dwindling customer base.  So Boeing is now renting out the massive, hump-backed 747s to cargo carriers in countries such as Russia and Azerbaijan, which increases the company’s exposure to potential defaults on payments. Through the end of last year, Boeing had provided financing valued at $1.26 billion to 747 customers through Boeing Capital Corp., regulatory filings show. That’s about a fivefold increase from the close of 2012. In fact, 747-related loans and operating leases now account for about one-quarter of the portfolio managed by Boeing’s lending arm. As the air-cargo market recovers, the strategy may pay off for Boeing. The manufacturer recently landed a crucial 747 order from United Parcel Service Inc. that could serve as a bridge to the future for the wide-body plane. But tomorrow’s 747 -- a symbol of luxury travel when it made its debut with Pan-American World Airways in 1970 -- most likely won’t be flying globe-trotting tourists. It will instead haul oversize cargo like oil-drilling equipment as demand fades for bulky four-engine passenger carriers. “We believe in the long-term need for this aircraft,” said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flight Ascend Consultancy. “As long as they don’t over-produce, which Boeing aren’t doing at the current rate, we believe there will be long-term demand.” Boeing recorded more than $2.1 billion in losses on the 747-8, the latest version, in 2015 and 2016 as it slowed production to keep pace with dwindling sales. The company received a big boost last year when UPS ordered 14 of the jumbo freighters and took options that would double the original order size. The sale was the largest Boeing has landed for the redesigned 747 since November 2007, according to the manufacturer’s website. Read more: Boeing’s 747 snags $5.3 billion lifeline from UPS It’s unusual -- and risky -- for a planemaker to buy and lease its own product on a large scale. If the cargo carriers default or don’t renew operating leases, it would be Boeing Capital’s responsibility to line up other customers, a challenge in a niche market. If the plane experiences a greater-than-expected decline in value, Boeing’s earnings or cash flow could be “materially adversely affected,” according to the filing. Boeing’s shares were little changed at $177.56 in New York Wednesday. They have gained 14 percent this year through Tuesday’s close. Stepping In It’s also a shift for Boeing Capital, which has whittled down its loan portfolio by two-thirds from $12.2 billion at the start of 2004 as the unit shed its ambitions of becoming Boeing’s answer to GE Capital. Since selling the General Electric Co. unit a $2 billion commercial loan portfolio in 2004, Boeing Capital has focused on supporting the company’s aircraft sales and managing a portfolio of loans and operating leases aimed primarily at out-of-production aircraft. The recent spate of 747-related operating leases isn’t a reversal of that strategy, Timothy Myers, president of Boeing Capital, said in an interview. His division stepped in to close the 747 deals after a financier had difficulty lining up equity, Myers said. With cargo traffic growing, he expects to find buyers for those aircraft. “We are in the process of doing that right now: offloading some of those transactions that we’ve done in the past,” Myers said. “This year most likely there will be multiple parties taking those assets.” The Export-Import Bank has been dubbed the “Bank of Boeing” for the backing it has given to aircraft purchases by foreign carriers unable to tap conventional credit markets. But it’s been blocked from providing loan guarantees of more than $10 million because it lacks a board member whose nomination has been stuck in a Senate committee since 2015. Conservative Republicans are opposed to the agency’s mission. “We may step in and support a few more deliveries,” Myers said. “But what we’re trying to do is find more third-party financiers to do that.” ‘Too Big’ Uncertainty over the global economy and freighter demand are complicating that task. Nippon Cargo Airlines parent Nippon Yusen KK announced March 24 that it was canceling its final two orders of the 747 freighter variant, which has a list price of $387.5 million. Although buyers typically negotiate steep discounts, it was “just too big, too expensive,” said Neel Jones Shah, a consultant who formerly headed cargo operations for Delta Air lines Inc. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up While the four-engine 747 is one of the best-selling jets in Boeing’s history, the latest version has struggled to gain sales as airlines shift to more-efficient twin-engine aircraft for long-range flying. The planemaker had a backlog of just 26 unfilled orders through the end of February, 19 of them freighter models, while its order tally for the year stands at two cancellations. There are also five “white tails” -- the nickname for jets built without an airline buyer -- taped up and sitting in storage. Boeing’s shares were little changed at $177.56 in New York Wednesday. They gained 14 percent this year through Tuesday, the third-biggest advance among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To market analysts like George Hamlin, the UPS order is a sign of more deals to come, barring a global recession or other market turmoil. That deal alone could keep Boeing’s 747 in production for another four years. A generation of older air freighters will soon need to be retired, and the Boeing jumbo has standout technology, from its fuel-efficient engines to nose that flips open to load oversize freight, said the Hamlin Transportation Consulting president. “UPS is a bellwether or bell cow, whatever term you want to use,” said Hamlin, a former Airbus Group SE executive. “In the intervening time period with UPS bridging the gap, it’s possible other orders may appear.” Global air freight in January increased by 6.9 percent from a year earlier, down from the 10 percent growth in December but far outpacing the 3 percent average annual pace recorded over the past five years, according to the International Air Transport Association, an aviation trade group. “The 747-8’s future is closely tied to the cargo market, and we’re keeping a close eye on that segment as it continues to show signs of improvement,” said Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president for marketing.

Gen. Duke Richardson, program executive officer for tankers at the U.S. Air Force, has been promoted to the rank of major general and has been appointed PEO to oversee the Air Force One replacement program, Aviation Week reported Tuesday. Lara Seligman writes Richardson’s appointment came months after President Donald Trump raised concerns about the cost of the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program and called for the cancellation of the contract with Boeing to build two new 747-8 planes through a Twitter post. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg soon met with Trump and said that the company will work to build the next pair of presidential aircraft for less than $4 billion. Ann Stefanek, a spokesman for the Air Force, said Richardson will continue to serve as PEO for tankers until June when Col. Donna Shipton succeeds him in the role. As PEO for tankers, Richardson oversees planning and implementation of lifecycle activities for the service branch’s fleet of Boeing-built KC-46 Pegasus, KC-135 and KC-10 tanker aircraft. The 34-year Air Force veteran previously served as director of logistics and sustainment at the Air Force Materiel Command and vice commander of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. Richardson was tapped in 2009 to serve as PEO for fixed wing under the U.S. Special Operations Command and became PEO for fighters and bombers in 2011. His appointment comes nearly a year after the service branch issued Boeing a potential $127.3 million contract modification to continue to provide risk reduction support for the PAR program.

By Nandini Krishnamoorthy Updated March 29, 2017 06:13 BST Close Watch a Boeing passenger jet going up in flames at Peru airport Reuters A Boeing jet went up in flames upon landing at an airport near the Andean town of Jauja in central Peru on Tuesday (28 March) after it veered off course on the runway. All 141 people on board the Peruvian Airlines flight were evacuated safely before the fire spread to the fuselage. No serious injuries were reported, Reuters cited a government minister as saying. The right wing of the Boeing 737-300 scraped the runway, which may have triggered the fire, Peruvian Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio said. The incident occurred as the plane made a scheduled landing at Francisco Carle Airport, a high-altitude airport, which is located about 165 miles (265km) east of the capital city, Lima. Authorities are investigating to determine the cause of the fire. "The plane couldn't stop on the runway and they made a manoeuvre to stop it with the wing and that appears to have caused the fire," Basombrio said. Photos and videos from the scene showed the aircraft engulfed in flames and several firefighters trying to extinguish the fire as thick black smoke billowed towards the sky. A spokesman for Peruvian Airlines, Alberto Lopez, said it was not a crash. "The plane did not crash, it landed and then the fire was produced once the plane was on the ground but the exact cause of fire will be explained once the investigation has been completed," ABC News cited Lopez as saying.

This is the first multi-year agreement for the Apache “E” variant. The army will receive 244 remanufactured Apaches while 24 new ones will go to the international customer. "This agreement is great news for our army, our soldiers, the American taxpayers, our industry partners and numerous international partners,” said U.S. Army Col. Joseph Hoecherl, the Apache project manager. “It is a direct result of the professional dedication and diligent efforts by government and industry teammates to provide the much needed capabilities of the world's best attack helicopter - the AH-64E Apache - at a fair and affordable price that results in year over year savings to the taxpayer. In the hands of our trained U.S. soldiers, the Apache's technologies and resulting capabilities are essential to army operations around the globe." Boeing builds the Apache in Mesa, Ariz. Deliveries of the “E” model began in October 2011. Seven customers outside the U.S. have ordered this variant. Including this latest version, the U.S. and 15 other countries have relied on the Apache during the past three decades. “The Apache has made a tremendous impact in the defense of the nations that have flown it for the last 37 years,” said Kim Smith, Boeing Attack Helicopters vice president and program manager. “Our team understands the responsibility we have to deliver the best aircraft on time at an affordable price every day, and we are committed to maintaining that well established tradition of excellence.” See other recent news regarding: Boeing, Apache, Helicopters.

A Boeing jet operated by Peruvian Airlines caught fire on Tuesday while landing at an airport near the Andean town of Jauja in central Peru after it swerved on the runway, but there were no serious injuries, a government minister said. Peruvian Airlines said in a statement that the Boeing 737-300 jet drove off the runway for unspecified reasons during the scheduled landing, after swerving to the right. It said that all 141 people on board the flight, which originated in Lima, were evacuated safely. Authorities are investigating the incident, which occurred about 4:30 p.m., involving the Boeing 737-300 jet at the high-altitude airport in an agricultural valley some 265 kilometers from Lima, the capital. The fire likely started when the wing scraped the runway, Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio said. "The plane couldn't stop on the runway and they made a maneuver to stop it with the wing and that appears to have caused the fire," Basombrio told reporters on local broadcaster RPP. Television images showed a large cloud of black smoke streaming from an airliner in flames. Boeing said it was aware of the reports of the incident and was gathering information.   For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in. ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.     # Peru# Boeing# Peruvian Airlines   Suggested Stories Recommended Watch Right Now Top Takes NEWS INDIA WORLD PHOTOS CRICKET MOVIES AUTO SPORTS LIFESTYLE TECH EDUCATION BUSINESS SITEMAP Copyright © 2017 Living Media India Limited.

(photo credit:JPOST STAFF) LIMA, March 28 - A Boeing jet operated by Peruvian Airlines caught fire on Tuesday while landing at an airport near the Andean town of Jauja in central Peru after it swerved on the runway, but there were no serious injuries, a government minister said. Peruvian Airlines said in a statement that the Boeing 737-300 jet drove off the runway for unspecified reasons during the scheduled landing, after swerving to the right. It said that all 141 people on board the flight, which originated in Lima, were evacuated safely. Authorities are investigating the incident, which occurred about 4:30 p.m., involving the Boeing 737-300 jet at the high-altitude airport in an agricultural valley some 265 kilometers from Lima, the capital. The fire likely started when the wing scraped the runway, Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio said. "The plane couldn't stop on the runway and they made a maneuver to stop it with the wing and that appears to have caused the fire," Basombrio told reporters on local broadcaster RPP. Television images showed a large cloud of black smoke streaming from an airliner in flames. Boeing said it was aware of the reports of the incident and was gathering information.

PetersonThe Associated Press The historical significance of Oregon's return to the Final Four was not lost on coach Dana Altman. The Ducks face North Carolina in the national semifinals in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday. Oregon hasn't been this close to the title game since the team won the inaugural NCAA Tournament in 1939. Altman called it "a long drought." Perhaps one that could end this season after 78 years? The Oregon Webfoots won the NCAA title with a 46-33 victory over Ohio State at Northwestern University. The team would become known by the nickname the Tall Firs — a nod to both the Oregon landscape and the fact that the players loomed taller than most of their opponents. The Webfoots' front line included 6-foot-4 John Dick, 6-foot-4 leading scorer Laddie Gale and 6-foot-8 Urgel (Slim) Wintermute. Guards Bobby Anet, a 5-foot-8 playmaker, and 5-foot-10 Wally Johansen rounded out the starting five. Anet and Johansen grew up on the same street in Astoria, Oregon, and had played together since junior high. Coach Howard Hobson told The Associated Press in 1988 that Anet, who passed away in 1981, was the heart of the Tall Firs. "He was the greatest floor general I ever had," said Hobson, who also coached at Yale and was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1965. "He sparked the team. He was its leader." Dick went on to serve 32 years in the U.S. Navy, enlisting the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and rising to the rank of rear admiral. He was at the final game played at Oregon's famed McArthur Court in 2011, and pumped his fist for the crowd when he was announced at halftime. He died later that year. Reserve guard Ford "Moon" Mullen went on to play baseball in the majors for the Philadelphia Blue Jays (Phillies) in 1944. Wintermute worked at Boeing. On the way to the first Big Dance , the Tall Firs won the Northern Division of the Pacific Coast Conference, then beat Southern Division champion California in a three-game series. The victory sent Oregon to the regional tournament on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, where the team beat Texas, 56-41, and Oklahoma, 55-37, before heading to Illinois for the title game via train. The eight-team NCAA Tournament was founded by the National Association of Basketball Coaches to compete with the National Invitation Tournament in New York. Denver-based writer Terry Frei, who grew up in Eugene and is the son of former Oregon football coach Jerry Frei, wrote a book about the Tall Firs called "March 1939: before the Madness." "They were so well-coached and they were big along the front line — almost revolutionarily big — and they had racehorse guards, especially the captain guard Bobby Anet, who kept everything in control," Frei said. "So I think it was a real complementary chemistry-type team far ahead of its time that way." Dick led all scorers with 13 points in the championship game against the Big Ten champions before maybe 5,000 fans, many of whom were given free tickets. Fans in Eugene listened to the game on the radio — it was the same year John Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath" was published and that "Gone with the Wind" came out in theaters — then later descended by the thousands at the local train station to welcome back the team. "They were largely for the most part small-town boys. Laddie Gale was from Oakridge, two of the starters were from Astoria, Slim Wintermute was from Longview, Washington, and John Dick was from The Dalles," Frei said. "So there was a small-town feel to the team, small-town heroes who stepped up big." Frei noted with a laugh that the players got $2 from a kitty to celebrate following the victory. Several of them took a train from the Northwestern campus into Chicago. "I think some of us had a couple of Heinekens or something," Frei quoted Anet as saying later. "It was quite late and none of us were big on bars or things like that, mainly because nobody ever had any money." Third-seeded Oregon, which last year advanced to the Elite Eight before falling to Oklahoma, defeated No. 1 seed Kansas 74-60 on Saturday to advance to the Final Four. North Carolina beat Kentucky 75-73. In the other semifinal, Gonzaga faces South Carolina. Altman believes this Oregon team is building its own historic legacy. "The seven years we've been at Oregon we've had great guys to work with. I feel great for those guys that our staff had a relationship with, but I also feel good for all the other players that have built Oregon basketball; 1939 is a long drought, but there are a lot of guys that played and built some tradition at Oregon," Altman said.

LOUIS COUNTY, MO (KPLR) – Viewer video of a large plane flying low over north St. Louis County attracted great interest from residents across the metropolitan area. After a day spent making calls and tracking the aircraft, Fox 2 News has solved the mystery. Blannie Wagner, who sent the video to Fox 2, said she’d never heard something so loud. Wagner was inside her home Monday around 9 p.m. when the walls began shaking. She lives just a few miles from St. Louis-Lambert Airport, so she’s used to hearing planes fly overhead, but this was different. "I’ve got some experience with aircraft, but I’m no expert,” Wagner said. “I can judge altitude and it was definitely startling.” Our news room made calls to Lambert, Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration, Whitman Air Force Base, and Scott Air Force Base, and we tracked down an answer. The large plane was a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, a military aerial refueling plane. A public affairs spokesperson for Scott Air Force Base said the aircraft was practicing touchdowns and takeoffs. The plane started at Scott, flew to Lambert, and then went back to Scott. This particular KC-135 tanker belongs to the National Guard. It stands 41-feet high and 136-feet long, with a wing span of about 130-feet. With four turbofan engines, it’s certainly loud enough to startle anyone not expecting it, which is why so many north county residents were concerned.

STOCKHOLM (Sputnik) – The contract was signed by US charge d'affaires James DeHart at the US Embassy in Oslo and Norway's defense procurement chief Mette Sorfonden. "A contract was signed today with US authorities on the acquisition of five P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) for the Armed Forces," the statement read. The first P-8A Poseidon is scheduled to land in Norway in 2022, with the rest following by 2023. The Boeing-built aircraft is designed for long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, and reconnaissance missions. © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

see what the Dow was worth the year you were born. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed 21,000 points for the first time ever on March 1. The milestone was achieved only 24 trading days after the Dow first reached 20,000. The only time in history the Dow passed a 1,000 point milestone in as few days was during the dot-com boom. The DJIA is a price-weighted average of 30 large American companies. Fluctuations in the Dow often reflect overall market conditions. In addition, because it is one of the oldest market indices, it is regularly used to compare markets over time. 24/7 Wall St. determined the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average each year since 1929, the first full year the index contained 30 companies. The companies comprising the Dow are picked by the editors of The Wall Street Journal as Charles Dow, the creator of the index, was also the founding editor of the publication. Since its inception in 1896, when only 12 companies comprised the average, the Dow has changed 51 times. The index currently contains companies such as Walmart, Disney, J.P. Morgan, Boeing, and the newest member as of 2015, Apple. The only company remaining from the original list of 12 is General Electric. Like the economy as a whole, the stock market is much larger today than it was in 1917. However, the Dow has experienced extreme swings over the course of its history. One of the most notable events in the history of the often-referenced index is the lows during the Great Depression. The Dow started 1929 at an inflation-adjusted level of 4,274.94 points. In October of that year, the Dow lost nearly one-quarter of its value in just two days. The Dow reached its lowest point on July 8, 1932, with an adjusted value of 725.90 points -- only 17% of its value at the start of 1929. After the historic low, the Dow soared by close to 70% in 1933, the largest single year growth in the history of the Dow 30. Still, the Dow did not return to its pre-Great Depression level until the mid 1950s. There have been several more dramatic stock market swings since the Great Depression. The largest single day drop in the index's history occurred during a stock market crash on October 19, 1987, when the Dow plunged 22.6%. The Dow's value doubled between 1995 and 1999 during the dot-com boom, only to collapse between 2000 and 2002. Relatively soon after, the Dow lost nearly a third of its value in 2008, after the financial crisis emerged in the summer of 2007. To determine the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the daily Dow figures aggregated by economic research website MeasuringWorth.com.

Sen. Roy Blunt, left, said that the additional fiscal 2017 funding for Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets as well as ships, missiles and troops should not be considered while lawmakers wrangle over passing 2017 appropriations bills or an omnibus budget before current federal spending authority expires April 28. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Senate could put off Trump's $30 billion defense boost until at least May By Travis J. Tritten (@Travis_Tritten) • 3/29/17 1:36 PM Travis Tritten Defense Writer The Washington Examiner Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Senate Republicans may delay until May the Trump administration's requested $30 billion supplemental boost in defense spending while Congress works to keep the government funded through the fall, according to a top lawmaker. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., told the Washington Examiner that the additional fiscal 2017 funding for Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets as well as ships, missiles and troops should not be considered while lawmakers wrangle over passing 2017 appropriations bills or an omnibus budget before current federal spending authority expires April 28. The supplemental request may be a heavy political lift either way — it faces opposition from Democrats because it cuts domestic programs and could break federal spending caps — and a reluctance by Republicans to take it on now could push consideration into May or later. "I think that the best way to get [fiscal year 2017] done is to do FY17, which includes defense … and then deal with the supplemental as a separate issue," said Blunt, who sits among Republican leadership and is a member of the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee. A $578 billion defense appropriations bill passed the House this month and could soon be taken up by the Senate. It would keep the Defense Department funded through September. The $30 billion supplemental request would provide an additional $25 billion for baseline spending and about $5 billion for the overseas war budget, which includes the fight against the Islamic State. The money would buy two dozen F/A-18 Super Hornets. The Navy and Marine Corps told the House Tuesday they may now have a shortfall of 100 aircraft and that about half of the two fleets are not ready to fly due to aging and a lack of spare parts. Nearly $14 billion of the request would go to modernizing aircraft, ships and missiles, according to Reuters. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., also a member of the appropriations subcommittee, said he believes the chamber should "deal with regular order first" before taking up the supplemental request, but said the scheduling decision will ultimately be made by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan. Also from the Washington Examiner Obamacare uncertainty could force insurers out of the marketplaces Insurers may be forced to leave Obamacare markets or dramatically increase premiums if they don't get answers soon. By Robert King • 03/30/17 12:30 AM "I don't see [the supplemental] at the moment being done by April but things change around this place," Shelby said. Democrats blasted the request during a hearing of the defense appropriations subcommittee this month, especially for a provision calling for $18 billion in domestic program cuts to offset the new spending. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the top Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee, said Wednesday he still has concerns about the request and is uncertain about its future in the Senate following Blunt's comments about a possible delay. "I've heard so many variations on that theme from my Republican colleagues," Durbin said. "The supplemental of course not only increases money for the military, it makes substantial cuts in non-defense programs like medical research, so it's not without controversy." Also from the Washington Examiner Air Force secretary nominee to face questions over contractor payments Air Force secretary nominee Wilson may have to explain $450k in contractor payments.

The Air Force has been breaking barriers since 1947 and the successful WGS-9 launch marks an important occasion for the Wideband constellation as it is a major milestone in a 20-year multilateral partnership. (Courtesy photo/ULA)  see less | View Image Page COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, UNITED STATES 03.29.2017 Story by Senior Airman Arielle Vasquez  50th Space Wing ✔ ✗ Subscribe 0 The 3rd Space Operations Squadron, along with various partners, witnessed the launch of the ninth Wideband Global SATCOM, which occurred March 18, 2017, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. WGS-9 will join eight other WGS satellites, marking another milestone in providing additional communications capabilities to both U.S. forces and international partners. WGS provides real-time data exchange necessary for tactical communications and supports a wide variety of missions for combatant commanders. “The men and women of 3 SOPS are thrilled to be welcoming a new member to our on-orbit family,” said Lt Col Joshua Brooks, 3 SOPS commander. “WGS-9 is the next to last of the planned satellites in the Wideband Global SATCOM constellation, and will continue to improve and increase the United States Air Force and U.S. ability to provide global communications to U.S. and allied warfighters world-wide.” In January 2012, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and New Zealand signed a multilateral Memorandum of Understanding with the United States, agreeing to fund the procurement of the ninth WGS satellite. The United States is responsible for funding the launch, operation and sustainment of WGS-9. International partners will receive a proportional share of the bandwidth provided by the WGS constellation based on financial contribution. 3 SOPS will be heavily involved in the post launch processes, to include, post launch testing, early orbit commanding, payload characterization and verification and orbital relocation. “Once the satellite is launched, it must go through several stages before obtaining its operational orbit, which will be a geosynchronous orbit,” said 1st Lt. Travis Perry, 3 SOPS WGS engineering officer. “A geosynchronous orbit is a circular orbit extending approximately 22,000 miles above the Earth’s equator. The process of launch and early orbit is overseen by Boeing and will take approximately 120 days, after which Boeing will hand over the satellite to 3 SOPS.” Perry will join other engineers in Hawaii to conduct Payload Characterization and Verification tests. After four weeks of testing the satellite, it will be relocated from the test location to an operational location. Perry and other 3 SOPS WGS engineers will command this relocation process from Schriever AFB. “Working on the payload portion of the spacecraft as we prepare to put it into operational use will be a challenge for me,” said Perry. “Our expertise here in 3 SOPS is the platform portion of the spacecraft, but this extra challenge makes the assignment all the more satisfying.” A team from 3 SOPS has deployed to Boeing Mission Control Center, located in Los Angeles El Segundo, California, to command and control the satellite during launch and early orbit. Matching the recently launched WGS-8, WGS-9 also includes the new state-of-the-art wideband digital channelizer that will increase communication capacity for the warfighter by approximately 45 percent compared to the first seven WGS satellites. The next WGS satellite is currently being built by Boeing in El Segundo, and will bring the WGS constellation to a total of 10 satellites on orbit when launched. “What’s rewarding is seeing 3 SOPS work hand-in-hand with partners from SMC, Boeing and the 45th Space Wing to bring this to fruition,” said Brooks. “This process has run so smoothly that there has been very few difficulties. It's all part of living the dream of being involved with an amazing group of people, and working together to put an object in space which will help us defend the nation.” LEAVE A COMMENT NEWS INFO Date Taken: 03.29.2017 Date Posted: 03.29.2017 15:00 Story ID: 228491 Location: COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, US  Web Views: 13 Downloads: 0 Podcast Hits: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN   This work, WGS-9 satellite launches from Florida, by SrA Arielle Vasquez, identified by DVIDS, is free of known copyright restrictions under U.S. copyright law.

His State of the Union speech on February 28 made only one fleeting vague comment about space, stating that "American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream." And though in the past he has expressed enthusiastic support for space exploration, and his transition team has indicated a preference for private commercial space plus a desire to return to the Moon, no specific details about their policy have been released. Determining future American space policy, however, is really not that difficult. All Trump has to do is to look at the numbers. The dueling manned space policy objectives of Congress and President Obama since 2010 has forced NASA to follow a two-pronged approach to manned space, and a comparison of these two approaches provides stark empirical evidence for determining the most effective approach for putting Americans in space. The first approach is centered on the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion capsule. This program, strongly supported by Congress, has followed the traditional approach used first during the 1960s. The President makes a Kennedy-like speech outlining some specific target in space that NASA must reach by some set deadline. For Kennedy, the target was the Moon and the deadline was the end of the decade. For George Bush in 2004 the target was the Moon and beyond and the deadline was 2015. For Barack Obama, the target was first an asteroid by 2020s, and then Mars by the 2030s. NASA then takes over, designing the mission, the rockets, and the spaceships, all based upon those specific presidential targets and deadlines. Since 2006 NASA has been building Orion and the rockets that will launch it, initially the Ares rocket under Bush and now SLS under Obama, in order to tackle the ambitious space proposals of these two presidents. The second approach, begun during the Bush administration and continued aggressively by Obama, is entirely different. In its need to provide cargo and crew to ISS, NASA stepped back from running the show and instead became a mere customer. SpaceX, Orbital ATK, and Sierra Nevada were hired to build and launch competing unmanned cargo freighters while SpaceX and Boeing were hired to build and launch competing manned capsules. Under this commercial program, NASA designed nothing, and the rockets and spaceships it is buying are owned entirely by the private companies, built not only to serve NASA's needs but also as products the companies can sell to others for profit. (SpaceX's announcement on February 27 that they plan to send two paying tourists around the Moon by 2018 is a perfect example of this.) A comparison of these two approaches, as shown in the table below, is quite striking and provides all the information that President Trump needs to set future American space policy. The comparison also proves that the old way of doing business, a big government-built centralized space program, is simply not a viable approach.                 flight    flight     development   total Program         capsules  rockets    time          cost --------------------------------------------------------------- Ares/SLS/Orion  3         2          15-17 years   $43 billion Commercial space           42        42         5-9 years     $12 billion Essentially, commercial space is building more than ten times the number of capsules and rockets in about half the time for about 25% of the cost. Why has private commercial space been so much more productive? Obviously, the goals for Ares/SLS/Orion are far more ambitious, and therefore more difficult and expensive. Still, the Apollo capsule and the Saturn V rocket had similar goals, and it took NASA about half as long to build each. The 1960s space program cost more, but it had never been built before, and the cost included the entire program and all infrastructure. The cost of Ares/SLS/Orion only includes the first launch, and practically none of the necessary infrastructure. Other factors must explain why Ares/SLS/Orion has been so ineffective. First, NASA's contractual approach for these two programs is very different. The commercial contracts are simpler and fixed price, with payments only made when companies reached specific milestones. This encourages fast and efficient construction, because any delays or cost increases are the responsibility of the companies. For Ares/SLS/Orion, NASA used its traditional and complicated cost-plus contract, where NASA picks up the tab should there be any delays or cost overruns. Thus, the companies involved have had no incentive to save money or time. Second, because NASA did no design work for the commercial contracts, its overhead was relatively low, somewhere between 5% to 34% of the program's total cost. With Ares/SLS/Orion, however, overhead costs ranged from 56% to 72%. Essentially the government paid twice for Ares/SLS/Orion, once when NASA's labor force designed it, and then again when the agency hired contractors to do the work. Finally, and most important, the private companies OWN their rockets and COMPETE to sell them. With Ares/SLS/Orion, ownership resides solely with NASA, which is focused on political goals unconnected to profit or cost savings. With the commercial program, ownership forces efficiency and innovation. SpaceX for example built the Falcon 9 rocket to launch its cargo capsule, but they also built it to grab market share in the global satellite industry. To make sure their launch prices were low enough to attract customers, SpaceX had to design the rocket quickly, simply, and with cost in mind.

The Ducks face North Carolina in the national semifinals in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday. Oregon hasn’t been this close to the title game since the team won the inaugural NCAA Tournament in 1939. Altman called it ”a long drought.” Perhaps one that could end this season after 78 years? The Oregon Webfoots won the NCAA title with a 46-33 victory over Ohio State at Northwestern University. The team would become known by the nickname the Tall Firs – a nod to both the Oregon landscape and the fact that the players loomed taller than most of their opponents. The Webfoots’ front line included 6-foot-4 John Dick, 6-foot-4 leading scorer Laddie Gale and 6-foot-8 Urgel (Slim) Wintermute. Guards Bobby Anet, a 5-foot-8 playmaker, and 5-foot-10 Wally Johansen rounded out the starting five. Anet and Johansen grew up on the same street in Astoria, Oregon, and had played together since junior high. Coach Howard Hobson told The Associated Press in 1988 that Anet, who passed away in 1981, was the heart of the Tall Firs. ”He was the greatest floor general I ever had,” said Hobson, who also coached at Yale and was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1965. ”He sparked the team. He was its leader.” Dick went on to serve 32 years in the U.S. Navy, enlisting the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and rising to the rank of rear admiral. He was at the final game played at Oregon’s famed McArthur Court in 2011, and pumped his fist for the crowd when he was announced at halftime. He died later that year. Reserve guard Ford ”Moon” Mullen went on to play baseball in the majors for the Philadelphia Blue Jays (Phillies) in 1944. Wintermute worked at Boeing. On the way to the first Big Dance, the Tall Firs won the Northern Division of the Pacific Coast Conference, then beat Southern Division champion California in a three-game series. The victory sent Oregon to the regional tournament on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, where the team beat Texas, 56-41, and Oklahoma, 55-37, before heading to Illinois for the title game via train. The eight-team NCAA Tournament was founded by the National Association of Basketball Coaches to compete with the National Invitation Tournament in New York. Denver-based writer Terry Frei, who grew up in Eugene and is the son of former Oregon football coach Jerry Frei, wrote a book about the Tall Firs called ”March 1939: before the Madness.” ”They were so well-coached and they were big along the front line – almost revolutionarily big – and they had racehorse guards, especially the captain guard Bobby Anet, who kept everything in control,” Frei said. ”So I think it was a real complementary chemistry-type team far ahead of its time that way.” Dick led all scorers with 13 points in the championship game against the Big Ten champions before maybe 5,000 fans, many of whom were given free tickets. Fans in Eugene listened to the game on the radio – it was the same year John Steinbeck’s ”Grapes of Wrath” was published and that ”Gone with the Wind” came out in theaters – then later descended by the thousands at the local train station to welcome back the team. ”They were largely for the most part small-town boys. Laddie Gale was from Oakridge, two of the starters were from Astoria, Slim Wintermute was from Longview, Washington, and John Dick was from The Dalles,” Frei said. ”So there was a small-town feel to the team, small-town heroes who stepped up big.” Frei noted with a laugh that the players got $2 from a kitty to celebrate following the victory. Several of them took a train from the Northwestern campus into Chicago. ”I think some of us had a couple of Heinekens or something,” Frei quoted Anet as saying later. ”It was quite late and none of us were big on bars or things like that, mainly because nobody ever had any money.” Third-seeded Oregon, which last year advanced to the Elite Eight before falling to Oklahoma, defeated No. 1 seed Kansas 74-60 on Saturday to advance to the Final Four. North Carolina beat Kentucky 75-73. In the other semifinal, Gonzaga faces South Carolina. Altman believes this Oregon team is building its own historic legacy. ”The seven years we’ve been at Oregon we’ve had great guys to work with. I feel great for those guys that our staff had a relationship with, but I also feel good for all the other players that have built Oregon basketball; 1939 is a long drought, but there are a lot of guys that played and built some tradition at Oregon,” Altman said. — For more information on Terry Frei’s book: www.terryfrei.com/madness.html — AP Sports Writer Bob Baum contributed to this report. — More AP college basketball: http://collegebasketball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-Top25 — Follow Anne M.

According to the Associated Press, the fake news claimed that photos of a newly redesigned Air Force One for President Trump being spread around are not new Air Force One photos. Instead, they are only concept photos of what a luxury aircraft could look like. The Associated Press credits the websites usanewsflash.com and freedomdaily.com with spreading the fake news about President Trump’s new Air Force One plane, with claims that Air Force One now looks as fancy and opulent as Mr. Trump’s gold apartment in New York’s Trump Tower. However, the photos of the “new Air Force One” plane are actually from Greenpoint Technologies, out of Kirkland, Washington. The Associated Press actually got in touch with Christine Hadley, a Greenpoint spokeswoman, who reported that the photos of the so-called new Air Force One plane are not actually of Air Force One but are “conceptual renderings only, not for one specific customer.” [Image by Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Images] That hasn’t stopped Facebook pages like Politics Insider from posting a video of what they claim is the “new Boeing jet that will be Air Force One,” and enticing their viewers to “take a tour of the $367 million jet that will soon be called Air Force One.” The fake news story from freedomdaily.com claimed the following, which incorrectly claimed that President Trump redesigned the Air Force One plane. “The contract was up on Barack Obama’s Air Force One with the expiration of his presidency. While that was just a chance of timing, President Trump stepped in to not only renegotiate the exorbitant cost of the aircraft, which came in millions higher than necessary but also took advantage of the renegotiation to make some much-needed changes to the new design. These possible changes weren’t revealed to the public until today and as soon as his plans for the new plane rolled out in public view, everyone immediately noticed one thing that has liberals losing their minds more than before. Being the leader of the most powerful nation in the world comes at a great cost, some of which is at the hands of your own citizens. For that reason, the vehicles that transport our Commander-in-Chief need to be specially equipped to do so safely, especially to protect against angry imbeciles who will stop at nothing to get a ‘winning’ round off as the martyr for the liberal movement.” After going on to rail against “leftist psychopaths,” the fake news story claims that the new Air Force One will go on to benefit other leaders in the future. The Air Force One plane’s accommodations will benefit future presidents, claims the fake news story about Mr. Trump’s new Air Force One, which the fake story says is fit for a king or queen. [Image by Lynne Sladky/AP Images] The article touched on President Trump’s negotiation skills and claims that former President Barack Obama didn’t negotiate such fancy accommodations in the new Air Force One plane. The fake story claimed that Mr. Trump’s new Air Force One aircraft should have twice the amount of protection than previous and old Air Force One planes. The story claimed that “liberals” would likely freak out over the cost of the new Air Force One plane. Comments surrounding the fake news story about President Trump and the alleged new Air Force One plane show some people believing and spreading the fake news, along with comments about Mr. Trump deserving such a great plane.

Sign up here. After Donald Trump won the presidential election, there were a number of stories about how companies were in a defensive crouch and hoping to avoid any attention from the incoming administration.  That's because when Trump tweeted about an enterprise, from Boeing to the musical "Hamilton," there were consequences. The fear of Trump's tweets was great enough that some West Coast public relations firms had staff monitoring the president's early morning missives so they could promptly respond if the president decided to target a client. Advertisement But now there's a shift underway. Instead of waiting to respond to Trump's tweets, companies and public relations executives appear to be planning a different strategy -- offense. Although it's hard to know for sure, it's appearing increasingly likely that some companies are leveraging the president's large social media presence -- 27 million Twitter followers -- to promote their interests.  And if the news is that your company is hiring in the US, Trump, it appears, will be happy to oblige. Get Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here On Tuesday, for example, Trump tweeted about Ford Motor Company making investments in Michigan plants and “JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!” Moments later, Ford issued a press release explaining what Trump meant, specifically $1.2 billion in investments in three plants and 130 new jobs. Earlier this month, Trump tweeted about an increased investment from ExxonMobil in the gulf and the creation of jobs. This tweet came just moments after the company sent out a press release. (That the investments actually began in 2013 was apparently beside the point.)  Some companies have gone even further to coordinate with the White House. Intel and Charter Communications each announced the creation of jobs alongside Trump in the Oval Office. Trump tweeted about both events. Advertisement To be clear, other presidents have coordinated major jobs announcements with US company leaders. It's notable now, with Trump, because so many business leaders were initially hesitant, even fearful, of how the president might portray them on Twitter.  But their new marriage makes sense: Trump wants to tout positive economic news, and company executives know they get more publicity by going through the president.  James Pindell can be reached at james.pindell@globe.com.

The ceremony was attended by Admiral Sunil Lanba, Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM), Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM), ADC Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral HCS Bisht, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command, serving and retired officers and men, who have served in the INAS 312 and other senior officials from the Navy as well as from civil administration. Speaking on the occasion, Admiral Sunil Lanba lauded the stellar role played by TU142M aircraft in the defence of the country as a Maritime Reconnaissance and Airborne ASW aircraft. He recollected the crucial role played by the Squadron in Operation Cactus in Maldives, where fleeing mercenaries were detected and tracked till they were apprehended by Indian warships. The Admiral also mentioned the maiden participation by TU's as the first Indian Naval Aircraft in the Republic Day fly past at New Delhi on Jan 26, 1999. He also acknowledged the professionalism of the pilots, the maintainers and all those personnel associated with flying and maintaining the aircraft in peak efficiency during their service. "The rich legacy of the Squadron would continue as the baton is being passed on to the proud crew of the worthy successors viz. the P-8 I Squadron," said the Admiral. With the imposing looks and a lethal punch to match, the TU14M aircraft which have been nothing short of a 'Flying Destroyer', were given an impressive farewell as they flew for one last time today along with three Chetak helicopters, two Dorniers, one each IL-38 and the Boeing P-8I. In appreciation of the stellar service of the TU142M aircraft, a TU Static Display was also inaugurated by the Chief of Naval Staff at lNS Rajali. INAS 312 was commissioned on 18 Nov 1976 at INS Hansa, Goa with five Lockheed L1049G Super Constellation aircraft acquired from No. 6 Squadron of the IAF. After de-induction of Super Constellation from the squadron in 1983, TU-142M LRMR ASW aircraft was inducted into INAS 312 on 16 Apr 88 by the then Defence Minister, Mr KC Pant at INS Hansa. The squadron later shifted its base to the East Coast of India in Apr,92, and has since then been based at INS Rajali, Arakkonam. In fact, the first TU142M landed at Rajali on 07 Mar 92 and from here started a glorious chapter of Long Range Maritime Air Operations of the Indian Navy. The TU142M truly brought in the era of dominant Maritime Reconnaissance and Airborne ASW for the Indian Navy and has always been counted as amongst the best and the most feared LRMR platforms in the world. INAS 312 has the unique distinction of operating the heaviest, fastest and highest flying turbo prop in the world namely the TU-142M which has been the mainstay of LRMR and ASW operations of the Indian Navy for close to three decades. Over the years, the TU-142M has rendered yeomen service to the nation and has taken part in all major exercises and operations including Operation Cactus in Maldives, Op Vijay in 1998, Op Parakram in 2002 and Anti-piracy Operations from 2011 till date. The Squadron was awarded Unit Citation by the Chief of Naval Staff in the year 2002 for outstanding professionalism and momentous contribution to the Service and adjudged the Best Frontline Squadron on numerous occasions over the years. After 29 years of dedicated service, the TU-142M LRMR ASW aircraft was drawn down today (29 Mar 17). Commander Yogender Mair, the last Commanding officer of the squadron with TU142M aircraft handed over the reins to Commander V Ranganathan, who will be the first Commanding Officer of the Squadron with the Boeing P-8I aircraft. The Boeing P-8I aircraft dedicated to the nation by the erstwhile Defence Minister, Mr Manohar Parrikar on 13 Nov 15, is the third type of aircraft, after the Lockheed L1049G Super Constellation and the TU-142M aircraft, to be operated by INAS 312. The P-8I aircraft has proven all its systems and has been fully integrated into the operational grid of the Indian Navy. The other event of milestone proportion was the celebration of Silver Jubilee of INS Rajali the air station which was synonymous with the TU's, and its home for the last 29 years. A special cover was also released by the Postal department to mark the occasion. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

The 'New Shepard' capsule's roomy interior includes seats for six travellers, who will be treated to views from the 'largest windows in space'. The capsule offers 530 cubic feet (15 cubic metres) of space - large enough for passengers to float freely and turn weightless somersaults. The include reclining black seats with blue piping, and seats emblazoned with the Blue Origin feather logo. Scroll down for video  Blue Origin, the rocket company owned by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, has revealed the first images of its reusable rocket capsule, due to take tourists to space as early as next year. This image shows the space capsule's 530 cubic feet (15 cubic metres) interior, with six seats each positioned by a window that the company says will be the 'largest windows in space' HOW THE CAPSULE WILL WORK The system consists of a pressurised capsule on top of a reusable booster rocket. The two vehicles launch together, accelerating for approximately two and a half minutes, before the engine cuts off. The capsule then separates from the booster to coast quietly into space. After a few minutes of free fall, the booster performs an autonomous rocket-powered vertical landing, while the capsule lands softly under parachutes, both ready to be used again.  'Our New Shepard flight test program is focused on demonstrating the performance and robustness of the system,' Bezos wrote in an email update. 'In parallel, we’ve been designing the capsule interior with an eye toward precision engineering, safety, and comfort.' Blue Origin's suborbital New Shepard launch system consists of a rocket and capsule designed to fly payloads and passengers to about 100 kilometres (62 miles) above the planet. Test flights with crew members aboard are expected to begin this year. The company has not yet set a price for rides, but says its commercial flight programme is on track to begin next year. Every seat on the flight will have access to a large window, which the company says is made of multiple layers of fracture-tough materials. Minimising distortion and reflection, the windows transmit 92 per cent of visible light giving them visibility 'as good as glass', according to Blue Origin.

Earlier this month, Blue Origin unveiled how its New Glenn 'megarocket', which will be used to launch space satellites, will operate - and revealed its first customer. The reusable rocket will be able to land on a drone ship, and is expected to blast off in 2021 with France's Eutelsat Communications SA as its first customer, Bezos said. It will compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX Dragon Heavy, which is expected to send tourists around the moon next year. Blue Origin's reusable New Glenn 'megarocket' is expected to blast off in 2021 with France's Eutelsat Communications SA as its first customer for satellite launch services, Bezos said 'We couldn´t hope for a better first partner,' Bezos said during a keynote address at the Satellite 2017 conference in Washington. The target date for the first launch is around 2021, Eutelsat CEO Rodolphe Belmer said.  Terms of the contract were not disclosed. Like New Shepard, the New Glenn booster is designed to fly itself back to Earth so it can be recovered and re-flown, slashing launch costs.  more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Thirsssty much?: Rescued king cobra drinks water from a bottle Watch video Supergirl's Melissa Benoist gets wet and wild with Chris Wood Watch video Coco Austin shows sexy BTS of photoshoot Watch video Trans musician Jaimie Wilson performs Ed Sheeran cover Watch video Woman steals beloved dinosaur planter from Denver bar Watch video Olivia Newton-John loses patience as Chloe Lattanzi films night out Watch video Medics fired after mocking patient on a surgery table Watch video Skydiver forced to detach parachute as it tangles mid-flight Watch video Motorcyclist is very nearly sent flying when car pulls out Watch video A German Shepherd rescues his canine buddy stuck in the snow Watch video The Duchess of Cambridge meets parents from Prince George's new school Watch video Kate Middleton is greeted my artists as she arrives at art gala Tech billionaire Elon Musk´s Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, also favours this approach. New Glenn will have about twice the lift capacity of SpaceX´s current Falcon 9 rocket, with the ability to put about 100,000 pounds (45,400 kg) into low-altitude Earth orbits. Blue Origin will compete with SpaceX, as well as the United Launch Alliance owned by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co, Europe´s Arianespace and other companies, for commercial satellite launch business. Jeff Bezos, founder of Blue Origin and CEO of Amazon, speaks about the future plans of Blue Origin during an address to attendees at Access Intelligence's SATELLITE 2017 conference in Washington Eutelsat operates a fleet of 39 communications satellites launched by several companies, including SpaceX, whose launches sell for about $62 million (£50 million), the company's website shows. 'We think that our role as an industry leader is to stimulate competition so that there is a stream of innovation ... and that access to space is easier,' Belmer said.  'When the opportunity of ... New Glenn presented itself, we jumped on it.' Bezos said his goal was to lower the cost of flights so that millions of people can live and work in space.  His vision is to shift energy-intensive, heavy industry into orbit and preserve Earth for human life, while Musk wants to colonise Mars. 'We couldn´t hope for a better first partner,' Bezos said during a keynote address at the Satellite 2017 conference in Washington. The target date for the first launch is around 2021, Eutelsat CEO Rodolphe Belmer said Earlier this month Bezos revealed his space firm Blue Origin has finished building its first 'megarocket' engine. The BE-4 engine will be one of seven powering the firm's  New Glenn 2- and 3-stage rocket. Like its predecessor the New Shephard and SpaceX's Dragon, it will be a reusable space vehicle with a first stage capable of returning to the launch site and landing itself upright after each flight.  The BE-4 engine will be one of seven powering the firm's New Glenn 2- and 3-stage rocket, which will have enough power to put heavy cargo payloads and astronauts into orbit around the Earth Bezos, left and Musk, right are locked in a battle to create reusable rocket systems  The engine is a major step forward for the fledgling space firm '1st BE-4 engine fully assembled. 2nd and 3rd following close behind,' Bezos tweeted.  The New Glenn itself is still years away from its maiden voyage, and the factory where it will be built is still under construction in Cape Canaveral. The BE-4 engines will now undergo rigorous certification at Blue Origin's West Texas-based test site until the rocket is ready for its first tests in 2019 The BE-4 engines will undergo rigorous certification at Blue Origin's West Texas-based test site until then. Earlier this month Bezos revealed what its first missions could be. The boss of Amazon, says he wants to start delivering equipment to the moon to help set up the first human settlement. The Earth-to-Moon cargo delivery service would carry as much as 10,000 pounds of goods to the Moon's South Pole and could be lifting off in 2020.  BLUE ORIGIN'S NEW GLENN  Blue Origin and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos unveiled the new rocket in October last year that will launch payloads and people into orbit. Called 'New Glenn', this launcher comes in two stages that make it larger than SpaceX's future Heavy rocket. 'New Glenn 3-stage' is 23 feet in diameter and stands 313 feet tall. And 'New Glenn 2-stage' is also 23 feet in diameter, but measures 270 feet tall. Each stage lifts off with 3.85 million pounds of thrust from seven BE-4 engines. Blue Origin has a range of rockets. As well as sending goods to the moon in 2020, the firm has also confirmed that it is still on schedule to send paying customers into orbit as soon as 2018 A single vacuum-optimized BE-3 engine, burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, will power New Glenn's third stage. However, the booster and the second stage are identical in both variants. Blue Origin plans to fly New Glen by the end of the decade from Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral, Florida.  The spacecraft come in two stages that are designed with half the power of Nasa's Saturn V launcher, and will bring Blue Origin one-step closer to its goal of 'millions of people living and working in space'. Bezos said the tests had validated the design A second picture revealed the bottom of the rocket   Bezos hopes his private space company Blue Origin will provide the lunar equivalent of Amazon Prime. It will mainly be delivering equipment that early moon settlers would need, he wrote in a white paper outlining his ideas. Bezos has already reserved his parking spot near the Shackleton Crater on the South Pole.  It's a prime spot because it has constant sunlight and water nearby could be used as a source of hydrogen for rocket fuel, according to The Verge. Jeff Bezos owns a private space company called Blue Origin which he hopes to use to deliver equipment for early settlers on the moon - it could be the lunar equivalent of Amazon Prime The sunny spots of the moon are quickly becoming valuable real estate.   Shackleton Crater could be turned into 'an oasis of warm sunlight surrounded by a desert of freezing cold darkness' Nasa said. Some experts believe that that routinely parking a piece of equipment on one spot could mean they take ownership of that piece of land.  This cargo service would help to enable 'future human settlement' of the moon, Mr Bezos wrote in his white paper, which was obtained by the Washington Post. 'It is time for America to return to the Moon — this time to stay,' Bezos told Washington Post.   'A permanently inhabited lunar settlement is a difficult and worthy objective. I sense a lot of people are excited about this', he said. This proposal came just days after Elon Musk said his company would fly two citizens around the moon next year.  This cargo service would help to enable 'future human settlement' of the moon. 'It is time for America to return to the Moon — this time to stay,' Bezos said Rather than visiting and then leaving, Bezos' plans would mean actually leaving things on the moon for the first time.    He said the mission could only happen with partnership with Nasa. 'Our liquid hydrogen expertise and experience with precision vertical landing offer the fastest path to a lunar lander mission.  'I'm excited about this and am ready to invest my own money alongside NASA to make it happen', he wrote in the white paper.  With the help of Nasa, Bezos wants to develop 'incentives in the private sector to demonstrate a commercial lunar cargo delivery service'. Just last month, Nasa's top staff were given instructions to assess the feasibility of sending humans to space with the first flight of the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The mission was originally designed to be uncrewed, and was set to launch in 2018. In a press conference in February, officials leading the study revealed the evaluations are now well underway, and they've already created a 'hard, crisp list' of everything that will need to change 'from a hardware standpoint' in order to add crew. Blue Origin space firm has confirmed that it is still on schedule to send paying customers into orbit as soon as 2018. The company completed a crucial in-flight escape pod test on its New Shepard rocket in October last year. 'We're still on track for flying people — our test astronauts — by the end of 2017, and then starting commercial flights in 2018,' said Blue Origin President Rob Meyerson, speaking at the International Symposium on Commercial and Personal Spaceflight (ISPCS) in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The company expects to build six New Shepard vehicles, which are designed to autonomously fly six passengers to more than 62 miles (100 km) above Earth, high enough to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the planet set against the blackness of space.  more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Thirsssty much?: Rescued king cobra drinks water from a bottle Watch video Supergirl's Melissa Benoist gets wet and wild with Chris Wood Watch video Coco Austin shows sexy BTS of photoshoot Watch video Trans musician Jaimie Wilson performs Ed Sheeran cover Watch video Woman steals beloved dinosaur planter from Denver bar Watch video Olivia Newton-John loses patience as Chloe Lattanzi films night out Watch video Medics fired after mocking patient on a surgery table Watch video Skydiver forced to detach parachute as it tangles mid-flight Watch video A German Shepherd rescues his canine buddy stuck in the snow Watch video Motorcyclist is very nearly sent flying when car pulls out Watch video The Duchess of Cambridge meets parents from Prince George's new school Watch video Kate Middleton is greeted my artists as she arrives at art gala Read more: Amazon boss Jeff Bezos wants to start shipping packages to the Moon - The Verge An exclusive look at Jeff Bezos¿s plan to set up Amazon-like delivery for ¿future human settlement¿ of the moon - The Washington Post Share or comment on this article e-mail 416 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Thirsssty much?: Rescued king cobra drinks water from a bottle The last moments of expert storm chaser Kelley Williamson Thug appears to threaten a mother in angry rant at a restaurant Body cam shows moment before SWAT team shoots Reno Owens 13 year old has no idea he's talking to the voice of Bart Simpson Motorcyclist is very nearly sent flying when car pulls out President Trump rearranges items on a table Dramatic moment armed police make arrest in Birmingham Spooky footage appears to show baby's hand disappearing 'Stop shaking your head' Spicer goes after reporter April Ryan 911 call: Man tells police he's shot two intruders with an AR-15 George Michael's boyfriend Fadi Fawaz races to funeral...

The European Commission said the deal would have created a "de facto monopoly" for certain financial services, BBC News reports. The merger would have combined Europe's two largest stock exchange operators. London Stock Exchange Group said it "regrets" the commission's decision, as the deal would have created a "world-leading" financial markets firm. The commission blocked the deal, which had already been thrown into doubt by Brexit, shortly before the UK started the formal process of leaving the European Union. It is the third time that a merger between LSE and its German rival has failed to come to fruition. They announced plans for a "merger of equals" about a year ago, following attempts by Deutsche Boerse to strike a deal with LSE in 2000 and 2004.

The Associated Press reported March 29, 2017, that a widely-shared story that claims to include photos of a recently delivered plane that will serve as Air Force One for President Donald Trump is false. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) by The Associated Press Close icon The Associated Press KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) - A widely shared story that claims to include photos of a recently delivered plane that will serve as Air Force One for President Donald Trump is false. The pictures included in the story do not show the presidential plane and are conceptual renderings from an outfitter of luxury aircraft. Versions of the story posted by usanewsflash.com and freedomdaily.com said Trump negotiated luxurious accommodations for the plane and the interior now resembles that of Trump's apartment in New York's Trump Tower. The accounts includes photos of what they say is the interior of the plane. The photos are from Kirkland, Washington-based Greenpoint Technologies, a company that specializes in making luxury modifications to wide-body aircraft. Greenpoint spokeswoman Christine Hadley told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the pictures do not depict Air Force One and are "conceptual renderings only, not for one specific customer." Trump has sought to negotiate with Boeing over costs for a pair of new 747 jets to serve as Air Force One. The new planes wouldn't be ready until 2023 or 2024, which would be at the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election. ___ This story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories.

The ceremony was attended by Admiral Sunil Lanba, Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM), Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM), ADC Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral HCS Bisht, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Eastern Naval Command, serving and retired officers and men, who have served in the INAS 312 and other senior officials from the Navy as well as from civil administration. Speaking on the occasion, Admiral Sunil Lanba lauded the stellar role played by TU142M aircraft in the defence of the country as a Maritime Reconnaissance and Airborne ASW aircraft. He recollected the crucial role played by the Squadron in Operation Cactus in Maldives, where fleeing mercenaries were detected and tracked till they were apprehended by Indian warships. The Admiral also mentioned the maiden participation by TU's as the first Indian Naval Aircraft in the Republic Day fly past at New Delhi on Jan 26, 1999. He also acknowledged the professionalism of the pilots, the maintainers and all those personnel associated with flying and maintaining the aircraft in peak efficiency during their service. "The rich legacy of the Squadron would continue as the baton is being passed on to the proud crew of the worthy successors viz. the P-8 I Squadron," said the Admiral. With the imposing looks and a lethal punch to match, the TU14M aircraft which have been nothing short of a 'Flying Destroyer', were given an impressive farewell as they flew for one last time today along with three Chetak helicopters, two Dorniers, one each IL-38 and the Boeing P-8I. In appreciation of the stellar service of the TU142M aircraft, a TU Static Display was also inaugurated by the Chief of Naval Staff at lNS Rajali. INAS 312 was commissioned on 18 Nov 1976 at INS Hansa, Goa with five Lockheed L1049G Super Constellation aircraft acquired from No. 6 Squadron of the IAF. After de-induction of Super Constellation from the squadron in 1983, TU-142M LRMR ASW aircraft was inducted into INAS 312 on 16 Apr 88 by the then Defence Minister, Mr KC Pant at INS Hansa. The squadron later shifted its base to the East Coast of India in Apr,92, and has since then been based at INS Rajali, Arakkonam. In fact, the first TU142M landed at Rajali on 07 Mar 92 and from here started a glorious chapter of Long Range Maritime Air Operations of the Indian Navy. The TU142M truly brought in the era of dominant Maritime Reconnaissance and Airborne ASW for the Indian Navy and has always been counted as amongst the best and the most feared LRMR platforms in the world. INAS 312 has the unique distinction of operating the heaviest, fastest and highest flying turbo prop in the world namely the TU-142M which has been the mainstay of LRMR and ASW operations of the Indian Navy for close to three decades. Over the years, the TU-142M has rendered yeomen service to the nation and has taken part in all major exercises and operations including Operation Cactus in Maldives, Op Vijay in 1998, Op Parakram in 2002 and Anti-piracy Operations from 2011 till date. The Squadron was awarded Unit Citation by the Chief of Naval Staff in the year 2002 for outstanding professionalism and momentous contribution to the Service and adjudged the Best Frontline Squadron on numerous occasions over the years. After 29 years of dedicated service, the TU-142M LRMR ASW aircraft was drawn down today (29 Mar 17). Commander Yogender Mair, the last Commanding officer of the squadron with TU142M aircraft handed over the reins to Commander V Ranganathan, who will be the first Commanding Officer of the Squadron with the Boeing P-8I aircraft. The Boeing P-8I aircraft dedicated to the nation by the erstwhile Defence Minister, Mr Manohar Parrikar on 13 Nov 15, is the third type of aircraft, after the Lockheed L1049G Super Constellation and the TU-142M aircraft, to be operated by INAS 312. The P-8I aircraft has proven all its systems and has been fully integrated into the operational grid of the Indian Navy. The other event of milestone proportion was the celebration of Silver Jubilee of INS Rajali the air station which was synonymous with the TU's, and its home for the last 29 years. A special cover was also released by the Postal department to mark the occasion.

Scroll to Dismiss News Sports Opinion ArtsEtc Visuals Banter About Advertise Newsletter Donate Weekly Newsletter News Herald Proposal asks for UW divestment from corporations participating in human rights abuses Students for Justice in Palestine has taken the lead on the proposition by Montana Leggett · Mar 29, 2017 Share Tweet Marissa Haegele/The Badger Herald As the Students for Justice in Palestine prepare to bring a resolution to the Associated Students of Madison Wednesday, some students and student organizations on campus have spoken out against the actions contained in the resolution. The resolution calls for the University of Wisconsin to break ties with companies that conduct business in Israel, the U.S. and Palestine and they say contribute to human rights violations both in the Middle East and domestically. Those companies include corporations that develop weapons, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing. They also include banks, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America, which the proposal says own private-prison corporations and have invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline. The resolution asks for divestment from nearly 20 corporations. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, all people are guaranteed the right to life, liberty and security of person. The people of Palestine have been denied these rights, according to the proposed resolution. This includes people who live in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza and Palestinian refugees outside of Israel and Palestine. Political activist thinks he has solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflictOne Israeli political activist believes his solution to create a democratic state may solve a decades-long conflict between Israeli and Palestinian groups. A Read… Zach Urisman, a member of Badgers United Against Hate, doesn’t approve of the resolution. Focusing on the human rights violations in Israel while not addressing the violations in other areas in the Middle East is not the way to solve the issue, Urisman said. The resolution will divide students on campus in many ways, such as by their ethnicity or their political beliefs, Urisman said. Urisman said there’s already tension between these groups, including white supremacist graffiti found in UW’s Greek community last year. “I feel a resolution of this sort would inflame a lot of the hatred that we’ve seen on this college campus and across the country in the past couple of months,” Urisman said. [UPDATED]: Anti-Semitic, white supremacist graffiti found in UW’s Greek life community[UPDATED]: Joel DeSpain, Madison Police Department spokesperson, said MPD is aware of the graffiti incidents that happened on Langdon Street and Read… Badgers United Against Hate, a new student initiative focused on promoting inclusivity and opposing divestment efforts on campus, said in a Facebook post they are opposed to the resolution. They said the efforts weaken the sense of community on campus and stop dialogue. According to the Facebook post, the resolution will particularly hurt marginalized students on campus because of lost scholarships, internships and job opportunities. In an email to The Badger Herald, SJP said the resolution targets corporations’ roles in the U.S., Israel and Palestine. They added the resolution was created “for the struggles” of groups on campus including SJP, MEChA, Wunk Sheek, Jewish Voices for Peace and the Wisconsin Black Student Union. “We hope to remove our university’s complicity, and thus our own complicity in these corporate human rights abuses,” SJP said. “We condemn all forms of racism and discrimination.” ASM will vote on the proposal Wednesday.

David Kerley has the latest on the investigation. Good morning to you, David. Reporter: Good morning, Michael. This is incredible video showing the seconds after an emergency fire and at response of firefighters and passengers and we can all learn something from this. Watch this. The Peruvian Boeing 73apparently made that emergency landing and veered off the runway to the right side and burst into flames. You can see the passengers evacuating over the wing, jumping off that wing, the slides deployed and then it appears that the fuel leaking from that right side had gone all the way back and you saw the fire truck come in and start to put that fire out. They were within the scene within a couple of seconds and passengers did move across the runway away from the jet as the firefighters worked. No serious injuries reported according to the airline and, Michael, this is why when you're told to leave your bag behind and get out quickly, you get out quickly. You don't know if that fuel tank is going to explode. Those are some remarkable pictures and shows how to evacuate an aircraft. You're right, glad no one is hurt. Thank you very much.

To match Exclusive JAPAN-R&D/MILITARY REUTERS/Tim Kelly - RTR4U3RD Reuters/Tim Kelly - RTR4U3RD ABU DHABI, 29th March, 2017 (WAM) -- Abu Dhabi's advanced composite aerostructures manufacturing facility Strata Manufacturing, today unveiled plans for its second facility at Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park. The Strata 2.0 facility will more than double Strata's existing capacity and sets the company on a firm path towards Abu Dhabi’s long-term goal of achieving economic diversification and driving global competitiveness for the UAE’s manufacturing sector. Located adjacent to Strata’s existing facility, the second site will have a final size of approximately 60,000 sqm, with construction on the Strata facility expected to start in 2018, and set to become fully operational by 2020. The new plant will manufacture two of the most complex work packages that include the horizontal tail plane, HTP, for the Airbus A320 and the vertical fin for Boeing’s B787 airliners. These work packages will be manufactured, fully equipped, tested and delivered directly to the final assembly lines of both Airbus and Boeing. The Strata 2.0 facility will be designed as a "factory of the future" that will feature a range of smart technology solutions and equipment to support Strata’s ambition in becoming one of the top aero-structure companies globally, according to Ismail Ali Abdulla, Deputy CEO of Strata, who was speaking during a roundtable at the Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit, GMIS 2017, in Abu Dhabi. This new factory will deliver on innovative solutions that will seek to revolutionise traditional production methods in aerospace by introducing smart technologies and additive manufacturing to create a unique and seamless flow. It will combine real-time visibility on operations with cognitive decision-making to drive efficiencies, eliminate waste, elevate the quality and unlock greater value for shareholders, customers and employees. Abdulla described the new factory as "a true milestone for the company, aligning achievements with future opportunities." "The 'factory of the future' vision is centred around the 4th industrial revolution. We have identified key guiding pillars for the new factory; Smart Building, Smart Manufacturing and a Smart Workforce. Strata 2.0 will unify these pillars inside the new iconic facility, said Abdulla, adding that since its inception in 2009, Strata has been a catalyst for socio-economic growth, delivering on Abu Dhabi’s Economic Vision 2030. Strata identified key guiding pillars for the new factory including, smart building, smart manufacturing and a smart workforce. "Strata has developed an ecosystem of its own in Al Ain, and it has been built on the trust and confidence of our global partners," Abdulla continued. Abdulla expressed his pride in having fostered an Emirati manufacturing talent base, now employing hundreds of highly-skilled male and female UAE nationals in a very dynamic setting, who will lead the introduction of Smart technologies in Strata 2.0. © Copyright Emirates News Agency (WAM) 2017. © Copyright Zawya.

Ruperta is a gaunt figure in the elephant enclosure at Caricuao Zoo in the Venezuelan capital Caracas. At 46 she should have around two decades of life left but she now looks on the verge of death.   Head of Venezuela's National Parks Institute Marlene Sifontes said: “There is food, but there is not enough variety. “They are feeding her only with auyama (a kind of pumpkin) and papaya, but it is not covering what she really needs.” Ruperta's story and pictures were shared online, which brought dozens of well-wishers rushing to the zoo with food for her. But zoo bosses turned it down, saying they could not accept donations for fear of malicious people giving unsafe or even poisoned material.   Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 10:20 • 30/03 Hypnodog!

The president and his companies have been linked to at least 10 wealthy former Soviet businessmen with alleged ties to criminal organizations or money laundering. Among them: • A member of the firm that developed the Trump SoHo Hotel in New York is a twice-convicted felon who spent a year in prison for stabbing a man and later scouted for Trump investments in Russia. •  An investor in the SoHo project was accused by Belgian authorities in 2011 in a $55 million money-laundering scheme. • Three owners of Trump condos in Florida and Manhattan were accused in federal indictments of belonging to a Russian-American organized crime group and working for a major international crime boss based in Russia. •  A former mayor from Kazakhstan was accused in a federal lawsuit filed in Los Angeles in 2014 of hiding millions of dollars looted from his city, some of which was spent on three Trump SoHo units. •  A Ukrainian owner of two Trump condos in Florida was indicted in a money-laundering scheme involving a former prime minister of Ukraine. Trump's Russian connections are of heightened interest because of an FBI investigation into possible collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russian operatives to interfere in last fall's election. What’s more, Trump and his companies have had business dealings with Russians that go back decades, raising questions about whether his policies would be influenced by business considerations. Trump told reporters in February: "I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. I have no loans with Russia at all." Yet in 2013, after Trump addressed potential investors in Moscow, he bragged to Real Estate Weekly about his access to Russia's rich and powerful. “I have a great relationship with many Russians, and almost all of the oligarchs were in the room,” Trump said, referring to Russians who made fortunes when former Soviet state enterprises were sold to private investors. Five years earlier, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. told Russian media while in Moscow  that “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets" in places like Dubai and Trump SoHo and elsewhere in New York. New York City real estate broker Dolly Lenz told USA TODAY she sold about 65 condos in Trump World at 845 U.N. Plaza in Manhattan to Russian investors, many of whom sought personal meetings with Trump for his business expertise. “I had contacts in Moscow looking to invest in the United States,” Lenz said. “They all wanted to meet Donald. They became very friendly.” Many of those meetings happened in Trump's office at Trump Tower or at sales events, Lenz said.   Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 10:20 • 30/03 Hypnodog!

The complete report is available at http://www.credenceresearch.com/report/unmanned-aerial-vehicles-uav-market Market Insights The overall UAV market is majorly driven by the rising expenditure by national governments on the defense sector. UAVs are majorly used for surveillance and monitoring across borders, homeland security and other crucial areas.Over the period of time, UAVs have found immense applications ranging from electronic intelligence, communication, aerial imaging and others. This is further estimated to significantly drive the overall market growth in the coming years. More than 50companies (including Northrop Grumman Corporation, Boeing Company), universities and government organizations in the U.S. are engaged in development of over 150 different unmanned aircraft designs. Thus, the UAV market holds immense opportunities and growth potential in the near future. The overall UAV market is largely driven by the increased spending over unmanned systems since the last few years.The U.S., Israel and China are prime markets for UAV across the world, in terms of expenditure and development. Due to high spending over defense sector, the two countries have emerged highly lucrative for UAV. In response to the increasing demand, various companies are striving to provide platforms (UAVs)along with the software solutions, sensors, communications and other subsystems. Nevertheless, major concern for the market is high costs of the UAVs, especially the ones designed to operate in the high altitude category. Countries having less defense budget face high initial costs as a major concern for deployment of high altitude UAVs. Competitive Insights: The global UAV market is consolidated in nature with few market players accounting for more than 40% of the total market revenue. The UAV market is highly competitive in nature.

Carefully consider the need to travel to Turkey at this time, and avoid travel to southeast Turkey due to the persistent threat of terrorism,” the warning said. The State Department also reminded that it terminated last year’s decision to direct family members of employees posted to the US Consulate General in Istanbul to depart the country temporarily while noting the continuation of restrictions on personal and official travel by U.S. government personnel and their family members travelling to and residing in Istanbul.   It also added that restrictions on travel by US government personnel to certain areas in southeast Turkey, including southern province of Adana, remain.  The warning reviewed major terror attacks in the country over the past years and said “an increase in anti-American rhetoric has the potential to inspire independent actors to carry out acts of violence against U.S. citizens.” It stated that additional attacks could occur at major events, tourist sites, restaurants, nightclubs, commercial centers, places of worship, and transportation hubs. The travel warning update came one day before Tillerson’s visit with the case of US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating the failed 2016 coup, the U.S.-led offensive to retake Raqqa from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and an “interim zone of stability” in Syria based on cease fires are on the agenda.  Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 10:20 • 30/03 Hypnodog!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 March 2017 by Military News Aeromexico Connects Mexico to the World /EINPresswire.com/ — ACAPULCO, MEXICO–(Marketwired – March 28, 2017) – In the framework of the 2017 „Tianguis Turistico” edition, Aeromexico, Mexico’s global airline, announced that its growth strategy has allowed it to maintain its position as the largest global airline network in Mexico serving 44 domestic and 45 international destinations. This leadership position is grounded in the carrier’s strategy to continue increasing its domestic and international connectivity options along with its fleet renewal plan for its more than 130 aircraft, including the Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 Dreamliner, considered the most modern commercial aircraft in the sky. In the last two years, the airline has added 12 new international destinations to its network spanning three continents, including Boston, Medellin, Panama, Toronto, and Vancouver in 2015; Amsterdam, Austin, and Santo Domingo in 2016; and Calgary, Detroit, Seoul, and San Jose, California this year. It is also important to note that Aeromexico’s international consolidation strategy for this year, is centered on strengthening its route network with a 150% increase in the number of flights offered to Canada, a 120% increase in the number of seats offered to Asia, a 30% increase in the number of flights it operates to Europe, and a nearly 15% increase in its service to Central and South America, as the carrier maintains its position as the only Latin American airline with a presence in Asia.

Or a world where farmers can plant their fields — without stepping foot outside… Or where catastrophic leaks from fuel storage tanks could be prevented long before it’s too late. Well, thanks to the work of aerial drones, all three of these scenarios — and many more — are possible right now. In fact, drone technology has become so widespread and affordable that regular folks like you and me can simply pick one up in a store. And on Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that over 770,000 drone registrations have been filed in just the last 15 months. As senior analyst Jonathan Rodriguez details below, this market is exploding right now. And he’ll show you two ways to play the incredible upside… Ahead of the Tape, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily Profit From the Drone Invasion in Two Easy Steps Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, might be the most important tech device on the market since the smartphone. In fact, consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates the global drone market will be worth $127 billion by 2020. Unfortunately, when many people think of drones, controversial images of war come to mind. That’s not surprising, since drones are used prominently in the defense industry. With good reason. Governments around the world have pushed in on them because they save the lives of countless soldiers around the world every day. But drone technology has made its way into many other fields, too. Drones are used in the entertainment industry for aerial filming… They’re also being used in the freight industry, delivering packages to remote locations inaccessible by car… Drones are even being used to plant farmers’ fields, shooting seeds right into the soil. Heck, PwC believes the UAV market in agriculture alone could fetch $32 billion. So how can you play the action? The biggest share of the drone market is held by giant defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing. But the small-cap players in the space will offer the most compelling growth opportunities. Here’s how you can play the best of both worlds… Play #1: Going Small for the Biggest Gains AeroVironment Inc. (NASDAQ: AVAV) is a leading small-cap tech company that specializes in unmanned aerial vehicles. With a market cap of just $641 million, AeroVironment represents one of the drone market’s juiciest growth plays. The company manufactures drones for both military applications and agricultural support. Its agriculture drones can create 3-D maps of fields for farmers for efficient planting. And using infrared cameras, AVAV’s drones can help farmers identify sick crops quickly — so they can be treated or removed. The company booked $264 million in sales last year, and revenue has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% since 2004. In 2016, the company posted earnings growth of more than 205%. And on a forward basis, the company is expected to boost EPS by 141%. That’s nearly double the EPS growth rate of the aerospace industry (76.3%). Better still, the firm sits on $194 million in cash and carries zero debt. The company’s phenomenal bottom-line growth and lean balance sheet also make it a prime takeover target. Play #2: Trade a Mega-Cap Defense Stock at a Bite-Sized Price Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) is one of America’s largest defense contractors. The company makes several combat drones, including the MQ-8C unmanned helicopter and the popular RQ-4 Global Hawk. Last year, Northrop Grumman was awarded a $108 million contract from the U.S. Navy to deliver 10 MQ-8C units by August 2019. This will bring the Navy’s total MQ-8C fleet up to 29. And the company snagged a $204 million contract with the U.S. Air Force to upgrade its existing fleet of Global Hawk drones. The company’s aerospace division, which includes UAVs, booked $10 billion in sales last year. The aerospace unit accounted for 44% of the firm’s total revenue of $25 billion. So Northrop Grumman’s exposure to the red-hot drone market is large. Instead of buying the shares outright, which run about $239, I’d recommend the January 2018 $260 call options, which are trading for just $7.20. This offers you leverage of about 33:1 to owning shares. The options break even if the underlying shares hit $267 by expiration, and the calls double in value if shares reach $273. Bottom line: With these two plays, you get the best of both worlds: a highflying small-cap drone company… along with low-risk, high-reward exposure to one of the world’s largest aerospace players.

Hrant Dink, the founder of the bilingual Armenian-Turkish weekly newspaper Agos, was shot dead in an Istanbul street in January 2007. Although a suspect was convicted, the case has been re-investigated several times amid concerns that police conspired to allow Dink's killing to happen. According to a judicial source who spoke on condition of anonymity due to restrictions on talking to the media, the eight suspects were held on charges of membership of terror organization and "attempting to overthrow the constitutional order". Ogun Samast, aged 17 at the time of the killing, claimed he murdered Dink for "insulting Turkishness" and was jailed for 23 years in 2011. Since then, prosecutors have examined whether he acted alone. In July 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled the original police inquiry had been an "ineffective investigation". Last December, another indictment was filed calling for the prosecution of 26 former police officers on charges of establishing an armed organization and dereliction of duty. Recently, the investigation has been expanded to gendarmerie officers and claims linking the killing to the Gülenist terror cult that also perpetrated last July's attempted coup, have added a new dimension.

The publication interviewed the legendary musician ahead of the scheduled event, describing him a universal and international symbol. “Such is the image of Charles Aznavour, who is known as a benefactor and is also Armenia’s honorary consul to UNESCO,” it says.   The musician shared stories of his life and career, speaking of the hardships of the past and present.   He said that his parents, Genocide survivors, were a model of kindness for him and his sister, Aida, as they instilled in them the desire to help others in need since early childhood.   “My life was probably a victory against myself. I started everything from a scratch and learned everything – whether music, literature or acting technique - on my own. Education wasn’t free then, and our family’s means being quite modest, I had to drop out of school early. From that moment on, I was independent in all my endeavors,” said the singer.   Asked whether performing on stage is psychologically easier or vice versa, the singer said he never thought about the audience’s reaction before rising to prominence. “But it’s an absolutely different feeling when you know the audience is there just for you. My audience is faithful; I meet with them as though I see an old friend,” he added.     Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 10:20 • 30/03 Hypnodog!

By: Shubir Rishi Published: Wednesday, March 29, 2017, 11:58 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News On Wednesday, the Indian Navy's three Tupolev Tu-142M aircraft were decommissioned after guarding the Indian Ocean region for nearly three decades at the naval air station INS Rajali in Arakkonam in Tamil Nadu. The Tu-142M maritime snooping aircraft, better known as 'Albatross' for its massive wing-span, had on several occasions picked up Chinese and Pakistani submarines operating close to Indian waters. The aircraft were upgraded in the last decade in Russia to plug the gaps till the time the American aircraft arrived in India and joined the operational service, navy officials said. The fuel-guzzling Tupolev142M's were the primary genuine long-range maritime reconnaissance of the Indian Navy. The TU-142MKE has a speed of around 850 kmph, and a battle range of 6,500-km. A squadron is also inducting the Boeing P-8I and two of these have also been received. India inked a deal worth US $2.1 billion January 1, 2009 for a total of eight aircraft, and the first aircraft arrived in India on May 15, 2013. Here are some glorious pictures of the aircraft: Only three remained operational Only three of the eight Taganrog-built Tu-142MEs, which were introduced in 1988, remained operational, according to flightglobal. These were being operated by the service's 312 Sqn from INS Rajali, Arakkonam. All photographs: spokespersonNavy/Twitter The fastest turboprop aircraft in the world With its four powerful engines, slender fuselage and swept wings, Tupolev is the fastest turboprop aircraft in the world and reportedly is difficult to intercept by fighters.     Several modifications for the Indian Navy The decommissioning comes weeks after the navy bid farewell to aircraft carrier INS Viraat. During the last nearly three decades, the 'Albatross' has undergone several modifications to keep up with evolving technology and changing requirements of the Indian Navy. Boeing P-8I, the successor The first squadron of Boeing P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft was dedicated to the nation on November 14, 2015. Armed with the mighty Harpoon anti-ship missile, the Boeing P-8I Squadron (INAS 312A) will boost Navy's activities such as anti-surface warfare, long-range antii-submarine warfare, surveillance and reconnaissance and littoral missions. TU-142M becomes 'heritage' The Navy will also celebrate silver jubilee of INS Rajali, the naval air station which was synonymous with the Tupolev and its home for the last 29 years. The ‘heritage display' of TU-142M would also be inaugurated as part of the ceremony.     Read more about: indian navy, aircraft, plane, navy, chennai, china, spy, tamil nadu, warfare Other articles published on Mar 29, 2017 Please Wait while comments are loading...

In a statement posted to Twitter, Peruvian Airlines said the plane turned off the runway upon landing at 4:30pm local time (8:30am CET). All 141 on board the Boeing aircraft had been safely evacuated from the plane with no injuries, the airline said. Alberto Lopez, a spokesman for Peruvian Airlines, emphasised that the plane did not crash. "The investigators are travelling to Jauja tomorrow [Wednesday] at 5am and our emergency team is in place and that is all we can say. The plane did not crash, it landed and then the fire was produced once the plane was on the ground but the exact cause of fire will be explained once the investigation has been completed." The aircraft caught fire as a consequence of the "forced landing," the Peruvian Ministry of Transport and Communication said in a statement. Firefighters at the airport extinguished the blaze. Boeing tweeted Tuesday night, "We are aware of the incident involving Peruvian Airlines Flight 2036. Our team is currently gathering more information."

It will operate in geostationary orbit. Credit: SES/Airbus CAPE CANAVERAL/KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FL – As the hours tick down to the history making liftoff of the world’s first recycled rocket, the commercial customer SES is proclaiming high “confidence” in the flight worthiness of the “Flight-Proven” SpaceX Falcon 9 booster that will blastoff with a massive Hi-Def TV satellite for telecom giant SES this Thursday, Chief Technology Officer Martin Halliwell told Universe Today at a media briefing. “We are confident in this booster,” SES CTO Martin Halliwell told me at a press briefing on March 28, regarding SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s bold vision to slash launch costs by recovering and reusing spent first stage rockets from his firms Falcon 9 launch vehicle. The milestone SpaceX mission destined to refly the first ever ‘used rocket’ is slated for lift off on Thursday, March 30, at 6:27 p.m. EDT carrying the SES-10 telecommunications payload to orbit atop a ‘Flight-Proven’ Falcon 9 rocket from seaside Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SES-10 is to be the first ever satellite launching on such a SpaceX flight-proven first stage rocket, Halliwell explained. The Falcon 9 was designed from the start of development by SpaceX engineers to be reusable. The nearly six ton satellite will provide significantly improved TV, voice and data service to over 37 million customers in Central and South America. “This thing is good to go!” The Falcon 9 booster to be recycled was initially launched in April 2016 for NASA on the SpaceX Dragon CRS-8 resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS) under contract for the space agency.

Workers had removed the first of four landing legs in this view from June 3, 2016. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The booster is one of eight first stages recovered by SpaceX so far, either by landing on a barge at sea or on a landing pad on the ground. “We [SES] have been through this vehicle with a fine tooth comb,” Halliwell elaborated. The boosters are carefully checked and refurbished to confirm their integrity and utility, and the first stage Merlin 1D engines are re-fired multiple times to confirm they will function reliably and robustly. “SpaceX has been through this booster with a fine tooth comb. This booster is a really good booster.” Is this a high risk strategy to be first in line launching an expensive satellite on a used rocket, I asked? Why are you confident? “There is not a huge risk,” Halliwell emphatically. “In this particular case we know that the reusability capability is built into the design of the Falcon 9 vehicle. I think its baseline is to fly nine times. We are flight #2.’ “We have tested this thing. We have run the engines up! Halliwell elaborated. SpaceX has run full duration static fire tests as well as shorter 3 to 5 second hold down tests on the pad. Indeed this booster was successfully checked out during a brief engine test lasting approximately five seconds at 2 p.m. today, Monday March 27, with the sudden eruption of smoke and ash rushing into the air over historic pad 39A on NASA’s Kennedy Space Center during a picture perfect sunny afternoon – as I witnessed from Space View Park in Titusville, FL.

History making launch of first recycled rocket is slated for 30 March 2017 with SES-10 telecommunications comsat. Credit: Ken Kremer/Kenkremer.com “We have also looked at the airframe, Halliwell went on. “We have looked at the various components. This thing is good to go.” “We don’t believe we are taking an inordinate risk here.” SpaceX says the cost of a Falcon 9 launch is about $60 million. Halliwell would not disclose the discount SES is receiving for this launch by utilizing a recycled rocket. But SpaceX officials have been quoted as saying the savings could be between 10 to 30 percent. “So with that we can go back to our insurers and we can explain that risk exactly. And we can back it up with analysis and test data. So I don’t agree that we are taking a huge risk here!” Halliwell told me. “From a pricing point of view, the launch cost pricing is really irrelevant. The delta in cost is really not relevant or material.” The payload was encapsulated inside the payload fairing and bolted on top of the Falcon 9. It will be rolled back out to pad 39A overnight Thursday morning and erected. 13 hours of critical checks are needed to insure the satellite is still functioning perfectly after raising at the pad, Halliwell explained. The timeline is tight to get all the required work done in time to carry out a Thursday evening launch. SpaceX, founded by billionaire and CEO Elon Musk, inked a deal in August 2016 with telecommunications giant SES, to refly a ‘Flight-Proven’ Falcon 9 booster. Luxembourg-based SES and Hawthrone, CA-based SpaceX jointly announced the agreement to “launch SES-10 on a flight-proven Falcon 9 orbital rocket booster.” The flight proven SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will deliver SES-10 to a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). SES-10 has a launch mass of 5,300 kg or 11,700 pounds, which includes the dry mass and propellant. The spacecraft utilizes for both chemical propulsion for orbit raising and electric propulsion for station keeping. Liftoff of the Falcon 9 carrying the SES-10 telecommunications satellite is now slated for 6:27 p.m. EDT at the opening of the launch window The two and a half hour launch window closes at 8:57 p.m. EDT. SpaceX will webcast the launch live. SpaceX will also attempt to re-land the Falcon 9 first stage for an unprecedented second time, provided there are sufficient fuel reserves remaining after accomplishing its primary mission to delivering SES-10 to GTO, Halliwell stated. SES-10 will replace AMC-3 and AMC-4 to provide enhanced coverage and significant capacity expansion over Latin America, says SES. “The satellite will be positioned at 67 degrees West, pursuant to an agreement with the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), and will be used for the Simón Bolivar 2 satellite network.” Up to 3 additional SES satellites could launch on SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets by the end of this year.

Geojit Financial Services recommends the following stocks: Bharat Electronics  | Rating: BUY                                Bharat Electronics (BEL) is a Navaratna enterprise having 37 percent market share in Indian Defence Electronics. BEL’s core capabilities are in radar and weapons systems, defence communication & electronic warfare. BEL's current order book is at Rs 33,806 crore, which is 4.7 times FY16 sales, provides strong revenue visibility for next four years. The current trend of strong order intake is expected to continue going for next few years given likely finalization of a few of the large orders like LRSAM, MRSAM and Akash system. To benefit from the government's higher focus on Make in India and higher indigenous procurement given its strong execution capabilities, technological tie-ups with a higher focus on R&D. Given shift of business towards system integration, margins are expected to improve going forward. We maintain a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,761. Bharat Forge | Rating: Hold                            Bharat Forge (BFL) is a leading player in the forgings industry serving several sectors including automobile, power, oil and gas, rail & marine, aerospace, construction, mining etc. We expect the domestic auto segment to register double digit growth on the back of improved demand from the OEM's. BFL's order from Boeing for developing and manufacturing 777x titanium forgings will start reflecting in its revenue from FY19 estimates. The company is eyeing for 100-200 percent volume growth in defence space by 2020. The long term growth outlook remains robust on the backdrop of improved revenue visibility. We expect 13 percent revenue CAGR over FY17-19E led by pick in domestic CV market and de-risking the utilization in non-auto sector. Cadila Healthcare | Rating: BUY Cadila Healthcare (Cadila) is India’s leading vertically integrated pharmaceutical company. With its presence across the value chain, it manufactures finished dosage forms, active pharmaceutical ingredients, animal healthcare products and wellness products. The recent clean chit given to the Moraiya facility (60 ANDA's pending for approval from this plant) and acquisition of specialty player in pain therapy in the US (Sentynl, annual sales of USD 58 million) will drive overseas growth (US contributes 42 percent of consolidated revenues). Domestic business continues to be on strong footing with a diversified portfolio and dominant presence in categories such as cardiac, anti infective and respiratory. The company is well positioned to leverage the volume-driven growth in the domestic pharma space through new product launches, penetration into tier II towns & increasing sales force productivity.With, robust US pipeline and a strong earnings growth trajectory, we estimate revenue/PAT growth at a CAGR of 11.5 percent/14.4 percent over FY16-19E and expect the stock to sustain premium valuations as compared to it’s peers. tags #Bharat Electronics #Bharat Forge #Cadila Healthcare #Companies #Fundamental picks #Stocks Views Related news Business Buy Prestige Estates, Thomas Cook, Ramco System: Ashwani Gujral Mar 30, 2017 12:12 PM Business Rane Brake may move to Rs 1400, VIP Industries Rs 210; buy Escorts: Ashwani Gujral Mar 30, 2017 11:37 AM Business EXCLUSIVE: LIC agrees to invest Rs 1,000 cr in UCO Bank tier-II bonds Mar 30, 2017 11:20 AM Business Buy Ashok Leyland; Voltas, Whirlpool may rally 20-30%, Astral Poly may hit Rs 750: Ashwani Gujral Mar 30, 2017 11:19 AM Business Buy Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors, GATI: Sudarshan Sukhani Mar 30, 2017 11:08 AM Business Buy Cairn India, Asian Paints, Adani Enterprises: Rajat Bose Mar 30, 2017 11:03 AM Business Buy Exide Industries; above Rs 143, Karnataka Bank may hit Rs 150: Mitessh Thakkar Mar 30, 2017 10:59 AM Business Here are a few stock ideas by Amit Gupta Mar 30, 2017 10:47 AM Business Buy Voltas, Whirlpool, Bata India: Sudarshan Sukhani Mar 30, 2017 09:54 AM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

Brazil aerospace sector seeks to dodge economic turbulence Money Thursday 30 March 2017 - 1:37am The the E195-E2 commercial jet's first prototype is pictured in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, March 7, 2017. Photo: Reuters RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil may be in the midst of an economic storm, but sitting back in a leather seat on Embraer's latest luxury jet, Gustavo Teixeira says the aviation industry is dodging the turbulence. The crisis "is on our radar but hasn't hurt us," the Embraer executive said in an interview aboard a glistening Legacy 500 jet displayed at the inaugural International Brazil Air Show, held at Rio de Janeiro's Tom Jobim Airport. Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, may be best known right now for a deep recession, political instability and a mammoth corruption scandal ripping through the political leadership. But the first ever Rio air show, backed by Airbus, Saab, Lufthansa, the IATA travel industry association and other international players, hopes to show that aviation opportunities in Brazil and across Latin America are sky high. "This is the right time. During a crisis, you need to bring people together," Paula Faria, director of the air show, told AFP. According to the Brazilian Aviation Institute, two years of recession have taken a measurable toll. The country's fleet of commercial planes fell from 727 to 686 in 2016, while the overall stock of planes rose just 0.1 percent to 21,895. However, the aviation institute's president, Francisco Lyra, said the industry is "resilient" and that Brazil is a sure bet when it comes to air travel investment. "In a continent-sized country the only practical, efficient way of travelling is by plane," he said in a speech. Think globally Embraer is the third biggest aeroplane manufacturer after Boeing and Airbus, an unusually prominent Brazilian high-tech success story with a strong line in executive jets. Speaking aboard the Legacy 500, which seats up to 12 passengers and has a $21.5 million price tag, Teixeira said the secret was having a global footprint. Embraer exports about 90 percent of its production and the biggest market is North America, so while "there's a regional component, it doesn't have a big impact," said Teixeira, sales director for Latin America. "When Brazil's credit rating went down, Embraer's credit rating remained at investment level. People understand the quality of our product, the quality of our service and they understand that we are a global player." Rafael Alonso, Airbus president for Latin America and Caribbean, told AFP that while airlines were looking to delay new Airbus deliveries because of falling passenger numbers, Latin America's growing middle class means plenty of potential for the European giant. "Brazil has just had its biggest crisis in history but we are seeing signs of recovery and the indicators are starting to look a bit more optimistic," he said.  "Brazil is a country with currently less than 0.5 (air) trips per inhabitant and we predict that by 2035, this will more than double." Teixeira said small, nimble executive jets will also continue to take off. Even if they seem like the ultimate luxury, in huge countries like Brazil business leaders may find them a necessity. "Brazil has 5,500 municipalities and of these, about 130 are served by commercial aviation," he said. "But if I'm not from these 130, how am I going to get around?" AFP Comment Now!

Oregon is headed to Phoenix to face North Carolina in the national semifinals on Saturday. Oregon hasn’t been this close to the title game since the team won the first NCAA Tournament in 1939. (University of Oregon Archives via AP) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (4) The historical significance of Oregon's return to the Final Four was not lost on coach Dana Altman. The Ducks face North Carolina in the national semifinals in Glendale, Arizona, on Saturday. Oregon hasn't been this close to the title game since the team won the inaugural NCAA Tournament in 1939. Altman called it "a long drought." Perhaps one that could end this season after 78 years? The Oregon Webfoots won the NCAA title with a 46-33 victory over Ohio State at Northwestern University. The team would become known by the nickname the Tall Firs — a nod to both the Oregon landscape and the fact that the players loomed taller than most of their opponents. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Webfoots' front line included 6-foot-4 John Dick, 6-foot-4 leading scorer Laddie Gale and 6-foot-8 Urgel (Slim) Wintermute. Guards Bobby Anet, a 5-foot-8 playmaker, and 5-foot-10 Wally Johansen rounded out the starting five. Anet and Johansen grew up on the same street in Astoria, Oregon, and had played together since junior high. Coach Howard Hobson told The Associated Press in 1988 that Anet, who passed away in 1981, was the heart of the Tall Firs. "He was the greatest floor general I ever had," said Hobson, who also coached at Yale and was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1965. "He sparked the team. He was its leader." Dick went on to serve 32 years in the U.S. Navy, enlisting the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and rising to the rank of rear admiral. He was at the final game played at Oregon's famed McArthur Court in 2011, and pumped his fist for the crowd when he was announced at halftime. He died later that year. Reserve guard Ford "Moon" Mullen went on to play baseball in the majors for the Philadelphia Blue Jays (Phillies) in 1944. Wintermute worked at Boeing. On the way to the first Big Dance , the Tall Firs won the Northern Division of the Pacific Coast Conference, then beat Southern Division champion California in a three-game series. The victory sent Oregon to the regional tournament on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, where the team beat Texas, 56-41, and Oklahoma, 55-37, before heading to Illinois for the title game via train. The eight-team NCAA Tournament was founded by the National Association of Basketball Coaches to compete with the National Invitation Tournament in New York. Denver-based writer Terry Frei, who grew up in Eugene and is the son of former Oregon football coach Jerry Frei, wrote a book about the Tall Firs called "March 1939: before the Madness." "They were so well-coached and they were big along the front line — almost revolutionarily big — and they had racehorse guards, especially the captain guard Bobby Anet, who kept everything in control," Frei said. "So I think it was a real complementary chemistry-type team far ahead of its time that way." Dick led all scorers with 13 points in the championship game against the Big Ten champions before maybe 5,000 fans, many of whom were given free tickets. Fans in Eugene listened to the game on the radio — it was the same year John Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath" was published and that "Gone with the Wind" came out in theaters — then later descended by the thousands at the local train station to welcome back the team. "They were largely for the most part small-town boys. Laddie Gale was from Oakridge, two of the starters were from Astoria, Slim Wintermute was from Longview, Washington, and John Dick was from The Dalles," Frei said. "So there was a small-town feel to the team, small-town heroes who stepped up big." Frei noted with a laugh that the players got $2 from a kitty to celebrate following the victory. Several of them took a train from the Northwestern campus into Chicago. "I think some of us had a couple of Heinekens or something," Frei quoted Anet as saying later. "It was quite late and none of us were big on bars or things like that, mainly because nobody ever had any money." » Next page...

The economic ties that bind China to the U.S. are primarily regional and run deep. Now, with a wild card in the White House, the Chinese want even more leverage should bilateral trade relations get hammered. China’s Ministry of Commerce says it’s working to expand various investment agreements with California, Texas, Iowa and other states, deals it estimates were worth $2.5 billion to U.S. and Chinese businesses in 2016 alone. "‘A good relationship between two nations is based on close connection between their peoples,’" said Sun Jiwen, a spokesman for the ministry, citing an old Chinese saying. "Province-state and intercity economic partnerships provide an important foundation for China-U.S. economic ties." While the outreach is a continuation of regional ties promoted for several years by Xi, it’s taken on added urgency as Trump’s economic team weighs whether to follow through on campaign-trail promises of tariffs of as much as 45 percent on Chinese goods. Read More: China Is Reviving the American Heartland, One Low Wage at a Time Part of the thinking is that making more American friends outside Washington could slow the push for protectionist measures, according to a person involved in the ministry’s campaign who asked not to be identified discussing its internal deliberations. Binding Ties If such cooperation flourishes, "it will not be easy for anyone to shake," says He Weiwen, a former ministry official who’s now deputy director of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization. Attention has focused on the massive trade deficit in trade of goods with China -- $347 billion in 2016, almost half of the U.S. total. But China, with its 1.37 billion people, is also among the top three export markets for 33 states.  Texas oil and gas producers, Michigan automakers and Georgia paper mills would all suffer if China were to impose import restrictions in response to American tariffs. China has also ramped up its investments in the U.S. -- by one estimate, they tripled last year to $45.6 billion -- which helps create the jobs Trump has promised. Bus Plant The Fuyao Glass facility in Moraine, Ohio. Photographer: Ty Wright/Bloomberg U.S.-China trade ties aren’t solely between Zhongnanhai and the White House. They’re forged in places like Moraine, Ohio, where American workers are employed by Fuyao Glass, a Chinese-owned company that bought part of a shuttered General Motors plant in 2014. Many of China’s cross-border investments are welcomed locally and aren’t the kind of deals that draw scrutiny from the U.S. government, which reviews foreign purchases for national security concerns. In Lancaster, California, a desert town north of Los Angeles hit hard by the financial crisis, the Republican mayor, R. Rex Parris, in 2008 began courting the Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co., which is part-owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. "Saved our city," he says of BYD’s electric bus plant in Lancaster. BYD now employs almost 500 there and anticipates tripling that within three years. "I’m telling people, ‘you’re going to have to not want a job to not have one,’" says Parris, who expects the local unemployment rate to drop to 2 percent. China’s Ministry of Commerce began formalizing the provincial-state ties in 2012, when Xi visited the U.S. and talked with governors including Iowa’s Terry Branstad, an old friend from a 1980s cultural exchange, about boosting trade opportunities.  California, Texas, Iowa, Michigan, New York, the state of Washington and the city of Chicago have since signed agreements with the Ministry of Commerce, calling for regular trade visits, business matchmaking and other exchanges. The deals cover 25 Chinese provinces and cities, which sent 22 delegations to the U.S. in 2016 while the U.S. organized 14 trips to China, according to the ministry. Trade Delegations Officials and executives from Shanghai made two visits last year to Chicago, which helped convince the popcorn maker Garrett Popcorn to choose the city for its first store in mainland China, according to a statement from Shanghai’s commerce commission.  In the manufacturing hub of Guangdong, officials plan a slate of cooperative activities this year, among them setting up a regional trade office in Los Angeles, hosting a biotech delegation from Massachusetts and sending representatives to an "Invest in America" summit sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Guangdong Commerce Department said in a written statement. Bob Honts, the owner of Texas Lone Star Enterprises LLC in Austin, Texas, accompanied Texas Governor Rick Perry on a trade mission to China in 2014. Honts, whose company raises investment money under the EB-5 visa program, says Chinese immigrants have put $200 million into real estate, oil exploration and other ventures in the state. Read More: Rich Chinese Rush to Fund U.S. Projects "To ignore the Chinese is like you’ve got this race car and you’re using three cylinders out of eight," says Honts, a Republican. "You can’t do that. We need to work with China." Trump hasn’t resolved tension in his administration between hardline advisers like Stephen Bannon, who has called for "economic nationalism," and such moderate voices as Branstad, who’s now slated to become Trump’s ambassador to China. Few companies have more to lose from a trade war than Boeing, which makes most of its commercial jetliners in Washington state and has collected $60.2 billion from deliveries to China since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That far outweighs the $800 million to $1 billion that Boeing spends a year on aircraft parts made in the People’s Republic, joint ventures and other operations.  Boeing Risk At Boeing Field in Seattle, many of the 737s lined up for testing are Chinese domestic carriers. But if would-be Chinese buyers get caught in the middle of a trade war, "they will simply buy Airbus," says Gary Locke, a former governor of the state who was also ambassador to China under former President Barack Obama. The state’s director of commerce, Brian Bonlender, is in China this week in preparation for a visit from provincial officials that had been planned for June but now has been pushed back to September and a planned trade mission led by Washington Governor Jay Inslee in August.

Sign Up Bonlender says his counterparts at the ministry in China have been more "engaged" and "helpful" since Trump’s election -- and seem especially focused on finding Chinese businesses with advanced ideas for investment projects and bringing them to the state’s attention. "We’re very encouraged" by the increased outreach, Bonlender says, adding that it’s likely due in part to the "changing tenor of international engagement" under Trump. — With assistance by Peter Robison, and Miao Han Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(John McDonnell /The Washington Post) Every so often, President Trump will don a virtual mortarboard and ensure that the citizens of the United States are up to speed on some of this nation’s great accomplishments and noteworthy leaders. He did it again on Wednesday, when he made sure that a panel discussion on women’s empowerment being held at the White House was familiar with perhaps-little-known women from history. Abigail Adams. Harriet Tubman. And Susan B. Anthony. Have you heard of Susan B. Anthony? “Have you heard of Susan B. Anthony?” Trump jokes at a women’s empowerment event at the White House pic.twitter.com/lhOljPGZj6 — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 29, 2017 “I’m shocked that you’ve heard of her,” Trump quipped. It then got a bit awkward, as Trump explained that Anthony dreamed of “an America where women themselves, as she said, ‘helped to make laws and elect the lawmakers.’ And that’s what’s happening more and more.” “Tough competition out there, I tell you!” Trump added. To save Trump time in future asides, we’ve made a brief list of people and events he has mentioned as being integral to history so that, should you ever be presented with a pop quiz by the president, you’ll be well-equipped to respond. We’ve listed them in alphabetical order. Susan B. Anthony As above: Feminist icon who envisioned a world where women won elected office. Frederick Douglass At a Black History Month event in February, Trump offered high praise for Douglass, who, Trump said, “is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice.” Douglass was an abolitionist and newspaper publisher, which Trump may not have known before praising him. The American flag In 2008, before he ran for office, Trump learned from Stephen Colbert why there were 13 stripes on the flag: to honor the 13 original American colonies. The Irish During a ceremony shortly before St. Patrick’s Day, Trump praised immigrants from the Emerald Isle. “Irish Americans played a vital role in preserving our union during its hour of greatest need,” Trump said. “So true. Played a very, very big role.” Specifically: During the Civil War, when Irish soldiers fighting for the Union helped subdue the Confederate rebels who sought to rip America in two. Abraham Lincoln The first Republican president, which “most people don’t even know.” Here’s that moment— Trump: "Most people don’t even know" Lincoln was a Republican, says PACs should take out an ad to promote that. pic.twitter.com/Hw9LrWqUFB — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) March 22, 2017 (There’s polling on this one. Most people did know that.) South Carolina “South Carolina has a long very, very proud military tradition and history,” Trump said during an event at a Boeing plant in the state last month. Included in that history: South Carolina’s effort at self-determination following its secession in 1861, an event undone when its Confederate soldiers were defeated in battle by brutal Union soldiers from the North. Rosie the Riveter Earlier this month, Trump made sure that those who watched his weekly address were familiar with this obscure assembly-line worker. Among the workers building B-24 bombers at the Willow Run plant during World War II was one tough lady. You might have heard of her: they called her Rosie the Riveter. And when Rosie’s country called her, she answered the call. If you hadn’t heard of her before, you have now. Space program “Almost half a century ago,” Trump said at a signing ceremony for NASA, “our brave astronauts first planted the American flag on the Moon. It was a big moment in our history.” Donald J. Trump Beneficiary of a historic electoral movement in November 2016, according to his official presidential biography: “Millions of Americans rallied behind his message of rebuilding our country and disrupting the status quo — this was a truly national victory and a historic movement.” That line follows this one: “He also won 306 electoral votes, the most for a Republican since George H.W. Bush in 1988.” In other words, he did better than George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By David Weigel By David Weigel March 29 at 5:30 PM Follow daveweigel No president has owed his rise to television more than Donald Trump, so it's fitting that no president is doing so much to enrich TV ad consultants. Just two months in office, the president has already been the focus of millions of dollars of spending on commercials meant to move his agenda through Congress, in part by counteracting the growing public mood that neither he nor the Republican-led Congress are doing anything good. The highest-profile ad, and the best, dropped Wednesday from the new Making America Great super PAC. As CNN's Teddy Schleifer reports, the group was founded after the megadonor Mercer family lost confidence in America First Policies, a super PAC that was intended to bolster the Trump political brand, but fell — in the usual, ironic fashion — to infighting. Are you flummoxed by the many pro-Trump commercials? We have you covered — here they are, ranked. 1. Making America Great Together (Making America Great) The Mercer family got what it paid for here — a clean, catchy spot that evokes Queen's “We Will Rock You” without having to pay royalties. (You don't become a billionaire by giving money to other people.) The ad credits a smiling Trump with all 298,000 jobs created in February, and thanks him on America's behalf for “reducing EPA regulations” and withdrawing from Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. (The Environmental Protection Agency is broadly popular, but TPP was not.) “America must put its own citizens first,” says Trump, in the joint address to Congress that still stands as the popular highlight of his first 70 days in office. 2. Making America Great Again (America First Policies) The first (and so far, only) spot from the original pro-Trump PAC is more granular, but also more generic, than it is successful. A message about the president “delivering on his promises” is matched with an image of Trump in front of a Boeing jet. The voice-over intones, “Mainstream media won't tell you this: One month in, President Trump is making America great again.” 3. Call to Defend President Trump (The Committee to Defend the President) The chintziest of these spots, and in a way the most on-brand with Trump's pre-presidency image, asks viewers of midday cable news to take a phone survey. “We need every Trump supporter to pick up the phone now!” hyperventilates an announcer. “We need the president to know he has the overwhelming support of the American people!” The threat: Democrats trying to slow Trump down with a “war room.” Not very scary, is it? Add in the fact that the ad was created by a Republican who opposed Trump up until he won the nomination, and it comes off more like a grab for money from the Trump brand than a persuasive spot. 4. Support the American Health Care Act (The American Action Network) The American Action Network and the Congressional Leadership Fund spent more than $10 million, combined, to build public support for the GOP's hastily constructed Obamacare replacement. The AAN went especially hard at conservative Republicans, with a short clip of Trump's joint session speech and a cry to “vote with President Trump.” But like most of the messaging around the American Health Care Act, it relied on bland talking points (“put patients and doctors in charge”) rather than the president's populist simplicity. Like the president, the groups trying to build support for his agenda do well with hype, but they struggle when it comes to policy.   politics the-fix Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

The potentially dangerous problem is caused by loss of cabin pressure during flight, and the Navy has called it the number one safety issue with the jet. “I am concerned about this growing trend — one that has a significant effect on readiness and one that needs to be fixed,” Ohio Republican Rep. Mike Turner, chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces subcommittee, said at the start of a hearing on the issue Tuesday. The issue, which affects both the Super Hornet and Growler models, “would appear to point to the onboard oxygen generating” according to a congressional staff memo reported by Bloomberg News Wednesday The Navy alone reported 297 incidents of oxygen deprivation for all types of F-18 between 2010 and 2015, according to Breaking Defense, and Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Niki Tsongas said that the number of incidents in 2016 were worse. From October through December, there were 13 incidents of what the Navy calls “physiological episodes,” defined as an episode when a pilot experiences loss of performance due to lack of oxygen or cabin depressurization, Turner said in the hearing. “Since May 1, 2010, all models” of the F-18 “show steady, yearly increases in the number of physiological episodes,” according to the memo reported by Bloomberg News. The oxygen issue is important as President Donald Trump considers making “a big order” of F-18s to boost combat capabilities. “By the way, do you care if we use the F-18 Super Hornets?” Trump said a crowd at the Boeing factory in February. “We are looking seriously at a big order,” Trump said. (RELATED: Trump To Boeing: Expect ‘A Big Order’ Of Super Hornets) Trump has pushed buying F-18s over Lockheed Martin’s fifth generation F-35 fighter jet, a program he says has been too expensive for taxpayers. The Navy has shown some improvement in addressing the problem at the start of 2017, but the “lack of overall progress” is “of great concern,” Tsongas, said. All branches of the military depend on the F-18 as the primary fighter as the F-35 slowly enters the service. The real problem is an overall readiness issue and the difficulty in finding replacement parts for aircraft, according to military officials who testified at the hearing. The military is making progress to address readiness issues, but “it’s a fragile progress,” Lt. Gen. Jon Davis, deputy Marine Corps. commandant for aviation, told the subcommittee.

AMRO and CEPA, both based in Washington, DC, have also presented the recommendations to President Donald Trump and his administration, according to a press release by AMRO. Prime Minister Grindeanu met on Wednesday with a delegation representing U.S. companies with interests in Romania led by AMRO president Eric Stewart. AMRO is an NGO that promotes commercial relations between U.S. and Romania. The full list of AMRO members is available here. “AMRO and CEPA convened in Washington a panel of top-level Romania experts in business and policy to identify the five priorities and additional specific actions outlined in our Roadmap to Prosperity,” Stewart said. “A bilateral economic and commercial agenda based on these priorities will lead to a mutually beneficial increase in jobs and investment in both the United States and Romania.” The five priorities are: continued business environment improvements in Romania; high-level bilateral government engagement and dialogue on commercial matters; greater cooperation in developing strategic security capabilities, including energy; support for a Romanian education and health system that strengthens economic competitiveness; and assistance for pioneer Romanian investments in the United States. “Our countries have always been very good friends and we hope our economic relationship to become as good as the political one. Romania has many competitive advantages, most notably the education,” Stewart also said. Prime Minister Grindeanu also said that the strategic partnership between US and Romania would undergo a significant development from an economic standpoint as well. “We have talked concrete things, specific projects that we can develop and that we will develop in the coming years (…), including in the healthcare sector, defense, transports, energy, finance, and so on,” Grindeanu said. AMRO president Eric Stewart presented the letter to Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu at a meeting during the organization’s Fifth Annual Business Mission to Romania. The delegation this year comprises thirteen American companies: Amgen, Archer Daniels Midland, Bell Helicopter, The Boeing Company, ExxonMobil, General Dynamics, Medtronic, Mega Company, MetLife, Oshkosh Defense, Pfizer, Smithfield Foods, and Timken. The representatives of these companies were to have to days of meetings with Romanian government officials to discuss cooperation opportunities in their fields. The AMRO letter acknowledges Romania’s good economic results and the progress made in improving the business environment and making it more predictable. “Accordingly, U.S. companies are increasingly looking to invest and do business in Romania.

PDT March 29, 2017 President Donald Trump walks down the stairs after arriving on Air Force One at the Palm Beach International Airport to spend part of the weekend at Mar-a-Lago resort on February 17, 2017 in West Palm Beach, Florida.(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Photo: Joe Raedle, 2017 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST KIRKLAND, Wash. - A widely shared story that claims to include photos of a recently delivered plane that will serve as Air Force One for President Donald Trump is false. The pictures included in the story do not show the presidential plane and are conceptual renderings from a Kirkland-based outfitter of luxury aircraft.     Versions of the story posted by usanewsflash.com and freedomdaily.com said Trump negotiated luxurious accommodations for the plane and the interior now resembles that of Trump's apartment in New York's Trump Tower. The accounts includes photos of what they say is the interior of the plane.     The photos are from Kirkland, Washington-based Greenpoint Technologies, a company that specializes in making luxury modifications to wide-body aircraft. Greenpoint spokeswoman Christine Hadley told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the pictures do not depict Air Force One and are "conceptual renderings only, not for one specific customer." Images appearing in the story can be seen in this video from Greenpoint.     "As part of the perks of being the president with golden taste and fierce negotiation skills to support the luxe accommodations on a 'dime,' you get an Air Force One that resembles that of the Trump Tower in Manhattan." wrote Amanda Shea, who authored the freedomdaily.com version of the report. Trump has sought to negotiate with Boeing over costs for a pair of new 747 jets to serve as Air Force One. The new planes wouldn't be ready until 2023 or 2024, which would be at the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election. ___     This story is part of an ongoing Associated Press effort to fact-check claims in suspected false news stories. © 2017 KING-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS A stranger emailed me a warning about blood clots.

Border-adjustment has also so dominated the tax-reform debate that some say lawmakers have barely begun to consider the myriad other hugely controversial changes the plan would make” [Politico]. Politics New Cold War This morning in Links, on the same story, I asked “So will Cheney become a liberal icon now, like Bush?” After lunch, I had my answer! Never thought I&#39;d find myself agreeing with Dick Cheney. . . https://t.co/cRBisvpTop &mdash; Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) March 27, 2017 Also, compare the Politico headline, at 03/27/17 04:08 PM: Cheney: Russian meddling possibly ‘an act of war’ With WaPo’s headline, at March 28 at 12:23 PM Cheney delivers a statement on Russian meddling: It’s an ‘act of war’ Planted or not, this is impressive: Lindsey Graham opened his town hall yesterday with a monologue on Russia, then fielded *nine* Russia-related Qs. from (Dem) constituents. &mdash; Michael Tracey (@mtracey) March 27, 2017 “My hunch is that … the 2016 campaign-collusion story will turn out to be a dead end. Much more interesting is the saga of the formation of Trump’s views of Russia over the last twenty-five years” [David Warsh]. Summarizing Warsh’s informed speculation, the Trump+Russia story is more likely to be a New York real estate story starting back in the 90s; Warsh aggregates some actual reporting to that effect. Who remembers Geraldine Ferraro? “The Devin Nunes wiretapping saga, explained” [WaPo]. We seem to have reached the Benghazi hairball stage. Anyhow, here’s a timeline. Health Care UPDATE “How Democrats Aided in the Demise of the GOP’s Health Bill” [Wall Street Journal]. If you’re looking for an explanation of why the #SaveTheACA crowd “never, ever” mentioned #MedicareForAll, the roster of Democrat establishment flexians involved in this effort may help. “With AHCA defeat, some Democrats see chance to push for universal coverage” [WaPo]. This story… [Please allow me a moment to pound my head on my desk. There. Thank you]. Quoting: At their first town meeting since the Republicans’ surprise surrender on the Affordable Care Act, progressives in blue America celebrated — then asked for more. Rhode Island’s two Democratic senators, joined by Rep. Jim Langevin, told several hundred happy constituents that the next step in health reform had to mean expanded coverage, provided by the government. “We have to look harder at a single-payer system,” said Langevin (D-R.I.), using a term for universal coverage. “I’m old enough to have voted for a single-payer system in the House,” said Sen. Jack Reed, Rhode Island’s senior senator. “The very best market-based solution is to have a public option,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said. I’m happy that the voters are asking for more after a victory. That’s a very good sign. I’m unhappy that the idiot reporter doesn’t point out that universal coverage and the so-called “public option” are not the same. I’m extremely unhappy with Whitehouse’s “Because markets.” Really, who cares? I’m even more unhappy with the effing career “progressives” of 2009-2010, who introduced the so-called “public option” to run interference for Obama by suppressing single payer, and introduced the brand confusion between it, and genuine Medicare for All, a confusion that persists to this day and allows Whitehouse to go all flaccid on policy. And I’m terrified that Sanders is going to screw things up, since the “public option” discourse has polluted everything it ever touched. See here. Since given the givens, we’re not going to get either single payer or the so-called “public option” before 2018, why not run on the best possible policy, one that voters support, instead of, like Obama, pre-compromising? Trump Transition “Trump’s morally repugnant budget must be defeated: Sen. Bernie Sanders” [USA Today]. Sanders: “Far from compassionate, this budget — if enacted — would be one of the cruelest in American history. In the words of former Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the four star general who warned us about the power of the military industrial complex, it, ‘signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.'” “Talking to a friend at lunch not long ago, he expressed his amazement that the House and Senate leadership didn’t have bills “lined up like airplanes on a runway” ready to take off in the new year. I was surprised, too” [Glenn Reynolds, USA Today]. “The continuing infrastructure fiasco” [DC Velocity]. “On March 2, the U.S. Conference of Mayors also weighed in on the subject, pressing the federal government to distribute infrastructure funds directly to cities, bypassing the states. In short, the entire problem has gotten out of control. There still is no sign of an overall plan for the needed improvements. And the funding issue is far from resolved. Many of our needs will not be attractive to investors. And even if private investors step up to finance specific road and bridge projects, they will have to be repaid, which means the costs will ultimately be passed on to users. We could easily find ourselves paying tolls and user fees, plus increased state taxes, leaving us in a worse position than we would have been in if Congress had simply raised fuel taxes in the first place. And as far as the ‘new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, and railways gleaming across our beautiful land,; good luck with that one.” More New York real estate: “Paul Manafort’s Puzzling New York Real Estate Purchases” [WYNC]. “Manafort’s New York City transactions follow a pattern: Using shell companies, he purchased the homes in all-cash deals, then transferred the properties into his own name for no money and then took out hefty mortgages against them, according to property records.” 2016 Post Mortem “To the extent Democratic turnout was weak, it was mainly among black voters. Even there, the scale of Democratic weakness has been exaggerated” [New York Times]. “Instead, it’s clear that large numbers of white, working-class voters shifted from the Democrats to Mr. Trump. Over all, almost one in four of President Obama’s 2012 white working-class supporters defected from the Democrats in 2016, either supporting Mr. Trump or voting for a third-party candidate.” As usual, I would like to see “white” removed, surgically if necessary, from “working class,” to see what new possibilities open up. I would bet that black working class rejection of Democrats is expressed as low turnout (anecdotes from IIRC Milwaukee here), since they couldn’t bring themselves to vote for Trump. It sure is puzzling that all those white racists checked their privilege and voted for Obama twice, though. Funny, life! Realignment and Legitimacy “A Haunting Debut Looks Ahead to a Second American Civil War” [New York Times]. “Set in the closing decades of the 21st century and the opening ones of the 22nd, El Akkad’s novel recounts what happened during the Second American Civil War between the North and South and its catastrophic aftermath. It is a story that extrapolates the deep, partisan divisions that already plague American politics and looks at where those widening splits could lead. A story that maps the palpable consequences for the world of accelerating climate change and an unraveling United States. A story that imagines what might happen if the terrifying realities of today’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — drone strikes, torture, suicide bombers — were to come home to America.” Zeitgeist watch… “A conversation continued over health care” [Castle Rock News]. Local report on Indivisible group in Colorado. No mention of single payer. “North Carolina’s ‘Bathroom Bill’ Could Cost the State More Than $3 Billion” [AP]. “Lemons: Gun-Totin’ Left-Wingers Demonstrate at the Arizona Capitol: Is Bloodshed on the Horizon?” [Phoenix New Times]. “Calexit: The “Bad Boys of Brexit” throw their weight behind move to split state” [Mercury News]. Stats Watch Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index, March 2017: “Manufacturing activity in the Fifth District expanded for the fifth consecutive month in March” [Econoday]. “The robust strength in manufacturing reported by the Fifth District is in line with strength seen in other regional reports, but it has yet to translate to similar strength in actual factory data out of Washington.” International Trade in Goods, February 2017: “A sharp 2.1 percent drop in imports helped to narrow a smaller-than-expected $64.8 billion goods deficit in February, masking however another weak showing for exports which edged 0.1 percent lower” [Econoday]. “Also released with this report are advance data on wholesale and retail inventories, both of which rose 0.4 percent in February. These inventory readings may help GDP estimates, where inventory builds are a positive, but not the outlook for production and employment which may suffer if the builds, during this period of slow growth, turn out in fact to be unwanted.” Wholesale Inventories [Advance], February 2017: “Wholesale inventories rose 0.4 percent in February with nondurables up 0.9 percent vs only a 0.1 percent rise for the key durable goods component” [Econoday]. Retail Inventories [Advance], February 2017: “Retail inventories rose 0.4 percent in February which looks heavy following an upward revised 0.9 percent rise in January. Year-on-year, retail inventories are up 3.9 percent and may be heavy given how slow February retail sales proved to be” [Econoday]. “Inventories are especially heavy at auto dealers, up 1.1 percent in the month and 9.5 percent year-on-year reflecting contraction so far in this year’s vehicle sales.” Consumer Confidence, March 2017: “It was two cycles ago that the consumer confidence index has been this high” [Econoday]. “At 113.8, the expectations component hasn’t been this high since September 2000. The present situation component is at 143.1 for its best reading since August 2001 which was just at the end of the 1991 to 2001 economic cycle…. Consumers are extremely upbeat right now though the lack of inflation expectations doesn’t quite fit. What else doesn’t fit is actual consumer spending which has failed to match the strength underway in confidence.” Yet again…. And: “An important element will be whether increased confidence in the outlook translates into increased spending or whether there is a move to raise precautionary savings despite higher confidence” [Economic Calendar]. And: “Unusual strength in confidence readings has been the standout feature of the post-election economy. The consumer confidence index has yet to slow, pressing to new cycle highs in February as the spread between optimists and pessimists continued to widen” [247 Wall Street]. State Street Investor Confidence Index, March 2017: “The rise in the confidence of global institutional investors was driven by a sharp increase in the European component, which rose 11.9 points to 95. The Asian component also rose, increasing by 5.3 points to 109.6, but the North American sub-index fell by 0.3 points to 91.6” [Econoday]. “State Street said the return of European investor confidence after a sharp decline in February was due to an easing of political tensions following the Dutch elections, as well as as sustained economic momentum on the back of positive economic surprises in the region. The stalling of U.S. investor confidence, on the other hand, shows understandable caution given the strong run-up in stocks and the simultaneous exit from historically low rates, which has not been experienced before.” S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, January 2017: “are on the climb” [Econoday]. “The geographic widening in strength is a special plus of this report, one that points to a solid, though not spectacular, contribution from housing.” Commodities: “Canada’s IC Potash Corp. (TSX:ICP) is creating a new research and development subsidiary called ICP Organics to focus on enhancing yields for cannabis growers and increasing the health impact and effects for consumers” [Mining.com]. Retail: “The much-talked-about ‘no cashier convenience store’ called Amazon Go to be launched by e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. through its ‘Project Como’ has got delayed.” [Zacks]. “Amazon has been testing the store at its campus in Seattle, with employees serving as beta testers. Reportedly, the store has been functioning well if there are just a few customers and are moving at a slow pace. As it is not feasible to ask customers to keep a check on their pace, the opening of these stores had to be postponed.” This sounds to me like another idea that MBAs and techies think is great but is in fact stupid. From my small town perspective: First, I like having a cashier. The human contact is good! Second, if there’s no cashier, there’s still going to be a human: A cop in a car, to prevent customers from being robbed. In other words, in good Walmart fashion, the social protective function once served by the cashier will now be funded by me, through my property taxes. Go, Jeff! Manufacturing: “The future of U.S. manufacturing is increasingly being built through automation, and it looks like the robots are coming from abroad” [Wall Street Journal]. “Commerce Department data show the U.S. last year ran a trade deficit of $4.1 billion in advanced “flexible manufacturing” goods with Japan, the European Union and Switzerland, which lead the industry—double the 2003 deficit. The gap poses a big policy problem: As the U.S. tries to increase industrial production, companies probably will have to import the kind of advanced machinery needed to keep American factories competitive. Consolidation in industrial robotics, including big buys by China’s Midea Group and Japan’s Fanuc Corp., and what one expert says is a “brain drain” in American expertise has left a gap in U.S. domestic production, leaving manufacturers looking for imports for innovation.” But we’re still #1 in fabulously expensive bespoke weaponry and financial scams. And opioids. So not to worry. Shipping: “Weak import volumes have left Brazil without the necessary empty containers to fulfil export potential, trapping it in a Catch-22 situation that will hinder long-term economic growth” [The Loadstar]. “This is the view of Antonio Dominguez, [Managing Director] of Maersk Line’s east coast South America cluster, who said carriers could no longer be expected to carry the burden of such inefficiencies.” Political Risk: “[Former BLS head Kathleen Utgoff] isn’t afraid that the Trump Administration will meddle with statistical methodologies or the numbers they produce; that would require co-opting thousands of career government surveyors, statisticians, and economists in an effort to alter data collected from hundreds of thousands of businesses and citizens. (Even Richard Nixon, who, in 1971, hatched a plan to rid the B.L.S. of what he thought was a “Jewish cabal” out to destroy him, was unable to undercut the bureau’s independence.) Nor does anyone object to the reasonable arguments about which unemployment rate (there are six of them) best reflects the true state of the economy. The danger is that a President who disparages the data might convince his followers that bad economic news is political propaganda, and offer numbers that have no statistical rigor behind them” [The New Yorker]. “Good economic statistics benefit the left and the right, government and business. Without reliable data, businesses can’t take risks on investments. Boeing, for example, decides how many 787 Dreamliners to build and therefore how many people to employ based on its Current Market Outlook forecast, which is rooted in B.L.S. data and projects aircraft demand for the next twenty years.” The Fed: “We note the contrasting projections by the Atlanta and New York Federal Reserve’s GDP trackers. The Atlanta Fed’s model has the US economy slowing to a 1.0% annualized pace in Q1. This would be just below the average Q1 pace beginning in 2010. However, the New York Fed’s model has the economy tracking 3.0%. The market (Bloomberg median) is smack in between” [Brown Brothers Harriman, Across the Curve]. Heck, what’s a mere 2% difference? The Fed: “Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan said on Monday that he will support further interest rate adjustments if the U.S. economy continues to show progress” [Economic Calendar].

Eric Bedingfield once shunned all marijuana use, but when his eldest son’s six-year struggle with opioid addiction ended with his overdose a year ago, the conservative Republican co-sponsored medical cannabis legislation” [Post and Courier (DK)]. “‘My mindset has changed from somebody who looked down on it as a negative substance to saying, ‘This has benefits,” Bedingfield said recently. The 50-year-old teetotaler believes marijuana may effectively wean addicts from an opioid dependence. Ultimately, the Marine veteran hopes medical marijuana can be an alternative to people being prescribed OxyContin or other opioid painkillers to begin with, helping curb an epidemic he’s seen destroy families of all economic levels.” Water Michael Burry, courtesy phone please! “Managers with the Oregon Water Resources Department have handed out rights to pump water while pleading ignorance about how much was actually available. They have approved new pumping for irrigation even as their own scientists warned it could hurt the water table, interviews and state records show” [The Oregonian]. “Some irrigators are so confident their permits will be approved, they sink wells first and file the paperwork later. Andy Root, a Harney County rancher who began pumping without state approval, said it has long been common practice in the area. He’s since applied to obtain a water permit years after he began pumping.” “Thousands of farmers in the parched Mexican border city of Mexicali are protesting plans by Constellation Brands to build a $1.4 billion plant there, the WSJ’s Robbie Whelan reports, and want President Donald Trump to push for the brewery to move to the U.S. side of the border. The farmers worry that the plant will use too much water, taxing an area where aging irrigation infrastructure and a low water table have already forced farmers to pull tens of thousands of acres out of production” [Wall Street Journal]. “The best estimate is that at present India uses 230-250 cubic kilometres of groundwater each year. This accounts for about one-quarter of the global groundwater use. More than 60% of irrigated agriculture and 85% of domestic water use now depends on groundwater. India now uses more groundwater than China and the United States combined” [Quartz]. “According to official assessments by the Indian ministry of water resources, in 2004, around 29% of the groundwater blocks were critical, semi-critical or over-exploited. It also concluded that the situation was deteriorating rapidly. In 2014, the central groundwater board noted that the number of over-exploited districts increased from 3% in 1995 to 15% in 2011.” Guillotine Watch “But the deafening din crackled with the spirit of a communal rally. [Hamilton] full-throated affirmation of diversity, inclusion and tolerance has taken on new urgency now that these values have fallen under sharp attack. “Hamilton” has become part of the resistance” [Los Angeles Times].

Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

I was surprised, too.” This is an enduring mystery. Recall 1994, when Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America really did have ten bills lined up like airplanes on a runway. From an R party perspective, it was hugely successful. They won back majority control of the House after a 40-year hiatus, and proceeded to enact six or seven of the ten bills. But in the following 1996 election, and all those thereafter, no “accountability” promises were offered again. WHY? One can only surmise that politicians fear accountability like vampires flinch from silver crosses (bearing in mind that there may be some overlap between these two demographics — reportedly some House members only come out at night). Reply ↓ Pirmann March 28, 2017 at 3:02 pm What that tells me is, aside from a couple of tweaks here and there, the Republicans pretty much got their agenda pushed through during the 0bama administration, so no substantive changes needed to be lined up for this one. Reply ↓ OpenThePodBayDoorsHAL March 28, 2017 at 4:45 pm Ding ding ding we have a winner 7 years to construct an ObamaCare alternative but why bother? Since you got the Heritage Foundation version implemented already.

Reply ↓ Marina Bart March 28, 2017 at 7:52 pm I don’t think this is correct. The corporatist neoliberals may be content, but the Freedom Caucus certainly isn’t. It seems clear to me that the bigger problem is that there is no consensus in the caucus on the role of government. Once Trump won the nomination, the Republicans in the Congress had no incentive to work on bills. He had no pre-existing constituency among the elected. He’s not a Freedom Caucus guy and he’s not (left to his own devices) a Koch guy. Even if they thought he had a chance to win, what he was saying he wanted to do wasn’t relevant to them. And I’m sure they all thought he would lose. The party tried to block him from the nomination, and then in the fall, it tried again to side with Clinton and get her elected. Under those condition, no Trumpian bills could be or would be developed, and those opposed to him and his expressed policy preferences had no reason to craft bills in case he won, either. Reply ↓ sleepy March 28, 2017 at 3:20 pm Perhaps because the status-quo has become so comfortable for the duopoly that there’s little need to offer things like actual laws, other than their utility as campaign rhetoric.

Reply ↓ Steely Glint March 28, 2017 at 7:17 pm That’s because he had aids who knew how to write legislation. After Newt (that vile creature) got rid of those aids, who provided advise to both sides of the aisle & went to partisan $$$ think tanks congress “forgot” how to write bills. I remember one Congress woman stating before the ACA passage that they would have to sharpen their pencils and relearn how to write legislation. As much as I would love to see Medicare for all, as long as $$ rules the day, I believe we would see a whittling away of Medicare as we know it, so people would have to purchase private insurance supplemental policies. http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaug-2014/the-big-lobotomy/ Reply ↓ Roger Smith March 28, 2017 at 2:19 pm “Hijab becomes symbol of resistance, feminism in the age of Trump” [USA Today].

Reply ↓ Katharine March 28, 2017 at 5:43 pm You called her oppressed because of what she chooses to wear. Excuse me for reading that as a judgment of what she should wear: it certainly appears that by your standards she would only not be oppressed if she chose as you think she should. I thought the idea of hijab as feminist act was no more than mildly interesting till I saw the way you reacted to it. Who do you think you are to judge her? Why can you not show her the elementary respect of believing that she makes her own choices without coercion? Reply ↓ Marina Bart March 28, 2017 at 7:58 pm Katherine, are you really unaware of the phenomenon of internalized misogyny and internalized hatred of oneself as “other”? There are women who hate women, black people who hate blackness. It starts very early. The New Testament includes Paul’s letters enforcing the covering of women’s hair. This is a very, very, very old ploy. Are you also fine with the Duggar girls not being allowed to go to school and then married off to pop out babies until their uteruses (uteri?) collapse? They will tell you they are making a free choice. Are they? Is it a choice when a girl hyper-sexualizes herself? Those seven year olds in bikinis? Is that a choice?

If that happens to coincide with what conservative Muslim men want her to do rather than with what you want her to do, too bad for you. You still do not appear to grasp that grown women can make their own choices and that your opinion is irrelevant. I refrained from spelling that out in my previous comment, because I was trying to be nice, but evidently nice won’t work. There are times–and when women with no connection to you choose their clothes is one–when your opinion is wholly irrelevant. Reply ↓ Vatch March 28, 2017 at 5:33 pm I don’t want her to do anything!

Dressing this way seems deliberately antagonistic and provocative to me. And, considering the religious implications for similarly clothed women globally (I’m thinking stones here) that this garb represents, I find the tortured explanation of expressions of american feminism to be pure, unmitigated bullshit. In my own defense, I would say that I extend my critique to female newscasters and politicians in four-inch heels displaying acres of boobs and miles of cleavage and expecting to be taken seriously. A distinction without a difference. I have a brain too. Don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining.. Reply ↓ Katharine March 28, 2017 at 6:11 pm You call this antagonistic and provocative? “Everyone deserves to choose their self identity,” she said. “If it is OK in the society for women to show their skin then it should also be OK for them to cover up.” Sorry, looks like a plain statement of equity to me. Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen March 28, 2017 at 7:08 pm I call the hijab antagonistic and provocative, and I stand by that call. There are plenty of articles of clothing, readily available in any american store, with which one can “cover up” if “modesty” is one’s religiously inspired aim. As near as I can tell, the hijab covers hair (kind of), not skin. So what’s this really all about? Reply ↓ Katharine March 28, 2017 at 7:28 pm I call your condemnation of the hijab antagonistic and provocative. Last I heard, we had free exercise of religion in this country, and if anyone, of any religion, wants to dress in a way they regard as religiously meaningful, I stand by their right to do it. Reply ↓ Optimader March 28, 2017 at 8:29 pm So , Katherine, you would not be offended if in my kay es mas macho religious belief i choose to wear a fleshtone tank top? Just the tanktop? Would you defend me in that religiously driven clothibg (or lack of it ) practice? I do my morning walk by the local grammar school BTW. Marina Bart March 28, 2017 at 7:35 pm I’m with Katniss. I’m appalled that we’re now being asked to accept the hijab as a “feminist” statement. It’s not. Are you also down with women consenting to have their daughter’s clitoris excised? I mean, that’s the next step here. In case the success of Hillary Clinton didn’t make it clear, lots of women consent to abide by misogynist control, for a wide variety of reasons. Internalized misogyny is a thing, in case you have never met a female anti-choice activist from among the evangelical community that used to not care about abortion at all. I don’t know whether it makes sense to ban hijabs from public school, and I would never force a woman to remove it by law, but come on. This is misogyny 101. Do men have to cover their hair? Why is covering her hair important to her? This goes back literally thousands of years. Enforcing the covering up and hiding of women’s bodies is part of hyper-eroticising them to weaken their ability to participate in public life, facilitate male sexual objectivity of them while putting the onus on the women for any sexual violence against them, and literally render them less visible as people. Reply ↓ Katharine March 28, 2017 at 7:45 pm Don’t be ridiculous! I have said only, and repeatedly, that I support women’s (or men’s) right to dress as they choose, and to suggest that means I would support their efforts to mutilate other persons is absurd and offensive. Why can you not respect other people enough to let them make purely personal choices that are different from those you would make? What kind of power trip is this? dcrane March 29, 2017 at 3:08 am I think that we’re focusing on the wrong issue. We’re critiquing a woman’s choice of clothing, rather than how the men and other woman in society treat that woman depending on which choice she made. hunkerdown March 28, 2017 at 6:10 pm Daily reminder that female modesty including veiling was normalized in the West early on by Greeks. Also, please look up “purdah”. That you choose to see women setting themselves apart from male society as a violation of Western norms is simply a liberal reflex, and really kind of embarrassing.

Indeed, the only point in complaining about it when the US sends them the materiel they use to enforce the subjugation of women is to soothe one’s conscience or to create an opportunity for moral dispensation. I don’t buy that “we’ve” moved past anything. If we oughtn’t take cues from boy-diddlers, we must disavow the entire history and most of the present of Western civilization, because they still run the joint. Reply ↓ Plenue March 28, 2017 at 11:10 pm “If anything, Wahhabists got it from the tradition of the “forefathers of Democracy™” in the West.” Bullshit. Regardless, you’re proving my point. Screw the Greeks and their bad ideas. And the present of Western civilization is in large an extension and expansion of basic ideas from the ancient world, changed in ways those ancients would most definitely not approve of. The United States itself was explicitly based on Roman and Athenian Greek ideas. Most of the things we equate with US democracy, things like universal voter enfranchisement, were never the vision of either our founders or the people they based their new government on. We didn’t even have direct election of Senators until 1913. The story of US democracy is one of clawing real democratic values out of the cold, dead hands of wannabe Athenians. Reply ↓ marieann March 28, 2017 at 5:59 pm I agree the hijab can be a choice. When I was a good little catholic girl I went to Mass wearing a hat or a little black veil. I never really thought about it but I didn’t really have a choice, women and girls had to cover their hair, if I didn’t I wouldn’t be allowed in Mass, to miss Mass is a sin and I could go to Hell, I was taught this in school Nowhere in the bible or the Koran does it say that women have to cover their hair ( what is it about friggin’ hair that bothers the religious anyway) ; it is a cultural thing. The good thing is when I was older I could ditch the brainwashing. To live in a country where the brainwashing is so strong means you don’t get to choose, and you grow up thinking it is your choice. I had a friend who wore the veil and from what she says it was never a choice, family pressure was the reason she dressed the way she did. Reply ↓ JustAnObserver March 28, 2017 at 8:07 pm A Hijab is NOT the same as a Veil! A hijab is just a bloody headscarf with a fancy name. I can remember 80s London when no Sloane Ranger worthy of the name would be without her Hermes headscarf (o.k. in a pinch Liberty would do). Did that make them oppressed by men ? by religion ? O.k. just like all junkies started by smoking weed (or drinking milk) there is the ever present danger that today the headscarf => tomorrow the burqa => emigration to Saudi Arabia is just around the corner. /s Reply ↓ Plenue March 28, 2017 at 8:08 pm “what is it about friggin’ hair that bothers the religious anyway” You could ask that about a lot of things. The Abrahamic G-d, Lord of Lords & King of Kings, The Alpha & Omega, The Almighty, The Merciful (/sarcasm) regularly comes across as nothing so much as a petulant child. A raging sociopath who throws a smiting hissy-fit at the merest minor infraction (not to mention decreeing the stupidest things to be infractions in the first place). Polytheist religions at least generally acknowledge that their gods are petty and vain, and that sacrificing to them is at least as much about convincing them to not actively screw you over as it is about getting them to support you. Show me a jihadi with the worlds worst facial hair, and I’ll show you the true face of Faith.

Reply ↓ Katharine March 28, 2017 at 7:50 pm Did you read the article? Reply ↓ clinical wasteman March 28, 2017 at 11:27 pm !+10,000+! “Sorry for you” will do for internet comments, but it goes to another level when, as in several European countries among other places, it becomes a police matter. (Sumptuary Laws, they used to call that in those same European countries only a few hundred years ago. It was explicitly about knowing your place in the social-economic caste system.) No amount of anecdotal or statistical evidence that some hijab-wearing Muslim women are oppressed (by family members, religious or community organizations etc, as well as by the state, employers … i.e. just like countless non-veiled, non-Muslim women … and men) is relevant at all here, because it’s all about whether or not you claim the right to try to make her do as you think she ought when she says she doesn’t want to. Maybe you suspect she was coerced into saying that, but presuming to know other people better than they know themselves is the ugliest habit of Blairite social SWAT teams, Sunnstein-Thaler-style ‘Nudge’ bullies, Toughlovers tabloid editors and … oh yeah, religious authoritarians at best; at worst it’s the habit of the same sort of people but with actual political power. Apart from a few protests in France about the infamous new Sumptuary laws there (women forced off beaches for showing too little skin), I’ve heard of few hijab-wearning women — few people at all other than liberal columnists actually — trying to claim ‘subversive feminist’ status for the scarf, and I live in a country where this is a routine shrieking point of pro-cultural-“integration” (i.e. not the Civil Rights Movement sense but forced conformity to imaginary British Vales as defined by lifestyle choices) media. The wry comments in this thread risk confusing a few other commentators (who don’t wear a veil but do spout about its “subversiveness”) with a great many more women who do, but don’t. For the latter — and for anyone else whose “cultural”, i.e. non-self-explanatory, needs are presumed and policed from above (eg.”offensive” speakers, “mis”users [not industrial-scale shippers] of Harmful substances, fans of Chief Keef in Chicago or Bashment raves in Croydon, refusers of nationally-specific Minutes of Silence/war memorials), etc etc it’s a matter of elementary respect. Ideally, respect would mean respite from other people trying to tell us what’s good for us — but the mere telling might be bearable if they would stop sending cops to force us to swallow it. Reply ↓ Dandelion March 29, 2017 at 3:42 am Well, that would be the neoliberal expression of feminism. Class-based feminism takes into account t the fact that no choice is made in a vacuum and also considers the effect of women’s choices on the global class women as a whole. Oppression is structural, not individual, and the hijab is very definitely a form of structural oppression, encoded in religious and secular law to enforce the submission of women. Reply ↓ wilroncanada March 29, 2017 at 10:04 pm Thanks Katherine.

Reply ↓ todde March 28, 2017 at 11:57 pm Are women who have to wear a top in public oppressed? Reply ↓ DJG March 28, 2017 at 3:56 pm What are you missing? Well, you don’t mention the deeper cause, which is the continuing crisis of monotheism. Just as one of the nice Christian ladies is quoted as saying that her dress is modest, too (and her husband will approve), so we are getting lots of enforced modesty these days. Further, what you missed telling us is that the obsession with women’s hair is part of a Semitic paradigm, because it turns up in Judaism, too. So this is deeply seated. And then there’s Good Ole Saint Paul, the guy who ruined the Beatitudes, who insisted women should cover their hair in church and not speak. Meaning: Women in Greek culture didn’t cover their heads in the temple (Romans did, to avoid evil spirits) and that there were rituals led by Greek and Roman women. See Jane Ellen Harrison’s magisterial Prolegomena to Greek Religion for women’s rituals. And what you were missing is the recent bad faith in attempting to compare the hijab to the habits of Catholic and Orthodox nuns. This came up as a metaphor in the burkini controversies. A little problem there: Nuns take vows and follow a rule (as do monks). They are not part of secular society. But what does religion in practice matter when we are all “spiritual” and metaphorical? So we are back at the same issue: What is equality for women? What is compulsion? What should a secularized culture accept? France and la laïcité may have a point. All that said, I don’t have a problem with women wearing the hijab. And there are many women who do so up here in the northern neighborhoods of Chicago. Just don’t try to sell me a bill of goods about agency, because I have seen Middle-Eastern men look right through the woman in the hijab. And don’t lecture me on “modesty.” Reply ↓ ChrisAtRU March 28, 2017 at 5:37 pm Well Lambert/RS, just because the Fauxistance is futile, doesn’t mean the Empire isn’t evil … ;-) Reply ↓ reslez March 28, 2017 at 6:48 pm Hijab may make one feel trendy and open-minded but it is not a fashion statement. To try to characterize it as such is to trivialize and ignore the rising history of oppression against women and loss of women’s rights in the Middle East since the 1960s. Hijab was considered a laughable, paleolithic demand of ultra-religious conservatives as little as 40 years ago. Choosing to wear it is like a freed slave choosing to wear an iron collar. At bare minimum it sends the wrong message. Wearing it means being completely conscious of that message and supporting it. Trivializing it is a mistake, one possible only for comfortable liberals in the West. Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen March 28, 2017 at 7:10 pm Thank you for this.

Reply ↓ clinical wasteman March 28, 2017 at 11:38 pm “Trivializing” or not is one thing, but legislation, i.e. policing, is another. I’m a commie not a liberal, but I’m offended on what I guess must be liberal-equivalent grounds when anyone presumes to guess my motives for doing anything, and I’m absolutely unwilling to be made to do (or stop doing) something “for my own good” (For others’ good, or under some sort of provisional voluntary arrangement, or crushed by force majeure: all a different story. The “for your own good” part is even worse than the force.) So awareness of late 20th century Wahabi revivalism — and its social/economic and geopolitical causes everywhere — is not going to convince me that anyone else must or can ever be “saved from herself” by High-Empathy-Quotient, blissfully conformist know-it-alls.

If you are a woman and you want to walk around in cowboy boots and a 10-gallon hat, that is your choice. If you are a woman and you want to walk around in high heels and a skirt that cobbles your movement, that is your choice. If you are a woman and you want to walk around in a sari, that is your choice. If you are a woman and you want to walk around in a dashiki and a dhuku, that is your choice. If you are a woman and you want to walk around in a hijab, that is your choice. I’m thinking some self-examination might be in order. Reply ↓ Marina Bart March 28, 2017 at 8:44 pm This is absolutely deluded. Do you not understand the power of social and cultural conditioning on people’s thinking? Economic forces, too. Yes, women wear high heels, that ruin their feet, tendons, and spines, while hobbling them so that they can’t run or even stride comfortably with authority. The high heels act to force their bodies into a sexually stimulating swaying motion. (Sexually stimulating to observers, that is. Not to the hobbling woman in the painful shoes.) Yes, we “let” them do it. Do you really think it’s some free expression of personal choice? I can’t believe we’re fighting this issue all over again. FAMILY BLOG this. FAMILY BLOG it to FAMILY BLOG. Reply ↓ Donald March 28, 2017 at 8:30 pm I read the hijab piece. I don’t understand why so many people here find it hard to understand. I will repeat the point made in plain English in the article. Forcing women to wear a hijab is oppressive. In the US, where Islamophobia is rampant, the pressure is on women who are Muslim to conform to what we think is right. So wearing a hijab in the US, if done voluntarily for the reason stated in the article is a way of telling moral busybodies that it is none of their business what a woman chooses to wear. It is also a thumb in the eye of Islamophobes. Reply ↓ Marina Bart March 28, 2017 at 8:49 pm So forcing women to unveil to conform to existing liberal society norms is bad, but applauding them for conforming to millennia-old restrictions still enforced with violence and oppression all over the world, including in communities here, is good? How about we let them wear the restrictive symbol of their oppression unmolested, while working to help them free themselves mentally and economically so they can and want to remove it? Reply ↓ clinical wasteman March 29, 2017 at 2:08 am How about…? By all means, provided “we…help” means people who see it that way collectively trying to do that — which means the work would be with the women on the “receiving end, i.e. a two-way exchange, which is what I do think is meant here — rather than a “Nudge”/”soft policing” state/NGO campaign. The UK is maybe the world leader in that sort of “behaviour modification” as political policy, despite the US origin of so much of the theory: it’s always invasive, with the additional galling aspect that the coercive power involved is coyly dissembled but still always there. It tends to get a show of meek compliance where the stakes are low and conformism is fashionable anyway (eg. diet commandments), but fares about as well as you might expect when it clashes with intensely felt group allegiances (eg. politically obnoxious, occasionally armed Wahabi/Salafi sects and any other Muslims who happen to be standing nearby) and offers nothing less laughable than “British Values” (politically obnoxious with some colourful cultural quirks; in the end always armed) in return. For similar reasons, a Nudge campaign against high heels (yes indeed, a grotesque symbol of male ((would-be)) proprietorship of women, imposed by “soft” coercion, and nowhere near as historically complicated as women’s religious headwear in any monotheistic religion) might fare better than a “soft” veil crusade. But it’s telling that there’s no such institutionally-backed anti-heels campaign anywhere, let alone a ban. The sexual symbolism could be argued (but let’s not start) to be even more blatant than that of the veils, but heels are apparently in keeping with certain prevailing “modern liberal sensibilities”/”Western Values”, even though they physically, visibly enact oppression, whereas veils attacked politically with occasional reference to oppression (real — I don’t think anyone is denying that) they sometimes symbolise. Not surprising, because feminist arguments are an afterthought in most anti-veil campaigns, which in Europe at least really do spout Clash Of Civilizations boilerplate all the time. Now bear in mind that “Muslims” are a described “culture” in Respectable Newspapers and as a “race” quite often in common speech: if outright prohibition of any religious paraphernalia is proposed, an officially retired (at least in Europe, yeah right…) “-ism” springs to mind, whether campaigners intend it or not. So although I agree with Katherine and Donald word for word, I don’t think that’s incompatible with gratitude to Marina — especially given the different perspective on the veil/s as such — for making the distinction between criticising something and policing it. Although I tend to disagree about the importance and legibility of symbols in general (leave them alone because they’re 1. more oblique than they seem and 2. are disastrously used as a diversion from real material problems: cf. “Culture Wars”, “National Socialism” vs. socialism), I do also agree with Marina about the absurdity of “personal choice” as an analytical category. The reason to resist institutional “benevolent”, especially when it’s “for your own benefit”, is that no-one outside some tiny economic elite is EVER even relatively “free to choose” almost anything. What looks like “choice” is a desperate, open-ended attempt to survive or evade multiple, conflicting, interlocking imperatives, threats and constraints. Prohibition and compulsion are obnoxious because they PRESUME that the compelled social group/individual is ABLE to choose to obey, and based on that presumption, the compelling institution (as likely private- as state-sector) threatens or perpetrates real violence by way of “deterrence” or “punishment”.

Reply ↓ ChrisPacific March 29, 2017 at 7:22 pm Coming to this a bit late, but I think those who argue that feminism means women being free to wear what they want should try other articles of clothing/decorations on for size (Confederate flag, swastika, KKK outfit, SS uniform…) and see if their mental model still applies. Clothes aren’t just clothes. They have a historical and cultural context, and they send a message. Yes, people are free to send whatever message they choose by wearing what they choose, but that doesn’t mean that they shouldn’t also be evaluated on the content of the message they choose to send. To give another example, if you see a woman on TV arguing that women’s right to vote should be revoked, do you applaud her as a feminist for exercising her First Amendment right to say what she thinks unconstrained by society’s expectations? Or do you think about what she is actually saying? Now it’s possible that women wearing the hijab by choice are trying to co-opt the message and change its meaning, which has been done successfully in the past before (the use of the term ‘queer’ by the gay community, for example). If that’s what they are doing then we could debate that (chance of success, whether it’s a good or a bad idea). But nobody in this thread seems to be making that argument. If the view is that women should feel free to wear a hijab because they think it’s comfy and warm and they want to, then I think that is naïve. Reply ↓ Dandelion March 29, 2017 at 3:47 am Well, that would be the neoliberal expression of feminism. Class-based feminism takes into account t the fact that no choice is made in a vacuum and also considers the effect of women’s choices on the global class women as a whole. Oppression is structural, not individual, and the hijab is very definitely a form of structural oppression, encoded in religious and secular law to enforce the submission of women.

The national unemployment rate has been cut in half since 2010 and the economy is projected to grow by almost 50% between 2010 and 2020. Despite this positive outlook, employees are overworked, burned out, and dissatisfied. A recent study my firm conducted, in partnership with Kronos, found that burnout is responsible for up to half of all employee attrition. Employees are working more hours for no additional pay and as a result, they are searching for new jobs. Nearly all employers surveyed agree that improving retention is a critical priority yet many aren’t investing in solving the problem, even though it costs thousands of dollars to replace each employee lost. … Companies need to do something about this burnout crisis now because otherwise, they will pay the high price of turnover. Sadly it’s only the fact that turnover might increase costs for business and lower profits that causes any action. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner March 28, 2017 at 3:20 pm Do Democrat do identity issues?

I’ve been seeing many more hijabs in recent years. 10 years ago, barely saw them. Not Trump related at all. I’m going to speculate that 16 years of wars, covert ops, coups, assassinations by our government against muslim countries, and western corporate media’s constant islamophobia has fueled a culture that wants to push back in some form.

Also, lots of signs promoting diversity using hijabs as a symbol (same artist who did the Obama Hope poster), which some people didn’t like. I don’t think there’s a lot of thought going into it. If they wore dashikis or a shriner fez or a keffiyah, nobody would care. Keffiyahs were, for awhile, a fashion statement. Some on the conservative side said it was the imminent Muslim invasion, those of the liberal bent said it was cultural appropriation. So there you go. I forget when I realized that roles in life are really a series of hats. Some soldiers wear helmets, others wear berets. Police officers wear visors. The Tuareg have the tagelmust among men, while traditionally the women went bald. I think the real rule here is, “Don’t let your hat have more personality than you do”.

I went to a meeting for a local chapter of Our Revolution this past weekend. The organizer began the discussion before voting on steering committee members by asking what should be the priorities for Our Revolution nationally in the short to intermediate term. I remarked that they should take a page from Grover Norquist and his tax pledge and work on getting every Democrat to sign a pledge that they will vote for single payer (referring to a specific bill would be best) and, if they don’t, working to make “primarying” them a priority. A less robust alternative would be to simply say that anyone who doesn’t sign it will not be endorsed by Our Revolution, period. So what I am wondering is what are the difficulties that would be involved? What are the drawbacks to such a strategy? To my mind, it seems like the worst case (which would be bad) is that for whatever reason it was ineffectual or came to be seen as toothless. Is that a strong likelihood? Does anyone else see this as a worthy pursuit to identify and solidify reliable supporters, identify likely holdouts, and work to keep the issue at the forefront of discussion in upcoming elections? For the record, I’m not claiming to be original in coming up with this idea, but I haven’t really seen any discussion of it as a concrete possibility. Reply ↓ Andrew March 28, 2017 at 6:01 pm As you say, there’s talk about single payer, but I haven’t seen anyone suggest the “Grover Norquist pledge” approach, and frankly that seems like a very sensible, effective idea. Not least because vocal support for it is a concrete demand that can be made of every single political operative you come across, including local Our Revolution organizers. I’m curious, what kind of response did you get from other attendees? Reply ↓ TellMeWhy March 28, 2017 at 9:56 pm That part of the meeting was fairly informal and a bit disorganized (it was the first meeting for the chapter). There was definitely some audible agreement from those in attendance but then it was quickly on to the next person without any further discussion. I plan to bring it up again at future meetings when there will hopefully be more substantive discussions. It was really just something that occurred to me spur of the moment so I hadn’t really thought it through much. I can say though that Medicare for All probably came up more than every other issue combined among those running for steering committee positions, and drew the most vocal response from the crowd.

He’s flipping the ambiguity to his advantage. Neoliberals claim no difference, so can’t disagree with Bernie for linking public option to Medicare for All.

However things turn out, I feel a debt of gratitude to Sanders for what he’s done and doing. Reply ↓ bob k March 28, 2017 at 4:34 pm there is no need for Sanders to introduce a bill, unless it goes along with Conyers’s bill he introduced again to the House. This is the real deal. No conflation, no confusion, spelled out in simple terms all can grasp on his website. I quote: “This bill would establish a privately-delivered, publicly-financed universal health care system, where patients, their physicians, and non-profit health care providers would be in charge of medical decisions — not insurance companies. H.R. 676 would expand and improve the highly popular Medicare program and provide universal access to care to all Americans. The program would be primarily funded by a modest payroll tax on employers and employees, a financial transaction tax, and higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans. H.R.676 has been introduced in Congress since 2003, and has a broad base of support among universal health care activists, organized labor, physicians, nurses, and social justice organizations across the nation. The bill has been endorsed by 20 international unions, Physicians For A National Health Program, two former editors of the New England Journal of Medicine, National Nurses United, the American Medical Students Association, Progressive Democrats of America, Public Citizen, and the NAACP. Last year, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found 67 percent of Americans support “Medicare for All.”” [A] “privately-delivered, publicly-financed universal health care system” is exactly what’s needed in the US. It can’t be tarred with the epithet “socialized medicine.” It’s got the support of unions, physicians, nurses, medical students and progressives. It plainly states how it will be financed – as it should be, through progressive taxes – the more you make the greater your contribution. That means it will be vastly more affordable than insurance premiums*. Conyers has been doing yeoman’s work, introducing this bill EVERY YEAR since 2003. He says that now is the time to give it legs, to push beyond the hollow “victory” of “saving Obamacare.” Will it be left to rot or will those who are advocating for Single Payer/Medicare for All put their activities where their mouths are. *The 1% need not fear the loss of their high priced health insurance that gets them to the head of the line at prestigious institutions like the Mayo Clinic. I’m pretty sure insurance companies will be happy to sell them The Ferrari Line of Super Expensive Medical Insurance that will allow them to look down on the 99%.

It’s not clear who’s actually winning quite yet. 1) Bernie’s got a long track record of playing a weak hand very well. Lambert included the intercept article about the Community Health Centers which I can personally vouch for as “concrete material benefits” for people. My wife works for one. They save lives. 2) I think he sees himself as the insider part of the inside/outside strategy. I think he’s hedging his bets, politically. If he can only get a public option through congress, he’ll take it, and when it falls short, as we know it will, he’ll push for more. If he can get Medicare for all, he’ll take it. 3) He sees my item 2) as his secondary job. He sees his primary job is to keep getting people fired up and keep getting them to harass their reps. He’s doing this very well and he’s building political capital in doing so. Look at his favorability ratings! Reply ↓ Elizabeth Burton March 28, 2017 at 7:47 pm Bernie clearly outlined his goals for Anderson Cooper. The ultimate goal is Medicare for All. However, there’s no chance in Hades of getting that in the current culture. Therefore, he will, while gathering support for same, also pursue some form of public option and lowering the Medicare age to 55 because people need help now. They shouldn’t have to wait another two or four or six years while the politicians get straightened out. Reply ↓ Vatch March 29, 2017 at 11:07 am Absolutely! I support HR676, I asked my Representative to co-sponsor it, and I have no expectation that it will pass in the 115th Congress. We won’t know until we see the bill that Sanders supports, but he seems to be doing the correct and pragmatic thing. HR676 has been introduced repeatedly over the years, and it has never passed the House. As far as I can tell, it has never even emerged from committee to be voted on by the full House of Representatives. Go here: https://www.congress.gov/advanced-search/legislation and select all Congresses from 2003 to the present. Enter hr676 in the “Legislation and Law Numbers” text entry field, and click Search. You’ll see HR676 has been introduced in each Congress, but it has never passed the House. When a party controls the House, as the Democrats did in 2009, it is a tactical error for members of that party to compromise in advance. When the other party controls the House, such as now, it makes perfect tactical sense for the minority party to do a little compromising, since that might allow the bill to actually come up for a vote.

Reply ↓ grayslady March 28, 2017 at 3:34 pm Regarding the Washington Post article on Dems and health care proposals, Wiegel is not an idiot when it comes to understanding the difference between universal health care and the “public option.” To wit, on July 9, 2016, Weigel wrote an article titled Sanders secures health-care promises from Clinton before expected endorsement. In that article, Weigel stated: “Hillary Clinton, in moves aimed at securing an endorsement from Bernie Sanders, on Saturday highlighted her support for a “public option” in health insurance and proposed additional funding for community-based centers championed by her rival for the Democratic nomination. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in a statement that she would affirm her support for allowing states to offer government-run health plans as part of the Affordable Care Act. And she said she would support allowing people 55 and older to buy into Medicare, which is available to people 65 and older. Those steps fall well short of the single-payer, “Medicare for all” program at the centerpiece of Sanders’s presidential campaign. But on a call with reporters Saturday, Sanders praised Clinton for “an important step forward” toward universal health care.” Lambert, I know you say you are waiting to see the text of any bill that Sanders puts forth on health care, but Russell Mokhiber, who began a modest website, Single Payer Action, a few years ago, and has been doggedly pursuing the cause of universal health care, reported back in December, 2016, that Bernie decided to abandon his campaign health care promises. In a December 2, 2016 Counterpunch article, titled Sanders Single Payer and Death by Democrat, Mokhiber reported on a conversation he had with Sanders’s health policy advisor, Laurie Kearns, who stated that Bernie believes party unity “is more important than single payer. Sanders apparently believes that single payer will get in the way of electing a Democratic Senate in 2018.” In his latest Single Payer Action website article, Single Payer Bernie Sanders Morphs Into Public Option Howard Dean, Mokhiber quotes several known single payer advocates, including David Himmelstein and Dr. Margaret Flowers, who agree with your take that the public option doesn’t come close to providing the economic and social benefits of an Improved Medicare for All, and could actually derail progress toward universal health care. As The Polemicist said, in a January, 2016 article: “Bernie Sanders is the dog who’s about to catch the car. We all thought it would pull away too quickly, but that doesn’t seem to be happening. If he catches it, he’s going to have to turn into a helluva ferocious beast, or let it go….You can say that’s just cynical old me, and I may be and hope I am wrong, but I contend that it’s reasonable to infer from Bernie Sanders’s political history, and from the position he has put himself in (an integral part of Democratic Party politics!), and from what he has said during this election, that his main goal is to prevent a Republican victory, and that if he thinks his presence in the race will risk that, he will find a way to get back to being America’s favorite “socialist” senator.” I, too, am taking a “wait and see” attitude, at this point, but my gut is telling me that Bernie is pursuing the approach Weigel described in his 2016 article, because the Clintons still control the Democrats, and Bernie would rather be an insider than an outsider.

In addition, a properly constituted public option would (eventually) drive private insurers out of business as surely as would single payer—and the health insurance companies and Pharma would fight that kind of public option tooth-and-nail, if it were not assumed out if existence at the outset. So whatever public option might be “allowed” to occur would necessarily be constrained. (Recall President Obama using as a selling point that “less than 5% of Americans would sign up” for the public option on offer in 2009—he had, of course, secretly bargained it away months earlier—or Senator Claire McCaskill’s statements that it was important that the public option be “handcuffed.”) If the choices are a constrained, “handcuffed” public option, whatever that is, or a properly constituted public option that health insurance companies oppose in much the same way as they would single payer, there’s no reason to consider either—we might as well be spending our time and energy fighting for single payer. Reply ↓ dk March 28, 2017 at 3:41 pm Trump+Russia story: Good start from David Warsh, hope further digging does not neglect the matter of Trumps attitude towards China. Chinese government entities began purchasing U.S. government agency-backed RMBS in the early 2000s to diversify beyond U.S. Treasuries. And the NYC real estate investment magnates of the time, Trump prominent but not alone among them, were not pleased when the dismissive Chinese government investors (private investment followed some years later) initially bypassed them almost completely and made offers directly to property owners. This had changed by the late 2000’s and beyond, and Trump’s attitude softened, but the macho never-forget-a-grudge stance remains. And speaking of election meddling, and not to pointlessly beat a hopefully mostly dead zombie horse, here’s a little item some may recall: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_campaign_finance_controversy The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People’s Republic of China to influence domestic American politics prior to and during the Clinton administration and also involved the fund-raising practices of the administration itself. I think it should be understood that the Chinese effort/need to have influence over US policy would have existed regardless of the particular president/candidate at the time. The Clintons did not solicit Chinese interests specifically, they were generously open to anyone with a checkbook, having already demonstrated as much during the 1992 campaign.

Your kindness will be rewarded with more plant pictures, and more comments. We are just waking up here, and many towns south of me are waking up to clear away the mess from Cyclone Debbie. It’s part of life here in the tropics and, in my time in Cairns, we’ve faced off three. There’s always a lot of property damage, but I think, loss of life and injuries are on the low side. Just to brighten your days, I’ll relate one of my chicken stories. Shirley came to us to replenish our small flock of 4 and fitted in well, often coming into the house to see what was going on. A real social bird, who would squat next to you and invite you to pat her sleek, red back, and fluffy back end. If you were gardening or fixing your car, Shirley would often be around keeping you company. My partner was throwing scraps to the chooks one day when one of our mini fox terriers, Jimmy, went for some of what Shirley was trying. Shirley didn’t back off until the dog had ripped into her shoulder. (It has been Jim’s only black mark.) When I saw the deep gashes in her back and thigh, I thought that Shirley was mortally wounded, and we put her in a travel crate to wait things out. A few days later and she was still going, even though she had developed a limp and could no longer fly. Months passed and she came back to her old self, even laying those big, big eggs of hers. And she was still capable of scratching one footed and feeding, although she probably lost a third of her body weight. I bought a troublesome utility (pick up) a year or so ago and it developed an electrical short and host of other problems, which saw it confined to the yard, with the battery disconnected, while I procrastinated about selling it on. As it was damaging the grass, I moved it every few days or so. One day, Shirley went missing, but we’ve got a biggish yard and there are plenty of hiding spots, so we didn’t panic. After three days, there was no smell, so we assumed that a python had taken her and went on with our lives. Five days in and I could smell death. I’d picked up several of our hens over the years and buried them in the corner, so I set about looking, under house, everywhere. The smell was faint, yet I kept going back to same part of yard. Then it hit me. My ute! I tentatively opened the drivers door and it hit me, the rank smell of decomposition. I held my breath, stuck my head in and saw what looked like a river of maggots flowing all over the interior of the vehicle. I shut the door and recalled when I had parked it last. I’d disconnected the battery and the door had been open for perhaps half hour. She’d hopped in to lay an egg, and I’d killed her. And my ute, I thought! I retold this story recently and my friend said: “If that had been me, I would have just locked it up and arranged for a tow. Wouldn’t even have stopped to gather the change.” But not me. First, I needed to respect my former friend, so I dug a small trench in the nearest garden bed and went back to the ute, big set of BBQ tongs in hand. Poor Shirley, was almost unrecognisable. A combination of 50c heat, 5 days and several hundred flies had done their job and, as I held her tightly and her body emerged from the vehicle, she slipped from the tongs and went splat at my feet. I looked inside and among all the goo and maggots was her last egg. No thanks, I thought and threw it into the garden. I quickly finished off Shirley’s burial, rammed home some big rocks to keep the dogs and chickens off her and then thought about the ute. Perhaps I could clean the mess and save something, I thought. So, I left the doors open, ruining our garden experience, and the neighbors’, for a couple of weeks until all the maggots had grown up and flown away. So I persisted, even driving it to one of those self serve car washes, with the carpet shampoo and so on. But when I saw the state of the floor mats, I knew I was defeated. I tried to sell the car, as a project you know, for parts, but it sat there. I rang the wreckers, but no-one was interested and I faced the prospect of having to pay to have it crushed. On a whim, I advertised the tow bar for $100 and, hidden in fine print was that the ute attached to the tow bar was free. And, I could deliver. Well, it sold that day. The buyer actually was looking for a tow bar and asked what was wrong with the ute. Not wanting to put him off, I was non specific, just saying that there were too many problems with it to fix. It was still registered and drivable, so he asked me to drive out to his son’s work and drop it off, which I did, removing the plates, and he handed over $100. I never did wait around to see what happened. In death, as in life, Shirley had made her mark.

My view of Clinton years is too much surplus was generated, in part, by high social security payroll deductions. And with regard to mortgage back paper, it was bad because of the underwriting. I could be way off. But as far as Greenspan excuse in 2001 goes, I think it was hack politics that motivated him at the time. That I feel pretty sure about.

Perhaps their primary interest is the crumbs of wealth and power that fall to Congress critters themselves. Making a lot of noise about servicing their masters is necessary to generate the flow of wealth and money in their direction, but actually doing something does not matter to most of the Republicans in and of itself. This is the difference between a true ideologue and those who play ideologues on TV (and on the Internet).

Few make much money at it, and they are not there for the money. Many work long hours. The problem is that most are not serious people; they are there for the ego-boost. After a few years, most staff drift away, and a new crop just as insipid as the last crop arrives. When staff drift away, they look desperately for a place to land, and maybe a few have passed out favors with future employment in mind, but that is not what drives the institution. They want to be big shots. If not famous, at least somewhat influential, or if they do not get that far, at least part of the show. Part of something exciting and important. Their focus is not on policy. Most Congressmen and staff are pretty flexible about most policy. A few pet peeves aside, they do not care that much. What they care VERY much about is staying part of the show. Winning elections. Corporate money buys them cheap by giving them an edge against anyone that might run against them. Fundraising and toeing the line is a chore. Not to get rich; just to hang onto the seat. For many, the seat (or staff position) is central to the sense of self-worth and place in the world. That emotional tie explains the violent hatred of Bernie by nearly every Dem senator and Dem staffer in wake of his challenge to Hillary. Bernie embodies the worst kind of threat to them.

Force the grifters to abandon the edifice of the Democratic Party. You think rats would suck on a metal tube if there was no sugar water flowing out of it?

Because I think there’s no value for money there for anyone not in on the consultant revenue stream. Yes, there are those for whom blocking the left from power is a urgent necessity. But I don’t think there are that many Dem donors who are really incentivized consciously to do that. If you’re a 5-10%er, neoliberalism is coming for you, too, and soon. Most of the upper middle class is next down the chute. I believe the Dems rely on that money. It’s not all coming from billionaires. And maybe, just maybe, those donors are acting rationally.

Reply ↓ Dandelion March 29, 2017 at 5:04 am What you’re missing, Lambert, is the degree to which postmodernism has re-shaped (completely inverted?) feminism, with its primacy of the subjective over the material; its absolute refusal to deal in ethical absolutes which therefore tends towards a vacant relativism that purports to support materially oppressed people but instead merely re-defines oppression as cultural expression; its dislocation of power due to lack of any class analysis; its obscuring of exploitation within an ever-expanding matrix of advantage; its emptying of meaning from language or even inversion of language such that, for example, discourse is action — all combined with the neoliberal belief that individual market choice and consumerist expression (such as clothing) maximizes power and freedom, no matter what the choice or the expression actually is and no matter the impact of that choice or expression on the population of women as a whole.

What is truly problematic is the degree to which vast numbers of people have “become” postmodern and neoliberal entirely thoughtlessly. Very very very large educational task ahead.

The Government confirmed on 9 February that it had appointed US-based company CH2M to help develop a section of the network north of Crewe to Manchester and from the West Midlands to Yorkshire. But on Wednesday, CH2M said it had decided to withdraw its interest, following what it called “continuing discussions” between HS2 and CH2M over the award of the contract. Read more HS2 won't improve Government's poor record on infrastructure Immediately after CH2M was awarded the deal, Mace – one of the unsuccessful bidders for the contract – reportedly raised concerns relating to a possible conflict of interest during the award process. “As is a matter of public record, HS2 sought clarification from CH2M on a number of areas,” a spokesman for CH2M told The Independent on Wednesday. In a separate statement, the company said it was pulling out of the contract as a result of “protracted delays and ongoing speculation” on the matter.

It reiterated that it had “demonstrated all appropriate measures taken throughout to ensure the integrity of the procurement process”. HS2 said it welcomed CH2M’s decision to withdraw but provided no further comment. The HS2 lines in question are expected to open in 2033, providing extra capacity and better service between the UK’s largest cities, enhancing connectivity and reducing journey times.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Regular readers may recall that I wrote last week about Goldman Sachs potentially using robots to provide financial advice. Fund manager BlackRock is, according to the New York Times, looking to do the same thing with its fund management.  The problem with actively managed funds that aim to beat the market is that they are expensive when compared to those that “track” the performance of a stock market index.  The latter charge annual fees of a fraction of a per cent to retail investors, even less to the likes of pension funds. Actively managed funds can cost as much as 1.5 per cent of our funds every year to you and me. They’re less pricey for organisations with a lot of money to invest, but still cost them many times what they pay for trackers.  Read more This robot automatically prints out, then burns, Trump's tweets Robots and AI are threatening close to a third of UK jobs Robot 'goes rogue and kills woman at Michigan car parts factory' Small wonder. The people employed by money managers to run funds and pick stocks command high salaries and require expensive infrastructure. Offices, Bloomberg terminals, secretaries, support staff, and the like They also like to be able to have the latest research, and to spend their valuable time visiting companies in which they invest.  Even when they do that, most of them struggle to beat the market over the long term, all the more so if you factor fund costs into performance data (and you should).  If a fund management company like BlackRock can cut out some of that cost, if it can dramatically reduce what it charges investors, it might help to stem the flow of funds away from actively managed funds. And BlackRock might still be able to make a better margin than it does from its trackers through the "value add". Saints be praised, we're saved!  If only it were that simple. For a start, there’s no guarantee that bots will work any better than the average stock picker. Actually, forget that. They probably will. Average stock pickers aren’t very good. Perhaps we should say there’s no guarantee that they’ll work any better than a half decent stock picker.  However, consider this, if you will. For a fund to be able to beat the market, it also requires that other investors under perform with tackers sitting in the middle.  Business picture of the day 37 show all Business picture of the day 1/37 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Reuters If everyone goes with bots, you would have to assume that some will inevitably fail to cut it. A bot managed fund is also only good as its algorithm, or its AI. But let's assume everyone irons the bugs out and AI driven funds learn to deal with the complexities and occasional panics the remaining humans like to indulge in, and that they all act in an ostensibly logical manner. They'll surely all end up trending towards the mean and become like, well, like trackers. But expensive ones. Either that or (more likely if you think about it) we might see some very odd things happening in the world's markets. It'll be anarchy I tell you! Anarchy!  It at least promises to make life as a financial journalist interesting, unless they start replacing us with bots too. But perhaps different bots will operate different strategies. Some will win. Some will lose. And what won’t change is this: For the small investor, and for many larger ones too, BlackRock’s trackers (the biggest part of its business) will  make for the cheaper and the better option.

A Foreign Ministry statement carried by the state-run IRNA news agency said the sanctions barred companies from any agreements with Iranian firms and that former and current directors would not be eligible for visas. It also said any of the company's assets in Iran could be seized. "The sanctioned companies have, directly and/or indirectly, been involved in the brutal atrocities committed by the Zionist regime in the occupied Palestinian territories, or they have supported the regime's terrorist activities and Israel's development of Zionist settlements on the Palestinian soil," the IRNA report said. The IRNA report referred to the sanctions as a "reciprocal act," without elaborating. Iran's new sanctions comes after the Trump administration in February sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a recent ballistic missile test. The companies named did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday. They included ITT Corp., missile-maker Raytheon Co. and United Technologies Corp. Denver's Re/Max Holdings Inc., a real estate company, also made the list. One of the named companies, Israeli defense contractor Elbit, declined to comment on the matter. Another firm on the list, truck maker Oshkosh, has worked closely with Israeli armored products maker Plasan, including on the Sand Cat armored vehicle that is used by several countries, including Israel. The Israeli Defense Ministry is reportedly seeking to buy some 200 tactical trucks from the Oshkosh, Wisconsin-based company. Kahr Arms and Magnum Research, two sanctioned firms which share the same parent company, advertise .44-caliber Magnum and .50-caliber "Desert Eagle" pistols — a product line that previously has been made in Israel. Meanwhile, a senior Iranian lawmaker said Iran would consider a bill branding the U.S. military and the CIA as terrorist groups if the U.S. Congress passes a bill designating Iran's Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization. Allaeddin Boroujerdi, the head of parliament's national security and foreign policy committee, was quoted by Iranian state television as saying the move to further sanction the Revolutionary Guard goes against the 2015 nuclear deal Iran reached with the United States and other world powers. The nuclear deal saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions. In the time since, Chicago-based Boeing Co. has struck a $16.6 billion deal with Iran for passenger planes. Tehran and Washington have had no diplomatic relations since 1979, when militant students stormed the U.S. Embassy and took 52 Americans hostages for 444 days. Tensions eased slightly with the nuclear deal struck by moderate President Hassan Rouhani's administration, though hard-liners have detained those with Western ties in the time since. Sunday's sanctions announcement also comes ahead of a May presidential election in which Rouhani is expected to seek re-election. ___ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell and Adam Schreck in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.

Good (on both counts) Long term an unhappy LSE may thank Margrethe Vestager, who has made clear she isn't going anywhere, Brexit or no James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Wednesday 29 March 2017 14:15 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Margrethe Vestager at the EU headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday AP There was a certain pathos in the EU formally killing off the London Stock Exchange’s proposed £24bn merger with Deutsche Börse on the day the UK triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, even if only a conspiracy theorist would believe it was planned that way.  Part of the coincidence’s resonance comes from the fact that the LSE faces a similar question to that which faces the UK as a whole in the wake of Brexit: what next? But that’s about as far as it goes.  Read more LSE’s planned tie-up with Deutsche Börse blocked by EU Why the LSE-Börse merger has been destined to fail for months London Stock Exchange warns Deutsche Börse merger likely to be blocked The invocation of Article 50 is an historic mistake on the part of the UK. By contrast, Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner, might have saved the LSE from one.  Her problem with the deal was the “de facto monopoly” she felt the merged company would have in the clearing of trades involving bonds and fixed income products. The LSE hoped to deal with that through the sale of part of its business to NYSE Euronext, another deal that will be undone. She required it to sell its bond trading platform MTS as well. We often forget that the modern LSE is an Anglo-Italian construction through its merger with the Milan Borsa, and that side of it was never going to wear such a disposal.  As big an issue facing the deal was the scarcely discussed fate of the two companies' clearing businesses post-merger. Bolting them together would have produced the synergies required to make the deal fly, and yet neither side was willing to say whether that would leave them in London or Frankfurt.  Ms Vestager saved the two from having to satisfactorily answer that question.  Still, others remain. The London exchange waffled about its confidence in a standalone future, but companies always do that in the event that their merger plans go awry. If they were convinced of the virtues of going it alone, they wouldn’t try mergers on for size, still less complicated and risky undertakings like bolting the LSE together with its German rival.  Despite its importance and brand, the LSE remains no more than a medium sized player in a business that has long favoured scale.  While the Deutsche-LSE deal was horribly flawed, something common to all three mergers the two have explored, there are no guarantees that a future partner will offer anything better.  There will inevitably be speculation that a transatlantic tie-up could be next. The trouble with that is that the Americans have a habit of regulating in a supranational manner, something that caused no end of controversy when the Nasdaq played suitor to the LSE.  A future American owner might feel compelled to impose US regulations on the London exchange. It would be a bitter irony were the City, supposedly freed from the yoke of the EU, to have to accept American rule by the back door. But any deal involving the LSE will create issues.  Theresa May has set out her stall as a PM who is willing to intervene and potentially block unfavourable M&A involving British businesses.  However, a feature of her rhetoric to date is how poorly it has been matched by her actions in reality. Much was made of her proposed crackdown on CEO pay, for example, but she caved in and dropped her most radical proposals at the first sign of resistance from the City.  The same may prove true when it comes to the latter’s love of dealmaking, even if that deal involves one of its crown jewels. Will Ms May dare to say no? At this point, it might be worth remembering that it is not just Ms May who will have a say in any future deal involving the LSE. Ms Vestager will too, as she has made very clear.

They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government.

The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

Getty 7/37 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The online retailer's foray into bricks and mortar shopping aims to revolutionise the weekly food shop and shake up the grocery business. Customers order their food online then collect from a drive-through, with bags pre-packed and loaded into the boot by Amazon employees. Payment is made online via an app or through a web browser, USA Today reported. Read more Amazon Go launches, letting people walk into shops and take things The two new locations, called Amazon Fresh Pickup stores were opened in Seattle just a day after the company had to admit that its previous supermarket concept had been delayed indefinitely because of technical issues. The company said in December that it planned to open stores laid out like traditional shops, except without the checkouts - customers simply pick what they want, and leave. They were set to use a range of technologies to watch over people and see which items they take, charging them automatically through their Amazon account.  However, Amazon revealed on Monday that the technology had difficulty tracking more than about 20 people, the Wall Street Journal reported. The shops had been due to open in “early 2017”, Amazon said in December. The Fresh Pickup concept is a lot more low-tech and relies on Amazon’s existing prowess in logistics and online sales. The move is the latest by the online retail behemoth to crack the huge but relatively untapped online grocery market.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The sleek, well-designed phones often have some of the most cutting-edge features it's possible to get on a smartphone. And Samsung is getting ready to reveal the next in the series - the Galaxy S8 - at an 'Unpacked 2017' event later today. Taking place in New York on March 29, gadget fans will finally get to see the phone in full after months of leaks and wild speculation. The new Galaxy S8 will go toe-to-toe with Apple's iPhone 7 and is likely to feature some big changes from last year's S7 and S7 edge.

Early indicators suggest that we'll see a 5.1-inch and a 5.5-inch model. What's not clear is whether or not Samsung will introduce an 'edge' version of the new phone with a curved screen. It has taken this approach with both the S7 and the S6 in the last two years.

We've collected all the latest whisperings right here and will continue to update this piece as we learn more.

Read More Brits are hoarding up to £13 billion worth of phones at home - how to ditch your handset for maximum cash These are believed to be of a "jet back" version of the new smartphone and were posted on the website slashleaks. The site calls it a dummy phone and, unfortunately, doesn't switch it on at any point. But the pictures still give us a good idea of what to expect when Samsung pulls the veil away next week. Release date Rather than reveal the phone at Mobile World Congress as in previous years, Samsung is hosting its own event on March 29. The event is called Samsung Unpacked and it is widely expected to be the official unveiling of the Galaxy S8. Read More Mobile World Congress 2017: The biggest announcements from this year's smartphone mega-show Samsung's Unpacked invitation (Photo: Samsung) The teaser image for the event showed the outline of a phone and the line "unbox your phone". Samsung confirmed it will be streaming the event live over its website. Price As with Apple's iPhones, the Samsung Galaxy handsets have more or less plateaued when it comes to price. The current 32GB S7 comes in at £569 whilst the slightly larger S7 edge is £639. It's unlikely that Samsung's new phones will deviate too far from this kind of pricing. So you better start saving. Read More iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7: Which smartphone is best when Apple and Samsung go toe-to-toe? The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge aren't cheap What could change things is if Samsung decides to offer multiple storage options. At the moment you can only get the S7 with 32GB of storage. If Samsung opts to increase this to 64GB or even 128GB the price could increase also. However, the company could also keep the storage space as it is and instead include the capacity of the microSD card slot. Design Posted to Twitter by serial leaker Evan Blass, an image appears to show a marketing photo of the Samsung Galaxy S8 face-on. It reveals the gigantic front screen and the lack of a physical home button - two prominent rumours that have circulated for months. Samsung upgrades the Gear VR with a controller for virtual reality pointing and shooting Much has been made of the S8's display and, as this picture shows, it appears to take up the entire front of the device with hugely reduced bezels on the top and bottom of the phone. The curving screen appears to have been carried over from the Galaxy S7. It also shows the phone's lock screen and redesigned clock face. The power button can be clearly seen on the side of the phone. Perhaps in an effort to rescue something from the doomed Galaxy 7 Note, Samsung could be planning to put an edge-to-edge display in the new S8. Read More Samsung Galaxy S8 owners will be able to use their FACE to pay for things (Photo: Getty) That's the message coming from tech site Droid-Life, which claims the new S8 will come in two sizes and won't feature any bezels. Samsung will release a 5.7-inch model and a whopping 6.2-inch model - which makes it practically a tablet in our eyes. What's more, the site is claiming Samsung will ditch the home button - something that has always been a feature of Galaxy phones. "With the removal of the home button, it should be expected that we might see on-screen buttons, instead of Samsung’s long-standing capacitive keys," claims the site. Samsung is also reportedly planning to put a pair of stereo speakers on the forthcoming Galaxy S8 flagship phone - something Apple did with the iPhone 7. The news comes from gadget site Fone Arena, which alleges that the new blower might also sport branding from audio company HARMAN. "According to our sources this dual speaker technology will have a branding, like the HTC’s Boomsound," wrote the site. "It could also come with HARMAN branding, and powered by technology from HARMAN that it recently agreed to acquire for about $8.0 billion." Specs Aside from the aforementioned 4K screen, there are a few rumours circulating about what kind of power the S8 may have under the bonnet. Samsung's cameras have been exceptionally good recently, but the proliferation of dual-lens snappers from the likes of Apple, Huawei and LG may inspire it to follow suit. According to tech site Trusted Reviews , Samsung is indeed planning to include dual-lens cameras in its next phone.

It says the new phone will pack in 6GB of RAM and a 30-megapixel camera. There will also be a 4,200mAh battery which - providing it doesn't explode - should easily see the phone through 24 hours of solid usage. A report on Samsung-watching site SamMobile hit on the fact that the S8 may include an Exynos 8895 processor coupled with a Mali-G71 GPU. According to the site, that means the new phone will be up to 1.8 times more powerful than the already-impressive Galaxy S7.

No headphone jack It's being rumoured that Samsung will follow Apple's lead and ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack on the Samsung Galaxy S8. If true, it would force users to adopt wireless headphones or, potentially, use a USB Type-C compatible pair, if that's what the new handset uses for charging. The latter is what Samsung fan site SamMobile believes will be the case when the Galaxy S8 is unveiled at Mobile World Congress in 2017. Galaxy S8 leaks suggest Samsung is planning to copy one of the iPhone 7's best features (Photo: REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji) By ditching the port, the company could make the phone sturdier and likely improve waterproofing while keeping the casing slim. But it's also likely to irk a huge number of people who rely on the old-fashioned analogue connection. Apple wasn't the first major manufacturer to remove the headphone jack, but the decision caused the biggest stir when the iPhone 7 was unveiled. Third-party manufacturers have raced to offer wireless headphones and phone cases to resolve the issue. Amid rumours that Samsung is planning to follow Apple's lead and remove the headphone jack on the Galaxy S8, some sources are now claiming that Samsung will launch a pair of lightweight bluetooth earbuds – similar in design and functionality to Apple's AirPods. Samsung already offers a pair of wireless earbuds, called the Gear IconX, which track your physical activity, have enough internal storage for around 1,000 music tracks and include a small touchpad to control music playback.

The new earphones could integrate with Samsung's new voice assistant, Viv, allowing users to dictate messages, request songs, make phone calls and ask for directions - just like users of Apple's AirPods can with Siri. Bixby personal assistant Samsung's next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8 , will come with a new artificially intelligent personal assistant called Bixby. Like Apple's Siri, Bixby responds to spoken commands, allowing users to control their phones with their voices alone. However, Samsung claims that Bixby offers a "deeper experience" than other voice agents or assistants in the market. Read More Samsung Galaxy S8 will come with a new Siri-like personal assistant called Bixby Samsung Galaxy S7 edge at The World Mobile Congress at the Fira Gran Via Complex (Photo: Miquel Benitez/REX/Shutterstock) Firstly, when using a Bixby-enabled application, Samsung's personal assistant can support almost every task that the application is capable of performing - so you don't have to remember which features work with voice command and which don't. Secondly, you can call upon Bixby at any time and it will understand the current context and state of the application, allowing you to continue what you're doing without interruption. The Samsung Galaxy S8 will come with a dedicated Bixby button on the side of the device, which you can press to call up the virtual assistant. To begin with, only a subset of pre-installed applications will be Bixby-enabled, but this set will continue to expand over time.

The move will require shifting six terawatt hours of electricity from fossil-fuel plants to wind, solar and other renewable sources, the Belgium-based company said in a statement on Tuesday. That’s almost enough to power all of Spain for a month. The company’s announcement came the same day US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to unravel rules to combat climate change, including cutting power-sector emissions. Read more Tesco has stopped selling Heineken beers because of Brexit The timing was a coincidence, according to Carlos Alves De Brito, AB InBev’s chief executive. Fighting climate change with renewable energy was good for the bottom line, he said. “This has no political connotations at all,” Mr Brito said. “We just think this is good for our business and the environment.” AB InBev plans to generate as much as 25 per cent of its electricity itself, including by installing solar panels on its facilities. The company will buy the rest directly from wind and solar farms.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Business groups representing hospitality, construction, finance and many more have been vocal about impending skills shortages if the flow of migrants slows significantly after Brexit. Too often, the key weapon in their armoury has been statistical evidence of these shortages, which are used in an attempt to convince people they are wrong to worry about immigration, the report said.  Read more Rise of the gig economy fuelled Brexit vote, MPs told This tactic comes across as a lecture which contradicts many peoples’ actual experiences, “leading to mutual misunderstanding and a dialogue of the deaf,” the report from think tank British Future and leading global immigration law firm Fragomen, said. As Theresa May prepares to trigger Article 50 on Wednesday, the think tank recommended that business groups shift focus towards acknowledging the pressures that immigration can bring and focusing on ways to effectively manage them. Companies should also highlight where they have pursued positive solutions such as engaging hard-to-reach British groups, investing more in the skills of indigenous workers and increasing productivity through automation. Ian Robinson, a partner at Fragomen, and co-author of the report, said: “The trick will be for business to be up-front and celebrate any initiatives that help British workers.” Read more Brexit: Pound sterling slips ahead of Article 50 trigger May vows to defend EU nationals in Brexit negotiations UK's most prominent ex-ministers unite against Theresa May's 'no deal' Tory MPs storm out of meeting to protest 'gloomy' report on Brexit He cited the example of Virgin Trains' efforts to employ ex-offenders and said companies can do more to embrace flexible working for people such as mothers returning to work after maternity leave. “If they work perfectly and no vacancies go unfilled then brilliant, business is sorted. If not, as seems likely, you can start to talk about immigration from a position of strength,” he said. Mr Robinson, who also worked for several years in immigration policy at the Home Office, told The Independent that businesses should reassure people about the strength of the current work visa system. Businesses that employ non-EU skilled workers have to keep close oversight of them, he said. This includes telling the Home Office if workers arrive in the country later than planned, where they live, if they move office, if they return home early and where they go on holiday. There are also heavy penalties for companies that breach the system. Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future said the debate needed to outline how people can feel like they have more of a say in immigration policy. This could be achieved with a migration equivalent of the annual Budget during which the Home Secretary would explain what happened last year, what is planned next year and what choices have to be made in light of the country’s skills needs, Mr Katwala suggested.

AFP/Getty 8/37 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 11/37 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Most people are open to hearing concerns about the need for nurses, care workers, low-skilled and high-skilled labour, he said, but many feel business isn’t interested in having a conversation about how to manage immigration better so that it works for the economy and society.

The crew of Russia’s next-generation spacecraft, Federation, will control it via three touch screens and one side handle, a senior official at the Federation’s designer told TASS in an interview. "Initially, we planned to install five monitors - one main screen, two for the commander and two for the second crew member. Later we decided that there should be one screen for each of the crew members and one main screen to be used by them jointly. All of them will be based on the touch screen technology," said Mark Serov, the head of the flight test department at the Energiya Space Rocket Corporation. Read also New Russian spacecraft designed for lunar missions to be run by fail-safe computer He added that RSC Energia’s technology will enable the crew to operate while wearing spacesuits and gloves. "Any kind of gloves are suitable for our screens, there’s even no need to sew in special elements on digits. These screens were designed to operate in the conditions of vacuum and differential pressure, including in a spacewalk," Serov said. In addition, a control handle will be placed between the seats of the commander and the second crew member for manual control. According to Serov, the cockpit of Federation’s rival Orion currently under development by Lockheed Martin for NASA, will also be equipped with three monitors. Another rival project, Boeing’s Starliner space capsule, is expected to have two monitors and a system of manual switches and controls resembling those that can be found in a cockpit of a plane. The spacecraft is intended for delivering humans and cargoes to the near-Earth and lunar missions. The space capsule has a life span of up to 30 days and can operate up to twelve months as part of an orbital station. It will be launched atop the heavy Angara-A5V and Angara-A5P carrier rockets. The first unmanned launch of the Federation space vehicle is scheduled for 2021 and the first manned flight for late 2023.

LOUIS COUNTY, MO (KPLR) - A large plane that appeared to be flying very low over North County has some residents concerned. Lambert officials said the plane didn’t come from the airport, so residents are wondering where it came from and why was it flying so low. Blannie Wagner was inside her home Monday night around 9 pm when the walls started to shake. Wagner lives a few miles from Lambert so she is used to hearing planes fly overhead but said this was the loudest one she had ever heard. She went outside to see what all the noise was about and saw a large aircraft flying about 1,000 feet above the ground "At first, we thought it was a commercial airliner or something of that nature having trouble landing, then we heard it come back around again and that’s when we went outside and started taking some video of it coming through," said Wagner. Wagner has some aviation experience and is guessing this may have been some type of military plane based on the engines and she attempt to track it using a flight tracker app. A spokesperson with Lambert said the plan was a F-15 and suggested contacting Boeing. A Boeing spokesperson said to call the director at Whiteman Air Force base. That director said the plane did no come from there and suggested contacting the FAA. Right now, we are still waiting for a response from the FAA. 38.751826 -90.370800 Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Watch our free movie channel KPLR’s digital channel 11.1 shows hit movies.

Sterling was trading around $1.2410 in late trading in London having on Tuesday briefly peaked above $1.26, a seven-week high, largely as a result of investors selling the dollar on doubts around Donald Trump’s promised tax and regulatory reform. Earlier in the day the pound fell below $1.24. It was also down sharply against the euro, the Swiss franc and the Australian dollar before recovering somewhat. Read more Brits increasingly think Brexit is going to be bad for the economy Ahead of Wednesday, the pound had oscillated and many strategists agreed that it was hard to predict its course over the next few weeks. Some said that after a more than 15 per cent fall against the dollar since June’s referendum, a hard Brexit scenario is now priced in. But last week strategists at Deutsche Bank published an updated forecast, predicting the currency could still fall at low as $1.06 before recovering. Read more Trump healthcare defeat helps pound to seven-week high against dollar Pound sterling jumps to one month high The pound is climbing after inflation hit its highest level in years Some economists’ forecasts are more optimistic than Deutsche’, but few expect the currency to recover from its post-referendum lows any time soon. “We’re in for a long period of volatility for the pound and UK assets as the government embarks on protracted and hugely challenging Brexit negotiations,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital.  “We could see it move lower still if negotiations take a sour turn - $1.10 is feasible,” he said.  Saker Nusseibeh, chief executive of Hermes Investment, likened the triggering of Article 50 "to embarking in a raft or canoe down a very windy and dangerous set of rapids” for markets. “All we know at present is that the journey is long, the path of the rapids will likely take unusual twists and turns, and that the ride will be turbulent,” he said. Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at Nordicbank SEB also said that he does not expect to see a substantial rebound in the pound any time soon.  But he also said that “if negotiations should proceed smoothly and show signs of successfully reaching an agreement” then “the pound is likely to appreciate substantially compared to its level today”. On Wednesday, some traders said that early selling pressure might also have stemmed from the Scottish parliament on Tuesday voting in favour of a second independence referendum. Business picture of the day 37 show all Business picture of the day 1/37 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming.

Although this may sound quixotic, physics says it's feasible, and it could be economically viable. All of the needed technology exists, plus new developments are continuously making a lunar option more viable. Indeed, if harvested on a large scale, power from the Moon could even turn out economically favourable over Earth-based solar power. ADVERTISEMENT Climate change has pushed Earth into 'uncharted territory' Climate change has pushed Earth into 'uncharted territory' Climate Change 23 Mar 2017 Research from the Qian Xuesen Laboratory of Space Technology in China shows that solar power generated on the Moon can supply future lunar bases, with plenty of energy to spare. Silicon dioxide, comprising a large component of the lunar rocks and dust, can be turned into glass for such a solar thermal system. The same lunar materials can also be converted into photovoltaic (PV) cells. READ NEXT Startups re-energise the power sector Startups re-energise the power sector In partnership with EDF Energy Another benefit is there is no weather or wind on the Moon. Consequently, PV cells could be constructed from lunar dust fairly easily, making it possible to build lunar-based solar power (LSP), not merely to support a few dozen people in a lunar base but to support the entire Earth. And how would we transfer the power from the Moon to Earth? Microwave beams – the old, well-developed technology that underlies radar, and is in your trusty microwave oven. The idea for LSP came from Dr David Criswell, a physicist tasked to find uses for the lunar materials during Nasa's Apollo missions in the early 1970s. The Aerospace Fellowship of Criswell's Institute for Space Systems Operations supported astrobiology and space medicine work at the University of Houston in the early 2000s. Criswell has championed the idea for more than four decades to policy makers, inside and outside of the US Congress, yet we hear much less about LSP than we do space-based solar power. Elon Musk offered a scathing critique of the latter four years ago because it would consist of a network of gargantuan satellites in geosynchronous orbit, thereby costing more to lift into space than it would pay off in energy. Space solar platforms would also shed enough debris to endanger spacecraft, yet here in the Pacific Northwest the Boeing Corporation constantly throws us adverts with a vision of space solar as the prime energy source in the year 2116. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT 100% of electric Dutch trains now run on wind power 100% of electric Dutch trains now run on wind power By Victoria Woollaston China is leading the world in solar energy production China is leading the world in solar energy production Climate Change 06 Feb 2017 By contrast, LSP would depend on small, cheap satellites to relay the microwave beams between the Moon and receiving stations on Earth, which would turn the beams into electricity. Microwaves penetrate clouds with little energy loss and could be relayed to receivers on Earth's night side as easily as the dayside meaning power generation would be 24-7, rain or shine, sleet or snow. Subscribe to WIRED ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Eco Wave Power turns wave power into electricity Eco Wave Power turns wave power into electricity By Emma Bryce Recently, Shimizu Corporation in Japan picked up Criswell's idea. In fact, Shimizu believes LSP is such a good idea that its developing the Luna Ring - a system of PV arrays that would circle the lunar equator meaning half the ring would always get sunlight. To fill just small fractions of the electrical grid, Criswell's economical assessment shows Earth-based PV cells and Earth-based solar thermal would be cheaper. However, scaling up to supply the 20-22 terawatts (TW) civilisation is set to consume by mid-century, the economics flips. LSP becomes significantly cheaper compared with Earth, and that's largely because Earth-based arrays must be heavy and thick to endure weather, whereas lunar PV cells can be tissue thin. As far as launch costs go, it's minimised by sending robots that use lunar materials to build more robots and other equipment on the Moon, which then construct the PV cell arrays, microwave transmitters, and other components. ADVERTISEMENT And the finances don't just work for wealthy nations that might build an LSP power grid. According to Criswell's calculations, developing nations would be able to buy into LSP at a cost cheaper per megawatt than building coal fire power plants – so long as LSP develops on a global scale. The system could be reprogrammed to send beams to new receiving stations as needed. Alongside Japan's efforts in LSP, China is looking into mining the Moon for helium-3 for nuclear fusion. The fusion reaction that's used the most in research, considered the easiest fusion to achieve, combines deuterium (hydrogen-2) and tritium (hydrogen-3). Fusing them generates high-speed neutrons that are hard to contain, so they take away energy. Using helium-3 instead of tritium could enable "aneutronic" fusion reactors, which should be practical as power plants sooner than tritium reactors. Russian and India were already eying our closest celestial neighbor for helium-3 several years ago. Research in these countries is not moving at warp speed to be sure, but they seem to value our natural satellite as a potential energy source. It's time for the rest of us to join them.

Jay Inslee talks with DECA Club students at the Oasis Cafe, the student store, Tuesday in Marysville Pilchuck High School’s new cafeteria. (Andy Bronson / The Herald) Gov. Inslee visits Marysville Pilchuck to see new cafeteria Chris Winters Wed Mar 29th, 2017 3:33pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. MARYSVILLE — Gov. Jay Inslee dropped by Marysville Pilchuck High School on Tuesday to visit the newly opened cafeteria, talk to kids about science and technology, and make a pitch for his budget proposal. The new cafeteria cost $8.3 million, with $5 million of it coming from a special appropriation from the Legislature and $2.6 million from state matching funds. The building opened in January. The old cafeteria has been closed since the October 2014 shootings that took the lives of five students, including the shooter. It is expected to be demolished once funding becomes available. Students had been crowding into the school’s second, smaller cafeteria or ate lunch in the gym or classrooms. Associate Principal Dave Rose welcomed the governor and thanked him for Olympia’s support. “It has been like a breath of fresh air for our students and staff after two and a half years of a dark cloud,” Rose said. The Marysville School District set up several demonstration stations in the cafeteria for Inslee’s visit. Amanda Smalley, a fourth-grader at Shoultes Elementary School, showed how she was writing software code to create graphic images. “I’m trying to fix this, ’cause it’s wrong,” Smalley said. Nearby, Mike Shreeve had brought his robotics club students from Cedarcrest Middle School. Inslee asked the kids what they liked about robotics. “I mostly like team building and assigning each other jobs,” eighth-grader Riley Antram said. Seventh-grader Lily Siron chimed in: “We have to go out and find solutions. It isn’t just laid out for us.” “I look forward to you working for Boeing,” Inslee told them. Other stations were set up from Marysville Pilchuck’s AP Chemistry class, and the governor also chatted up DECA students behind the counter at the Oasis Cafe. Inslee said one takeaway from his visit was the importance of STEM education, which stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics. “We want to see this across the state, that’s why we’re focused on McCleary,” he said, referencing the state Supreme Court decision requiring the Legislature to fully fund education. He also said other schools in the state needed access to mental health services that have been made available at Marysville Pilchuck since the shootings. “I’m hoping the Legislature will fund these positions to provide nurses and mental health professionals, because these kids need it,” Inslee said.

REUTERS/Gary Hershorn/File Photo    U.S. Travel Doesn’t Speak For U.S. Airline Workers Tim Canoll President, Air Line Pilots Association 9:39 PM 03/28/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5560093 This week, the U.S. Travel Association will bring industry professionals to Washington, D.C., for their annual meeting. But they won’t be speaking for the whole travel industry because, frankly, they’re missing some key players. U.S. Travel doesn’t represent a single major U.S. airline, yet they have waded deeply into a debate about the future of the U.S. airline industry and its ability to compete fairly. It’s a debate about government-subsidized foreign airlines and the threat they pose to our economy and millions of American jobs. And, despite its name, “U.S. Travel” is taking sides on behalf of foreign interests. Major U.S. airlines and their employees have joined their European counterparts in calling for the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to stop pouring billions of dollars in subsidies into their state-owned carriers: Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. This massive subsidization is a violation of our trade agreements with these countries and has roiled the global aviation industry, pushing other airlines off existing routes and taking existing passengers away from rule-abiding competitors in Europe, Australia, Asia and now the United States, and costing good U.S. jobs. The U.S. airline industry is concerned for good reason. But strangely, U.S. Travel is not. Peeling back this onion is easy. When you look at U.S. Travel’s funders, at the highest sponsorship level, the Chairman’s Circle, there are two airlines listed – Emirates and Etihad. The only U.S. airline the group represents is one small U.S. regional carrier called ViaAir. It seems U.S. Travel is willing to use its American branding to represent foreign-owned airlines, whose interests are completely at odds with the majority of the U.S. airline industry that operates most of the flights in and out of the U.S. Therefore, we shouldn’t listen to them when they say are they advocating for what’s best for America’s aviation industry. The United States’ interest here is in keeping a healthy aviation market that supports millions of jobs and provides national and international service connecting America’s small and mid-sized communities with the world. As a professional pilot for 27 years and a representative of 55,000 airline pilots in the U.S. and Canada, I recognize the full value of America’s aviation network and the jobs that come with it. The three U.S. global carriers—along with their regional partners—support hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs and provide billions in U.S. wages. U.S. Travel also likes to claim that their members’ orders of Boeing aircraft somehow outweigh the economic benefits of a stable U.S. airline industry. Economists have debunked this argument, but it can be rebutted simply – to buy planes, airlines need routes that aren’t being undermined. American jobs making planes depend on America’s airlines having a fair opportunity to compete if they’re going to purchase aircraft. More important, ordering U.S. planes should not serve as an excuse for any country to violate its trade agreements with the United States. We know the value of Open Skies agreements and we respect their principal goal: the reduction of government interference in the market. When these deals are working the way they should, airlines focus on what they do best – flying their customers around the world. President Trump was right to say that America’s trade deals need to work for American workers. Enforcement of America’s trade deals matters to all Americans, including those who fly, service, and make the planes, those who work in and around airports, and those who travel as a passengers. We should be concerned when a U.S. industry isn’t able to compete on a fair footing, and even more concerned when agents representing foreign interests claim to speak for the American aviation industry. Capt. Tim Canoll is the tenth president of the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), which represents more than 55,000 professional airline pilots who fly for 32 airlines in the United States and Canada, and is the largest nongovernmental aviation safety organization in the world.

Sebastien Roblin March 29, 2017 TweetShareShare The Su-35S can carry over 17,000 pounds of munitions on its hardpoints, with up to 14 usable for air-to-ground attacks. The F-15C can carry…none. Because it is purely an air superiority fighter. (To be fair, refitting for ground combat would not be an insurmountable task—Israel already refitted its Eagles in the 70s in this manner and used them destroy the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osiriak.) The F-15E Strike Eagle can carry 23,000 pounds of ordnance. The Strike Eagle can fly just as fast as the F-15C and carry the same air-to-air weapons, but it is somewhat less maneuverable and agile in Within Visual Range combat due to its heavier weight. In other practical respects, the Russian military makes less use of precision-guided munitions than the United States, and uses a smaller range of types. However, the Su-35 is well equipped to employ them using the ground-attack mode of its Irbis-E radar. I have been asked to compare the venerable American F-15 Eagle fighter to Russia’s new competitor for the crown of best Fourth Generation fighter, the Su-35S “Flanker E.” The former is the airplane that in many ways defined what a Fourth Generation fighter can do. Introduced in the 1970s, it has been extensively updated to keep with the times—and hundreds will remain in service for decades to come. The latter is an upgraded Su-27 Flanker—the Soviet-era counterpart to the F-15—now sporting modernized avionics and munitions, fancy vector-thrust engines and a fresh coat of radar-absorbent paint. I’ve written in detail about the Su-35S before, and the National Interest’s Dave Majumdar has written an excellent analysis of how the two aircraft would fare in aerial clash. He concluded that regardless of their differences, the two aircraft were more or less closely matched. As a result, supporting assets and pilot skill are more likely to determine the outcomes of an engagement between the two rather than any technological gap. Here, I’d like to break down the strengths and weaknesses of the two aircraft, and how those will inform their ability to perform various mission. Sensors and Stealth The Su-35S has a powerful Irbis-E passive electronically scanned array radar with a range of up to 400 kilometers; it is also effective against ground targets. However, the F-15’s APG-63 V3 Active Electronically Scanned Array radar is superior—harder to jam, higher resolution and harder to track. The Su-35 boasts an infrared search and track system (IRST), which allows it to determine the general position of aircraft within a fifty kilometer radius—potentially quite useful for detecting stealth aircraft at shorter ranges. The F-15 doesn’t have an IRST. However, a new add-on pod that is entering service, Talon HATE, will not only add an IRST to the F-15 but provide data fusion with other air and surface sensors, even allowing it to network with F-22 Raptor stealth fighters, which use a nonstandard datalink. Using this system, Raptors could fly ahead and identify hostile targets and send the targeting data to missile-firing F-15s a safer distance to the rear. The F-15 wasn’t designed to be stealthy—and it isn’t, with an average radar cross section of five meters squared. The Su-35 has been designed for stealth, and reportedly can achieve a radar cross section ranging between one to three meters squared. So the Su-35 will show up on radars less quickly—but a radar cross-section of one meter squared can still be detected at fairly long ranges by good modern radars, and will not protect it from being targeted by long-range missiles. Beyond Visual Range Combat:  The latest air to air missiles can be launched at targets well over 100 kilometers away. While the United States Air Force is convinced that beyond visual range (BVR) combat will dominate air warfare in the twenty-first century, with missiles fired over vast distances, the Russian aviation establishment is more skeptical. It holds that electronic counter measures and evasive maneuvers will lower the hit probability against maneuverable fighter aircraft considerably below the projected fifty to seventy percent hit rate. Russian aircraft are still designed to engage in BVR warfare, but with the belief that short-range combat is likely to ensue after BVR volleys are exchanged. In terms of weapons load, the Su-35 has twelve or more hardpoints for carrying missiles compared to just eight on the F-15C. This is a clear advantage for the Su-35, which will likely fire multiple missiles at a time to increase hit probability; however, this edge may prove temporary. Boeing is offering to upgrade F-15s with quad-rail racks that will double the F-15’s loadout to sixteen. This would enable rear-deployed F-15s to serve as “missile boats” firing at targets painted by a vanguard of F-22 stealth fighters. For the time being, however, the F-15 is out-missiled. Both the F-15 and Su-35 carry long-range, radar-guided air-to-air missiles: the AIM-120D (160 kilometer range) and the K-77M (200 kilometers range). These missiles are basically in the same class—though the comparative effectiveness of their seekers has yet to be established—and would likely be fired under their maximum range when used against fighter-type aircraft to increase the likelihood of a kill.

Image by: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images Save & Share Tweet Email Print UK billionaire entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson has raised the prospect of planes being made entirely from the so-called wonder material, graphene, within 10 years, as the airline industry labours under a 50% increase in fuel in the past year, sparking a desperate need for lighter fleets. The Virgin Atlantic president described the super-lightweight material as a "breakthrough technology" which, he said, could help revolutionise the airline industry and transform its cost base. Speaking in Seattle, where Virgin has just begun flights on a daily basis, Branson said: "Graphene is even lighter [than carbon fibre], many times lighter and many times stronger. "Hopefully graphene can be the planes of the future.10 years down the line. They would be massively lighter than the current planes, which again would make a difference on fuel burn." Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms forming a regular hexagonal pattern and is extracted from graphite. It has a litany of uses and is said to be as light as a feather yet stronger than steel. The entrepreneur likened the push for graphene planes to urging Airbus and Boeing to make planes from carbon fibre, a battle he won. Boeing's latest 787 Dreamliner planes, which Virgin is flying on the London Heathrow-Seattle route, are made from 50% carbon fibre and other composite materials, as opposed to the traditional 100% aluminium. They use 30% less fuel than their standard alternatives.
