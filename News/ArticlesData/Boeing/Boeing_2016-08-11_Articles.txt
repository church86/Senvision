Consider the following analysis. Low Orders Are Not Indicative Of Possible Peril: As of the latest quarter, Boeing’s commercial business had a robust backlog of about $472 billion with close to 5,700 orders in the pipeline. The company can also count  on the $55 billion backlog at Defense, Space & Security. [1] This means that, at the current rate of production, the company can continue uninterrupted production for the next 7 years. So far in the year, Boeing has secured only 334 orders. [2] But one must not fret as history has proven that airline orders are cyclical in nature. Relevant Articles Boeing: Will The Iran Deal Be Successful? What Lies Ahead For Boeing? Why We Revised Our Price Estimate For Boeing Downwards What Can We Expect From Boeing Under Trump’s Presidency Boeing Q3 Earnings: Earnings Beat As Future Seems Clearer What Can We Expect From Boeing’s Q3 Earnings? What has happened is that with fuel prices so low, airlines can afford to wait on buying new planes. Unless the world spirals into recession, we can expect the orders to bounce back within the next five years. For instance, orders for the 787 Dreamliner has slowed for the third year in a row. That said, CEO Dennis Muilenberg has confirmed that delivery slots for the 787 in 2018 are fully assigned. Furthermore, for 2019 and 2020, delivery slots are almost 75% full at the current production rate. With so many delivery slots open after 2020, airlines need not place orders immediately. This indicates that we can expect deliveries to pick up in the next few years as old planes will need retiring. Until then, the heavy backlog can help sustain operations. [3] Additionally, let’s not forget that Airbus (Boeing’s main rival) is also pretty much in the same boat as Boeing. While Boeing orders are down 8.4% year over year, Airbus orders are down 8.6% year over year. [4] The 737 Is A Clear Winner: The 737 is seeing increasing demand with every quarter. Since the introduction of the 737 MAX, the model has bagged close to 3,200 firm orders. The aircraft is powered by the newly designed CFM International LEAP-1B high-bypass turbofan engines that are 20% more fuel efficient. Currently, the program has a strong backlog of 4,400 orders. The company has revealed that due to the high demand, the production for the aircraft will be heavily ramped up and the entry into service will be accelerated. [5] Boeing is on track to increase production of the 737 from the current 42 per month to approximately 47 in 2017. Additionally, the company plans to push production to a further 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. This esteemed airframe is generating significant demand, as per our calculations, even at the 2019 production rate, the program will continue to remain oversold. Business At Defense, Space & Security Could See Increased Demand: Boeing has seen good demand for all defense programs in the year so far. Not accounting for the one-time charge on the KC-40A tanker program, the company has performed solidly in the last quarter. As mentioned previously, the defense segment boasts of a $55 billion backlog, 37% of which is from international customers. Domestically, the Obama administration’s budget request for FY 2017 highlights advances in key BDS programs. The company anticipates a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next five years. Additionally, most technical glitches on the KC-46A tanker have been mended. Unless Boeing runs into more problems into the fuel tanker program, we expect the company to move on to low-rate initial production (LRIP) despite the delays and recurring cost overruns (paid for by Boeing). [6] In conclusion, we can say that Boeing is far from doomed as can be seen from its robust order backlog, and the heavy demand in the 737 program and Defense, Space and Security segment.

Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s acquisition head, declared the program has successfully cleared Milestone C review late Friday. The Air Force expects to award the first two Low Rate Initial Production lots within the next 30 days. Those contracts will cover 19 and associated spare parts, for a pre-negotiated $2.8 billion combined value. "The KC-46 is ready to take the next step," Gen. Dave Goldfein, Air Force Chief of Staff, said in a service release. "Our Air Force and Boeing team stepped up to meet the recent challenges.  I'm especially proud of the employees on the floor of the Boeing plant, and employees of all our industry partners, who work every day to deliver game-changing capability to the warfighter.  My hat's off to them and our program leads."  As part of the Milestone C requirements, the KC-46 had to prove it could refuel an F-16, C-17, and A-10 off of its boom, as well as use the hose and drogue systems on an AV-8 and F/A-18. The KC-46 also had to take in fuel from a KC-10. Those tests were delayed, however, after the discovery that the KC-46 boom struggled to deliver fuel to heavier aircraft such as the C-17. While Boeing was able to design a bypass to help better regulate the fuel flow, that problem contributed to a delay that pushed a Milestone C decision from June to August, and the delivery of the first 18 certified tankers to the Air Force from August 2017 to January 2018. Boeing is operating under a development contract that caps taxpayer costs at $4.9 billion, and the company has already taken $1.9 billion in pre-tax charges due to cost overruns. Entering the production stage is the first step towards recouping some of those losses. The Air Force plans to procure 179 KC-46A models over the life of the program. The service has long-term plans for KC-Y and KC-Z programs, which Boeing hopes to secure as additional buys of the KC-46. "Production approval is an important, positive step for the program and the Boeing/Air Force team has worked extremely hard to get to this point," a Boeing spokesman said in a statement. ?We expect the first low-rate initial production contract to follow shortly, and look forward to continuing our progress building the world's most capable tanker."

Djibouti - Air Djibouti took delivery of the first Boeing 737-400 aircraft in Djibouti in preparation for the launch of Air Djibouti’s new commercial operations. His Excellency Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, President of the Republic of Djibouti, Mr. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, Chairman of Air Djibouti, along with other dignitaries, met the plane and crew at Djibouti’s International Airport in a ceremony welcoming this important step in Djibouti’s development as a global transport hub. Bruce Dickinson, Chairman of Cardiff Aviation, which provides Air Djibouti with operational management, delivered the Boeing 737-400 personally. The plane travelled from Cardiff, stopping in Malta for re-fuelling. The plane will officially go into service on August 16, flying to regional destinations initially. Air Djibouti plans to introduce two BA146-300 aircraft by mid-September and mid-October, and a Boeing 767-200 in December this year, initially operating between Djibouti and London. Other international destinations are expected to follow soon after, as well as regional freight services. UK-based aircraft services and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) company, Cardiff Aviation, is providing technical assistance and management, and secured the European-level Air Operator’s Certificate for Air Djibouti. The launch of Air Djibouti’s commercial operations is a crucial element of the Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority (DPFZA)’s strategy for establishing Djibouti as a major logistics centre for the region. With two new airports under construction that are expected to be operational by 2019, the country is building its air transport links to complement its already well established road, rail and maritime transport network. Bruce Dickinson said: “The arrival of the first aircraft comes at a particularly exciting time for the region as Djibouti leads in spearheading the growth of aviation in East Africa.” Djibouti is strategically located on the second busiest shipping lane in the world. It is a natural meeting point for the East and West’s global business development. The DPFZA is working to replicate its success in port logistics in the aviation sector. Air Djibouti’s commercial operations will further develop the country’s international connections and accessibility. Djibouti’s current transport and logistics infrastructure programme exceeds $15 billion. Discussion Be the first to comment on this article!

Over the next two years, NASA will work with six companies to produce prototypes for deep space habitats. Among the collaborators are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Bigelow. Boeing is also working with NASA on the SLS, and Bigelow recently sent up the BEAM inflatable space hab module to the ISS. NASA and CubeSats are really a thing lately. They’re Facebook official. NASA’s Dellingr satellite, named for the Norse god of the dawn, launched this week to study the Earth’s atmosphere and mind its weather patterns. Dellingr is a 6U CubeSat, which makes it about the size of a cereal box. It’s a really powerful cereal box, with a magnetometer and a tiny mass spec. Credit: NASA NASA’s work with Lockheed is also giving NASA a chance to wedge in a little CubeSat science around the edges of the Orion mission. The connector ring that links Orion to the rocket is built with 13 bays for CubeSats. Lockheed is sending up a 6U CubeSat named SkyFire, which has a sweet new thin-and-light infrared camera as part of its science package. For the low, low price of a ride to space, NASA gets a bunch of data out of the SkyFire mission. Skyfire. Credit: Lockheed Martin Also from NASA’s R&D elite: work on the new SLS rocket engine led to the development of a high-dynamic-range (HDR) camera called, in their usual imaginative style, HiDyRS-X. It’s capable of balancing exposure between the incredibly bright plume of fire coming out of a rocket engine, and the comparatively cool, dim metal of the engine itself. This is what it sees when it looks at an SLS test burn: Top panel: without HiDyRS-X. Bottom panel: with HiDyRS-X. Images: NASA Elsewhere in the universe… It’s not too late to catch the Perseids! They peak in about a five-day window centered around the wee morning hours of August 12th this year, so there’s still time to catch the tail end of this year’s meteor shower. Your best chance to see a fireball is after the waxing moon sets, but before dawn begins to break. It’s even cooler if you think about it in 3D: the meteor shower is actually us passing through the enormous network of debris trails left in the orbital wake of the comet Swift-Tuttle. Perseid Meteors Over Ontario. Image Credit: Darryl Van Gaal (via NASA) Researchers sifted through Kepler’s entire catalog and found twenty rocky exoplanets that really beg for further observation. Based on size, composition and distance from their host star, we think they’re the most like Earth of any we’ve found yet: temperate, rocky planets with liquid water, orbiting Sun-like stars. Speaking of Kepler’s recent exploits, researchers discovered that the “alien megastructure star” is dimming, and we don’t know why. None of the natural mechanisms scientists have presented can completely explain the way this star’s light output is dropping over time at a non-linear rate: it’s not a planet, and it’s not behaving like it should if it’s going to explode. We’ve observed fluctuations in brightness of up to 20%, along with a gradual dimming across years. What could possibly be going on? My favorite hypothesis is that it’s a Dyson sphere, à la Pandora’s Star… Tagged In space nasa kepler solar system lockheed martin this week in space cubesats perseids Post a Comment Comment ExtremeTech Newsletter Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

This week Nasa named its six partners for developing crafts to house a human crew in deep space. Concept habitats will be built here on Earth, to help the space agency gain a better insight into the needs and opportunities for extensive manned missions around the moon and beyond.  Nasa has named its six partners for developing crafts house a human crew in deep space. Included in the mix is a design from Bigelow Aerospace (illustrated is its XBASE module docking with the International Space Station), the Nevada-based firm behind the inflatable pod recently installed on the International Space Station Nasa has released artists' impressions from its six contenders, which come from well-established aerospace firms already working with space agencies on satellite and probe technology. Included in the mix is Bigelow Aerospace, the Nevada-based firm behind the inflatable pod recently installed on the International Space Station, as well as long standing partners Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Share this article Share The partnerships are part of Nasa's 'NextSTEP' programme, which will see a mix of private and public expertise and resources combined to push the existing boundaries of manned space exploration, initially testing a manned habitat near the moon as a testing ground for Mars and beyond. ‘The NextSTEP partnerships are a large contribution to the dual objectives of advancing deep space habitation development and stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit,’ said Jason Crusan, Nasa’s director of Advanced Exploration Systems. Boeing Aerospace's design for a habitation module illustrates the interior.  The partnerships are part of Nasa's 'NextSTEP' programme, which will see a mix of private and public expertise and resources combined to push the existing boundaries of manned space exploration DESIGNS FOR DEEP SPACE HABITATS Nasa has put out the call for design proposals for deep space habitats which astronauts will call home on the long-haul journeys.  For manned missions to Mars and beyond astronauts will need a safe and relatively comfortable space to live for deep space missions. The outbound leg of a trip to Mars could take anywhere from 150 to 300 days, depending on the positions of the planets, so the crew will need room to stretch their legs and enough shielding to protect them from high levels of DNA-shredding radiation. The rise of private space ventures, such as Space X and Bigelow Aerospace, is opening up space exploration to collaborations which marry the expertise of state agencies with the business drive of the private sector. Earlier this year, Crusan highlighted the importance of collaboration in pushing the boundaries of space exploration. He said: 'Nasa is increasingly embracing public-private partnerships to expand capabilities, and opportunities in space.'  All of the habitat designs incorporate the same core components, including a pressurised space for the crew to live, along with environmental control and life support systems.  They will also include propulsion technology, docking capability as well as sufficient radiation shielding, to protect the crew inside from the harsh environment of space. Building prototypes on the ground will enable extensive testing and provide Nasa and its partners crucial data on how the various systems interact. Lockheed Martin is working on a prototype of a refurbished logistics module (pictured), the general purpose modules used to deliver cargo to the ISS. The concept artwork illustrates an air lock hatch through which the crew can access the exterior to carry out maintenance work Another of the partners, Orbital ATK, will continue development of a habitat based on its unmanned Cygnus spacecraft (illustrated), which has also made successful delivery runs to the ISS  Boeing will develop a modular habitat based on the firm’s experience gathered from working on the ISS for more than 15 years.  The full-scale prototype will be built on the ground to test the systems and the suitability as a habitat for astronauts for extended periods. A second approach will see Lockheed Martin refurbish a multi-purpose logistics module, similar to the ones which carry cargo to the space station, while Orbital ATK will continue development of a habitat based on its unmanned Cygnus spacecraft, which has also made successful delivery runs to the ISS. Sierra Nevada Corporation plans to use its Dream Chaser spacecraft along with an inflatable module, testing all systems together (illustrated)  One of the partners is basing its prototype of a low-Earth orbit plane to transport up to seven passengers.  Sierra Nevada Corporation plans to use its Dream Chaser spacecraft along with an inflatable module, testing all systems together. The inflatable approach is already being tested in space, with Bigelow’s expandable BEAM habitat installed aboard the space station.  The firm aims to expand on this success further with an even larger 330 cubic metre pod called the XBase. The final partner is the Ixion Team, a conglomerate of three small aerospace space firms which will look at converting a rocket’s launch stage into a pressurised habitat.  Ixion Team is a conglomerate of three small aerospace space firms which will look at converting a rocket’s launch stage into a pressurised habitat (illustrated) more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Touching commercial shows family waking up with tiger in home Watch video Justin Bieber leaves fan bloodied after throwing a punch Watch video Strip club performs the Mannequin Challenge with customers Watch video Chrissy Teigen's underwear-free American Music Awards look Watch video Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Watch video Disgusting moment man squeezes ingrown hair on his friend's back Watch video Middle-aged man's sad step-by-step guide to microwave meal Watch video Kanye West hospitalized 'for his own health and safety' Watch video PBS special explores USS Arizona 75 years after Pearl Harbor Watch video Breastmilk champion shares tandem feeding with her two sons Watch video Embarassed Prince Harry turns down dance in Antigua Watch video President Obama awards his last Presidential Medals of Freedom Share or comment on this article e-mail 175 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Kanye West hospitalized 'for his own health and safety' Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

Domestic flights for national carrier Garuda began operating in the morning from Soekarno-Hatta airport's steel and glass $560 million Terminal 3. Its international flights will shift to the new terminal next month. Other airlines will gradually move their flights to the terminal and the airport company plans to start refurbishing two old terminals, built in 1984 and 1992, later this year. Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, is one of world's fastest growing air travel markets. But many international airlines bypass the capital Jakarta in favor of modern, high-capacity airports at Bangkok, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur for their Southeast Asian stopovers. Passengers wait for their flights on the first day of operation of the new terminal of Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang near Jakarta on Aug. 9, 2016. The Indonesian capital's airport opened its $560 million, steel and glass Terminal 3 Tuesday after years of operating at far above its passenger capacity.  (Photo: Tatan Syuflana, AP) The airport operator and government hopes the new terminal, and a third runway that is under development, will change that. Budi Karya Sumadi, Indonesia's transport minister and former president of the airport company, said "this terminal was built to change the image of the capital Jakarta." Soekarno-Hatta airport will be able to handle 62 million passengers a year once the renovated terminals are fully operational again in early 2018. The airport handled about 54 million passengers last year, making it the 18th busiest in the world, according to Airports Council International. An electric train from the airport to the city is slated for completion in early 2017.

Here's how these two peas in a pod are using Azure data technologies to make commercial flights more efficient and even (gasp!) more pleasant. By Andrew Brust for Big on Data | August 11, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (06:00 PDT) | Topic: Big Data Analytics Boeing 787 Dreamliner Last month, in a keynote at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference (WPC), Microsoft demonstrated on stage how Japan Airlines is using HoloLens to improve the technician training experience, bringing jet engines to life in 3D, hologram-based augmented reality. Neat stuff. read this Delta outage highlights how airline industry needs new IT approaches The airline industry is plagued by legacy systems and single points of IT failure. How'd we get here? Mergers, bankruptcy restructurings, and falling behind the cloud curve. Read More But a week after WPC, Microsoft announced that it and Boeing are partnering around Azure and data. I wanted to know more about that. Given that commercial airplanes are described by some as "flying data centers" and considering the number of inefficiencies that exist in commercial air travel today (just ask anyone who flies more than once a year), the potential for analytics in commercial aviation seems immense, and so do the potential benefits. Talking to both companies I asked Microsoft if I could learn more and the company was kind enough to set me up to speak with Andrew Gendreau, the director of advanced information solutions in Boeing's Digital Aviation division, and Greg Jones, Microsoft's global industry director for travel & hospitality. Although we only had a short time to speak, I found out a lot. For one thing, Microsoft and Boeing already had a partnership in place and have already worked together using Microsoft's application development stack, especially its tools for mobile applications. One output of that collaboration: tablet-based Electronic Flight Bag software that replaces paper-based flight bags, containing books and documents, often weighing as much as 40 lbs! Predictive Examples Under the existing partnership, things like Maintenance Optimization, Crew Planning, and Crew Training were already being addressed. Fuel optimization was in motion as well, and it's fascinating. By observing fuel usage over all of its flights, an airline can build predictive models which predict fuel usage needs over time. These models can account for the idiosyncrasies of certain routes (and their typical air traffic delays), seasonal anomalies, equipment, passenger load, and so forth. These models can then be used to drive policy, performance targets, financial aspects of fuel procurement (potentially including hedging strategies), and the necessary change management to make all of these procedures and systems work better. All in But now the two companies are moving beyond these specific initiatives, with an eye towards a thorough re-platforming that would build and host all efficiency applications on Azure. The scope of this is huge, and it benefits not just the airlines, but passengers too. Have you been on a flight that seemed to be running on-time only to encounter a maintenance issue at the last minute? Ever waited for the part and the technician to arrive and fix the problem or, worse yet, have to deplane and switch aircraft? When such things happen, it infuriates passengers. It's also expensive and disruptive to the airline -- the delays are costly and the impact on flight crews' morale and performance is non-trivial. Multiple contingencies, in model form The good news is that predictive models can help here, in many ways. Predictive maintenance can avoid operational maintenance incidents overall. And where they can't do that for specific aircraft, they can still assist greatly in making sure the right parts and personnel are on-call, in the locations where such issues are most likely. Special Feature Cloud: How to Do SaaS Right Software as a Service offers irresistible benefits for organizations of all sizes — from cost savings to scalability to mobile accessibility. We offer guidance on avoiding the pitfalls of the cloud and choosing your SaaS partners well. Read More This overall discipline is called (I kid you not) "disruption management" and encompasses things such as schedule execution, equipment utilization optimization, and performance of crew. Another important component of this work is determining the optimal set of actions required to mitigate outages and equipment failures. These outages include not just the aircraft and its navigational components but hardware and services in support of the customer journey, including things like climate control, overhead lights, and the in-flight video system. All together Of course, all of these services are delivered by the airlines (or "operators") and not Boeing, per se. But in addition to manufacturing aircraft, Boeing offers management systems for these operational needs to its airline customers. As Microsoft builds out its data cloud with services like Azure Machine Learning, HDInsight (with Spark and R), Azure IoT Suite, and Power BI, Boeing thinks it's got a full-on platform on which it can standardize. Microsoft is a database company, an enterprise software company, and a cloud computing company. It seems that combination is exactly what a company like Boeing needs as it establishes such a wide-ranging partnership.

The result was the worst downturn here since the Great Depression — this was when the “Will the last person leaving Seattle — turn out the lights” billboard was put up by two real-estate agents near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. This history echoes a bit with the story from my colleague Dominic Gates about Boeing admitting “softness” in the widebody market that not only affects the 777 and 787, but casts a pall over the upcoming 777x, heavily subsidized by state taxpayers. (If you haven’t read it, please do so. I don’t mind waiting). Softness? The story reads, “Boeing has said it needs to sell 40 to 60 jets per year to fill all the open 777 delivery slots between now and the end of the decade. So far this year, it has booked just eight net new orders.” Related story Boeing admits ‘softness’ in widebody orders, weighs Everett slowdown Despite being a much more economically diverse region with technopolis and major world headquarters, this is still Jet City. Boeing is the largest private-sector employer in the state. It remains — despite the ministrations of former CEO Jim “Lil Jack Welch” McNerney — a bastion of family-wage union jobs.

By Mary-Ann Russon August 11, 2016 18:23 BST Boeing has made major progress with the Starline CST-100, which will be the first new space capsule to take astronauts into space from US soilBoeing As part of continued efforts to revitalise the US space industry and once again have astronauts launched into space from American soil, Boeing and Nasa are striving ahead to build space capsule called Starliner that will feature 21st century technology to get humans and cargo into low-earth orbit destinations. The Starliner CST-100 crew taxi vehicle is a space capsule designed to fit the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket. The capsule's parachute and airbag system enables it to be reused up to 10 times, it flies autonomously (with backup manual controls just in case) and it can hold five passengers comfortably as well as cargo. Test flights on a prototype of the Starliner CST-100 are meant to take place in 2016, with the intention that the Starliner will be able to fly Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) and back in 2018, and eventually to the Bigelow Aerospace orbital space complex that is currently being developed for launch in 2020. A glimpse at the future of US space ambitions The pressure hull for Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner structural test article sits inside a repurposed space shuttle hangar at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in FloridaNASA/Kim Shiflett Boeing recently gave the media a first look at the Starliner factory – the 50,000sq ft high Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility (C3PF) high bay at the Kennedy Space Center in a hangar that previously housed the orbiter Discovery and cost $20m (£15.4m) to refurbish. Currently, there is currently no direct American access to the ISS and Nasa has to pay $70m (£48.3m) per seat for US astronauts to ride on Russia's Soyuz space capsules. To counter this, Nasa has awarded both SpaceX and Boeing over $8.2bn to help private firms revitalise the space industry as soon as possible, and Boeing is calling in small businesses to help it with the many components needed to make the spacecraft a reality. The aerospace manufacturer told Universe Today that it was currently simultaneously building two full scale Starliner crew vehicles at full speed, while work is almost complete on the Structural Test Article (STA) crew module, which will be sent to a test site in California so that qualification tests can begin to make sure the that all the components in the space vehicle are structurally sound. The Starliner CST-100 is meant to be much lighter than previous space capsules, using a weldless spin-forming process to produce a honeycomb effect that makes the capsule both lighter and more resilient to the stress placed on the spacecraft during flight. While the space capsules continue to be built, this weekend (13 August), Nasa, Boeing and ULA plan to showcase the CST-100 Starliner Crew Access Arm and White Room to the Crew Access Tower on Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The arm will serve as the connection that astronauts will walk through prior to boarding Boeing's Starliner spacecraft when stacked atop ULA's Atlas V rocket. On track to deliver space capsule to Nasa in 2018 The Crew Access Arm will be used as a bridge by astronauts to board Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft as it stands on the launch pad atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocketNASA/Ben Smegelsky At the moment, everything is on track for the pad abort test that will make sure the spacecraft is able to life astronauts away from danger if there is an emergency during launch. That test will take place in October 2017, while a full unmanned orbital test flight is slated to take place by the end of 2017, and the plan is for three crew taxi vehicles to be ready for Nasa deployment by 2018. If all goes well, there will be a two-person crew test flight in February 2018, launched atop the Atlas V rocket, and in August 2018, SpaceX plans to hold a similar crew test flight on a Dragon space rocket to the ISS. "It's important for our team to understand the legacy of the shuttle program, all the lessons we learned on the shuttle program, and transition to the next phase of human spaceflight," said John Mulholland, head of Boeing's commercial space program, according to Florida Today. "I'm extremely confident that if our team continues to perform to our plan, that we're going to be just fine. We're really proud of our team at what we've accomplished, and feel very comfortable that we will capture the flag and be the first partner of Nasa to return humans to the International Space Station on a domestic system."

NASA has been discussing potential partnership opportunities with Bigelow for its inflatable habitat technologies as part of NASA's goal to develop innovative technologies to ensure that the U.S. remains competitive in future space endeavors. (Photo : Photo by Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images) In hopes of surviving in space, NASA is partnering with private companies to build space habitats. The Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program has partnered with approximately six companies to build the prototypes which would meet the criteria of basic life support to radiation mitigation. Advertisement For NASAs NextSTEP program, six private companies have been selected. These include a few renowned names in the US aerospace industry namely Orbital ATK, Bigelow Aerospace, Nanoracks, Boeing, Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems, and Lockheed Martin. However, not all of the companies will be building space habitat modules. A few are said to focus on propulsion systems, communication infrastructure, and other equipment needed for survival in space. The space habitats created by the companies will become part of the mission to Mars set for 2030. The three private companies focused on creating space habitats are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, and NanoRacks. Bigelow Aerospace is developing an Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE), which is an expandable habitat. This 330 cubic meter space habitat would be attached to the visiting module of an existing space station. Boeing's space habitat is a capsule designed to be assembled while in orbit. Low cost and quite simple, the Boeing space habitat can be modified for long term deep space missions. The third space habitat is from NanoRacks, which is in partnership with two companies namely United Launch Alliance and Space Systems Loral. The habitat called "Ixion" will make use of repurposed propellant tanks of launch vehicles. These will be converted into a space habitat. If the design works, this can be a cost saving measure. As for Lockheed Martin, the private company is set on developing a logistic module. This will be used for the Orion spacecraft. The main component of Lockheed Martin's logistic module is its Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). Advertisement Orbital ATK will be creating cargo supply ships in the form of the Cygnus Spacecraft for the International Space Station (ISS). The Cygnus Spacecraft is reportedly a new prototype which will be used in tandem with other deep space modules and the Orion Spacecraft. Last but not the least is Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems. The private company is in charge of creating an unmanned reusable space vehicle, the Dream Chaser spaceplane.

Here's how these two peas in a pod are using Azure data technologies to make commercial flights more efficient and even (gasp!) more pleasant. By Andrew Brust for Big on Data | August 11, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (06:00 PDT) | Topic: Big Data Analytics Boeing 787 Dreamliner Last month, in a keynote at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference (WPC), Microsoft demonstrated on stage how Japan Airlines is using HoloLens to improve the technician training experience, bringing jet engines to life in 3D, hologram-based augmented reality. Neat stuff. read this Delta outage highlights how airline industry needs new IT approaches The airline industry is plagued by legacy systems and single points of IT failure. How'd we get here? Mergers, bankruptcy restructurings, and falling behind the cloud curve. Read More But a week after WPC, Microsoft announced that it and Boeing are partnering around Azure and data. I wanted to know more about that. Given that commercial airplanes are described by some as "flying data centers" and considering the number of inefficiencies that exist in commercial air travel today (just ask anyone who flies more than once a year), the potential for analytics in commercial aviation seems immense, and so do the potential benefits. Talking to both companies I asked Microsoft if I could learn more and the company was kind enough to set me up to speak with Andrew Gendreau, the director of advanced information solutions in Boeing's Digital Aviation division, and Greg Jones, Microsoft's global industry director for travel & hospitality. Although we only had a short time to speak, I found out a lot. For one thing, Microsoft and Boeing already had a partnership in place and have already worked together using Microsoft's application development stack, especially its tools for mobile applications. One output of that collaboration: tablet-based Electronic Flight Bag software that replaces paper-based flight bags, containing books and documents, often weighing as much as 40 lbs! Predictive Examples Under the existing partnership, things like Maintenance Optimization, Crew Planning, and Crew Training were already being addressed. Fuel optimization was in motion as well, and it's fascinating. By observing fuel usage over all of its flights, an airline can build predictive models which predict fuel usage needs over time. These models can account for the idiosyncrasies of certain routes (and their typical air traffic delays), seasonal anomalies, equipment, passenger load, and so forth. These models can then be used to drive policy, performance targets, financial aspects of fuel procurement (potentially including hedging strategies), and the necessary change management to make all of these procedures and systems work better. All in But now the two companies are moving beyond these specific initiatives, with an eye towards a thorough re-platforming that would build and host all efficiency applications on Azure. The scope of this is huge, and it benefits not just the airlines, but passengers too. Have you been on a flight that seemed to be running on-time only to encounter a maintenance issue at the last minute? Ever waited for the part and the technician to arrive and fix the problem or, worse yet, have to deplane and switch aircraft? When such things happen, it infuriates passengers. It's also expensive and disruptive to the airline -- the delays are costly and the impact on flight crews' morale and performance is non-trivial. Multiple contingencies, in model form The good news is that predictive models can help here, in many ways. Predictive maintenance can avoid operational maintenance incidents overall. And where they can't do that for specific aircraft, they can still assist greatly in making sure the right parts and personnel are on-call, in the locations where such issues are most likely. Special Feature Cloud: How to Do SaaS Right Software as a Service offers irresistible benefits for organizations of all sizes — from cost savings to scalability to mobile accessibility. We offer guidance on avoiding the pitfalls of the cloud and choosing your SaaS partners well. Read More This overall discipline is called (I kid you not) "disruption management" and encompasses things such as schedule execution, equipment utilization optimization, and performance of crew. Another important component of this work is determining the optimal set of actions required to mitigate outages and equipment failures. These outages include not just the aircraft and its navigational components but hardware and services in support of the customer journey, including things like climate control, overhead lights, and the in-flight video system. All together Of course, all of these services are delivered by the airlines (or "operators") and not Boeing, per se. But in addition to manufacturing aircraft, Boeing offers management systems for these operational needs to its airline customers. As Microsoft builds out its data cloud with services like Azure Machine Learning, HDInsight (with Spark and R), Azure IoT Suite, and Power BI, Boeing thinks it's got a full-on platform on which it can standardize. Microsoft is a database company, an enterprise software company, and a cloud computing company. It seems that combination is exactly what a company like Boeing needs as it establishes such a wide-ranging partnership.

The cadets from 17 units are part of the Northern Ireland Wing of the Air Training Corps who are currently working together to build a Sting S4 plane at Ulster Aviation Society’s Lisburn hangar. The project - Centennial Wings, which has been supported by funding from Boeing and the Air League, is in the early stages and cadets are working on the aircraft to ensure it will be ready to fly at Farnborough Air Show in 2018 to mark the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Royal Air Force. Sir Michael Arthur, president, Boeing Europe and managing director, Boeing UK commented: “These young men and women are the future of our industry and I could not be more proud that we can support this engaging, hands-on STEM initiative.” The Sting S4 ultralight aircraft is being built from kit, under the guidance of Sqn Ldr Ian Campbell, Wg Cdr Mike Miskimmin, volunteers from the Ulster Aviation Society as well as Boeing engineers who will also mentor the programme. The two-seater plane will have a state-of-the-art system of controls and instruments installed and when completed the aircraft will be capable of a maximum speed of 177 miles per hour. Project Officer Aaron Coulter commented on the project which is expected to take a year to complete: “This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the cadets who are taking part and a first for cadets from Northern Ireland. “They have all been greatly enthused by the project, it’s not everyday kids get the opportunity to build an aircraft.” Farnborough Airshow is described as ‘the world’s greatest airshow’ and the cadets will be in Hampshire to see their aircraft presented. “The project team will all be over at Farnborough,” added Aaron. “Our cadets travel to the Royal International Air Tattoo every year but cadets in Northern Ireland don’t get the opportunity to go to Farnborough so it will be a great experience to see the aircraft will fly at the airshow and also be on display for people to look at.” The biennial Farnborough Airshow alternates with the Paris Airshow. With about 1,500 exhibitors and some 100,000 trade visitors, Farnborough’s pulling power remains huge. It has played a key role as a marketplace for Britain’s aerospace and defence firms. The 17 squadrons involved in the project are: 72 (Omagh), 806 (Larne), 814 (Portadown College), 817 (Lisburn), 825 (Bangor), 833 (Antrim), 1134 (West Belfast), 1136 (South Belfast), 1137 (East Belfast), 1919 (Newtownabbey), 2004 (Ballynahinch), 2062 (Carrickfergus), 2178 (Hollywood), 2241 (Regent House School), 2349 (Ballymena), 2350 (Coleraine), 2390 (Belfast Royal Academy).

A state-of-the-art Etihad Airways Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner today touched down in Shanghai from Abu Dhabi on its first flight into China. The new Dreamliner features the airline's next-generation Business and Economy Class cabins, with 299 seats – 28 in Business Class and 271 in Economy – representing a 14 per cent capacity increase on the route. Flight EY862 from Abu Dhabi departed at 10.25pm yesterday arriving in Shanghai at 11.10am today. The inaugural flight from Shanghai (EY867) will depart again on 3 August at 00.30am, arriving in Abu Dhabi at 6.15am the same day. To mark the event, guests were presented with commemorative certificates in Chinese and English, featuring Shanghai's iconic landmark, the Oriental Pearl Tower. Peter Baumgartner, Chief Executive Officer of Etihad Airways, said: "Since launching flights between Shanghai and Abu Dhabi four years ago, we have experienced first-hand the huge growth of China's outbound tourism market and enjoyed strong demand from both business and leisure travellers. "The decision to upgrade to the Boeing 787 reflects the importance of Shanghai and China to the airline. Shanghai is a modern metropolis and a global economic, financial, trading and shipping centre, which underlines its importance within Etihad Airways' global network and supports the introduction of the new aircraft." Mr Baumgartner continued: "The new Boeing 787 services will help to support the increasing demand for outbound tourism from Shanghai and its surrounding cities in Eastern China. The additional capacity will enable more Chinese business and leisure travellers to enjoy seamless one-stop connections over the Abu Dhabi hub to over 40 destinations across the Gulf region, Europe, Africa and South America." China has recently surpassed the USA as the biggest business travel market in the world, according to the Global Business Travel Association, representing US$291.2 billion spending on business travel in 2015. The Dreamliner will assist Etihad Airways' growing reputation amongst the business community in China, with the aircraft specifically catering to the long-haul business market. The airline's world-renowned guest experience begins well before departure and lasts long after arrival. For example, its chauffeur service is available in over 30 cities globally including Beijing and Shanghai. At Terminal 3 in Abu Dhabi International Airport, guests pass through a dedicated premium check-in facility into the luxury of an exclusive Business Class Lounge, while a new flagship First Class Lounge & Spa opened at the end of May for First Class guests and eligible Etihad Airways Partners Platinum Frequent Flyers. On the aircraft, the Business Studios offer direct aisle access, a fully flat bed of up to 80.5 inches long, and an increase of 20 per cent in personal space. Upholstered in the finest Poltrona Frau leather, the Business Studio is equipped with an in-seat massage and pneumatic cushion control system which enables guests to adjust the firmness and comfort of their seat. Each Business Studio has an 18-inch personal touch-screen TV with noise-cancelling headsets. Business Class guests also have access to three choices of main course, with a dine-on-demand option for travellers who wish to choose when to eat. Each Business Class guest also receives a customised Etihad Airways LUXE amenity kit, inspired by some of the iconic cities on the airline's global network. Passengers on board have access to a dedicated Food and Beverage Manager, a multi-national crew and the airline's well known Flying Nanny, who provides assistance to parents travelling with young children. For inflight entertainment, Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE system on its flagship fleet of Boeing 787s and Airbus A380s. Guests can also enjoy mobile connectivity, access to onboard Wi-Fi and seven satellite channels of live TV on many aircraft. For Economy Class guests, the airline's Smart Seats provide enhanced comfort with a unique 'fixed wing' headrest, adjustable lumbar support, a seat width of approximately 19 inches and an 11.1" personal TV monitor on each seat. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner has been designed for optimum long-haul travel with enhancements including humidity controls while air pressure levels are set to ensure a smoother flight allowing guests to arrive feeling fresher on arrival. Shanghai is the seventh destination in the world to be served by Etihad Airways' B787-9 Dreamliner aircraft with the aircraft also deployed to Brisbane, Düsseldorf, Perth, Singapore, Washington DC, andZurich. Etihad Airways first launched a five-times-a-week two-class Airbus A330-200 services to Shanghai in March 2012. With a further 62 Boeing 787 Dreamliners scheduled for delivery over the next few years, the aircraft will become the mainstay of Etihad Airways' long-haul fleet.

Homes Heritage Perth and District Christmas House Tour 5 / 5 The latest update on defence contracts awarded David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen More from David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen Published on: August 11, 2016 | Last Updated: August 11, 2016 12:26 AM EST Training systems are being developed for the RCAF's Chinook helicopters (one of those helicopters is shown here in this USN photo). Bluedrop Performance Learning Inc. and Boeing recently announced they completed a major milestone in the development of the next-generation CH-47 Chinook helicopter Rear Crew Trainer with the integration of its Canadian-built fuselage with Boeing’s cockpit training simulator system. Share Adjust Comment Print The latest issue of Esprit de Corps magazine is out and it has my article outlining recently awarded contracts for the defence industry. Here is the article, based on info provided by the companies: IMP Aerospace has delivered the final re-winged P-3 Orion aircraft to the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF), marking the successful completion of the multi-year program, company officials announced. The aircraft are very similar to the Canadian CP140 Auroras, which are also receiving new wings, as well as mission system upgrades as part of a mid-life upgrade being undertaken at IMP Aerospace under a separate contract. The wing replacement is part of the Aircraft Service Life Extension Program (ASLEP), which also includes the replacement of the center wing lower surface and horizontal stabilizer, IMP noted. Under this program, all life-limiting components are replaced with new materials incorporating advanced alloys, yielding a five-fold increase in corrosion resistance and resulting in a significant reduction in future maintenance and operating costs, the firm pointed out. The ASLEP(N) contract was awarded to IMP in February 2008, to refit the entire RNoAF fleet of six P-3 Orion aircraft. L-3 MAS announced that it has been awarded a contract to provide avionics upgrade kits for the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18 early Lot C aircraft. The F/A-18 C+ upgrade kit will provide the USN with parts required to modernize a portion of its legacy fleet to ensure it maintains its operational viability to meet ongoing strike fighter commitments. The contract calls for 28 kits, L-3 MAS officials said. L-3 MAS provides F/A-18 A-D depot maintenance, system upgrade and life extension solutions and has provided such support to Canada, Australia, Finland, Spain, Switzerland and the U.S. Navy. Discovery Air Defence Services Inc., (DA Defence) has had its Standing Offers to provide interim Contracted Airborne Training Services (“ICATS”) to the Canadian government extended until December 2017, with two additional six-month option periods.  DA Defence has been the exclusive supplier of “fast jet” (Type 1) and “business jet” (Type 2) airborne training services to the Canadian Armed Forces through these Standing Offers since 2005, the company pointed out. The ICATS program supports live-fly Adversary, Joint Terminal Attack Controller training, Electronic Warfare and Electronic Attack training as well as live fire target practice. Bluedrop Performance Learning Inc. and Boeing announced they completed a major milestone in the development of the next-generation CH-47 Chinook helicopter Rear Crew Trainer with the integration of its Canadian-built fuselage with Boeing’s cockpit training simulator system. The fuselage is part of a forty-two foot-long mock-up of the Chinook helicopter that was manufactured by Bluedrop and installed in its Bluedrop Training and Simulation Centre facility in Halifax. The team has also tested, and is on track to achieve a 100 percent untethered, or wireless, virtual reality training experience to maximize the flexibility and safety of the trainer. The initial development phase of the trainer began one year ago following a more than US$2 million cash commitment from Boeing as well as, an intellectual property license associated with the specific technical characteristics of the Chinook platform, engineering support from the Boeing training and simulation group during the development phase, and a five-year commitment to support the on-going sales and marketing of the new product within Boeing’s global supply chain. The integration and testing process will continue through the fall, with a full demonstration of the stand-alone trainer ready by year end. Final delivery of the trainer to Boeing is anticipated in early 2017. The Chinook is used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Army Reserve, National Guard and more than 19 counties including Canada, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Italy, Greece, Spain, South Korea, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, Bluedrop Training & Simulation Inc., a subsidiary of Bluedrop Performance Learning Inc. received a US$13 million contract from Sikorsky to provide instructors and training courseware for pilots and maintainers learning to operate Canada’s new fleet of 28 CH-148 Cyclone maritime helicopters. The agreement extends by three years the training that Bluedrop has provided to the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project since 2010. Bluedrop will provide over 30 technician and aircrew instructors, simulator operators and training program support personnel for the 406 Operational and Training Squadron located at 12 Wing Shearwater in Nova Scotia. The Cyclone training suite includes two flight simulators, two operational mission simulators, six mission procedures trainers and two aircraft maintenance trainers; supplemented by several maintenance part task trainers. C4i Training & Technology of Calgary supported a series of emergency response exercises, running along the West Coast of the United States and Canada, in an effort to prepare local leaders for a large-scale earthquake and resulting tsunami. Exercises included: CASCADIA RISING (USA – WA, OR, FEMA Region 10), Coastal Response (Canada – EMBC) and Staunch Maple (Canada DND). C4i’s Emergency and Disaster Management Simulation was selected as the simulation driver for the Washington State National Guard and Oregon National Guard events on CASCADIA RISING. Also, in partnership with Calian, C4i provided EDMSIM to EMBC, providing the scenario, visualization and social media stimulus to the Provincial Emergency Management organization’s preparation exercise. GE’s Marine Solutions business in Peterborough, Ont., is completing one of the  first milestones of the company’s 7-year contract with Irving Shipbuilding Inc., to provide electrical power, propulsion systems, installation and commissioning services for six ice-capable Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships (AOPS) for the Royal Canadian Navy.  GE’s power and propulsion systems will position the new vessels amongst the highest performance in their class worldwide.  Four diesel generators and engines have been shipped to ISI’s Halifax Shipyard, and GE has begun acceptance testing on the first AOPS propulsion motor. General Dynamics Mission Systems–Canada successfully completed at-sea testing for its MATADOR Torpedo Detection System under the Build in Canada Innovation Program (BCIP). The testing, conducted on board a Royal Canadian Navy ship, confirmed the detection and tracking capabilities of the MATADOR system against heavyweight anti-ship torpedoes. MATADOR is an acoustic processing system optimized for torpedo detection and designed to be used with a wide range of passive underwater sensors. The system’s open architecture and flexible interface allow it to be configured to work seamlessly with almost any sensor. Sensor systems fitted with the specialized MATADOR acoustic analysis capability can provide additional levels of warning that reduce mission risk, allowing ships to operate more safely and effectively in the far oceans of the world. Under the BCIP, innovative Canadian products are matched with a government department for testing in a relevant operational environment. The MATADOR system was installed onboard HMCS Calgary using the existing towed sonar array as the underwater sensor. The Royal Canadian Navy recently tested an integrated submarine combat system developed by Lockheed Martin. The test marked Canada’s first use of the combat system with the MK 48 heavyweight torpedo, variant 7AT. The exercise took place at the Canadian Forces Maritime Experimental and Test Ranges (CFMETR) on the U.S. Navy Yard Torpedo Tender Battle Point, a surface ship that can launch torpedoes from submarine tubes, Lockheed Martin said. The next step is to install the submarine combat system on the Victoria class submarine for further test firings, according to Lockheed. The plan is to upgrade all Victoria Class submarines to the CCS 876 Combat System over the next few years. Along with the CCS 876 Combat System, the RCN is also deploying the AN/BQQ-10(v)7 sonar system developed by Lockheed Martin, the company pointed out.   What is happening with HMCS Charlottetown and the outbreak of Hand,...

MUMBAI: Preliminary inquiry into the Emirates Dubai crash landing suggest that the commander retracted the landing gear during a wind shear go-around after which the Boeing 777 aircraft lost speed rapidly and crash-landed onto the runway. A wind shear is a rapid change in wind speed and/or direction over a short area and by itself this weather phenomena rarely brings down a passenger jet such as a Boeing 777. "But when a go-around is carried out in wind shear, the standard operating procedure is to leave the aircraft configuration unchanged, that is, it's landing gear and flap settings should be left untouched," said a senior commander. So, if the landing gear is down, as would be the case when an aircraft approaches a runway to land, then it shouldn't be retracted till the aircraft has climbed clear off wind shear. That rule was probably not honoured. It is also suspected that the aircraft did not have full go-around power, which is needed to climb out of a wind shear situation. On August 3, the Boeing 777300 aircraft operating the Emirates ThiruvananthapuramDubai flight EK 521 crash landed on the 13,123-feet long Dubai runway 12 L at 12.50pm. The aircraft was engulfed in smoke and burst into flames a few minutes later. A commendably executed emergency evacuation ensured the survival of all the 282 passengers and 18 crew. While only the final investigation report will reveal a comprehensive picture of the sequence of events that led to the crash, preliminary inquiries put a question mark over the actions taken by the commander during the course of the wind shear go-around. "When it came down to land, the Boeing 777 continued to float over the runway and missed the touchdown zone," said the commander. This occurs when there is a strong tailwind (wind blowing from the tail to the nose of aircraft). The commander initiated a go-around, that is, instead of continuing with the landing, the aircraft would now climb, level out, descent and approach the runway for a second attempt at landing. A go-around is a standard, safe practice opted for by pilots when not sure of a safe landing. The commander would have pushed the TOGA (take off-go around) switch on the throttle which would rev up the engines to full throttle to give full power so as allow the aircraft to climb out of wind shear. "Now, during a wind shear go around, no changes should be made to the flap setting or landing gears till the aircraft has left the wind shear zone," he added. However, it seems, the Emirates commander didn't wait for it. It is also not clear whether the aircraft had attained full TOGA power too."After the aircraft climbed a bit, he seems to have raised the landing gear lever to retract the gear. The aircraft had its nose high up and all these actions together increases the drag on the aircraft, which in turn reduces its speed. The aircraft speed dipped and it stalled and crashed onto the runway. The pilots gave a Mayday call and ordered an evacuation," the source said.Capt M Ranganathan, an air safety expert said: "If they had followed the wind shear go around procedure correctly and left the landing gear down, the aircraft would have been safe." An Emirates spokesperson said: "The incident is currently being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Emirates is extending our full cooperation in this regard. We are unable to comment further. Both the Captain and the First Officer have over seven thousand hours of flying experience each." Only the final investigation report will reveal whether the actions taken by the commander led to the crash. What should be remembered though is that investigations should not carried out to apportion blame, but to find out the causes and to prevent a recurrence.

Thanks to This Man, Airplanes Don’t Crash Into Mountains Anymore Bloomberg 11/08/2016 The wreckage of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, a Boeing 727, smolders as recovery workers search for the bodies of 111 victims on Sept. 7, 1971, in Juneau, Alaska. Giant flocks of black birds circled the wreckage of an airliner that had struck an Alaska mountain two weeks earlier, killing all 111 aboard. In a small plane overhead, a young engineer directed his pilot to follow the same path the jet had taken toward the craggy terrain. With seconds to spare, an alarm went off. Don Bateman’s plane climbed to safety, but he was frustrated. The electronic device he invented to warn pilots that they were about to hit the ground didn’t leave enough time to have prevented the large airliner from crashing. “I was disappointed,” Bateman, now 84, recalled of the day in 1971 when he flew over the remains of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, which had slammed into a fog-shrouded ridge. “We needed to do better.” That’s exactly what Bateman and his small team of engineers at what is now Honeywell International Inc. did. The device presaged today’s mobile mapping applications, dramatically reduced what had been by far the worst class of air crashes and made Honeywell billions of dollars. © Mike Kane/Bloomberg Don Bateman with a Honeywell plane the company used to test his safety devices at Paine Field in Everett, Wash. “I would give Don individual credit for having saved more lives than any other individual in the history of commercial aviation,” said Earl Weener, a member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and former chief engineer for safety at Boeing Co. Before retiring in June, Bateman and his band of colleagues dabbled in the world of Cold War espionage, hid the true cost of their endeavor from their corporate masters and endured skepticism from the very airlines whose planes were being lost. In spite of repeated changes in corporate ownership and the blunt-spoken Bateman’s occasional threats to quit, he worked on his mission to save lives with the same group for almost six decades, colleagues said. Eventually Bateman’s Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System became required in most commercial planes around the world, dramatically reducing accidents in which perfectly good aircraft with trained crews plowed into the ground or bodies of water, almost always in poor visibility. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was an average of one such fatal accident per month, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. It was by far the largest cause of death in jetliner accidents. Since the U.S. government began requiring an upgraded version of the device on all but the smallest aircraft starting in 2001, there hasn’t been a single such fatal crash on a U.S. commercial passenger plane equipped with it or competing devices. There have been a few overseas, often when pilots ignored or shut off the devices.

Bateman was always fascinated with airplane crashes. As an 8-year-old school boy in 1940 in Saskatoon, Canada, he and a friend sneaked out of class after two military planes collided and crashed nearby. As punishment, his teacher made him write a report on what happened. “That was my introduction to aircraft accidents,” he said recently. The carnage he saw that day helped motivate him years later. After taking a job with Boeing in Seattle, he joined a small aviation firm called United Control in 1958. Airplane accidents continued to fascinate him and he began “making little books” of notes on them. One type stood out. In the arcane world of aviation terminology, these crashes were called Controlled Flight into Terrain, or CFIT. It was a vexing problem: Basic navigation should have kept pilots from crashing. But the cockpit navigation technology of that era wasn’t intuitive and it was too easy to get disoriented, especially at night or in bad weather. “In my mind it became a big issue, even though there wasn’t much being done about it,” Bateman recalled. In the 1960s, Bateman worked with Scandinavian Airlines System, now SAS AB, which had suffered a CFIT crash in Turkey in 1960, to invent a mechanism to warn pilots when they flew too low. It involved a new instrument on planes that used radio waves to determine a plane’s distance from the ground. It helped stem the accident rate and, after a series of crashes, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required it starting in 1974. But it was prone to false alarms and had a glaring weakness: It couldn’t look forward, so was of little use if a plane was flying toward steeply increasing ground, such as a mountain. For years, Bateman tinkered with the device to improve it. He also consulted with NTSB investigators, poring over accident reports. “He would come to me and say what do we know about this accident?” said Jim Ritter, director of the NTSB’s Office of Research and Engineering, who was a technician at the time. “The whole time, the gears were spinning and he was trying to make things safer.” Bateman had been imagining a far better solution as early as his flight over the Alaska crash site. If he could create a database of all the world’s terrain, the device would see mountain tops and cliffs from miles away. But this was before personal computers and global-positioning services. Even worse, much of the world’s topography was considered secret at the time, a vestige of the Cold War. Then in 1991, in the chaos created by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the detailed maps it had created of the world starting in the 1920s were for sale -- if you knew where to buy them. Bateman asked Frank Daly, the director of engineering at the Sundstrand Corp. division that had swallowed United Control, for his blessing to purchase the data from the U.S. government’s Cold War enemy. “He thought I was crazy,” Bateman said. They wound up sending one of his employees, Frank Brem, in search of maps in Russia and elsewhere. “There isn’t a terrain data store in downtown Moscow,” Daly recalled. “But he would go out and find the right people.” A bigger problem than navigating the black market was the millions of dollars it was costing for the still unproven technology. “We probably weren’t as open with senior management about that process,” Daly said. He sometimes hid costs in other accounts. © Emile Wamsteker/Bloomberg A demonstration of a prototype infrared technology from Honeywell at Morristown Airport in New Jersey in 2010. By the early 1990s, Bateman had developed working prototypes of the new system. Now the company had to sell it. For pilots and safety officers, it was a marvel. Ed Soliday, then director of safety at United Airlines, had been prodding Bateman to improve the warning device. One day in the early 1990s, Bateman called and said he thought he had what Soliday wanted. “Once I flew the thing with Don, it was like an epiphany,” Soliday recalled. “I was sold. I thought if we could make it work, this was a huge breakthrough.” If a plane was flying toward a mountain, a screen popped up automatically marking the high ground in yellow and red on a map. If pilots didn’t respond, it began a series of increasingly dire warnings. Once a collision became almost imminent, a mechanical voice implored, “Terrain, terrain. Pull up! Pull up!” Compared to the earlier system, it was almost fool proof. But many of the more cost-conscious corporate chieftains at airlines weren’t convinced, according to Bateman and Daly. A meeting at American Airlines was particularly grim. Daly was on the sales call at the airline’s headquarters with his then chief executive officer. Their host, a senior executive at the airline, was hostile. “He was almost apoplectic and said, ‘We don’t want another box. We don’t want to have to replace the existing system,’ ” Daly said. “Here I am justifying spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and my boss has just been soundly beaten on the shoulders by the customer.” Soliday had more success at United. The airline agreed to help Bateman’s team test it so it could be certified by the FAA, he said. Most other carriers balked. It took another high-profile fatal crash to change their minds. As American Flight 965 neared Cali, Colombia, from Miami on the evening of Dec. 20, 1995, a pilot accidentally entered the wrong data into the plane’s flight computers. The crew didn’t notice as it began a slow left turn toward mountains lying invisible in the darkness. The Boeing 757 was equipped with the earlier version of Bateman’s warning device and its mechanical voice began warning of “terrain.” But 13 seconds later, after the pilots added full throttle to climb as steeply as possible, it rammed into a ridge. All but four of the 163 people aboard died. Within days the airline wanted the new device, which would have issued an alert far earlier and likely prevented the crash, Bateman and Daly said. First American and then United agreed to voluntarily install them. Other carriers followed. The FAA began requiring them in 2001. In the end, the products spawned by Bateman’s device were a financial boon to Honeywell. There are 45,000 units on aircraft today, worth more than $4 billion at list prices, according to the company. Both Bateman and Daly wonder whether the decades-long effort to develop and improve the warning system would be possible in today’s risk-averse corporate world. “Today new projects need to be blessed by many people,” Daly said. “You need to have hard evidence. They just would not speculatively fund something like this, especially when we were being resisted by the aircraft manufacturers, the airlines. “But Don’s faith, the genius of his team and a little support from the company -- and it happened.” Go to MSN Home More in News The slow-burning hatred that led Thomas Mair to murder Jo Cox The Guardian Scotland Yard probes 58 GHB-related deaths after Stephen Port killings Evening Standard Brexit vote means £122bn extra borrowing chancellor admits The Guardian Man guilty of randomly punching baby in face at supermarket fined £900 Evening Standard Former England footballer David White sexually abused as a young player The Guardian Cat forced to eat other cats to survive after being abandoned by owner The Independent Up Next White supremacist will die in jail for murdering pro-EU MP Jo Cox Sky News More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sport Money Lifestyle Horoscopes Health & Fitness Food & Drink Cars Travel Dating © 2016 Microsoft Privacy & Cookies Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Anti-Spam Newsletter

"If the market's not going to demand it, we're not going to go," Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the sidelines of an investor conference in New York by global investment bank Jefferies, confirming remarks made during the formal program. "It's not the end of the world" if Boeing keeps 787 production at 12 a month instead of lifting it to 14 as planned, Smith said during the event. "We can still be profitable in the program as I see it today at 12." Analysts said Smith's statement confirmed that Boeing will not overproduce widebody planes and, most importantly, does not foresee an accounting charge for the 787 if output stays at 12. Boeing took about $1.7 billion in after-tax charges in its latest result for the 787 and 747 programs to account for excess 787 inventory and slow 747 sales. Smith said the company would decide in the next two months whether to cut 777 output further. If it fails to sell enough 777s to bridge the gap to new 777X production, "then we will make an adjustment accordingly," he said. His comments went beyond what he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told analysts after the company released quarterly results last month. Muilenburg said Boeing would "keep supply and demand in balance" but did not discuss keeping 787 production at 12 a month or cutting 777 further. Low oil prices and a series of boom years have slowed orders for new widebody jetliners, raising concerns that Boeing will notch down cash and profit targets. Smith said on Wednesday that Boeing still has about two years to decide whether to raise 787 output, given lead times for components, and could still generate rising cash flow and profit if production rates "moderate" on the 787 and 777. The list price for the mid-sized 787 is $264.6 million, but airlines typically receive steep discounts. Boeing has won eight net 777 orders this year and 19 net 787 orders. It already plans to reduce 777 production by 15 percent next year as it switches to the 777X. Boeing shares rose 0.6 percent to close at $132.28 on the New York Stock Exchange. -Reuters- Add comment Name (required) E-mail (required, but will not display) Website Notify me of follow-up comments Refresh Send Cancel JComments News National News International News Business News Sports News Documentary Links CNN News BBC News AseanMedia Channel News Asia Others About Us Contact Us Feedback Copyright © 2016 RTB News Website.

Smith indicated that the dearth of widebody jet sales may mean Boeing won’t raise output of the 787 Dreamliner as high as planned. A further 777 production rate cut and a lower-than-planned 787 rate — added to the possibility signaled last month that Boeing could shutter the 747 jumbo jet assembly line — would mean less work in the Seattle-area city of Everett and potential job cuts there. Boeing has already committed to slowing production of the current 777 from today’s rate of 8.3 jets per month — that’s 100 per year — down to 7 jets per month in 2017. The rate will decrease further to 5.5 jets per month during the transition to the new model 777X in 2018. Speaking at the Jefferies Industrials Conference in New York, Smith said it’s unclear if new orders will arrive in time to match those planned rates. “Over the next couple of months, we’ll know,” Smith said. “We’ll either solidify those orders or we’ll modify the production rate.” Boeing has said it needs to sell 40 to 60 jets per year to fill all the open 777 delivery slots between now and the end of the decade. This year it has booked just eight net new orders. Smith did not indicate how much lower the rate might go. Local aviation analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham.net said the 777 order backlog suggests a rate of about 4 aircraft per month is sustainable without further sales. One indicator that the 777 market is in trouble came in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing late last month by global aircraft lessor Intrepid Aviation. Intrepid, which has six 777s on order from Boeing, revealed it hasn’t yet found airlines to take four of those planes — three scheduled for delivery next fall and the other in early 2018. Sam Pearlstein, aerospace analyst with Wells Fargo, wrote in a note to investors that “this highlights why Boeing’s goal of 40-plus annual new 777 orders will remain a challenge.” Smith also lowered expectations on production of the 787 Dreamliner. Next year, 787 production is set to rise from today’s 10 jets per month to 12. And Boeing had planned to make 14 per month by the end of the decade. Now that second rate hike looks uncertain. “We’re going to match supply and demand, and if it doesn’t play out to be 14, then we’ll adjust accordingly,” Smith said. “It’s not the end of the world if you went from 14 to 12. We can still be profitable.” While the 787 sold at record levels prior to entering service, sales slowed dramatically afterwards. In the first five years of sales, Boeing sold 700 Dreamliners. In the five and a half years since, it has sold 400 more. So far this year, Boeing has added just 19 net new orders for the jet. Last week, Leeham.net’s Hamilton wrote that even the planned rate of 12 Dreamliners per month could be challenging to sustain without more 787 sales.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured NASA asks Lockheed Martin, 5 others to develop habitats for Mars mission By Zeba Anwer - 13/08/2016 NASA: NASA has selected Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems and NanoRacks for development of Mars habitats NASA has asked six US companies to develop concepts for the design of space habitats for future deep space missions including manned missions to Mars. The habitat will help man to survive the hazards of space travel including radiation and other threats which will be encountered during such long journey in deep space. Jason Crusan, chief of NASA Advanced Exploration Systems said that NASA is embarking on a futuristic and ambitious journey to Mars, and the full potential of the private and government sectors will be used in this endeavor. The next odyssey into deep space will essentially involve Space Launch System and Orion capsules, which are being designed for deep space journeys involving long-duration habitation and in-space propulsion. The selected corporations include Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems, Boeing and Bigelow Aerospace. The corporations have been given 24 months to develop ground prototypes and conduct concepts for deep space habitats. The process will cost about $65 million and will finance work in 2016 and 2017. The selected parties will be asked to contribute 30% of the total cost of the project. The ground prototypes will then go through a tough evaluation process which includes testing the different supporting integrated systems, human factors, and operation testing to help define the functioning of the overall system. The tests are crucial for setting design standards, common interfaces and requirements and reducing the risk factors for the final flight which will happen in the end. The step is a part of a process to involve private commercial investment in the low earth orbit for operational deep space habitation capabilities for missions to the Moon which will be used as a springboard for missions to Mars during the 2020’s.

The space agency awarded the design contracts, with a combined value of $65 million, as part the public-private partnership Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships 2 (NextSTEP). The full-size deep space habitats will be designed and built here on Earth where the agency can test them against the needs of astronauts on missions to the moon or Mars, Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems, said in a statement. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The six companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, NanoRacks, Orbital ATK, and Sierra Nevada Corp. They’ll be expected to contribute 30 percent of the development costs themselves. The companies will have 24 months to design and build their deep space habitation prototypes so NASA can test them for safety, durability, and ease of use. They’ll be used first on the moon before moving deeper into space, Crusan said in a statement. “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep-space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” All of the designs will include the core components of a pressurized living area for the crew, environmental controls, and life support systems, but they’ll also be equipped with propulsion and docking technology.

NASAHabitat OrbitalATKSpaceTravel SierraDeepSpace Boeing will develop its module using technology employed on the International Space Station while Lockheed Martin plans on refurbishing a logistics module like the ones used to carry cargo into orbit. Orbital ATK will base its plans on its unmanned Cygnus spacecraft, and the Sierra Nevada Corporation will use its low-Earth orbit plane along with an inflatable module like the BEAM being tested on the ISS. Ixion Team, a joint venture of three aerospace firms, plans to repurpose a rocket’s launch stage as long-term living quarters capable of supporting astronauts in deep space. NASA has plans to launch a manned mission to Mars in the 2030s, and Elon Musk intends SpaceX to colonize the red planet, but there’s no guarantee human life can survive the harsh conditions. The Earth Mars transit would take anywhere from 150 to 300 days depending on the location of the planets, and that causes a few problems for NASA. No one has spent that much time in space before, so the agency isn’t sure how humans will react to the cramped quarters, low gravity, and high levels of radiation. Then, when the astronauts land on the red planet, they’ll need to deal with the completely alien environment. NASA’s Journey to Mars is behind schedule and over budget, but if the engineers at the space agency intend for it to go forward, they’ll need to find a way to comfortably house the astronauts in deep space. That’s where Next-STEP and cooperation with private space companies come in. The space agency is increasingly relying on public-private partnerships to develop the technology and prototype systems needed for future space missions beyond Earth’s orbit, Crusan said in a statement. “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors.” The Next-STEP program is designed to encourage private companies to develop deep space exploration technology. The private sector is surging ahead with their plans for commercializing space, and an asteroid mining company has already announced plans to launch the first interstellar prospecting mission in Earth’s history.

Credits: NASA NASA has selected six U.S. companies to help advance the Journey to Mars by developing ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement, Appendix A, NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions. The selected companies are:         Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas         Boeing of Pasadena, Texas         Lockheed Martin of Denver         Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia         Sierra Nevada Corporations Space Systems of Louisville, Colorado         NanoRacks of Webster, Texas Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our Journey to Mars. NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and were utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors, said Jason Crusan, director of NASAs Advanced Exploration Systems. The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth. The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The contract award amounts are dependent on contract negotiations, and NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. This round of NextSTEP selections are part of a phased approach that will catalyze commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment thats still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects, such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment using SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles. In addition to U.S. industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable fully operational deep space habitation capability. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASAs Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. AES is pioneering innovative approaches and public-private partnerships to rapidly develop prototype systems, advance key capabilities, and validate operational concepts for future human missions beyond Earth orbit.

REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo WASHINGTON Boeing Co's KC-46A refueling plane has been approved for production, with work underway for the first two low-rate initial production lots to be awarded in the next 30 days, the U.S. Air Force said on Friday. "The KC-46 program has made significant strides in moving the Air Force toward the modernization needed in our strategic tanker fleet," Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement announcing the approval. The Air Force added it would soon award Boeing contracts for the first two batches, 19 aircraft in total, with a pre-negotiated combined value of $2.8 billion. Last month the KC-46 refueled an A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft in flight, passing the final test needed to begin initial low-rate production. The Air Force said in June that it was seeking compensation from Boeing for delays in the program. Boeing already has taken $1.3 billion in pretax charges for cost overruns. Boeing expects to deliver a first batch of 18 tankers in January 2018 instead of August 2017. "Production approval is an important, positive step for the program, and the Boeing/Air Force team has worked extremely hard to get to this point," Boeing spokeswoman Caroline Hutcheson said.

(Image: Wikimedia Commons) A recent New York Times article (8/7/16) detailed, in often scathing terms, what many media critics already knew: that think tanks are frequently not objective, neutral arbiters of information, but corporate- and government-funded agenda-promoters with an academic veneer to give the appearance of impartiality. One of the two think tanks the Times’ Eric Lipton and Brooke Williams raked over the coals was the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which published a report advocating the expansion of drone sales while being funded by drone makers, namely General Atomics (emphasis added): As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear. “Political obstacles to export,” read the agenda of one closed-door “working group” meeting organized by Mr. Brannen that included Tom Rice, a lobbyist in General Atomics’ Washington office, on the invitation lists, the emails show. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major CSIS contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry’s priorities. “I came out strongly in support of export,” Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of State for defense trade controls. But the effort did not stop there. Mr. Brannen initiated meetings with Defense Department officials and congressional staff to push for the recommendations, which also included setting up a new Pentagon office to give more focus to acquisition and deployment of drones. The center also stressed the need to ease export limits at a conference it hosted at its headquarters featuring top officials from the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps…. “CSIS will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,” Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to the Times. “We do not lobby.” The result was a victory for General Atomics. As the Times also notes, CSIS is funded largely by Western and Gulf monarchy governments, arms dealers and oil companies, such as Raytheon, Boeing, Shell, the United Arab Emirates, US Department of Defense, UK Home Office, General Dynamics, Exxon Mobil, Northrop Grumman, Chevron and others. Anyone with a seven-year-old’s understanding of causality can conclude that CSIS would, in the aggregate, promote the expansion of the military and surveillance state, since that’s who pays their bills; what the Times did was reveal a specific, rather direct example, using heretofore secret documents. New York Times readers didn’t need a smoking gun in any event, since CSIS’s agenda can be seen with simple inference. Since it was the Times that broached the topic, let’s use what CSIS fellows have written or said in the Times over the past year, and see if they ever called for the defunding or de-escalation of the military state: CSIS op-ed (12/3/15) hyping the threat of ISIS and by implication calling for more surveillance of Americans CSIS op-ed (2/18/16) calling for an “international precedent” for an encryption backdoor CSIS op-ed (2/23/16) calling for an encryption backdoor CSIS senior fellow (5/17/16) helping the US military with its pro-LGBT (a/k/a “woke imperialism”) rebranding efforts CSIS fellow (5/27/16) saying that Africa was no longer seen by the US through a “peacekeeping lens” but was now a battlefield with enemies that could potentially threaten the US CSIS “military budget expert” (6/10/16) criticizing Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter for not moving fast enough on its new cybersecurity recruitment initiative CSIS op-ed (7/5/16) calling for more biometric security and dismissing privacy concerns as “irrational” “nervous dystopian projections” CSIS fellow (7/8/16) saying the White House hasn’t “fully acknowledged” the shift in Europe and how it could damage NATO CSIS senior fellow (7/9/16) insisting nuclear weapons remain in Europe due to increased threats from Russia CSIS fellow (8/5/16) insisting Boko Haram is “increasingly unstable” One of the starkest examples, one that FAIR noted at the time, was a New York Times article (8/20/15) last year, warning about the US “lagging behind” Russia in the Arctic Ocean, that was based almost entirely on a CSIS report warning of “Russia’s strategic reach” near the north pole. As we noted in September, the piece failed to mention Russia has 14 times the Arctic coast of the US, and thus it made sense it would have roughly that many more icebreaker ships. The “gap” was just asserted, based primarily on US military say-so and a CSIS report that breathlessly insisted Russia was getting the better of the US in the Arctic. The New York Times even helped out, using a wildly deceptive map implying Arctic parity where none existed: In May, the torrent of media articles hyping the “Arctic gap” asserted by CSIS and the US military paid dividends, with Congress allocating an additional $1 billion to the Navy’s budget to pay for icebreaker ships. Another bill, the Icebreaker Recapitalization Act, calling for Congress to fully fund “six heavy-duty polar icebreaker ships,” has been introduced by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D.–Wash.). While the contracts are not awarded yet, Lockheed Martin—one of CSIS’s top donors–is said by market analyst The Motley Fool to be an “obvious choice” to build the new fleet. Their runner up to build the new icebreakers? Huntington Ingalls Industries, who also donated generously to CSIS. No instances of CSIS calling for the defunding or de-escalation of the military state in the New York Times could be found by FAIR. FAIR reached out to CSIS spokesperson Andrew Schwartz, asking him to cite any examples of CSIS ever saying the threat of Russia or Islamic extremism was overestimated, or advocating for less surveillance or military spending. He did not respond at the time of publishing. It could be a coincidence that CSIS always errs on the side of more military spending, more surveillance, more hyping of threats from Russia and ISIS, and that these conclusions were reached based on a dispassionate examination of the facts. Or the New York Times could read its own reporting, and treat deep-state think tank war-boosters as just that. At the very least, if they are to be cited, the paper could note that they are funded by interests heavily invested in promoting the expansion of a NATO/GCC-led military apparatus, so the reader can know that the bespectacled quasi-academic being interviewed or proffering charts and maps is not entirely without strings. (Noting that someone commenting on war is funded by those who profit from war seems entirely reasonable, no?). The media would understandably be hard-pressed to drop think tanks altogether. Their insta-pundits lend gravitas to articles for writers on deadline and, just as they do for lawmakers, think tanks do much of the research heavy-lifting. But the think tank industry, as the internal emails New York Times revealed make clear, is often based on laundering influence through ostensibly neutral-sounding “institutes” or “centers,” with the fact that the average media consumer won’t know who funds them being part of the service offered to donors. This is true not just in the military field, but in every policy area that affects corporations’ bottom lines, as is suggested by the Times‘ reporting on the even more ubiquitous Brookings Institution promoting the JPMorgan bank’s image: JPMorgan, in a document dated a month before the agreement was signed, said the pending donation to Brookings “deepens/extends relationships with important client base among business and civic leaders both in the US and abroad.” And Brookings was ready to do its part. “Our events, which in part target these audiences,” said an internal 2014 Brookings memo, referring to the Global Cities Initiative and federal and state leaders, “have yielded 100+ media hits, with 97 percent of them referencing GCI and 90 percent referencing JPMorgan; by the end of this year, we will have held events in 13 domestic markets and nine international markets.” At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank’s executives. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” These “media hits” would not be possible if the corporate agenda wasn’t laundered through the pseudo-academic credibility of a think tank, whether it’s a giant bank trying to improved its image via Brookings or an arms manufacturers trying to promote the war industry via CSIS. “John Smith, funded by Raytheon, the Department of Defense and Chevron, says Russian aggression is unprecedented” sounds far less credible than “John Smith, senior fellow at CSIS, says Russian aggression is unprecedented”—even though they are, in effect, the same thing. In light of the New York Times report, perhaps it’s time for media to start spelling out what’s happening for readers. © 2016 Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) Adam Johnson Adam Johnson is an associate editor at AlterNet and writes frequently for FAIR.org.

(Notre Dame Univ., IN, United States); Bush, Robert H. (Pratt and Whitney Aircraft, East Hartford, CT, United States); Mani, Mortaza (Boeing Co., Research and Technology, Saint Louis, MO, United States) Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and other advanced modeling and simulation (M&S) methods are increasingly relied on for predictive performance, reliability and safety of engineering systems. Analysts, designers, decision makers, and project managers, who must depend on simulation, need practical techniques and methods for assessing simulation credibility. The AIAA Guide for Verification and Validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations (AIAA G-077-1998 (2002)), originally published in 1998, was the first engineering standards document available to the engineering community for verification and validation (V&V) of simulations. Much progress has been made in these areas since 1998. The AIAA Committee on Standards for CFD is currently updating this Guide to incorporate in it the important developments that have taken place in V&V concepts, methods, and practices, particularly with regard to the broader context of predictive capability and uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods and approaches. This paper will provide an overview of the changes and extensions currently underway to update the AIAA Guide. Specifically, a framework for predictive capability will be described for incorporating a wide range of error and uncertainty sources identified during the modeling, verification, and validation processes, with the goal of estimating the total prediction uncertainty of the simulation. The Guide's goal is to provide a foundation for understanding and addressing major issues and concepts in predictive CFD. However, this Guide will not recommend specific approaches in these areas as the field is rapidly evolving. It is hoped that the guidelines provided in this paper, and explained in more detail in the Guide, will aid in the research, development, and use of CFD in engineering decision-making.

KARIM SAHIB / AFP/Getty Images Share Adjust Comment Print Boeing will open a data analytics lab in Vancouver this fall, adding 50 new high-income jobs to the Lower Mainland. The announcement was made Thursday by B.C. technology minister Amrik Virk at the Aerospace, Defence and Security Expo in Abbotsford. “These are not entry-level jobs,” Virk said. “These are very experienced, highly educated, graduate-level jobs that are high-paying that add to the supply chain… and they will be based right here in British Columbia. We have an opportunity with our 50 doing very, very high level work and analysis that will have impact around the world.” Boeing owns Richmond-based AeroInfo, which also specializes in flight data analysis. The entire operation — both the Richmond facility and the Vancouver lab — will be rebranded as Boeing Vancouver. Boeing officials said they chose Vancouver due to the availability of highly-trained workers, stemming from a close relationship between the aerospace sector and academia, including a partnership with UBC. “The expansion represents a natural extension of Boeing Vancouver’s analytics, software development and professional consulting work,” Boeing Vancouver president Bob Cantwell said in a statement, adding that AeroInfo is one of the largest analytics groups within Boeing and is well suited to house the new lab. The analysis at the new lab, officials say, involves tracking the performance of aircraft components over time. It allows Boeing to assess with a high degree of accuracy which parts may need to be repaired or replaced at what time, which in turn allows Boeing to suggest flight routes to plane owners and operators to ensure planes don’t have to travel out of their way to get the replacement parts from a certain Boeing location when they need them. “They are going to work on a number of the aviation industry’s largest challenges,” Virk said. “One aircraft, I’m told, has 5,000 to 10,000 sensors in it. The data analytics team will track when you need a replacement, how do you make a better flight plan and route your aircraft better to reduce costs.” The expo, which coincides with the high-profile Abbotsford International Airshow this weekend, features hundreds of companies and government agencies. The exhibition is the biggest in B.C. and one of the biggest of its kind in the country. Organizers say the show’s goal is to showcase B.C.’s aerospace sector — as well as companies throughout Western Canada — to regional and global players that may be interested in partnering up. Officials also say the expo will play a key role in introducing companies outside of Canada to the western Canadian security sector. Statistics from the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada show that 8,300 people in B.C. work in the sector and it generates $2.4 billion in revenue every year. This year’s theme, “growth and innovation in the Asia Pacific,” shows a logical shift of attention toward rapidly growing markets such as India, where recent whole-scale economic reform under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is driving demand from communications technology to transportation infrastructure. Defence and aerospace are also included in New Delhi’s plans. A report last week — compiled partly by management consultancy Roland Berger — showed India’s aerospace and defence electronics sector is expected to balloon to $72 billion US ($93.4 billion) within the next 12 years. The sector is currently valued at $1.7 billion US ($2.2 billion). Major global companies taking notice include U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin, which has offered to build its latest rendition of the F-16 fighter jet in India. Rahul Gangal, partner at Roland Berger, spoke to the expo’s attendees and reiterated the attractiveness of the Indian market, but cautioned that foreign companies face major challenges such as local partners expecting higher profit margins than global industry norms, as well as constantly changing regulations and frequent delays in carrying out plans. “Something that Canada needs to think about, looking at the case with other countries, is government-to-government sale,” Gangal said, noting Boeing’s success in India is achieved largely through a strong relationship with the Indian air force. “Those tend to be the fastest going through. In order for Canada to be successful, you will need to find someone with a strong relationship to link you to that market.” chchiang@postmedia.com Full steam ahead for B.C.'s buoyant boating industry No more salmon sports fishing on the lower Fraser River, DFO...

Glass that switches from transparent to opaque may soon replace the need for blinds The new glass switches from transparent to opaque Similar technologies exist, but these drain power while they are on The new glass requires no power to maintain its state, apart from a little electricity to switch from one state to another  By Colin Fernandez for the Daily Mail Published: 11:11 EST, 11 August 2016 | Updated: 11:28 EST, 11 August 2016 e-mail 114 shares 54 View comments Curtains have been used for hundreds of years – but new technology means their reign could be drawing to a close. And Venetian blinds too may lose their pulling power. Researchers have come up with a way of making glass windows switch from being transparent to opaque. Scroll down for video  Once the glass is switched from clear to dark, or vice versa, the new system requires little to no power to maintain its new state; unlike other materials, it only needs electricity when it’s time to switch back again THE NEW GLASS  The windows work by sandwiching a sheet of electrochromic material – so called because electricity makes it change colour - between two glass panes. The researchers say that the new material is an improvement on existing ‘self- shading’ windows. The new glass requires no power to maintain it’s state, apart from a little electricity to switch from one state to another.  While similar technologies have been developed before – the windows of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner use them – these drain electric power while they were on. The new glass requires no power to maintain its state, apart from a little electricity to switch from one state to another. MIT professor of chemistry Mircea Dinca and doctoral student Khalid Al-Khabbi outlined their discovery in the journal Chem. The windows work by sandwiching a sheet of electrochromic material – so called because electricity makes it change colour - between two glass panes. The researchers say that the new material is an improvement on existing ‘self- shading’ windows. He said that in the case of the Boeing 787 windows, which can be darkened by turning on the voltage, but Professor Dinca said, ‘when you flip the switch, it actually takes a few minutes for the window to turn dark. Obviously, you want that to be faster.’ The slowness is because the old style changing glass relies on charged particles called ions flowing through the material – and this process is slower than electric current. While similar technologies have been developed before – the windows of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner use them – these drain electric power while they were on And the 787 windows can only change to a dark shade of green, rather than going opaque. To make their breakthrough, Professor Dinca and his students achieved the long-sought goal of producing a coating that can go all the way from perfectly clear to nearly black by blending two complementary colors, green and red). The new material is made by combining two chemical compounds, an organic material and a metal salt. Once mixed, these self-assemble into a thin film of the switchable material. Professor Dinca said: ‘It's this combination of these two, of a relatively fast switching time and a nearly black color, that has really got people excited.’ Curtains have been used for hundreds of years – but new technology means their reign could be drawing to a close As well as cutting down on glare, the windows could also help their users save money – by cutting down on air conditioning costs in hot countries. He said users ‘could flip a switch when the sun shines through the window, and turn it dark,’ or even automatically make that whole side of the building go dark all at once, he says. The properties of the material – technically known as a metal-organic framework - have now been demonstrated in a laboratory setting, the team's next step is to make a small-scale device for further testing: a 1-inch-square sample, to demonstrate the principle in action for potential investors in the technology, and to help determine what the manufacturing costs for such windows would be. Further testing is also needed, Professor Dinca says, to demonstrate what they have determined from preliminary testing: that once the switch is flipped and the material changes colour, it requires no further power to maintain its new state. No extra power is needed until the switch is flipped to turn the material back to its former state, whether clear or opaque.  THE 'UNBREAKABLE' GLASS  Corning has revealed its newest version of Gorilla Glass, and it can withstand drops from more than half a meter higher than the previous model. According to the firm, the glass can survive a fall from 1.6 metres high onto a rough surface – about equal to the height you reach while taking a selfie. Lab tests have shown that the glass survives up to 80 percent of face-down drops from 1.6 metres high.   Read more: www.cell.com/che...

Daryl Taylor, Vice President & General Manager, Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility, speaks during a delivery ceremony for the 1st U.S.-produced aircraft for American Airlines at the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility Delivery Center in Mobile, Ala., on Tuesday May 17, 2016. (Sharon Steinmann/ssteinmann@al.com) ((Sharon Steinmann/ssteinmann@al.com)) By  Christopher Harress | charress@al.com AL.com Email the author Follow on Twitter on August 11, 2016 at 7:00 AM, updated August 11, 2016 at 7:20 PM Print Email Law enforcement officials from the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office have opened an investigation into Airbus' sales practices for deals made in Asia and the Middle East, which could have serious long-term effects on the company's global operation and eventually hurt the long-term viability of its assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama.   While the company is unlikely to experience any serious short-term effects to its business, which includes an impressive order book containing thousands of deals, the SFO's investigation will take years and likely delve deeply into how Airbus conducts some of its biggest sales. More importantly, however, it could damage the French-based company's international reputation and give an edge to its biggest rival Boeing. "The news came as a shock, since the issue had been downplayed," Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christophe Menard said in a note to investors Monday. "It could turn out to be more serious than envisaged." The investigation was formally opened by the U.K.'s SFO in July after Airbus officials self-reported instances of unusual business practices, specifically the use of third-party agents in getting multi billion aircraft deals done. Ordinarily, the U.K. Export Finance Agency is charged with assisting in completing sales and organizing credit guarantees for overseas deals, such as those made at the Farnborough airshow, one of the year's big aviation events where aircraft manufacturers sign multi billion dollar contracts. The guarantees are essentially a backstop for the selling company against the buyer experiencing financial issues, but Airbus severed ties with U.K. Export Finance in April after first raising the issue of its sales practices. The investigation centers on Airbus' conduct in emerging markets where it hopes to gain greater influence and beat rival Boeing. However, gaining a foothold in the Middle East, Asia and other growing regions comes with risk. Because it can take years to establish a business relationship with some of the governments in those regions, which often own a stake in the national airlines and dictate purchases, some companies find it easier to rely on local, established agents that already have connections with government officials. While it's not technically illegal to use a middleman in such sales, it adds another layer to the process and complicates oversight in Western countries, where many of the deals are initially made. It's believed that Airbus admitted to using the agents in an effort to avoid criminal implications. In the event of being found criminally liable, Airbus will likely attempt to obtain what's known as a deferred prosecution agreement in exchange for paying a fine, future compliance and help in bringing charges against other individuals or companies involved in the case. Banks in the U.S. often make use of such agreements, but it's less common in the U.K. Airbus said in a statement Sunday that it was fully cooperating with the SFO. "Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants," the company stated. "Airbus Group continues to cooperate with the SFO." While it's not yet clear if the investigation will damage global Airbus sales, Richard Aboulafia, Vice-President of analysis at Teal Group, a Virginia-based aerospace and defense think tank, told AL.com in a phone interview that he doesn't believe it will. "It sounds like it (Airbus) is fully cooperating and it doesn't sound like it's a terribly adversarial ordeal," said Aboulafia, who pointed out that previous SFO investigations usually end in a fine. However, SFO investigations are not quick and often drag a company's dirty-laundry into the public domain, as is being demonstrated by the near-four year look at Rolls Royce's use of third-party agents in China and Indonesia. The investigation also adds to Airbus' ongoing business troubles, including production problems with the wide-body A350 commercial jet, slow sales of the A380 super-jumbo, delays on its A400M military transport, and the grounding of the Super Puma helicopter after a fatal accident in April.  About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

Thanks to This Man, Airplanes Don’t Crash Into Mountains Anymore Bloomberg 8/11/2016 The wreckage of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, a Boeing 727, smolders as recovery workers search for the bodies of 111 victims on Sept. 7, 1971, in Juneau, Alaska. Giant flocks of black birds circled the wreckage of an airliner that had struck an Alaska mountain two weeks earlier, killing all 111 aboard. In a small plane overhead, a young engineer directed his pilot to follow the same path the jet had taken toward the craggy terrain.

Don Bateman’s plane climbed to safety, but he was frustrated. The electronic device he invented to warn pilots that they were about to hit the ground didn’t leave enough time to have prevented the large airliner from crashing. “I was disappointed,” Bateman, now 84, recalled of the day in 1971 when he flew over the remains of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, which had slammed into a fog-shrouded ridge. “We needed to do better.” That’s exactly what Bateman and his small team of engineers at what is now Honeywell International Inc. did. The device presaged today’s mobile mapping applications, dramatically reduced what had been by far the worst class of air crashes and made Honeywell billions of dollars. < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 4NEXT SLIDE > Don Bateman with a Honeywell plane the company used to test his safety devices at Paine Field in Everett, Wash. © Mike Kane/Bloomberg “I would give Don individual credit for having saved more lives than any other individual in the history of commercial aviation,” said Earl Weener, a member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and former chief engineer for safety at Boeing Co. Before retiring in June, Bateman and his band of colleagues dabbled in the world of Cold War espionage, hid the true cost of their endeavor from their corporate masters and endured skepticism from the very airlines whose planes were being lost. In spite of repeated changes in corporate ownership and the blunt-spoken Bateman’s occasional threats to quit, he worked on his mission to save lives with the same group for almost six decades, colleagues said. Eventually Bateman’s Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System became required in most commercial planes around the world, dramatically reducing accidents in which perfectly good aircraft with trained crews plowed into the ground or bodies of water, almost always in poor visibility. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was an average of one such fatal accident per month, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. It was by far the largest cause of death in jetliner accidents.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Since the U.S. government began requiring an upgraded version of the device on all but the smallest aircraft starting in 2001, there hasn’t been a single such fatal crash on a U.S. commercial passenger plane equipped with it or competing devices. There have been a few overseas, often when pilots ignored or shut off the devices. President Barack Obama awarded Bateman the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011. Bateman was always fascinated with airplane crashes. As an 8-year-old school boy in 1940 in Saskatoon, Canada, he and a friend sneaked out of class after two military planes collided and crashed nearby. As punishment, his teacher made him write a report on what happened. “That was my introduction to aircraft accidents,” he said recently. The carnage he saw that day helped motivate him years later. After taking a job with Boeing in Seattle, he joined a small aviation firm called United Control in 1958. Airplane accidents continued to fascinate him and he began “making little books” of notes on them. One type stood out. In the arcane world of aviation terminology, these crashes were called Controlled Flight into Terrain, or CFIT. It was a vexing problem: Basic navigation should have kept pilots from crashing. But the cockpit navigation technology of that era wasn’t intuitive and it was too easy to get disoriented, especially at night or in bad weather. “In my mind it became a big issue, even though there wasn’t much being done about it,” Bateman recalled. In the 1960s, Bateman worked with Scandinavian Airlines System, now SAS AB, which had suffered a CFIT crash in Turkey in 1960, to invent a mechanism to warn pilots when they flew too low. It involved a new instrument on planes that used radio waves to determine a plane’s distance from the ground. It helped stem the accident rate and, after a series of crashes, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required it starting in 1974. But it was prone to false alarms and had a glaring weakness: It couldn’t look forward, so was of little use if a plane was flying toward steeply increasing ground, such as a mountain. For years, Bateman tinkered with the device to improve it. He also consulted with NTSB investigators, poring over accident reports. “He would come to me and say what do we know about this accident?” said Jim Ritter, director of the NTSB’s Office of Research and Engineering, who was a technician at the time. “The whole time, the gears were spinning and he was trying to make things safer.” Bateman had been imagining a far better solution as early as his flight over the Alaska crash site. If he could create a database of all the world’s terrain, the device would see mountain tops and cliffs from miles away. But this was before personal computers and global-positioning services. Even worse, much of the world’s topography was considered secret at the time, a vestige of the Cold War. Then in 1991, in the chaos created by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the detailed maps it had created of the world starting in the 1920s were for sale -- if you knew where to buy them. Bateman asked Frank Daly, the director of engineering at the Sundstrand Corp. division that had swallowed United Control, for his blessing to purchase the data from the U.S. government’s Cold War enemy. “He thought I was crazy,” Bateman said. They wound up sending one of his employees, Frank Brem, in search of maps in Russia and elsewhere. “There isn’t a terrain data store in downtown Moscow,” Daly recalled. “But he would go out and find the right people.” A bigger problem than navigating the black market was the millions of dollars it was costing for the still unproven technology. “We probably weren’t as open with senior management about that process,” Daly said. He sometimes hid costs in other accounts. By the early 1990s, Bateman had developed working prototypes of the new system. Now the company had to sell it. For pilots and safety officers, it was a marvel. Ed Soliday, then director of safety at United Airlines, had been prodding Bateman to improve the warning device. One day in the early 1990s, Bateman called and said he thought he had what Soliday wanted. “Once I flew the thing with Don, it was like an epiphany,” Soliday recalled. “I was sold. I thought if we could make it work, this was a huge breakthrough.” If a plane was flying toward a mountain, a screen popped up automatically marking the high ground in yellow and red on a map. If pilots didn’t respond, it began a series of increasingly dire warnings. Once a collision became almost imminent, a mechanical voice implored, “Terrain, terrain. Pull up! Pull up!” Compared to the earlier system, it was almost fool proof. But many of the more cost-conscious corporate chieftains at airlines weren’t convinced, according to Bateman and Daly. A meeting at American Airlines was particularly grim. Daly was on the sales call at the airline’s headquarters with his then chief executive officer. Their host, a senior executive at the airline, was hostile. “He was almost apoplectic and said, ‘We don’t want another box. We don’t want to have to replace the existing system,’ ” Daly said. “Here I am justifying spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and my boss has just been soundly beaten on the shoulders by the customer.” Soliday had more success at United. The airline agreed to help Bateman’s team test it so it could be certified by the FAA, he said. Most other carriers balked. It took another high-profile fatal crash to change their minds. As American Flight 965 neared Cali, Colombia, from Miami on the evening of Dec. 20, 1995, a pilot accidentally entered the wrong data into the plane’s flight computers. The crew didn’t notice as it began a slow left turn toward mountains lying invisible in the darkness. The Boeing 757 was equipped with the earlier version of Bateman’s warning device and its mechanical voice began warning of “terrain.” But 13 seconds later, after the pilots added full throttle to climb as steeply as possible, it rammed into a ridge. All but four of the 163 people aboard died. Within days the airline wanted the new device, which would have issued an alert far earlier and likely prevented the crash, Bateman and Daly said. First American and then United agreed to voluntarily install them. Other carriers followed. The FAA began requiring them in 2001. In the end, the products spawned by Bateman’s device were a financial boon to Honeywell. There are 45,000 units on aircraft today, worth more than $4 billion at list prices, according to the company. Both Bateman and Daly wonder whether the decades-long effort to develop and improve the warning system would be possible in today’s risk-averse corporate world. “Today new projects need to be blessed by many people,” Daly said. “You need to have hard evidence. They just would not speculatively fund something like this, especially when we were being resisted by the aircraft manufacturers, the airlines. “But Don’s faith, the genius of his team and a little support from the company -- and it happened.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

(NASA/Handout via Reuters) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Space Business August 11, 2016 By 2030, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) wants to send humans to Mars. In order to make the Journey to Mars, which began at the start of this decade, a reality, the space agency will have to figure out how to establish habitation systems that could provide a safe place for its astronauts on the red planet. NASA has selected six private U.S. companies to develop concepts and prototypes of deep space habitats on Earth, with the idea that they’ll eventually be used on our solar system neighbor. The companies will have 24 months to assist with “the commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions,” NASA announced on Aug. 9. The six companies are: Bigelow Aerospace Boeing Lockheed Martin Orbital ATK Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems NanoRacks “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems, according to the release. “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” This is part two of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program. In 2015, four partners—Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK—were selected to work on deep space exploration and habitats. NextSTEP-2 will hone in on “missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s,” NASA states. “These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars.” Bigelow is a pioneer of sorts when it comes to deep space habitats. Earlier this year, the Las Vegas-based company launched its latest experiment: the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), which was the first inflatable habitat NASA allowed to be attached to the International Space Station (ISS). The module was flown into space on SpaceX’s cargo capsule, attached to the ISS, and expanded and pressurized on May 28. For the next two years, it’ll remain in orbit above the earth to test how well expandable habitats hold up against conditions like solar radiation and extreme temperatures. NanoRacks’ inclusion in NASA’s current program signals an expansion of their existing relationship; the Texas-based company already has a mini-satellite launcher on the ISS. Orbital ATK will be advancing designs for Cygnus, its current commercial cargo space craft that flies to the ISS. The other three companies will be creating or refurbishing and modifying ground demonstrators or prototypes of habitats. Over the next two years, each of the six selected companies will be awarded varying amounts of funding for their diverse projects, but the combined total cost will be close to $65 million. In their press release announcingNextSTEP-2, NASA implied that, if necessary, the project would continue into 2018 and additional funding would then be pumped into it. Of course, nothing guarantees functional finished products by 2018—or ever, for that matter. But NASA has a track record of successful partnerships with private companies leading to real results, like Red Dragon, SpaceX’s spacecraft that aims carry astronauts to the ISS by 2018.

Yuma News Now NASA Selects Six Companies to Develop Prototypes, Concepts for Deep Space Habitats Details Written by Kathryn Hambleton Published: 10 August 2016 Washington, DC - NASA has selected six U.S. companies to help advance the Journey to Mars by developing ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement, Appendix A, NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions. The selected companies are: Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas Boeing of Pasadena, Texas Lockheed Martin of Denver Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems of Louisville, Colorado NanoRacks of Webster, Texas Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our Journey to Mars.  “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The contract award amounts are dependent on contract negotiations, and NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK.  This round of NextSTEP selections are part of a phased approach that will catalyze commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects, such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment using SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles. In addition to U.S. industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable fully operational deep space habitation capability. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. AES is pioneering innovative approaches and public-private partnerships to rapidly develop prototype systems, advance key capabilities, and validate operational concepts for future human missions beyond Earth orbit.

companies they will team up with to realise their dreams of building residential homes on the Red Planet.     The six companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems, and Colorado NanoRacks, with whom they have agreed to manufacture prototypes of deep space habitats.   Although in their infancy, there have plans to have manned colonies on Mars for decades.  These recent developments fall under the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) programme that was created as an programme to ‘expand knowledge, commercial capabilities and opportunities in space’.   There are many hurdles with creating habitable conditions on Mars, discounting the extreme hostile environment that is devoid of oxygen, getting a spaceship there and back is still impossible with the fuel needed for a return trip currently unfeasibly high, ensuring any trips would be one way.   The ambitious and long-term plans would play a part in the wider, if somewhat challenging, programme that would see humans colonize Mars and develop settlements that astronauts could live in for long periods of time.   Explaining the programme in more detail, Jason Crusan, Director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA Headquarters had this to say: “The NextSTEP partnerships are a large contribution to the dual objectives of advancing deep space habitation development and stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit.” The first manned trip to Mars, by NASA, is currently scheduled for 2030.

Back To Top[*] 31st anniversary of JAL jumbo jet crash observed Aug. 13, 2016 - 05:50AM JST Relatives of the 520 victims of the 1985 crash of a Japan Airlines jumbo jet on Friday marked the 31st anniversary of the accident in Gunma Prefecture. In the morning, bereaved relatives climbed to the crash site on Mt Osutaka, at a height of 1,565 meters, where the JAL Boeing 747 with 524 people aboard crashed on a flight from Tokyo to Osaka. Only four survivors were found when the first rescue workers arrived 12 hours later. The relatives gathered at a cenotaph, offered prayers and rang a “bell of safety” installed at the site. JAL President Yoshiharu Ueki joined relatives in climbing the trail in the afternoon. He paid his respects to victims and pledged thathis company would do its utmost make sure such a tragedy never happened again. At 6:56 p.m.—the exact time of the crash—a ceremony was held in Ueno village at the foot of the mountain, attended by about 200 relatives and JAL officials. A moment of silence was observed. JAL Flight 123 took off from Tokyo’s Haneda Airport at 6:12 p.m. on Aug 12, 1985. Twelve minutes into the flight, a bulkhead is believed to have blown in the tail, creating over-pressurization that severed the four sets of hydraulic-control lines and blew part of the tail section off. With a total loss of hydraulic pressure, the captain attempted unsuccessfully to regain control of the aircraft as it descended uncontrollably in a flight condition known as the “Dutch roll.” At 6:56 p.m., the plane crashed into the mountain. Since 2006, JAL has been displaying messages written by passengers and a cabin attendant before they died, at its Safety Promotion Center at Haneda Airport. A government-appointed investigation panel blamed the accident on improper repairs to the rear bulkhead seven years earlier. In 1988, local police served papers on 20 people from JAL, the transport ministry and Boeing on suspicion of professional negligence resulting in death and injury.

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Two U.S. astronauts left the International Space Station on Sunday for a seven-hour spacewalk to install communications and navigation aides for new commercial space taxis. Station commander Barry "Butch" Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts floated outside the station's Quest airlock shortly after 7 a.m. EST/1200 GMT to begin their third spacewalk in eight days, a NASA Television broadcast showed. The purpose of the outings is to prepare berthing slips for spaceships being developed by Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. The astronauts are scheduled to install more than 400 feet (122 meters) of cables and a pair of antennas that the new vehicles will use to navigate toward and dock with the station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth. Sunday's outing follows two spacewalks last week to rig power and data cables for a pair of docking port adapters that are due to arrive later this year. One adapter will be installed at the berthing slip once used by NASA's space shuttles, which were retired in 2011. The second docking system will be located at an adjacent hatch on the Harmony connecting node. Since the shuttles' retirement, the United States has been dependent on Russia to fly crew to and from the station - a joint project in which 15 nations are involved. NASA aims to break Russia's monopoly before the end of 2017 by buying rides from Boeing and SpaceX.

Video IT Resume Makeover: How to start from scratch NASA this week picked six companies to develop prototype deep space habitats that astronauts could somewhat comfortably live in on long space journeys – particularly to Mars. According to NASA, an effective habitat contains “pressurized volume plus an integrated array of complex systems and components that include a docking capability, environmental control and life support systems, logistics management, radiation mitigation and monitoring, fire safety technologies, and crew health capabilities.”  +More on Network World: The weirdest, wackiest and coolest sci/tech stories of 2016 (so far!) “The ground prototypes will let NASA and the partners evaluate configurations of the habitat, how the various systems interact together and with other capabilities like propulsion modules and airlocks, and will provide platforms to test and ensure the standards and common interfaces being considered are well thought out,” NASA stated. NASA said the six companies would have about 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30% of the cost of the overall proposed effort, the space agency said. “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems in a statement. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” +More on Network World: The Martian author Andy Weir calls for massive new space station to prep humans for Mars trip+ The prototype habitats are part of a NASA program called Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP), which is developing all manner of deep space systems from advanced propulsion to satellites. Announced in 2014, NextSTEP programs for habitat development are already underway at a number of space industry companies such as Bigelow, Boeing and Orbital. Congress earlier this year urged the space agency to move along its ideas for how humans would live on planets or other places far from Earth. With that pressure as a backdrop NASA said it wants US companies, universities, and non-profit organizations to offer up their best ideas for space living systems would include reliable life support systems, fire safety, atmosphere revitalization and monitoring, water processing, lighting, and fire detection and radiation protection. Here are the companies an their prototypes as described by NASA: Bigelow Aerospace will develop and test a prototype of Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE), a 330 cubic meter expandable habitat and test platform for deep space hardware. XBASE is based on the B-330 expandable spacecraft for the mission-specific purpose of attaching to the International Space Station as a visiting vehicle. XBASE leverages the lessons learned from the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), a 16 cubic meter expandable spacecraft, which was recently deployed on the space station.

This includes the production of a full-scale habitat that will provide design analysis and high-fidelity demonstration and test capability to simulate how humans can safely live and work in deep space for extended periods of time. This ground demonstrator will test and validate interface standards, systems features and critical exploration technologies.  Boeing Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module.

The high-fidelity environmental control and life support systems prototype will provide risk reduction and form and fit testing. The avionics prototype will prove data communication between the habitat and Orion and demonstrate crew interfaces between a deep space habitat and Orion.  Lockheed Martin Concept image of Lockheed Martin's refurbished multi-purpose logistics module prototype Credits: Lockheed Martin Orbital ATK will mature the mission architecture and design of their initial cislunar habitat concept, based on the Cygnus spacecraft that currently services the space station. Orbital ATK will create their prototype to support testing of critical interfaces with Orion and other modules. It will use the Cygnus-derived habitat design for long-term operation in deep space and establish a proposed roadmap that leads to Mars exploration.

(Photo : NASA/Getty Images) NASA approves a $65 million budget to be spent on developing deep-space habitats, which are expected to be used on the mission to Mars. The budget will be spread over two years between 6 participating companies; which indicates the level of priority NASA have set onto the project as the mission to Mars would likely see transit in the coming few years, according to NASA website. NASA had already handpicked its team of companies to develop deep-space-ready habitats, which likely includes building prototypes, sharing and comparing notes and concepts between these companies. The chosen companies are all based in the U.S., which include Bigelow Aerospace, which is based in Las Vegas; Lockheed Martin, which is from Denver; Boeing, which is based in Texas; Orbital ATK of Virginia; Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems, which is based on Colorado; and NanoRacks, which is from Texas, as well. The research is part of NASA's NEXTStep project, which is an ongoing program under the agency's Advanced Exploration Systems. The aforementioned projects aim to further humankind's knowledge on space exploration, as well as funding private research to develop technologies to be used in such projects, TechCrunch reported. The recently announced project, along with its budget, is significantly larger than the previous years. The previous contracts have allotted a mere $15 million, which was divided between 10 parties, while the current NASA project have bumped its sum to $65 million, to be split 6 ways, according to NewsLedge. The selected companies bring with itself a diversity between approaching the problem facing space exploration; sustainability. The companies are quite well known by their unique approach and respective company views, which would likely raise the odds of developing an apt habitat for humans in deep space. NASA's self-imposed deadline for the Mars Mission is fast approaching, which is on 2020. On a side note, NASA have recently teamed up with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is adamant that the private company would bring humans to the Red Planet in as early as 2018.

Earlier this week, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said it was unlikely that the plane's captain glided the plane into the sea, and instead said engine failure due to lack of fuel had sparked a sudden "death dive" into the southern Indian Ocean, Xinhua news agency reported. ATSB Chief Commissioner Greg Hood told The Australian daily that the agency had come to a consensus with a number of other agencies about the theory, including aircraft manufacturer Boeing, the US National Transport Safety Board and the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation. At the time, he said analysis of satellite data by Defence Department scientists concluded the plane made a sudden and rapid descent at more than 10 times the usual descent rate. But on Friday, independent investigators noticed the ATSB had withdrawn the claim from its website without explanation. Richard Godfrey from an independent group of MH370 expert observers told News Corp that he noticed the "consensus" claim had been deleted after it was picked up by computer tracker. Godfrey said the deletion of the consensus theory could mean that not all experts on the strategy group agree with the "death dive" consensus. "Another possibility is that it was assumed there was a consensus, but then some party complained and the published report had to be changed," he said. MH370 was carrying 239 passengers and crew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it disappeared on March 8, 2014. --IANS ksk SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Ogg August 11, 2016 3:10 pm EST Print Email Tweet There is some potentially big news in the defense and warfare industry, but more in process than in size. It is also important to realize that this is not yet written in stone. The U.S. State Department has now approved the potential sale of precision-guided munitions and equipment to its NATO partners. This is a pilot program where NATO could spend about $231 million, whereby NATO’s own support and procurement unit would be the actual buyer for militaries inside of NATO. If the sale is approved by Congress, NATO member countries like the Czech Republic, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain would be able to get the precision-guided munitions by sharing costs and pooling resources to actually buy and pay for the weapons. This deal is said to be in tranches and was a two-year pilot program that started in early 2015 via the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency. What makes this effort different than so many years worth of prior orders is that arms sales by U.S. companies are traditionally made with individual nations. This is effectively a procurement alliance, and it is aimed at saving money by being able to get a larger grouped order or orders. How it will work through time, and whether it ultimately cannibalizes higher margin individual nation sales, remains to be seen. One issue that could delay or block this new effort and process might be a concern about whether the technology could be transferred to outside parties or nations. Still, we shall have to wait and see whether the order is given the final approval. This order specifically names subsidiaries of Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) and Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) as the beneficiaries. We have taken a look at the details compared to the larger picture for each company below. The news release’s quote from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, edited down, said: The proposed sale improves NATO members’ capability to meet current and future ground threats with precision. They will use the enhanced capacity as a deterrent to regional threats, and to increase interoperability within contingency operations. Many of the purchasing nations already have precision-guided munitions in their inventories and will have no difficulty absorbing these additional munitions. … Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to NATO. … There is no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. … This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded. NATO Support and Procurement Agency showed a list of which systems will make up this approximately $231 million order. They were as follows: 500 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Guidance Kits, KMU-556 F/B 40 JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU-557 F/B 1,500 JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU-572 F/B 1,000 MAU 210 E/B Computer Control Groups for 1,000-lb. Enhanced Paveway IIs 300 MAU 210 E/B Computer Control Groups for GBU-49s 1,025 MAU 169 L/B Computer Control Groups for GBU-12s 1,350 Joint Programmable Fuzes, FMU-152 A/B 60 Bomb Fin Assembly and Airfoil Group 650-MXU K/B for GBU-12s 1,025 Bomb Fin Assembly and Airfoil Group, MXU-650 K/B AFG for GBU-12s The order also included the following: Detector Sensing Unit (DSU)-38A/B Laser sensors; DSU-33D/B proximity sensors; Wireless Paveway Avionics Kit (WIPAK) interfaces for Enhanced Paveway II bombs; FMU-139C/B electronic bomb fuzes; repair and return services; transportation; engineering services; and other support services. Normally 24/7 Wall St. would not get too excited about a $231 million order that is being split among two multi-billion defense contractors. Still, this is the first, and it could ultimately lead to larger single orders rather than so many small orders. The impact on Boeing might be harder to evaluate as important in the big picture since so much of its revenue-generating government and agency orders are based on planes and space systems. Boeing’s market cap is $83 billion, and its 2015 revenue was $96.1 billion. At $133.34, its shares were up 0.8% late on Thursday. Boeing has a 52-week trading range of $102.10 to $150.59 and a consensus analyst price target of $149.00. Raytheon’s market cap is almost $42 billion, and its shares were up 0.8% at $141.95 late on Thursday. Its 52-week range is $96.68 to $142.15, and its consensus price target is $150.77. Raytheon’s 2015 revenue was $23.25 billion. This is one of those news announcements in which the implication of the order and the process of it could greatly outweigh what the mere $231 million size might indicate. Ultimately this could alter how hundreds of millions of dollars or even billions of dollars in orders could be handled. Stay tuned.

These lawsuits follow close on the heels of ones against MIT, NYU and Yale. Aug 11, 2016 @ 1:56 pm By Greg Iacurci + Zoom Duke University It's been two days since Yale, MIT and NYU were sued for excessive fees in their retirement plans, and lawyers have already added four more to the pile: Duke University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt University. The same law firm, Schlichter, Bogard & Denton, is responsible for each of the seven university lawsuits, which allege breach of fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for allowing the plan to incur excessive investment, record-keeping and administration fees that cost participants millions of dollars in lost retirement savings. The firm's managing partner, Jerry Schlichter, pioneered excessive-fee litigation in the 401(k) market, where he has been bringing cases for about a decade. It seems he and his firm are broadening their reach to the realm of 403(b) plans, which are defined-contribution plans for nonprofit institutions. The lawsuits earlier this week were the first to be filed among university 403(b) plans. “What seems to have happened is plaintiffs' attorneys have discovered there's a whole world of plans in the educational community, and having now discovered them, they're exploring whether or not there are settlements to be extracted,” said Andrew Oringer, partner and co-chair of the employee benefits and executive compensation group at Dechert. Those settlements have the potential to be hefty. Mr. Schlichter, for example, won the largest-ever sum in cases such as these from Lockheed Martin Corp. last year, to the tune of $62 million. He's won several more, including a $57 million sum from The Boeing Co., earning more than $300 million in aggregate. Mr. Schlichter didn't return a request for comment. ALLEGATIONS The Duke, Johns Hopkins, UPenn and Vanderbilt 403(b) plans each have more than $3 billion in assets and tens of thousands of participants. Participants in the plans are bringing suit on behalf of a proposed class. Allegations among the lawsuits are nearly identical. Over the relevant time periods, plaintiffs claim the university plans used multiple record keepers, imprudently used revenue sharing to pay for record-keeping services and harbored too many investment options, many of which were underperforming funds in a retail share class as opposed to a less-expensive institutional share class. These factors led participants to pay excessive fees, constituting a breach by fiduciaries to ensure participants incur reasonable fees, plaintiffs claim. Vanderbilt's and Duke's plans, for example, used four separate record keepers — Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Co., Vanguard Group Inc., TIAA and the Variable Life Insurance Co. The inefficiencies of using multiple providers as well as excessive revenue-sharing payments to these providers, contributed to $45 million in lost savings in the last six years for Duke's participants, and $25 million for Vanderbilt's, according to plaintiffs. Johns Hopkins University used five record keepers, and UPenn two. Three out of four of the plans offered more than 300 investment options, the vast majority of them proprietary and split between mutual funds, insurance pooled separate accounts and fixed and variable annuities. Johns Hopkins' plan, for example, offered more than 440 investment options, Duke more than 400, Vanderbilt 340 and UPenn 78. Plaintiffs allege this number of options causes duplicative investment strategies, which is confusing for participants and doesn't allow fiduciaries to take advantage of economies of scale to achieve better pricing. “Duke provides a range of options that give employees flexibility in designing retirement plans to meet their individual needs,” said Michael Schoenfeld, a spokesman for the university. “These investments are reviewed and carefully managed in accord with federal law to provide low costs and good outcomes for our employees. We will continue to commit to these guiding principles.” Similarly, UPenn spokeswoman Phyllis Holtzman said the university uses a “rigorous process to review all aspects of the investment options offered to its faculty and staff to ensure they are administered with the highest degree of care and prudence.” UPenn plans to defend itself vigorously against the lawsuit, she said. Vanderbilt hasn't yet been served with the complaint, and hasn't had the opportunity to review allegations, spokeswoman Beth Fortune said. Johns Hopkins spokeswoman Jill Rosen said the university offers its employees a “generous and carefully managed benefits program,” and is in the process of reviewing its lawsuit as well as the others filed this week. The litigation appears to attack traditional aspects of the 403(b) market, according to Michael Hadley, a partner at the law firm Davis & Harman. “Having lots of options and lifetime income products available is pretty fundamental to university 403(b) plans,” he said. “The 403(b) market has moved closer to how we administer 401(k) plans over time. But it's certainly not the same as a 401(k) plan.” Mr. Hadley believes it's “way too early” to determine the validity of the suits' arguments. Mr. Oringer thinks "you'd really have to establish there was material inefficiency in the use of multiple record keepers that cost participants money in a way that was not defensible. And it just seems to me that that's potentially a tough claim to make.” Further, courts tend to favorably view providing an expansive number of choices, he said. 0 Comments What do you think?

The companies will have 24 months to assist with “the commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions,” NASA announced Aug. 9. The six companies are: Bigelow Aerospace Boeing Lockheed Martin Orbital ATK Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems NanoRacks “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems, according to the release. “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” This is part two of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships, or NextSTEP, program. In 2015, four partners—Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK—were selected to work on deep space exploration and habitats. NextSTEP-2 will hone in on “missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s,” NASA states. “These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars.” Bigelow is a pioneer of sorts when it comes to deep space habitats. Earlier this year, the Las Vegas-based company launched its latest experiment: the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, which was the first inflatable habitat NASA allowed to be attached to the International Space Station. The module was flown into space on SpaceX’s cargo cargo capsule, attached to the ISS, and expanded and pressurized on May 28. For the next two years, it’ll remain in orbit above the Earth to test how well expandable habitats hold up against conditions like solar radiation and extreme temperatures. NanoRacks’ inclusion in NASA’s current program signals an expansion of their existing relationship; the Texas-based company already has a mini-satellite launcher on the ISS. Orbital ATK will be advancing designs for Cygnus, its current commercial cargo space craft that flies to the ISS. The other three companies will be creating or refurbishing and modifying ground demonstrators or prototypes of habitats. Over the next two years, each of the six selected companies will be awarded varying amounts of funding for their diverse projects, but the combined total cost will be close to $65 million. In their its release announcing NextSTEP-2, NASA implied that, if necessary, the project would continue into 2018 and additional funding would then be pumped into it. Of course, nothing guarantees functional finished products by 2018—or ever, for that matter. But NASA has a track record of successful partnerships with private companies leading to real results, like Red Dragon, SpaceX’s spacecraft that aims carry astronauts to the ISS by 2018.

Michael Rogers, the hawkish former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, will be advising the Trump transition team on national security, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. After leaving Congress, Rogers founded a pressure group called Americans for Peace, Prosperity, and Security, intended to “help elect a president who supports American engagement and a strong foreign policy.” As Lee Fang reported for The Intercept last year, the business executives helping APPS included several defense contractors who stand to gain financially from continued militarism. At a rally in February, Trump criticized defense spending. “I will build a military bigger, better, stronger,” he said. “I guarantee we can do it for less money. I hear stories like they are ordering missiles they do not want because of politics; because of special interests. Because the company that makes the missiles is a contributor. … We are ordering missiles that the generals do not want because of politics.” Trump has also advocated reduced military intervention. In July, when asked about the attempted coup in Turkey, he told the New York Times: “I think right now when it comes to civil liberties, our country has a lot of problems, and I think it’s very hard for us to get involved in other countries when we don’t know what we are doing and we can’t see straight in our own country.” In the same interview, he argued against the NATO alliance: “We’re talking about countries that are doing very well. Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, ‘Congratulations, you will be defending yourself.’” Despite Trump’s noninterventionist talk, a financial analyst predicted in April that a Trump presidency would be good for the defense industry. In June, the Trump campaign met with representatives of defense contractors Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin, the Daily Beast reported. Defense contractors were also an important part of Rogers’s congressional bids. During his 2014 run, for example, he took campaign contributions from ManTech International, L-3 Communications, Motorola Solutions, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Rogers founded APPS with leftover campaign money after he retired from Congress last year. The group has held campaign events in which candidates discussed national security. Most recently, APPS held a national security forum at the RNC with Chris Christie. Since last April, the group has held 27 forums on national security with 14 GOP candidates. Rogers is part of a minority in the national security community that supports Trump — none of the other leaders at APPS has endorsed the candidate, for example. APPS advisory board member Danielle Pletka, who is vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in CNN last month that Trump “not only knows nothing about national security, he doesn’t care to know.” Kevin Madden, national advisor to APPS and senior advisor to Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign, told the Daily Beast in May that he will not vote for Trump. And George W. Bush’s national security advisor, Stephen Hadley, a board member at APPS and Raytheon, declined to endorse either candidate. Fifty Republican former national security officials recently signed a letter opposing Trump. Donald Rumsfeld, George W. Bush’s first defense secretary, is the most prominent national security expert to endorse Trump. On Monday, Trump attacked the former national security officials who came out against him. He said in a statement that the letter was “politically motivated,” and that “they are nothing more than the failed Washington elite looking to hold onto their power.” Related Contact the author: Naomi LaChance✉naomi.lachance@​theintercept.comt@lachancenaomi ˅ ⎕ 50 Comments (closed) The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

A string of cases have fuelled suspicions in the US and beyond that some Chinese firms will resort to any measures to obtain valuable intellectual property that could give them a technological leg-up. In 2010, former Boeing engineer Dongfan “Greg” Chung was jailed for 15 years and nine months for economic espionage after he was convicted of passing trade secrets to Beijing to assist the Chinese aviation industry. The engineer, who worked on Nasa’s space shuttle programme, had stored binders full of information about US military aircraft in his home, collecting data that he passed on to China over three decades. The documents included design manuals for the US Air Force’s B-1 bomber, the C-17 military cargo plane, the F-15 fighter jet, as well as Chinook helicopters. In letters to a Chinese state official, Chung said that he wanted to “make some contributions to the modernisations [sic] of the Motherland”. One letter from a Chinese official, found at Chung’s house and written in 1987, said: “It is your honour and China’s fortune that you are able to realise your wish of dedicating yourselves to the services of your country.” FBI agents began looking into Chung while investigating a separate case against Chinese-born naturalised US citizen Chi Mak. Mak was found guilty in 2007 of conspiring to export sensitive defence technology to China while working for defence contractor Paragon Power. He was caught when family members were searched at Los Angeles airport and found to have a CD full of classified information. The information Mak passed on allegedly helped China build its own version of Aegis, an American radar system built to protect military ships. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison for acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. More recently Chinese citizen Mo Hailong, commonly known as Robert Mo, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal agricultural trade secrets. In January Mo admitted digging up corn seeds from an Iowa farm to send back to China, breaching the intellectual property rights of agrochemicals conglomerate Monsanto and seed producer Du Pont Pioneer. He is yet to be convicted or sentenced, but conspiracy to steal trade secrets is a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The Justice Department (DoJ) said the theft was on behalf of “companies controlled by the government of the People’s Republic of China”. Repeated allegations of spying by state-sponsored hackers have also added to tensions between the west and China. In 2014, the DoJ indicted five Chinese military officers with stealing data from six US companies and unions in an eight-year espionage campaign that targeted firms including metals giant Alcoa and nuclear firm Westinghouse Electric. Oil giants BP, Shell and Exxon Mobil were among companies which had their systems infiltrated by hackers in China, uncovered by internet security firm McAfee in 2011. The attacks, part of a lengthy campaign nicknamed “Night Dragon”, targeted “project-financing information with regard to oil and gas fields and operations”, according to McAfee, including information about the location of potentially lucrative oil reserves. Google’s travails in China, where the search engine is banned, are well documented. In 2010, the US internet firm said a cyber-attack originating in China had targeted its intellectual property. Google said the attackers’ main aim was to infiltrate the email accounts of Chinese dissidents and human rights activists, but it also flagged up efforts to steal information from companies in industries including chemicals, technology and finance. In 2014, a Chinese hacker group called Putter Panda, thought to be based in the offices of the People’s Liberation Army, was said by security experts to have hacked satellite technology companies in the US and UK. A report by BT and KPMG warned earlier this year of the “industrialisation of cybercrime”. The report said today’s cybercriminals often work for complex operations akin to businesses, with human resources divisions and budgets for research and development. Some are so sophisticated that they are able to hijack senior executives’ email accounts and fake correspondence to convince junior company employees to approve transactions.

QRZ Callsign Search  Page last updated on: Wednesday, August 10, 2016 NASA TV to air installation of space station docking port NASA Television will bring to viewers around the world live coverage Friday, Aug. 19, as two NASA astronauts install a new gateway for American commercial crew spacecraft at the International Space Station - a significant milestone in NASA’s work to return crew launches to U.S. soil. Coverage of the spacewalk will begin at 6:30 a.m. EDT Aug. 19, on NASA TV and the agency’s website, with the spacewalk scheduled to begin at 8:05 a.m. Leading up to the spacewalk, NASA TV will air a briefing from the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston at 2 p.m. Monday, Aug. 15, during which station and commercial crew experts will discuss the process and significance of installing and connecting the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs) that will be used for the future arrivals of Boeing and SpaceX commercial crew spacecraft. The briefing participants are: Kenneth Todd, International Space Station Operations Integration manager Steve Stich, deputy manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program Zeb Scoville, spacewalk flight director Glenda Brown, lead spacewalk officer The adapter was launched on a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and arrived at the station July 20. Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams, KD5TVQ and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins, KG5FYJ of NASA will conduct the spacewalk to install the equipment. This will be the fourth spacewalk in Williams’ career, the first for Rubins, and the 194th for the space station. The two astronauts will venture outside the space station’s Quest airlock to install the first IDA onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2, located on the forward end of the Harmony module. On Wednesday, Aug. 17, ground controllers will use the Canadarm2 robotic arm, and its attached “Dextre” Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, to extract the IDA from the trunk of Dragon, and position it just inches away from PMA-2. There will be no live coverage of the trunk removal and IDA positioning. Commercial crew flights from Florida’s Space Coast to the International Space Station will restore America’s human spaceflight launch capability and increase the time U.S. crews can dedicate to scientific research, which is helping prepare astronauts for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars. NASA TV’s Public Channel (NTV-1) will broadcast enhanced coverage of the spacewalk including operational commentary, in-studio experts and features, and its Media Channel (NTV-3) will broadcast a clean feed of video from space station with operational commentary.

For one thing, the new glass technology pioneered by a team of scientists at MIT is capable of changing shades much faster that what you’ll find on those ultra-hip eyeglasses. It also covers a broader spectrum of opacity than such photochromic substances. The material also differs from the electrochromic variety you’ll find on the windows of Boeing 787 Dreamliner to prevent glare. Again, it’s quicker, in part due to the slow speeds of electronics and ions required to create the material change in the older technology. Utilizing spongy metal-organic frameworks, the new stuff conducts both quickly. The material is also capable of running the spectrum from completely clear to nearly black, the latter of which it accomplishes by combining different chemical compounds. The material, highlighted in the new issue of the online journal Chem, could be used to reduce glare (a la Boeing), produce e-ink-style displays and cut down on energy costs by going opaque for cooling purposes when the sun is particularly glaring outside. And while, like other electrochromic solutions, the material requires a current to change shades, electricity isn’t required to keep it in that state. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Tesla and SolarCity-powered Island | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Windows glass MIT Science Popular Posts Featured Stories The OnePlus 3T makes one of Android’s best bets even better 4 hours ago | Brian Heater Google’s AI translation tool seems to have invented its own secret internal language 18 hours ago | Devin Coldewey, Contributor Starbucks starts selling Ember mugs, which keep your drink at a steady temp for hours 19 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Facebook built censorship tool to get into China despite human rights risks 19 hours ago | Josh Constine Latest From TechCrunch Gong says it’s cracked news personalization 9 minutes ago | Anthony Ha A longtime VC on the virtues of not swinging for the fences 14 minutes ago | Connie Loizos Amazon makes good on its promise to delete “incentivized” reviews 20 minutes ago | Sarah Perez Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures back Apptopia’s next-gen app intelligence platform 2 hours ago | Sarah Perez Comment moderation powered by Up Next Microsoft acquires Beam interactive game live streaming service Posted Aug 11, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings CRM Berater (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland) C++ Developer - Qt Product Development (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland) Full Stack Engineer at FactorChain at The Sourcery (Los Altos, CA, United States) UI Engineering @ FactorChain at The Sourcery (Los Altos, CA, United States) Senior Backend Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Rubins and Williams will conduct a spacewalk in August 2016 to install the first International Docking Adapter, the new docking port that will enable the future arrival of U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. Credit: NASA. A pair of astronauts tried on U.S. spacesuits this morning ahead of a spacewalk next week. Afterward, the crew explored heart cells, fluid pressure in the head and the eyes and the composition of meteors. NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins are due to work outside the International Space Station on Aug. 19 for 6.5 hours. The duo tried on the spacesuits today they will wear during the spacewalk to complete the installation of the first of two International Docking Adapters to the Harmony module. Commercial Crew vehicles are being developed by Boeing and SpaceX that will dock to the new adapters in the future. Rubins then moved on to observing heart cells with a specialized microscope. The heart cells are derived from stem cells that were manufactured from human skin cells. Williams joined cosmonaut Anatoly Ivanishin for ultrasound scans and vision checks. That work was part of the Fluid Shifts study that is exploring how the lack of gravity influences head pressure and eye shape possibly affecting an astronaut's vision. Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi replaced a hard drive on a laptop computer that collects data on the composition of meteors entering Earth's atmosphere. Cosmonauts Oleg Skripochka and Alexey Ovchinin participated in a study that seeks to improve the ability of a crew member to pilot a spacecraft. On-Orbit Status Report Fluid Shifts Operations in the Service Module: With ground team assistance, crewmembers continued Fluid Shifts Imaging exams by conducting the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) exam, Ultrasound scans, the Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) tests, and a Tonometry exam. This investigation characterizes the space flight-induced fluid shift, including intra- and extravascular shifts, intra- and extracellular shifts, changes in total body water and lower vs. upper body shifts. Results from this investigation are expected to help define the causes of the ocular structure and vision changes associated with long duration space flight, and assist in the development of countermeasures. Mouse Epigenetics Cage Unit Maintenance: The crew completed standard maintenance activities for the Mouse Epigenetics experiment by refilling the water in the Mouse Habitat Cage Unit located in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF). The Mouse Epigenetics investigation studies altered gene expression patterns in the organs of male mice that spend one month in space, and also examines changes in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of their offspring. Results from the investigation identify genetic alterations that happen after exposure to the microgravity environment of space. Heart Cells Microscope Operations: The crew set up the Heart Cells microscope, removed the BioCell Habitat from the Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) and the Multiwell BioCell from the BioCell Habitat and inserted into the microscope before conducting Heart Cells operations. The Heart Cells investigation studies the human heart, specifically how heart muscle tissue, contracts, grows and changes (gene expression) in microgravity and how those changes vary between subjects. Understanding how heart muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, change in space improves efforts for studying disease, screening drugs and conducting cell replacement therapy for future space missions. Meteor Hard Drive Change: The crew R&Rd the hard drive in the Meteor Laptop located in the Window Observational Research Facility (WORF) in preparation for upcoming meteor showers. The Meteor investigation provides the first space-based measurement of meteor flux. It also allows for the monitoring of carbon-based compounds. Continuous measurement of meteor interactions with the Earth's atmosphere could also spot previously unforeseen meteor showers. Dose Tracker: The crew completed entries for medication. This investigation documents the medication usage of crewmembers before and during their missions by capturing data regarding medication use during spaceflight, including side effect qualities, frequencies and severities. The data is expected to either support or counter anecdotal evidence of medication ineffectiveness during flight and unusual side effects experienced during flight. It is also expected that specific, near-real-time questioning about symptom relief and side effects will provide the data required to establish whether spaceflight-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) is occurring during missions. MSG Video File Transfer Issues - Yesterday, the Microgravity Sciences Glovebox (MSG) experienced an issue with the Video Unit Equipment (VUE). Ground teams were unable to access the solid state storage devices during HeartCell video downlink operations. A soft reboot was attempted with no success. A power cycle was then conducted and the drives were recovered. In addition, ground teams are having difficulties in downlinking large files associated with the payload. The HeartCell data is being recorded, so no loss of science at this time. If required, the current work-around is to have the crew utilize a thumb drive to allow the files to be downlink. Currently, the VUE is functional except for downlinking large files. Ground teams are investigating. Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The crew continued preparations for the IDA2 EVA scheduled on August 19. This morning they performed pressurized Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) On Orbit Fit Check Verification (OFV) of EMUs 3003 and 3008 to assess fit and feel of the suits prior to the EVA.

However, a trip to the red planet using current propulsion technologies can take up to eight months, during which astronauts need to be able to survive the extremely hostile environment of the cold and dark beyond, which, if things go wrong, can kill them in the blink of an eye. In order to ensure that humans survive the grueling journey, NASA has long been trying to design and develop deep space habitats and systems. On Wednesday, in another step toward this effort, the space agency announced that it had selected six companies as part of its Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program to develop full-sized ground prototypes and concepts for deep-space habitats. Concept image of the interior of a deep space habitat. Photo: NASA The six selected partners are — Lockheed Martin, which will refurbish and test a multi-purpose logistics module, Boeing, which will develop a full-scale modular habitat system, Orbital ATK, which will work on perfecting the design and architecture of its cislunar habitat concept, Bigelow Aerospace, which will develop and test a prototype of its XBASE habitat, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems, which will study and refine a flexible architecture and concept of operations for a deep space habitat, and NanoRacks, which will, along with its partners Space Systems Loral and the United Launch Alliance, conduct a feasibility study regarding the conversion of an existing launch vehicle’s upper stage into a pressurized habitat. Concept image of Lockheed Martin's refurbished multi-purpose logistics module prototype Photo: Lockheed Martin “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems, said in a statement. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” Related Stories 'Ice House' Could Keep Astronauts Cozy On Mars Apollo Astronauts Face Higher Risk Of Heart Disease Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. Photo: Boeing The space agency estimates that the contracts would add up to $65 million over the next two years. The selected companies are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the total cost. NASA would seek to ensure that at least some of these habitats would be a part of its ambitious mission to Mars, and it hopes to put these technologies to test in the true deep space environment near the moon during the 2020s. However, until that happens, the ground prototypes will allow NASA and the partner companies to evaluate configurations of the habitat and test how the various systems interact together and with other capabilities like propulsion modules and airlocks.

In the meantime, we need to develop ways for humans to live safely in space for extended periods of time. That’s the goal of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2). The latest initiative in this program is the development of six deep space human habitats here on Earth for in-depth testing. Each of the six habitats will be developed by a different private company over the course of this year and next. You’re probably familiar with some of the ideas and companies that are participating in the habitat test. For example, Bigelow Aerospace, which made news recently with an inflatable module on the International Space Station. Bigelow will be developing a prototype of the XBASE (Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement) that is larger than the BEAM modules on the ISS. The XBASE will be 330 cubic meters in size, compared to just 16 cubic meters for the BEAM. Space heavyweights Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also getting involved. Boeing doesn’t have many details, just that it plans to develop a module habitat system. Lockheed has an interesting plan that involves refurbishing logistics modules in space for use as habitats. Orbital ATK has worked with NASA on a number of big projects, too, and it’s designing a habitat version of its Cygnus cargo vessel. The lesser known firms working on the habitat project include Sierra Nevada Corporation, which will develop a prototype module space station design that can be assembled in orbit in 3-4 launches. NanoRacks is the final participant and will explore the feasibility of converting the upper stages of existing launch vehicles into habitable volume in orbit. NASA expects to award about $65 million in total for work done on these feasibility studies, some of which could eventually become real space habitats.

(Photo : NASA via Getty Images) The continues advancement in space technology requires calculated steps and complex maneuvers to complete, like the installation of the new kind of docking port to the International Space Station (ISS). Advertisement Last July, SpaceX delivered cargo to space including the docking port that will be used in the new few years for the new breed of space capsules that can transport crew to space including the ones currently being developed by SpaceX and Boeing. NASA is ready to share the history as it unfolds when the agency announced that the installation of the new docking port will be televised and will be available for viewing around the world. NASA TV will air the space walk to install the port on Friday, Aug. 19, according to the agency's press release. Walking in space alone poses a threat to the astronauts performing their duty, but the new mission of installing a dock into the ISS adds to the level of difficulties that astronauts will need to survive in order to perform their duty. The docking port will serve as the new gateway at the ISS. The coverage that will record the intricate spacewalk to install the port will start at 6:30 am on Aug. 19 on NASA television (NASA TV). The briefing for the event will also be conducted on the same day at the Johnson Space Center at 2:00 pm. During the briefing, key individuals concerned with the project will discuss the important points of the mission; the list includes Kenneth Todd, the International Space Station Operations Integration manager, Steve Stich, deputy manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, Zeb Scoville, spacewalk flight director and Glenda Brown, lead spacewalk officer, according to PR Newswire. The new type of docking board called International Docking Adapters (IDAs) that is fitted to receive Boeing and SpaceX' space capsules for crew transport.   Advertisement     TagsISS, International Space Station, Spacewalk, space walk, spacewalk live, NASA TV spacewalk live, watch spacewalk live, ISS docking port installation, space © 2016 NatureWorldNews.com All rights reserved.

(Photo : NASA via Getty Images) Developing space habitats is a vital step in NASA's deep space explorations as providing the crew with decent and habitable area in space in crucial to the success of future missions. Advertisement NASA is looking at developing other deep space habitats from different companies and is planning to build full-scale model of each here on Earth. The agency teamed up with six private companies to produce full-scale prototypes of space habitats from their original design. The designs were chosen from the submissions to the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships, according to Engadget. Earlier this year, a habitable inflatable module was sent to the International Space Station (ISS), the first inflatable module sent to space developed by Bigelow Aerospace. Bigelow Aerospace will also develop its space habitat version called Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE), the XBASE is capable of attaching to existing space stations. The companies chosen includes Boeing that will test their modular habitat system. Boeing is also developing a new generation of space capsule that can transport crew to space called CST-100 Starliner. Lockheed Martin is also part of the program and will transform their multi-purpose modules that used to carry supplies into space to habitats with integrated avionics and Environmental Control System, while Orbital ATK will continue to develop its cislunar habitat. Other companies also working with NASA in developing space habitats include Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems, another cargo resupply company to the ISS. They will modify their Dream Chase space plane originally designed from unmanned cargo resupply missions, according to a report. While for cost-effective measures, Space Systems Loral and United Launch Alliance are working on NanoRacks under their team name "Ixion." They are attempting to study the feasibility of transforming tanks from former launch vehicles into space habitats. This way, the former parts of space vehicles that are doomed to waste might get another shot at life by providing shelter to the crew in space. All the habitats will be designed with space in mind and future deep space explorations like Mars. The companies are expected to build full-scale deep space habitat prototypes on Earth.

And from the end of next year, the centre will be used to train a new generation of Qantas pilots on the next generation aircraft.” Qantas has previously announced plans to recruit 170 pilots between now and 2020 as part of its Dreamliner program. This is in addition to training some of its existing pilots on the new aircraft. “The 787-9 will be the first new major aircraft type introduced into the Qantas fleet since we started flying the Airbus A380 in 2008 and provides us with the ability to replace older, less efficient aircraft and deliver potential new routes,” Mr Joyce said. Some of the key features of the Dreamliner include reduced engine noise, a 20% reduction in emissions and fuel burn, and technology to reduce turbulence. Qantas’ first 787-9 is expected to enter service by the end of 2017. Most pilots spend up to 24 hours a year in a simulator specific to the type of aircraft they fly as part of their ongoing training and professional development. Pilots using the B787 simulator will be working towards their certification to fly the new aircraft, which in the case of a pilots already operating as a captain on a Boeing aircraft takes 44 hours of ‘sim time’.

Pops! Resident orchestra gains quick following Adam Parker For The Gazette Aug 10, 2016 (…) Buy Now The North Charleston Pops! orchestra is regularly drawing an audience of 1,000 people or more. It’s catching on fast. Now at the cusp of its fifth season, the North Charleston Pops! is luring thousands of patrons to the Performing Arts Center for concerts featuring Broadway and movie music, big band tunes, famous singers such as Mary Wilson and a relaxed atmosphere. The pops orchestra comprises professional players led by conductor Nick Palmer, who is about to start his second season as music director. “I wasn’t expecting it to become so important to the community so quickly,” said Executive Director Tacy Edwards, who devotes many hours to the ensemble on a volunteer basis. “Nick is the perfect match for what Pops wants to do”: provide great entertainment and harness the spirit of a growing city. They manage to do a lot with a small but growing annual budget. This year it’s $180,000, with a big chunk of it coming from Boeing, the orchestra’s main sponsor. The city helps, too, providing venues, marketing and money. This enables the Pops to keep ticket prices low, Edwards said. The partnership with the city began at an opportune moment, just as the region began to see substantial growth in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. The Pops ensemble satisfies a need, Edwards said. “There’s lots of pride that the community has its own orchestra.” The expanded new season begins on Sept. 10 with “Broadway Rocks!” The concert includes tunes from popular shows such as “Wicked,” “Hairspray,” “The Lion King,” “Rent,” “The Wiz” and “Mamma Mia!” Four more concerts follow. Plans also are being laid to present a few outdoor concerts in Riverfront Park, Palmer and Edwards said. They also want to take the Pops orchestra on the road for performances in the Southeast. Edwards remembers her joy at seeing more than 700 patrons in the audience for the first-ever Pops concert in November 2012. Nowadays, concerts easily draw at least 1,000. The final concert of last season filled the PAC with 1,220 people. Once, in February 2014, a concert featuring Cirque de la Symphonie sold out with more than 2,000 in attendence. “We are finding, as each concert happens, we sell more tickets,” she said. “Word-of-mouth advertising is very powerful.” Palmer, who has enjoyed a long career as a composer, arranger and conductor, said he’s especially excited about the opportunities opening up for the North Charleston Pops! orchestra. It’s about a lot more than presenting concerts. The group operates a successful instrument donation program, providing low-income children a chance to learn and perform music. And now Palmer and his colleagues are working on setting up a Pops chorus and string orchestra. Eventually, he hopes to develop a full-scale Youth Pops Orchestra, he said. Edwards, a flutist with years of performing and administrative experience, said the orchestra is fortunate to have found Palmer. “I have worked with many music directors,” she said. “It’s hard to find a person so well-rounded. ... Nick, he loves people, goes into the community, he’s responsive, outgoing, easy to work with, very supportive of what we do.” And he is full of ideas and has a clear vision for the organization. “He knows a lot of artists out in the world, so he’s able to bring us talent at a fraction of the typical cost.” Most Popular Articles Articles Edisto Beach State Park to reopen Friday Hanahan's Dyson inks with Crusaders Hawks counting on versatility Second person dies in apparent murder/suicide in Goose Creek Cane Bay girls team seeking consistency Gators lose 25 seniors, expect better 2017 Championship dreams at stake in playoffs Gators dealing with huge loss Charleston Southern to offer new BS in Cyber Security degree Cobras fend off Crestwood Friends2Follow Poll What do you think of the new ourgazette.com website?

David Goldfein brief reporters. (Photo: U.S. Air Force, Scott M. Ash) Updated on August 15 to reflect KC-46 production approval More than 60 U.S. Air Force acquisition and upgrade programs could be affected if the Congress approves stopgap legislation instead of passing the Fiscal Year 2017 defense appropriations bill, warned Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James. Production of the joint direct attack munition (JDAM) and the KC-46 refueling tanker would be less than planned next year, as would spending on the B-21 long-range strike bomber. James delivered the warning during a “State of the Air Force” briefing August 10 at the Pentagon. It was her first such briefing with Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, who was sworn in to the post on July 1. He succeeded Gen. Mark Welsh. The service is “hearing” that Congress may pass a six-month or a year-long continuing resolution, or stopgap spending measure, James said. A long-term “CR” would fund the Air Force at $1.3 billion less than the amount it seeks in FY2017, she instructed. Lesser funding would limit production of Boeing’s JDAM precision guidance tail kits—much in demand for overseas contingency operations against the Islamic State and other extremists—to the FY2016 level. Similarly, the Northrop Grumman B-21 program, now at the engineering and manufacturing development stage, would be capped at the FY2016 level. Production of the Boeing KC-46 would be capped at 12 aircraft instead of the 15 sought. This “couldn’t help but push back” the KC-46 program’s contractual required assets available (RAA) date, said James, who expressed concern that the contract could be renegotiated. “That’s a serious question because of course we do have favorable terms and we do not want to reopen the contract (or) change requirements in any way,” she added. The “key meeting” leading to a Milestone C decision to begin low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the tanker will happen later this month, James said. “We believe that the aircraft has met all of the wickets that are required to meet Milestone C,” she attested. But undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics Frank Kendall must approve the decision. (The Air Force announced on August 12 that Kendall gave Milestone C approval to begin LRIP. The service said it will soon award Boeing contracts for two production lots totaling 19 aircraft, for a combined pre-negotiated value of $2.8 billion.) Separately of the budget discussion, James said the Air Force has made progress on a “get well plan” to shore up its remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) corps, which is challenged to attract and retain pilots and sensor operators. It is “well on the way” to fully manning training units and from FY2015 to FY2017 will double the number of RPA graduate and undergraduate pilots from 188 to 334. As of October 1, the service will raise its RPA pilot retention bonus from $25,000 to $35,000. Air National Guard units are supporting active-duty and reserve airmen, providing for three additional air combat patrols. The Air Force is also relying more on contractors to conduct non-strike missions. This fall, it will announce candidate bases for locating a new wing of RPA airmen, James said. While the Air Force has made progress on RPA recruitment, it faces an accute shortage of up to 1,000 fighter pilots in the next couple of years (from 700 now) and is seeking authorization from Congress to improve their compensation. “Why is this so? Well, the airlines are forecasted to be hiring a lot more. They already are,” James said. A reporter asked if the situation represents a crisis. “I believe it’s a crisis,” Goldfein said. “Air superiority is not an American birthright.

Do you really want a world in which the U.S. makes all its own shirts, and Bangladesh tries to build its own planes? Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday gave a virtual mirror image of the speech that Donald Trump gave earlier this week. Trump went to Detroit to tell a story of the decline of U.S. manufacturing. Clinton went to a high-tech factory in the suburbs to talk about its rebirth. There’s one area, though, where Clinton and Trump have some points of agreement: trade. The Hillary Clinton of a few years ago was an advocate of free trade. The campaign has pushed her toward protectionism. The implicit message of Clinton’s speech was that we could make great things in the U.S. and ship them abroad. And we can! But that’s the funny thing about trade discussion these days: They all take place on Trump’s terms, and the discussion is largely about how the U.S. can make more stuff at home and buy less from abroad. And if every country acted that way — well, you can guess the result. The protectionist bandwagon is getting pretty full now. There will still be plenty of time to climb on it if you want. But before you do, some questions that may help you gauge if that wagon is really headed in the direction you want to go: Clinton visited an advanced auto parts factory, right? No, not exactly. She spoke at the plant of a company called Futuramic Tool & Engineering. Futuramic once made parts for the auto industry, but that’s no longer its focus. It’s now, Clinton said in her speech, an aerospace company, making parts for the F-35 fighter plane and the tools that will be used to assemble the next generation Space Launch System Rocket (NASA’s replacement for the space shuttle). The F-35, that’s a military program, isn’t it? What does that have to do with trade? Yes, the F-35 is indeed a military program. The fighter airplane is also likely to become one of the biggest U.S. exports. A number of partner countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and several other NATO members are also supplying parts for the plane. They are now testing it, and will be future buyers when it hits final production. Another buyer? Japan. Japan has already ordered parts from the U.S. that will be used to assemble F-35s in a factory overseas. Got that? We are buying parts from Europe for F-35s to build here, some of which will be exported back. We are also sending parts to Japan for F-35s that will be built there. Trade gets complicated that way. Every country plays the “make it here if you want to sell it here” game to some degree. That’s part of the reason large-scale projects like the F-35 source components from around the world. The idea, hopefully, is that in the end the best companies in each place get a piece of the business, not that one country will “win” by building everything. What about private aerospace? The U.S. does have a big private aerospace industry. Most of it, however, is headquartered on the West Coast. In fact, Futuramic recently opened an office there, to be close to Boeing and other companies like Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’s rocket company. Going to California or Michigan wouldn’t present the same contrast with Donald Trump’s speech, which portrayed Detroit as a desert of failure and decline. Ironically, Michigan has actually been a quiet success story. It’s unemployment rate is now 4.6% —lower than the national average, and lower than those of California or Washington. Hey, what about cars? Don’t they still make them in the United States? Why didn’t Clinton go to that kind of plant? Yes, there are definitely cars still made in the U.S. Like the Toyota Camry. Cars.com, which compiles an “American Made” index each year, found eight cars in 2016 that were composed of at least 75% U.S.-made parts. Five of those were made by Toyota or Honda. (Did we mention that trade was complicated?) In 2015, it was just seven. A decade ago, it was more than 20. So, basically: Fewer cars are made primarily in the United States. Most of the ones that are are what many folks still think of a “Japanese cars.” Didn’t Clinton say Trump could make his suits and shirts here? She did, and he could. On her campaign website, Clinton provided a list of U.S. makers for all the stuff sold under the Trump name. (Incidentally, Trump doesn’t really make it all; he just licenses his brand.) There are a lot of great manufacturers on that list, some venerable names you might have heard of. It’s a clever conceit, but here’s the big caveat: A lot of the U.S.-manufactured apparel is pretty high-end items. Trump collection suits run from $144 to $280 at Amazon.com; a typical Hickey Freeman suit is about $547. Many of the shirts made in the U.S. are finely tailored, intriguingly designed — and much, much more expensive than you are probably used to paying. Dress shirts from Mizzen+Main in Dallas, are priced at $125; ones from O’Connell’s in Buffalo, N.Y. will generally set you back about $125 to $165. Nothing wrong with that. There are good reasons to make shirts domestically. For instance, you can maintain an extensive catalog of styles, then quickly make and deliver a new batch of the most popular one. If you can afford these shirts, great. But most Americans don’t spend that much (and even most of those who do probably get some cheaper ones, as well). What’s left of the U.S. apparel industry specializes in a fairly high-end product. If you think it’s better that all our apparel should be made in the U.S., be prepared for much higher prices. You may wonder, by the way, about those countries that do make cheaper apparel, like Bangladesh. Do they buy anything from the United States? Oh, yes, they do. And at this point you might even guess what: Biman Bangladesh Airlines is waiting for a delivery of new Boeing 787 Dreamliners. But all that only works if other countries don’t put up barriers to U.S. products, right? And do things like protect our intellectual property? Sigh. Yes, that’s right. Actually, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was about taking down those barriers. It would facilitate the kind of trade in which a U.S. maker buys some parts from Asia, others from the United States, and ships the finished, high-tech product around the world — just like that F-35. In Michigan, Clinton unequivocally promised to kill it: “I oppose it now, I’ll oppose it after the election, and I’ll oppose it as president.” It would be hard for her to step back from that in the Oval Office. It’s really a read-my-lips-no-trade-deal moment. Does that mean the infamous TPP is dead in a Clinton presidency? Well, maybe. But in the business world there’s a huge amount of backing for something like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Sure, it might get chopped up, renamed, and partially “renegotiated,” but there’s a good chance we’ll have a trade deal of some sort, just called something else.

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor SpaceX’s rate of launch set to accelerate with launch of JCSAT-16 Jason Rhian August 12th, 2016 An archive photo of a Falcon 9 rocket inside the company’s Horizontal Integration Facility. JCSAT-16 is slated to launch Aug. 14, 2016, from Space Launch Complex 40. Photo Credit: SpaceX CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — With the year more than half over, SpaceX is ramping up launch operations at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) in Florida. Not one but two launches are planned between now and Sept. 3. While not as exciting as a mission to the International Space Station, these commercial flights are helping SpaceX demonstrate it can rapidly send payloads into orbit. The first flight, that of the JCSAT-16 telecommunications satellite, is currently set to take to the skies at 1:26 a.m. EDT (05:26 GMT) Aug. 14 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Space Station’s SLC-40. When the Space System Loral-built comm sat launches, it will mark the eighth mission this year carried out by Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX. Weather conditions currently provide an 80 percent chance of favorable conditions for launch. The primary weather concerns for this mission are cumulus and thick clouds. JCSAT-16, nearly identical to the JCSAT-14 satellite launched May 6, 2016, is seen during tests at Space Systems Loral. Photo Credit: Space Systems Loral This particular flight will mark the second time SpaceX has lofted a payload on behalf of Japanese Corporation Sky Perfect JSAT Corporation. The first was JCSAT-14, which launched May 6 of this year (2016). SpaceX has approximately two hours in which to launch the satellite. Once in orbit, JCSAT-16 will be controlled by the JSAT telecommunications firm. According to an article posted on NASASpaceFlight.com, JCSAT-16 is based on the SSL-1300 bus and was constructed by Space Systems Loral. According to a report appearing on Spaceflight Now, the satellite will serve as an on-orbit spare for the JCSAT fleet and is targeted to reside at 162 degrees east longitude in a geostationary orbit. It will employ its array of Ku and Ka-band transponders and antennas to provide communications services across Asia. In its role as a spare, the new spacecraft will work to serve as a back-up for JSAT’s Superbird B2 satellite (which was launched on an Ariane 4 booster in 2000). The launch vehicle successfully carried out a static hot fire test at approximately 11 p.m. EDT August 10 (03:00 GMT Aug. 11). This is the last major milestone that all of the roughly 229.6-foot (70-meter) tall Falcon rockets undergo before being sent aloft. The two-stage “Full Thrust” Falcon 9 is the latest version of SpaceX’s highly-successful rocket. First flown in 2010, the rocket has been modified to include capabilities no other in-service rocket has achieved in the nearly 60 years since the start of the Space Age. SpaceX stunned long-time space analysts on Dec. 22 of last year (and again on July 18, 2016) by having the first stage of the Falcon 9 conduct a controlled landing back at Cape Canaveral’s Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1, formerly Space Launch Complex 13). However, as any naval aviator will tell you, it is far more difficult to land on a moving platform out at sea – but this is something SpaceX has also become adept at achieving. The NewSpace firm has managed to have the first stage of its rocket land on what are known as Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ships (ASDS) three times so far. SpaceX is hoping that Sunday’s launch attempt will mark the fourth time the Of Course I Still Love You ASDS will transport another stage back to Port Canaveral. The company has stated it plans to reuse one of the flown stages as early as this fall (according to reports on Space.com and Space News). If and when SpaceX successfully demonstrates the ability fly pre-flown stages again, the paradigm and associated cost of launching payloads to orbit should drop significantly. An archive photo of the JCSAT-14 satellite prior to its encapsulation in the Falcon 9’s payload fairing. Photo Credit: SpaceX To date, only SpaceX has demonstrated the ability to return the first stage, and more importantly, the stage’s expensive nine Merlin 1D rocket engines back safely to Earth. The “Full Thrust” Falcon 9 has a mass of some 1,207,920 pounds (549,054 kilograms). Measuring an estimated 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter, the rocket is described by SpaceX as being able to send some 50,265 pounds (22,800 kilograms) to low-Earth orbit (LEO) or 18,300 pounds (8,300 kilograms) to a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). Nine Merlin 1D engines along with aluminum-lithium alloy tanks, which contain the launch vehicle’s liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellant, are incorporated into the Falcon 9’s first stage. According to SpaceX, the amount of thrust the Merlin 1Ds provide is more than what five Boeing 747s aircraft produce – at full power. The Falcon 9 is capable of producing an estimated 1.7 million pound-force (7,607 kilonewtons) of thrust at sea level and 1.85 million pound-force (8,227 kilonewtons) in vacuum. Flight computers ensure the rocket is in prime health before it is released from the pad and allowed to get the mission underway. After lifting off, the engines in the rocket’s first stage are throttled at the close of the stage’s flight. This is done so as to restrict the rocket’s acceleration as the Falcon 9’s mass diminishes with the burning of its fuel. While the flight of a comm sat might not seem all that important for the 14-year-old launch service provider, for SpaceX, JCSAT-16 should serve to increase a key metric for the company – its rate of launch. As noted, this will mark the eighth time a Falcon 9 has taken to the skies, either from the Cape or from Vandenberg Air Force Base’s Space Launch Complex 4E (East). Two flights, the CASSIOPE and Jason 3 missions, have launched from Vandenberg, with the remainder launching from the Cape’s SLC-40. SpaceX’s launch operations are also set to expand to Florida’s Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) in 2017 and the under-construction Boca Chica launch complex in Texas sometime in 2018. The company was looking to see the first flight of the NewSpace firm’s giant Falcon Heavy occur at LC-39A late this year. However, according to NASASpaceflight, that has been pushed to early 2017. Additionally, earlier plans had called for the SpaceX to conduct, sometime in 2016, an in-flight abort of their Crew Dragon spacecraft. However, last year, NASA announced this test would take place sometime after their first unpiloted test flight of the capsule – currently scheduled for May 2017. The abort test would utilize the same capsule used in the uncrewed test flight. After this weekend’s flight, next up for SpaceX is the Sept. 2 launch of the AMOS-6 satellite, which is being flown to provide broadband coverage to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The communications payload is built by Canadian-based company MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) and is being launched to replace the aging AMOS-2 satellite.

The company, based in Mountain View, California, plans to launch the small, 110-pound Prospector-1 spacecraft as part of their ambition to mine near-Earth asteroids, Grant Bonin, Deep Space Industries chief engineer, told Space.com. “This is intended to be a very low cost first commercial mission to an asteroid.” The mission is an important first step in the company’s plan to mine near-Earth asteroids for resources it can sell to other space-based companies. The small mining spacecraft is designed to visit asteroids and look for deposits of ice or water that other spacecraft could use as fuel. Every asteroid is different, so the space mining satellite will probably need to visit a few different space rocks before it finds one with the right minerals, Bonin told Space.com. “We’ve got about half a dozen very, very attractive targets, which as you might imagine we’re playing very close to our vest.” The Prospector-1 will launch into low-Earth orbit as a secondary payload aboard a space shuttle and then use its own fuel to break out of Earth’s orbit and head for deep space. It will use water as fuel to approach the selected asteroid and maintain its orbit around the space rock as it looks for ice deposits. The spacecraft will be equipped with infrared cameras and a neutron spectrometer it will use to map the asteroid’s surface and probe its interior. Then, it will attempt to land on the asteroid at a site likely to contain water so it can conduct additional experiments and claim the space rock for the private mining company. Deep Space Industries hasn’t announced specific mission dates yet as the timing will depend on which asteroid the company chooses to visit first, but it has promised to launch by the end of the decade, Bonin told SpaceNews. “We have mission concepts of operation that give us departure windows every year from 2019 to 2022.” Before that happens, the asteroid mining company will launch a technology demonstration mission using their Prospector-X spacecraft in 2017. Space Mining Company Unveils First Asteroid Prospecting Spacecraft For Interplanetary Mission 5 4 3 AsteroidMiningSpace Asteroid Mining Prospector Follow-up missions will use the water and ice extracted from asteroids as fuel to power other mining spacecraft and as a commodity to sell to other space travel companies, Bonin told SpaceNews. “Water is going to be a key enabler of the cislunar economy. It’s a grand vision, but it’s predicated on the use of space resources.” A number of companies plan to develop cislunar space, the area between the Earth and the moon commonly called low-Earth orbit, by creating a space transportation system. The plan, put forward by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co., involves using a form of water as fuel to dramatically cut down on the cost of space travel, ULA Spokesman George Sowers, told Space.com. “I want to buy propellant in space. Once I have a reusable stage and can buy my fuel, then I have the potential to dramatically lower costs to go elsewhere. I can potentially do that whole mission cheaper if I can get propellant cheap enough in low Earth orbit.” A rocket lifting off from Earth would only need to carry enough propellant to reach orbit if there was a gas station in space where it could refuel before continuing on its mission. The ULA venture envisions 1,000 people working in space by 2045. The plan involves mining the moon for valuable resources and construction of a lunar tanker to transport the minerals into orbit. The first private customer looking to buy space-mined resources and their budget for buying resources would set a standard that other space companies could use to develop their own operations. What do you think of Deep Space Industries plan to mine near-Earth asteroids for valuable resources?

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen As the Canadian government continues to come under fire for exports of armoured personnel carriers to countries like Saudi Arabia and South Sudan, our own military is looking to augment its capabilities with an entirely new type of ground vehicle. Story continues below Related Drug trafficking charge laid against Canadian Forces member Following in the footsteps of the American military, Canada has issued a call for tender for 52 new ultra-light combat vehicles, or ULCVs. READ MORE: Dion approved $11B in export permits for armoured vehicles destined for Saudi Arabia The ULCVs will be four-passenger, Jeep-like vehicles that are small and light enough to fit inside a Canadian Forces’ CC-177 Globemaster aircraft, a CC-130 Hercules aircraft or a CH-147 Chinook helicopter (or to be lifted externally by helicopter). According to the tender documents, published earlier this week, they must also be designed “to be air dropped with a 900 kg payload” from either the Globemaster or the Hercules, and detached/offloaded from the helicopter within five minutes. WATCH: Auditor General finds Canadian military struggling to recruit They need to be able to operate in extreme temperatures (-32C to +49C), handle a combination of urban and rural environments (mountainous, plains, jungle and woodland) and will be off-road 75 per cent of the time, the documents note. “The Department of National Defence (DND) will be using the ULCV as a complimentary vehicle to increase mobility across a spectrum of operations,” confirmed department spokesperson Ashley Lemire in an email to Global News. “The ULCV is a new type of vehicle and will be used in concert with the current fleet of DND ground vehicles to increase mobility on operations.” Increasing ground mobility The ULCV can be used for a variety of different missions and tasks, Lemire noted, extending the “tactical mobility needs” of troops in the field. In plain English, that could mean providing quick deployment into a hostile area, cutting down on the distance soldiers need to walk before reaching an active battle zone. The ULCVs may also give troops an easier entry and exit during reconnaissance or surveillance missions, and help avoid putting helicopters within the range of enemy fire that could shoot them down. “The range and maneuverability of (the) ULCV is an increase over portions of the current fleet of vehicles,” Lemire said. The call for tender notes that DND will have the option of adding 26 more vehicles to the total within two years. There are several possible options in terms of the model of ULCV Canada may acquire. U.S. defence firm Polaris could be a contender with its DAGOR model, as could aerospace giant Boeing with the Phantom Badger. The total cost of the new acquisition will depend on the bids received, but Polaris’ DAGOR models for example, run around US$150,000 apiece. That’s around CAD$194,000 at the current exchange rate. Tight timeline Much like their American counterparts, department officials are moving quickly to add ULCVs to the roster of available ground vehicles as the role of special operations groups becomes more prominent. Among other missions, Canadians special forces are currently carrying out training work in Iraq with local Kurdish troops fighting the so-called Islamic State. WATCH: PM Trudeau outlines Canada’s new role in fighting ISIS This week’s call for tender comes just under a year after an initial request for information, which went out last August, and the first 52 vehicles are expected to be delivered by Nov. 15, 2017. Asked if the American move to purchase a fleet of ULCVs prompted the Canadian tender, Lemire said that “while we must ensure our equipment remains compatible with other nations with whom we frequently work, the equipment we acquire must also meet the essential requirements … needed for the (Canadian Armed Forces) to achieve the missions assigned by the Government of Canada.” © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

On August 24th, a giant Ariane-5 rocket is scheduled to carry Intelsat-33e and Intelsat 36 into geostationary transfer orbit.  It will be Ariane’s overall sixth mission this year, and the fourth by the heavyweight Ariane rocket. Intelsat 33e – the first of the two payloads to arrive in French Guiana – has completed its initial checkout, and during preparations, was installed on the launch vehicle’s SYLDA dual-passenger dispenser system, and which automatically discharges the satellite from the rocket’s payload bay. The latter step was performed in the Spaceport’s Final Assembly Building and positions Intelsat 33e for the upper slot of Ariane 5’s payload arrangement. I-33e was built by Space Systems/Loral. As the second spacecraft of the next-generation Intelsat EpicNG series, Intelsat 33e – which was produced by Boeing – integrates one of the most advanced commercially-available digital payloads in the world. The first Intelsat EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e, was successfully delivered to geostationary transfer orbit on an Ariane 5 mission earlier this year in January.

Clinton said Trump has “made a career of stiffing small businesses from Atlantic City to Las Vegas.” On taxes, Clinton hit the pass-through part of Trump’s corporate tax reform plan as well as his proposal to end the inheritance tax and reduce the top rate to 33 percent: “He would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers. That would explode our national debt ... He’d pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families.” Story Continued Below She also sought to portray Trump’s vision of America as out-of-step with reality: “I just wish my opponent in this election saw the same Michigan I do. When Donald Trump visited Detroit on Monday, he talked only of failure, poverty, and crime. He’s missing so much.” WEAKEST POINT: TRADE — Clinton flip-flopped on TPP during her campaign against Bernie Sanders and her criticism of the deal still sounds like the worst kind of inauthentic pandering. Where she is strong: “[T]he answer is not to rant and rave — or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would kill even more jobs. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us. Where she isn’t: “So my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages — including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I’ll oppose it after the election, and I’ll oppose it as President." What’s missing here? Any explanation for how TPP would kill jobs and hold down wages. Perhaps Clinton’s transition from TPP as “gold standard” to TPP as unacceptable was a political necessity. But it’s still pretty pathetic to watch. CLINTON CAMPAIGN LETS TRUMP BE TRUMP — POLITICO’s Eli Stokols: “In what was billed as a major economic policy speech .. Clinton drew a sharp contrast between her plan and ... Trump’s — but she colored softly, content to do or say very little that would divert the media’s attention from her opponent. ... Clinton’s criticisms of the GOP nominee were notable in their cool, clipped delivery — not dripping with animosity or the urgency of a candidate in an actual fight. “It’s a deliberate strategy. As polls show Trump trailing by significant and widening margins in every swing state, the Democratic nominee and her team are eager to keep Clinton’s head down and allow American voters to watch Trump undercut his own economic agenda by spouting incendiary comments” http://politi.co/2bmld2t REACT — Bankrate’s Mark Hamrick: “Clinton clearly was trying to appeal to the sense of loss felt in Michigan and other areas historically reliant on manufacturing ... But it is unrealistic, and even misleading, to suggest their previous manufacturing strength can be restored.” The left loved the TPP stuff. Charles Chamberlain, Executive Director, Democracy for America: “In particular, the clear opposition ... voiced to the job-killing [TPP] ... is the strongest we've heard from her ... and will undoubtedly help build the support necessary to kill this miserable trade deal ... However, it's now more important than ever that the country and President Obama hear specifically from Secretary Clinton that a vote on the job-killing TPP during a lame duck session of Congress must not happen." MORE CLINTON TREASURY TALK — Per a former Treasury official: “It is important to think about whether Clinton sees Warren and Sanders' support for her Treasury Secretary pick as essential. Brainard is unlikely to be seen as any sort of give to the left. “She was central to pushing TPP and other big trade agreements going back decades. She kept China from being labeled as a currency manipulator. And she has done nothing at the Fed to push big banks to shrink. Clinton says regulators need to be tougher on big banks. If not Fed governors, who is she talking about?” Lew to stay on? Per MM’s mail bag: “I’ve heard rumblings about Dr. Brainard as well, but have also heard the Lew may stay on a while for continuity and one less nomination fight (esp if GOP keeps Senate)” TRUMP ADDS MORE ECON ADVISERS — Per release: “The newest additions to our economic team include, Diane Hendricks, Darlene Jordan, Betsy McCaughey, Brooke Rollins, Carla Sands, Anthony Scaramucci, Judy Shelton, Liz Uihlein, and Kathleen Hartnett White” Bios: http://bit.ly/2blTwXK MORE DONORS — POLITICO’s Shane Goldmacher: “[M]ore than half the additions have either already given Trump money or have pledged to help raise campaign cash for him and the Republican Party. One new addition, hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, contributed $100,000 to Trump's joint fundraising committee with the GOP, known as Trump Victory. Another, Carla Sands, hosted a multi-million-dollar fundraiser for Trump last month at her southern California home” http://politi.co/2b0b3DE GOP TO RNC: CUT OFF TRUMP MONEY — POLITICO’s Anna Palmer: “More than 70 Republicans have signed an open letter to [RNC] Chairman Reince Priebus urging him to stop spending any money to help ... Trump win in November and shift those contributions to Senate and House races. The letter comes as a number of Republican senators and high-profile GOP national security officials have come forward saying they cannot vote for Trump. “Former Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire and former Reps. Chris Shays of Connecticut, Tom Coleman of Missouri and Vin Weber of Minnesota are among the Republicans lending their name to the letter. Close to 20 of the co-signers are former RNC staffers” http://politi.co/2b1XQMu EMAILS KEEP DOGGING CLINTON — WSJ’s Peter Nicholas and Byron Tau: “The email controversy that ... Clinton hoped had died out when federal prosecutors closed their investigation last month now looks likely to shadow her campaign all the way through Election Day. Rolling releases of emails from Mrs. Clinton’s time as secretary of state, combined with her own failure to provide succinct, consistent answers on her email practices, have kept the issue simmering. .... “The drumbeat is undercutting Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy and hindering her efforts to seize fuller control of the presidential race by painting ... Trump as an unacceptable alternative. Last October, 42% of people polled said her use of a private email system while secretary of state was an ‘important factor’ in whether to vote for her, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed. A survey last month found that figure had jumped to 55%.” http://on.wsj.com/2aX62Pf TRUMP CONFRONTS LOSING — For CNBC, I looked at Trump’s comments about losing and going on a long vacation and asked the question: Does he really want to win?" http://cnb.cx/2aFH1sR GOOD FRIDAY MORNING — Last MM for me in August.

OLYMPICS BLAST — Yet more gold for Michael Phelps. But silver medal redemption for Aly Raisman and gold for the incredible Simone Biles really topped the day in Rio. What a pair of super stars. Yes MM shed a few tears when Raisman finished her floor exercise. We aren’t made of stone! Also incredible: Simone Manuel becoming the first African-American woman to win gold in an individual swimming event. What a moment. So proud. #USA http://bit.ly/2aPFsK4 TRUMP’S TAX CUT FOR TRUMP — WP’s Jim Tankersley: “A little-noticed provision in ... Trump’s tax reform plan has the potential to deliver a large tax cut to companies in the Republican presidential nominee’s vast business empire, experts say. Trump’s plan would dramatically reduce taxes on what is known in tax circles as ‘pass-through’ entities, which do not pay corporate income taxes, but whose owners are taxed at individual rates on their share of profits. “Those entities are the most common structure for small businesses and increasingly popular for larger ones as well. They are also a cornerstone of the Trump Organization. On his 2015 presidential financial disclosure report, Trump listed holdings of more than 200 limited liability corporations, which is a form of pass-through. ... [T]he provision highlights the tensions between Trump’s policy proposals and his personal financial interests. He would also benefit from his proposals to cut top income tax rates and eliminate federal taxes on inherited wealth” http://wapo.st/2b20aTK GOOGLE IS THE NEW GOLDMAN (IN D.C.) — Bloomberg View’s Justin Fox: “You remember ‘Government Sachs,’ right? It’s the nickname that gained currency during the financial crisis for the Wall Street firm and its alumni, who seemed to occupy every crucial position in Washington. Well, now there’s Govergle. Or maybe it’s Googlement. Alphament, anyone? ... Google/Alphabet’s annual spending on lobbying, for example, went from less than $1 million a decade ago to $16.7 million in 2015, putting it behind only Boeing and General Electric ... “But there is also a weirdly tight relationship between the company and the Obama administration. Since Obama took office in January 2009, at least 250 people have left Google and related companies for jobs in the administration or vice versa. Oh, and in 2012 Schmidt actually helped recruit the Obama campaign technology team and spent election night in the campaign 'boiler room' in Chicago” http://bloom.bg/2bmCdpl NO TAX TRUMP? — NYT’s James B. Stewart: “Mitt Romney was excoriated during the 2012 presidential campaign for paying $4.9 million in federal income tax, or an average of just 14 percent of his adjusted gross income, in the two years for which he released returns. No one should be surprised, though, if Trump has paid far less — perhaps even zero federal income tax in some years. Indeed, that’s the expectation of numerous real estate and tax professionals I’ve interviewed in recent weeks. “Even with hundreds of millions in gross revenue from his vast real estate empire, ‘it’s both possible and legal that Donald Trump would pay little or no income tax,’ said Len Green, an accountant and chairman of the Green Group, a tax and accounting advisory firm. ... ‘I would expect he’s paying little or no tax,’ agreed Steven M. Rosenthal, a veteran tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy center.” http://nyti.ms/2b16WHm STOCKS PARTY LIKE IT’S 1999 — WSJ’s Corrie Driebusch and Aaron Kuriloff: “A troika of stock indexes hit highs in tandem for the first time since 1999. The question is whether the party is just getting started. On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all rose to new highs on the same day, an alignment that hasn’t occurred since Dec. 31, 1999. ... “The Dow is up 6.8% this year, the S&P 6.9% and the Nasdaq Composite 4.4%. For some traders, the trend suggests stocks could enjoy a sudden surge. The bump could happen once investors return from summer vacations and begin taking some cash off the sidelines, they say. U.S. stock-trading volumes have been below the 2016 average in recent weeks. The consensus one-year target for the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now more than 20000” http://on.wsj.com/2aKJFJu MACY TO SHUTTER 100 STORES — NYT’s Rachel Abrams and Sapna Maheshwari: “The great American consumer is very much alive. It’s just that people aren’t shopping like they used to, reluctant to pay full price or even leave the couch ... For legacy stores, the fallout from this shift has been profound, perhaps never more apparent than this week. Macy’s, the country’s largest department store, said on Thursday that it would close 100 stores, saying they were more valuable as real estate properties. “Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, announced on Monday that it would buy a small online rival for more than $3 billion. The hope is that the deal will reverse its sputtering online growth. Other retailers have taken aggressive action, too, trying to turn their fortunes around. Billions of dollars have been poured into e-commerce efforts. Stores have turned to sharp discounting, temporarily lifting sales but hurting profits and upsetting partners. But almost always, these efforts have led to mediocre results” http://nyti.ms/2aFFraj BANK LAWYER FIRED OF FANNIE MAE RELATIONSHIP — FT’s Ben McLannahan: “The largest bank in Ohio fired its top lawyer last month after she said she was in a romantic relationship with the chief executive of Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage company — who has been allowed to keep his job. The case highlights differing views of the best way to handle relationships between executives at connected companies. “Like many banks in the US, Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp has a big business supplying Fannie Mae and its sibling company, Freddie Mac, with mortgages that are later bundled into securities guaranteed by the government. When Timothy Mayopoulos, chief executive of Fannie Mae, told an internal office of compliance and ethics in March that he was in a relationship with Heather Russell, former chief legal officer at Fifth Third, his employer had no problem with it ... But Fifth Third considered the relationship represented ‘a conflict of interest’” http://on.ft.com/2aPjofP CHINA FALTERS — Bloomberg: “China’s recent economic stabilization faltered in July as factory output, retail sales and investment all slowed. Industrial production rose 6 percent from a year earlier in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. Retail sales climbed 10.2 percent last month, while fixed-asset investment increased 8.1 percent in the first seven months of the year. All three readings missed economists estimates. “Bloomberg’s monthly gross domestic product tracker slipped to 6.94 percent in July, from 7.13 percent a month earlier. The slowdown sharpens the dilemma facing the nation’s policy makers — boost growth with cheap credit that risks undermining financial stability, or curb debt expansion even if that slows the economy.” http://bloom.bg/2b19zsY Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg View on the coming retirement crisis: “With interest rates extremely low and the prices of stocks and bonds at historic highs, finding safe investments that can help guarantee a comfortable retirement has become increasingly difficult. “This has put the managers of pension funds and other institutions that invest on behalf of future retirees in a difficult position, driving them to take ever greater risks in hopes of meeting their performance objectives — targets that are unlikely to be met absent a major revamp of economic policies and corporate prospects. As a result, individuals are increasingly being exposed to the threat of losses that can not be recouped quickly” TIME FOR BETTER ONLINE LENDING DISCLOSURE — Brayden McCarthy in an American Banker op-ed: “Since 2000, the so-called Schumer box has been to credit cards what nutrition labels are to food. Instead of listing calorie and carbohydrate counts, the summary table requires disclosure of basic numbers like the interest rate and annual fee at the top of credit card solicitations. ... Yet when that same consumer applies for a small-business loan, he or she is left in the dark.” http://bit.ly/2blM29L « View Archives Authors: Ben White bwhite@politico.com @morningmoneyben About The Author Ben White is POLITICO Pro's chief economic correspondent and author of the “Morning Money” column covering the nexus of finance and public policy.

New payload preparation milestones bring Ariane 5's upcoming mission closer to liftoff by Staff Writers Kourou, French Guiana (ESA) Aug 12, 2016 File image. The two satellite passengers for Ariane 5's August 24 flight - both of which will be orbited at the service of global operator Intelsat - are advancing through their payload preparation phases during parallel activity at the Spaceport in French Guiana. Designated Flight VA232 in Arianespace's numbering system, the upcoming mission will loft Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 to geostationary transfer orbit. It is scheduled as the company's sixth launch to be performed in 2016, as well as the fourth this year using a heavy-lift Ariane 5. Arianespace's full launcher family is rounded out by the medium-weight Soyuz and light-lift Vega. Intelsat 33e - the first of the two payloads to arrive in French Guiana - has completed its initial checkout, and during preparations carried out yesterday, was installed on the launch vehicle's SYLDA dual-passenger dispenser system. The latter step was performed in the Spaceport's Final Assembly Building and positions Intelsat 33e for the upper slot of Ariane 5's payload arrangement. As the second spacecraft of the next-generation Intelsat EpicNG series, Intelsat 33e - which was produced by Boeing - integrates one of the most advanced commercially-available digital payloads in the world. The first Intelsat EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e, was successfully delivered to geostationary transfer orbit on an Ariane 5 mission performed in January. Flight VA232's Intelsat 36 co-passenger marked an important pre-launch milestone of its own yesterday with the loading of onboard propellant, which occurred in the S5A hall of the Spaceport's S5 payload preparation facility. Following its upcoming transfer to the Final Assembly Building, this spacecraft will be integrated as the August 24 mission's lower payload. Built by SSL (Space Systems Loral), Intelsat 36 will enhance Intelsat's premier direct-to-home neighborhood in Africa after reaching its final orbital position.

State Dept. approves $231 million munitions sale to NATO countries by Geoff Ziezulewicz Washington (UPI) Aug 11, 2016 disclaimer: image is for illustration purposes only The U.S. State Department has approved the proposed sale of $231 million in guided munitions to several European countries. Required notification was sent to Congress on Tuesday, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, said in a statement Thursday. NATO's support and procurement agency requested the sale, which includes equipment and support, on behalf of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain. The order includes 2,040 joint direct attack munition guidance kits of various iterations, as well as computer control groups, joint programmable fuzes and bomb fin assembly and airfoil groups. Also included in the deal would be laser sensors, proximity sensors, avionics kit interfaces, electronic bomb fuzes, repair and return services, transportation, engineering services and other support services. The sale would improve NATO members' ability to meet current and future ground threats and provide a deterrent to regional threats, the agency said. Boeing Corporation and Raytheon Missile Systems would be the prime production contractors. Swedish military orders Carl-Gustaf ammunition Linkoping, Sweden (UPI) Aug 11, 2016 - Sweden's Defense Material Administration has tapped Saab for the supply of ammunition for the Carl-Gustaf recoilless rifle. The ammunition, in a variety of types, will be delivered next year and is worth more than $14.3 million. "With this order, of both live and training ammunition, the Swedish Armed Forces continues its efforts to increase the capability of its army on the battlefield. The order is definitely a strong proof of the customer's trust in the system and in Saab as a supplier," said Gorgen Johansson, head of Saab's Dynamics business area. The Carl-Gustaf is an 84mm anti-tank that was originally introduced in 1948. Its modern version is used in anti-armor warfare as well as for clearing obstacles and engaging enemies in buildings. Additional details of the Swedish military order were not disclosed.

Showbiz Celebrity News Margot Robbie to play tragic trapeze artist Lillian Leitzel in Queen of the Air The actress is no stranger to acrobatics having received her “trapeze certificate” aged eight Emma Powell Friday 12 August 2016 09:28 BST New role: Margot Robbie will show off her circus skills Dave Benett Margot Robbie will play a trapeze artist in new film, Queen of the Air. The Australian actress has been cast as tragic circus star Lillian Leitzel in the film adaptation of Dean N. Jensen’s 2013 nonfiction book of the same name. The film will follow Leitzel’s volatile love affair with fellow acrobat Alfredo Codona up until their deaths. Leitzel was an acrobatic sensation in the 1920s who was famed for her signature move, the one arm plange. Read more 8 reasons why we want to be best friends with Margot Robbie At 4 foot 9 inches tall, she would turn up to 100 times and dislocate her shoulder at every turn. Leitzel – who was the first inductee into the International Circus Hall of Fame – died during a live performance in 1931 when her rigging snapped. Cat Vasko is penning the script while Andrew Lazar of American Sniper fame will produce. It is not yet know who will direct the film. Robbie is no stranger to acrobatics. The actress attended circus school as a child and received her “trapeze certificate” when she was eight. She most recently showed off her aerial maneuvers in David Ayer’s Suicide Squad as the fantastically psychotic anti-hero Harley Quinn. She starred alongside Will Smith, Cara Delevingne and Jared Leto - who played her love interest, The Joker.

Australian MH370 search agency secretly removes "death dive" theory from website But on Friday, independent investigators noticed the ATSB had withdrawn the claim from its website without explanation. FAMAGUSTA GAZETTE� The Australian government agency in charge of the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370 has reportedly secretly retracted a published theory that the plane slammed into the sea after a "death dive." Earlier this week, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said it was unlikely the plane's captain glided the plane into the sea, and instead said engine failure due to lack of fuel had sparked a sudden "death dive" into the southern Indian Ocean. ATSB chief commissioner Greg Hood told The Australian newspaper that his agency had come to a consensus with a number of other agencies about the theory, including aircraft manufacturer Boeing, the U.S. National Transport Safety Board and the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation. At the time, he said analysis of satellite data by Defence Department scientists concluded the plane made a sudden and rapid descent at more than 10 times the usual descent rate. But on Friday, independent investigators noticed the ATSB had withdrawn the claim from its website without explanation. Richard Godfrey from an independent group of MH370 expert observers told News Corp that he noticed the "consensus" claim had been deleted after it was picked up by computer tracker. Godfrey said the deletion of the consensus theory could mean that not all experts on the strategy group agree with the "death dive" consensus. "Another possibility is that it was assumed there was a consensus, but then some party complained and the published report had to be changed," he said. MH370 was carrying 239 passengers and crew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it disappeared on March 8, 2014. � (Xinhua) Sitemap { powered by bulletlink.com }

But with commercial deployment still a way off, it’s also starting to look less than unique. The project’s chief technologist, Chris Urmson, departed last week, the latest in a parade of talent to abandon the effort, which began in 2009 inside the Google X lab—now called just X and a subsidiary of the Alphabet holding company created to separate Google’s core business from its other projects last year. Alphabet and others that invested early in autonomous driving, such as Tesla Motors, have seen senior staff leave as competitors ranging from large automakers to Apple to well-funded startups have built up serious autonomous-car projects of their own. “Others have been catching up to Alphabet; I wouldn’t say they’re running away with it anymore,” says Quin Garcia, managing director of Autotech Ventures, a Palo Alto investment firm focused on transportation startups. “Investors and corporations are willing to put big money into developing that technology.” Recent advances in machine learning have made it easier to cover ground that took Alphabet's project years, says Garcia. And experienced engineers such as Urmson can be sure of strong backing even if they decide to go it alone, he says. (Urmson said in a blog post last week that he doesn’t have a new project lined up.) The $581 million General Motors spent earlier this year to acquire Cruise, a startup working on automated driving, has stoked confidence among entrepreneurs and investors that competing with Alphabet can be viable. One founding member of Google’s original autonomous-driving project, Anthony Levandowski, left the company in January. In May he launched Otto, a San Francisco startup working on autonomous driving for trucks. The company has already modified trucks to drive themselves in tests on California freeways. Otto has more than 60 employees, according to LinkedIn, including several veterans of Alphabet’s and Tesla’s autonomous-driving teams. Alphabet’s other competition includes Zoox, a startup based in Menlo Park, California, that is working on an autonomous vehicle intended to be used for a driverless taxi service. A June filing shows that Zoox has received $100 million in funding, and Business Insider reports it is set to double that figure. One reason investors are backing self-driving startups is a belief that despite Alphabet’s early lead, the company is not well positioned to commercialize the technology. The project’s leaders have said they are only interested in cars that can handle every type of driving without human supervision. To that end, they are developing cars that lack steering wheels and brake pedals for a human to ever use. And Alphabet wants to license its technology to a car manufacturer rather than make cars itself. Last year the former head of Hyundai’s American division, John Krafcik, was appointed as the project’s CEO. That strategy faces two big challenges, says Robert Seidl, managing director at Motus Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on transportation. For one, “car companies don’t trust Google,” he says. “They don’t want to be left just bending metal and getting the low-margin part of the business.” And second, says Seidl, neither Alphabet nor the automakers are in a good position to launch a fleet of robotic taxis, which he and other investors argue would be the most plausible way to make money with fully autonomous vehicles. An on-demand ride service could quickly recoup the cost of developing and manufacturing the cars by putting them to work for many hours a day, says Seidl. A robot car service could also be viable even if its vehicles were limited to operating in a certain area, he says. Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on detailed 3-D maps that must be kept up to date, so releasing a consumer car capable of driving anywhere would be a big challenge. Urmson said at MIT Technology Review’s EmTech Digital conference in May that he expected Alphabet's vehicles to come to certain urban pockets first. Shahin Farshchi, a partner at the venture firm Lux Capital in Menlo Park, which invested in Zoox, says that neither a company built around answering Web searches nor one that specializes in selling cars for private use is likely to build out a good transportation service. “The notion of Toyota and Honda going into the autonomous-transport business is like saying Boeing and Airbus are going to be effective as airlines,” says Farshchi. (GM’s decision to invest $500 million into Uber competitor Lyft and work on a trial of self-driving ride service could be recognition of that challenge; Alphabet has a stake in Uber, but the ride-sharing company is aggressively pursuing its own self-driving technology.) By insisting on waiting until fully autonomous passenger vehicles are ready, Alphabet could also miss a chance to capitalize on the early years of the technology’s emergence. Meanwhile, other companies could make money from selling self-driving technology for, say, highway driving, which is simple compared with getting a vehicle to cope with complex urban situations (see “Driverless Cars Are Further Away Than You Think”). Other companies, including Otto and Tesla, believe it’s possible to offer automated features for private or commercial driving—features that work only some of the time. Urmson has been a vocal critic of the idea that partial automation is safe, saying that Google employees loaned self-driving prototypes in 2012 quickly became dangerously trusting of them (see “Lazy Humans Shaped Google’s New Autonomous Car”). He has also said Alphabet’s project is closer to being road-ready than some may think. At EmTech Digital in May he repeated his frequent claim that he was aiming to make it unnecessary for his son to get a driver’s license. That would mean Alphabet’s cars will hit the road in 2020. Whether he still believes that, or whether those cars will have to share the road with other self-driving vehicles created with Urmson’s help, is unclear.

A pair of F-35 stealth fighters roared into British Columbia on Thursday in preparation for the annual Abbotsford International Airshow. The next-generation aircraft, whose development has been marred with delays and cost overruns, has been the source of ongoing angst in Ottawa as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government grapples with finding a replacement for the country’s long-outdated fighter jets. Trudeau told the House of Commons in June that the F-35 “does not work and is far from working,” two months before a surprise announcement last week that the aircraft is ready for combat. Lt.-Col. George Watkins, a pilot with the U.S. air force’s 34th Fighter Squadron, flew one of two operational planes to B.C. from Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Speaking on the tarmac in front of one of the aircraft, he described flying the F-35 as “awesome.” “I’m very confident in the combat declaration that we made, combat ready,” Watkins said. “Being a combat commander in a fighter squadron, I personally wouldn’t go to war with any other jet beside the F-35 right now. The stealth technology and the advanced radar and the threat detection system makes me more capable so I can strike first and it makes it so that my pilots are more survivable in war time.” The federal Liberal government promised during last year’s election campaign that it would hold an open competition to replace Canada’s aging CF-18 fleet, but it also pledged not to buy the F-35. Former prime minister Stephen Harper said in 2010 Canada would buy 64 of the stealth fighters, a commitment that was derailed when the Liberals came to power last year. Lockheed Martin, the U.S.-based defence contractor overseeing the F-35’s development, has since asked the Canadian government for the chance to compete in an open and fair competition to provide the next generation of airplanes to Canada’s military. Still, the federal government paid more than $30 million earlier this year to remain part of a consortium of nine countries backing the development of the fifth-generation aircraft. Canada has contributed more than $311 million to the group, which ensures it an eventual discount to buy the jet as well as access in the meantime to lucrative development contracts. The government said Canadian companies have received US$812 million in contracts since Canada’s first F-35 payment in 1997. The rival aircraft vying to become Canada’s next fighter jet is Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, which was also scheduled to make an appearance at Abbotsford’s air show. A published report earlier this year said the Liberals had decided to purchase the Super Hornet as an interim measure to buy time for landing on a long-term fix for the Air Force. That prompted an outcry from the Opposition Conservatives over what they described as a rigged process that allowed Boeing to “jump the queue.” Canada bought its current fleet of CF-18s in the 1980s. The jets were designed to last 20 years, but the former Conservative government opted to spend $400 million to overhaul the fleet to keep the 77 aircraft in operation until at least 2025.

Every day. Wherever you are. Download our app here Show comments Hide comments (3) Controversial F-35 jets make an appearance at B.C. air show Trudeau’s pledge not to allow F-35 in a competition was illegal. The PM just can’t disqualify a firm from competing for a major contract “cause”, “cause Harper is for it” or “cause it polled well”. This is why they’ve now discovered how urgent an “interim” fighter is. If equipment is needed urgently different rules apply. If we will shortly have a “capability gap” then sole sourcing may be lawful. Just to make sure we don’t have NAFTA problems the GOC says it wants to but Boeing Super Hornets. That “gap” is false. A lie to cover a illegal campaign promise. A F-35A with an engine now costs about $ 153 million CAD. Lockheed says the price will come down by 2019 but will still be huge. That’s a lot and operating costs are likely to be higher than the competition. If we had a competition and the F-35 competition was substantially less expensive and performed the tasks listed in a fairly written Statement of Requirements (a stretch given the pull from the GOC and the air force to write the SOR so that their preferred candidate wins) then by all means buy it. The way we’re going will result in a massive law suit we will lose. For example we’ll probably get stuck with a ~ $160 million penalty for mischief involved in the recent army truck buy. A similar penalty for fighters would be over $ 3 billion. Reply ↓ Michael Shannon on August 11, 2016 at 10:33 pm It’s easy to get out of the F35 contract, and we should. Requirements have changed, drastically. The latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) now bests human pilots, and ‘best’ is being nice to the humans. Even if the AI (named ALPHA, look it up) is flying a deliberately crippled aircraft (at this point simulated… don’t want these things flying around in real planes yet), it still stands a good chance of wining against top-gun humans. Oh, and the best part about this… the code runs on a Raspberry Pi. This isn’t IBM’s Watson were talking about here… it’s $35 for the real deal, and Chinese clones are cheaper. The university researchers that did this (UC’s Ernest and Cohen) published a paper with enough information on their process that others will be able to follow their lead. Human pilots are done. Seriously, this is a game-changing event. By the time we had a fleet of operational F35 fighters, Bombardier could probably build a fleet of UCAVs to take them out. The best approach right now is, if necessary, buying a few of the newer F18Es that we could integrate into the existing fleet. Just enough to keep the Americans happy. Just enough to tide us over before the UCAV arms race settles down to a predictable level. I understand how impressed the pilots are that get to fly the F35… but, sorry, you’re being automated out of a job, soon. If it’s any consolation, so are the truck drivers, and the taxi drivers, and the… Reply ↓ David English on August 12, 2016 at 2:46 am There is no contract to buy F-35s. There never was. One of the problems the Tories inflicted on themselves was saying there was when there was not. What the “requirements” are as stated in the final SOR will be contentious. Beyond the ability to replicate what a CF-18 does t’s a matter of opinion what they should be. The air force will want “stealth” to be included and the LPC will not.

The facts as they are Local News Reports OP-ED Political Analysis Business Lifestyle In The Media Reports Our Yemen war: The U.S. plays a quiet role in a heinous conflict 3 months ago by NY Staff Written by NY Staff Post Gazette — Yemen peace talks have dead-ended for the moment. U.S.-supported Saudi Arabian and other bombing of Yemeni sites, including the capital, Sana, resumed Tuesday, with lethal results. The multiparty Yemen civil war, with substantial international involvement, has continued for 15 months now, with thousands of casualties from the fighting and particularly the bombing, but also taking a high toll among the civilians of this poorest of Middle Eastern states. It pits Houthi Shiite Muslim rebels, backed to a degree by predominantly Shiite Iran, supported by Sunni Muslim supporters of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, against the Sunni Muslim government of Yemen President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Sunni states of the Persian Gulf. Yemen peace talks have dead-ended for the moment. U.S.-supported Saudi Arabian and other bombing of Yemeni sites, including the capital, Sana, resumed Tuesday, with lethal results. The multiparty Yemen civil war, with substantial international involvement, has continued for 15 months now, with thousands of casualties from the fighting and particularly the bombing, but also taking a high toll among the civilians of this poorest of Middle Eastern states. It pits Houthi Shiite Muslim rebels, backed to a degree by predominantly Shiite Iran, supported by Sunni Muslim supporters of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, against the Sunni Muslim government of Yemen President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Sunni states of the Persian Gulf. These are led by Saudi Arabia and include Bahrain, Egypt, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates. What the list leaves out is that the United States provides technical and intelligence support to the Sunni side, based in part on the fact that the air forces of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states were largely sold to them by American companies, including McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. It is unlikely that Saudi Arabia could put these warplanes in the air to bomb Yemen without substantial U.S. assistance. Washington declines to say whether there are ever U.S. co-pilots in the aircraft. There were peace talks involving the parties to the conflict under the auspices of the United Nations underway in Kuwait for the past nine weeks, but these have now collapsed, without success, at least for the moment. The United States has not promoted the talks, reflecting Saudi lack of enthusiasm for an end to the conflict without victory for its side. This approach to a brutal intra-Islamic war is an unacceptable policy position for the United States to take. President Barack Obama should weigh in with a strong initiative to resume the Yemen peace talks on an urgent basis and to pursue them to a successful close, for humanitarian as well as political reasons. If the Saudis are perceived to be dragging their feet, Washington should threaten to cut off U.S. support of their bombing in Yemen. Commercial commitments do not provide a sufficient argument for the perpetuation of the war and the continued killing of Yemenis through U.S.-supported bombing.

NASA announced yesterday that it will partner with six private companies to refine deep space habitation solutions in advance of a possible Mars mission.  By Christina Beck, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. Boeing/NASA View Caption About video ads View Caption of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has its sights set far beyond the moon, toward the mysteries of deep space. NASA announced Tuesday that as its mission objectives expand to human exploration of deep space, including planned missions to an asteroid in 2025, and Mars by 2030, it is working together with six US companies to help develop deep space habitats to support human exploration. “NASA is increasingly embracing public-private partnerships to expand capabilities, and opportunities in space,” said director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems (AES), Jason Crusan, in a NASA press release when the program was first announced in 2015. “Our NextSTEP partners commit their own corporate resources toward the development – making them a true partner in the spaceflight economy.” Recommended: How well do you know the moon? Take our quiz! NASA announced NextSTEP in May, 2015 , in a Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) Broad Agency Announcement. NASA later selected 12 projects to help innovate deep space solutions, including advanced propulsion, habitation, and small satellite projects. Test your knowledge How well do you know the moon? Take our quiz! Infographic Space Race, The Sequel: Who is exploring the cosmos today? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Now, NASA has chosen six project proposals out of all the applications it received for the NextSTEP habitation project. It will be working with these six companies to innovate deep space habitation solutions in anticipation of a mission to Mars within the next few decades. The deep space habitats will be tested in an area near the moon, a “proving ground” before the planned mission to Mars, according to NASA scientists. Habitats will include features such as docking capabilities for spacecraft, life support systems, fire safety mechanisms, crew health capabilities, and radiation monitoring, among others, according to a NASA blog post. Once the habitats are constructed, NASA says, it will be able to test how the many systems involved (including airlocks, docking systems, etc.) function, and how they will function in deep space. Each of the six companies will work on a slightly different product. One of the most recognizable names, Boeing, has already worked on systems in use at the International Space System. The company says that it will use this experience to guide the creation of its habitat, which will include, “the production of a full-scale habitat that will provide design analysis and high-fidelity demonstration and test capability to simulate how humans can safely live and work in deep space for extended periods of time.” Lockheed Martin, another private company well known for its involvement in space technology innovation, plans to refurbish an existing multi-purpose logistics module. Orbital ATK also plans to work off an existing product, its initial cislunar habitat concept, based off the company’s Cygnus craft. Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems plans to modify its own Dream Chaser module and combine it with an inflatable fabric module and life support systems, while Bigelow Airspace LLC plans to develop a 330-cubic-meter inflatable habitat called the XBASE. According to NASA, “the testing conducted on this platform will advance approaches for deep space missions and serve as a basis for commercialization in low-Earth orbit.” Finally, lesser known Texas company NanoRacks plans to modify an existing launch vehicle’s second stage to convert into a habitat, which it says could be a low cost habitat solution. NASA says that these habitat plans will help inform the space agency’s approach to planned deep space explorations. “The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment utilizing SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles,” wrote NASA in a blog post. “In addition to U.S. Industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable a robust fully operational deep space habitation capability."

At Large In Ballard: Finished Lives 08/11/2016 It’s the stories. For the final stage of Ballard Historical Society’s Mapping Historic Ballard project volunteers have researched and provided background material on just 150 properties out of hundreds with historic value. I volunteered as one of 15 researchers to do a single one. Flash forward three months (two since targeted completion) and it’s down to Sue Cromarty, mapper and researcher extraordinaire, and me. We are hooked on piecing together lives. I’ve always loved crossword puzzles and acrostics. Trying to fit together the clues assembled by the volunteers who scanned and uploaded all the property cards and photographs is rewarded by what they reveal: the lives, loves and losses of those who lived in the apartment above the corner grocery, the Mench house, the pharmacy that was replaced by the telephone exchange building. I was hooked on my first property, the Grankull’s home on NW 70th. While turning over clues like game cards…fee owner on the side sewer card, name on the census with address, I learned the death card is usually first. Once I’d matched a resident to an obituary I worked backwards to birth of children, marriage, engagement, drunk driving (mostly confined to fishermen who boarded where I live now), resident by resident, owner by owner. Plying the Seattle Public Library’s special collections I did all my sleuthing from home, blowing up census pages and city directories, submitting and re-submitting variations of street names and possible residents to the 1895-present archives of the Seattle (Daily) Times. I found valor in Donald Billington of 7042 18th NW, stationed aboard the Pennsylvania at Pearl Harbor who served 25 months in the South Pacific. Forty years later the homeowner was a Seattle teacher on strike. I tracked children from birth to fishing derbies, through graduation and marriage. I read of service pins awarded for 50 years of service, to the city, to a bank, to a business. There was an invalid wife and a brother who died while waiting for the bus to work. Always the community club elections, the decorating contests, the Elks and the Odd Fellows. Photographers in a dark room hold their paper in a chemical bath waiting for images to appear. That’s what it’s like hoping a square preview will surface on a blank screen meaning the combination of name and address has yielded a result. Then waiting as whatever magic exists between our homes and scanned, old newsprint takes form in front of me, peering at the tiny print to see if it’s just a false lead, a Nelson born too soon or too late. Finding Percy C. Sankey, Ballard merchant, helping to avert a garbage strike and his son Percy D. working for the City of Seattle for 46 years. Obsession is the only word. Ignoring the clock I feel that I have to knit the family back together before I can go to bed. Who was Mrs. Betty Cox who suddenly appeared in the household? Ah, it’s the daughter Elizabeth married at 19, divorced at 22, later remarried and in her own home. There’s her father’s long service as a railway man and mention of his collection of train photographs. Am I trying to drown out today’s news by reading the articles that flank those written in 1920, 1945, 1966? I look at grainy wedding photos and download an obituary that tickles my fancy with the headline, “Former Writer…” Friends bought a house in West Seattle and feeling like a magician, a librarian wannabe, I found part of their first home’s past, a mountain-climbing man, President of the Seattle Outdoors Good Manners Association. He railed against thoughtless hikers in a newspaper story titled, “Wreckreationists.” They want to frame the article. An archeologist without dirt, a genealogist for families I’ve never met. I may be the last to finish but so many other volunteers have been winding their way through Ballard’s past as well, watching the sons and daughters marry and move closer to Boeing, south to Renton and north to Everett. Making new of the old is very satisfying. Volunteer Mia Hannula ventured to the downtown construction files and emerged with a French Canadian widow whose daughter Valencia married Lem Fong Chin. Valencia was herself widowed and later remarried, but she lived on 19th NW for 50 years of her adult life, first with her mother and siblings, and then her husband and children. I started with Arthur and Hilda Grankull, both from Finland who lived on Seaview and then moved up to a new corner home on 70th NW in 1930. They were in their home 50 years, until their deaths. I want to award them 50-year pins. So when I found a family who lived around the corner, a Norwegian (Cornelius) married to a Swede (Hannah), I reveled in the names of the four Asmervig daughters, Mathilda, Eugenia, Selma and Delia. Mathilda married Chester Walling, who’d served in World War I. Their entire married life, during his 46 years with Seattle Transit and on into retirement they lived in a beautiful home near Sunset Hill Park. After their deaths her sister Mrs. Eugenia Roo was the one who sold the home to its current, and only second owners. This strikes me as a happy ending to finished lives, which may be at the root of any present, and former, writer’s obsession.

Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement, Appendix A, NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions, NASA's official website reported. The selected companies are: Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas Boeing of Pasadena, Texas Lockheed Martin of Denver Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems of Louisville, Colorado NanoRacks of Webster, Texas Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our Journey to Mars.  “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The contract award amounts are dependent on contract negotiations, and NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK.  This round of NextSTEP selections are part of a phased approach that will catalyze commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects, such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment using SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles. In addition to U.S. industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable fully operational deep space habitation capability.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: August 11th, 2016 >> Story Satnews Daily August 11th, 2016 Prepping For The Push Continues For Arianespace Flight VA232 Preparations continue for Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 and their launch to orbit by Arianespace aboard an Ariane 5 on August 4th. These two satellites are advancing through their payload preparation phases during parallel activity at the Spaceport in French Guiana. Designated Flight VA232 in Arianespace's numbering system, this will be the company's sixth launch to be performed in 2016 as well as the fourth this year using a heavy-lift Ariane 5. Arianespace's full launcher family is rounded out by the medium-weight Soyuz and light-lift Vega. The latest payload preparations for Ariane 5’s Flight VA232 are captured above. In the photo at left, Intelsat 33e is shown being lowered for integration atop the SYLDA dual-passenger dispenser system; while at right, the Intelsat 36 co-passenger is “topped off” with its onboard propellant. Photos are courtesy of Arianespace. Intelsat 33e—the first of the two payloads to arrive in French Guiana—has completed initial checkout and, during preparations that have been successfully completed, the satellite was installed on the launch vehicle's SYLDA dual-passenger dispenser system. The latter step was performed in the Spaceport's Final Assembly Building and positions Intelsat 33e for the upper slot of Ariane 5's payload arrangement. As the second spacecraft of the nexgen Intelsat EpicNG series, Intelsat 33e—which was produced by Boeing—integrates one of the most advanced commercially-available digital payloads in the world. The first Intelsat EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e, was successfully delivered to geostationary transfer orbit on an Ariane 5 mission performed in January. Flight VA232's Intelsat 36 co-passenger also marked an important pre-launch milestone with the loading of the onboard propellant. This event occurred in the S5A hall of the Spaceport's S5 payload preparation facility. Following the satellite's upcoming transfer to the Final Assembly Building, Intelsat 36 will be integrated as the August 24 mission's lower payload. Built by SSL (Space Systems Loral), Intelsat 36 will enhance Intelsat's premier DTH neighborhood in Africa after reaching the final orbital position. www.arianespace.com Topical Tags :  Events    Launch    Satellite Operator    Service Provider          Regional Tags :  Europe    South/Central America                 FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News SWOT's Up With NASA & SpaceX?

The FAA has been open to granting permits to private companies to travel into space for several years now. NASA has been working with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to deliver supplies to the space station. NASA is also working in conjunction with SpaceX to facilitate the exploration and colonization of Mars. Musk has a goal to take humans to live on Mars in about ten years. It is hoped that cooperation between various corporations and NASA will lead to the colonization of Mars by 2025. NASA is building partnerships with several commercial industry corporations including ULA Orbital/ATK and many others through programs called NextSTEP and NextSTEP 2, in order to advance the rapid development of propulsion, habitats, satellites and more. Selected companies are working in partnership with NASA, developing the technology needed for mankind to probe deep space. They will be focusing on both Mars and the space around the moon. Elon Musk of SpaceX has the goal of beginning the colonization of Mars in the next decade. He plans to make commercial space travel and colonization a reality in his lifetime, according to The Washington Post. Mr. Musk is the mastermind behind both Tesla and SpaceX. He is one of the most brilliant minds of our time. An innovator and businessman, Elon has a track record of making dreams a reality and turning his plans into tangible results. Comparing his project to the colonization of America, Mr. Musk explains why he thinks people will agree to move to mars. “The months-long journey is sure to be hard, risky, dangerous, difficult, [but] just as with the establishment of the English colonies, there are people who love that. They want to be the pioneers.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ndpxuf-uJHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Commercial space travel with the goal of eventual colonization of Mars is being facilitated by Elon Musk, SpaceX and a variety of companies under NASA’s NextSTEP program. The project allows NASA to combine their own efforts with teamwork and delegation to private companies who are committed to their mutual goal of transporting potential pioneers to Mars. Companies working through the NextSTEP program are partnering with NASA to build actual size, on the ground habitats and test them for safety. This private and public partnership allows various corporations to develop different aspects of different projects with the common goal of deep space exploration and colonization. The six prototypes will be developed by six different companies including Boeing. They will be responsible for design analysis, demonstration, and testing according to The Te Cake. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pPlYpbSMFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Commercial space travel, including travel, transport, and colonization under the NextSTEP program, is a cooperative effort. The companies signed on through the NextSTEP corporation, are working on projects intended to facilitate the development of extraplanetary travel technology quickly and efficiently according to NASA. The human race will no longer be earthbound, and they will have corporations to thank for designing these projects. Not all the projects are similar. Lockheed Martin worked to build new parts for the ISS. The space shuttle transported these parts to the ISS. The Sierra Nevada Corporation is working on inflatable fabric space habitat components to attach to interplanetary travel vehicles. NASA and NextSTEP partner Orbital ATK is working to make launch vehicles more comfortable for long term habitation, while Texas-based NanoRacks will be responsible for conducting a feasibility study, involving the conversion of an existing launch vehicle’s upper stage, which is the propellant segment, into a pressurized inhabitable volume, or livable area, in space. Space X [Photo by NASA/Getty Images]Commercial space travel including exploration, transportation, and colonization through NextSTEP is being managed by NASA under the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. The purpose is stated to be the building of prototypes. These prototypes are being designed to make the habitation of Mars and perhaps eventually other planets possible. These are vital when SpaceX takes human beings off the Earth and onto another planet for the first time. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is preparing for a launch their Falcon 9, which will launch the JCSAT-16 satellite into space, according to NASA Space Flight. This latest Falcon 9 is tasked with lofting the JCSAT-16 satellite into its Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GEO) on August 14, once again involving the first stage making a landing attempt on the drone ship. Elon wants to develop spacecraft that are reusable, rather than waste all the parts, on every trip. This would make travel to another planet more affordable. Ultimately, though, Mr. Musk’s goal is to colonize Mars. Part of Elon’s plan is affordability. He wants ordinary people to be able to afford to travel to Mars if they want to move there.

Veteran of the Week Lew McCreary� STANLEY EARL CORNWELL, Dobbin, Texas Born the son of an oilfield roughneck, in Brownwood, Stan is 73 years old. Before entering the service he married his high school sweetheart Sandra and they began raising three children together. He received his draft notice in 1964 and joined the USAF experiencing twelve weeks of boot camp at Lackland AFB in San Antoniothen to Wichita Falls training as helicopter mechanic. In 65 he relocated to the NAS at El Centro, CA. He tested out very well becoming crew chief on a T-28 trainer. By late that year he was flown a very roundabout way to Tan So Nut AFB Vietnam as an E-3, becoming helicopter mechanic (E-4) and returned home after his one year obligation as A/1. His daily routine in Vietnam was flying missions just about everywhere as they had adopted the slogan You call and we haul aboard their sturdy twin turbine engine CH3C heavy lift chopper that Stan maintained in working order. They routinely dodged ground fire but their closest scrape and only slight injury was on the ground due to incoming mortar fire. Fortunately they were not in their chopper that sustained damages. The crew received bruises caused by flying debris. Stan had top secret clearance because of occasional trips to Laos and Cambodia. One mission (Laos) was collecting dirt samples to be examined for future US bombing strategies. On other occasions they inserted and retrieved three man sniper teams during 20 minute rendezvous using predetermined coordinates and lots of stealth. Stan returned to Patrick AFB in Florida becoming a flight engineer and loadmaster. During one Atlantic Ocean assignment they made an emergency landing on a storm tossed destroyer to pick up an injured sailor as the seas tossed the vessel around violently. His most memorable assignment was during the launching of missiles from a Polaris submarine for telemetry and salvage purposes. They carried frogmen to help recover 20 foot missile antennas that were designed to float temporarily before sinking. They successfully captured the first but the second sank. The salvaged antenna was to be secured to their choppers chain hoist and cable. Stan was lowered on a lanyard to help secure it to their helicopter and safely make the trip back to base. There was significant risk but fortunately he was not bumped very seriously and injured during the ordeal of securing their cargo to the helicopter. Another exciting assignment occurred during the Apollo Program series and the Saturn booster. Their mission was precautionary in case the capsule needed to be sprayed with water to cool it offbut mainly to gather up the crew should the launch be aborted. Stan spent 67-68 at Patrick AFB and was then discharged. Unfortunately there were multiple exposures to Agent Orange during his Vietnam tour and by 2004 he developed as cancerous prostate that was surgically removed. Symptoms returned in 2009 and radiation treatments were necessary. At that time he received a military disability. As a civilian he spent time working for LTV, Boeing Aircraft and Bell Helicopters. Next he utilized his G.I. Bill to secure an industrial engineering degree at West Texas State University. He then spent employment opportunities with Schlumberger and Texas Oil and Gas, both in Conroeas well as 15 years with Reed Roller Bit and the next 15 at Time Manufacturing in Waco. Stan retired from the business world in 2008 and settled in Dobbin. What advice would he give to graduating seniors? If you dont have the funds for college, join the military and let them teach you skills for industry. His current hobbies are enjoying the plethora of nature located near their homebut during more serious moments he built a Shelby Cobra hot rod automobile and also refurbished a 68 Thunderbird. A long time Christian and stalwart Cowboy Church member, the Cornwells can be observed most Sundays at church in Montgomery. A very recent newcomer to the Poplar Business Park veteran gatherings, Stan pledges to return soon. Sitemap { Newspaper Template by bulletlink.com }

If the sale is approved by Congress, the weapons, worth an estimated $231 million, would be sold to the NATO Support and Procurement Agency and then distributed to Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain. In January 2015, US Navy Vice Adm. J.W. Rixey, head of the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) wrote in a memo that his organization was launching a two-year pilot program to see if weapons could be sold directly to NATO in order to allow partner nations to pool their resources and find cost efficiencies. This precision-guided munitions sale would represent the first such sale, a State Department spokesman confirmed. According to a notice posted on the website of DSCA, the potential sale would include “five hundred (500) Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Guidance Kits, KMU-556 F/B; forty (40) JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU-557 F/B; one thousand five hundred (1,500) JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU-572 F/B; one thousand (1,000) MAU 210 E/B Computer Control Groups for 1,000-lb. Enhanced Paveway IIs; three hundred (300) MAU 210 E/B Computer Control Groups for GBU-49s; one thousand twenty-five (1,025) MAU 169 L/B Computer Control Groups for GBU-12s; one thousand three hundred fifty (1,350) Joint Programmable Fuzes, FMU-152 A/B; sixty (60) Bomb Fin Assembly and Airfoil Group 650-MXU K/B for GBU-12s; one thousand twenty-five (1,025) Bomb Fin Assembly and Airfoil Group, MXU-650 K/B AFG for GBU-12s.” Work will primarily be done at Boeing’s facility in St Louis, Missouri, and Raytheon’s Tucson, Arizona, location.

CGNPC employee Szuhsiung Ho is accused of conspiring to develop nuclear material in China without US approval. Who is he and what is his background? Szuhsiung ‘Allen’ Ho, a nuclear engineer employed by the China General Nuclear Power Company. Photograph: Knox County sheriff's office Rob Davies Thursday 11 August 2016 13.18 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.38 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Dr Szuhsiung “Allen” Ho is, according to a motion filed by his lawyer, a 66-year-old American citizen who was born in Taiwan, educated in the US and lives in Wilmington, Delaware. In character statements submitted to a court in Tennessee, friends and neighbours described him as an honest and law abiding member of the community who loved the US and would eventually be exonerated of charges of nuclear espionage brought against him by the US government. Ho came to the US in 1973 to attend the University of California and married his wife Anne a year later. He received a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of Illinois in 1980, and became a naturalised US citizen three years later. . The couple are childless, but Ho fathered a son outside the marriage in 2007. Neighbours said his wife had declared herself willing to help raise the child in the US. They are described as active members of the local Chinese American Community Centre in Wilmington, where Anne Ho is involved in running a women’s book club. The couple live in a large house in the town, which has sizeable Chinese community, but Ho spends much of his time in China working for his nuclear consulting business, Energy Technology International, which was set up in 1996. Prosecutors say he has two flats in China, one of his own and another for his son and the boy’s mother. Ho has worked as a consultant for China General Nuclear Power, which has a 33% stake in the UK’s £18bn Hinkley Point C project. Prosecutors allege that he enticed US nuclear experts at the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority energy corporation to pass sensitive information to Beijing by paying them bribes. They also allege that he failed to register with the Department of Justice as an agent of a foreign state and that he is paid by the Chinese government. Ho is charged with helping a foreign power produce nuclear material, a term that refers to enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear reactor fuel. His lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg, said in court papers Ho had “no expertise or experience in the development or production of special nuclear material”. He said Ho was helping nuclear plants in China to run safely in order to avoid a Chernobyl-style disaster. Ho was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia, in April and has been jailed pending trial. If found guilty he could face life in prison. Zeidenberg has requested bail, pointing out that Ho, 66, is “not a young man” and is “poorly equipped for dealing with the stress and potential dangers inherent in detention”. He said that at one facility where Ho was held, he had to be segregated from other inmates after they were heard discussing a plan to harm him. “It has been brutal for him in every way imaginable,” a friend of Ho’s said. Neighbours and family friends have provided statements praising his character, according to filings with the court intended to support his bail request, which will be heard on Tuesday. Gwen and David Chen, also of Wilmington, said Ho was a “bright, honest, warm, mild, likable [sic], and friendly man”, adding that the allegations “must be some misunderstanding”. Friend Amy Chien said he was a “man of filial piety” who always visited his family in Taiwan when he travelled to China and was “well liked and respected in his circle of friends”. Shirley and Evan Tseng said he spent a lot of time in China for work, but that he had “roots deeply planted in Delaware” and loved the US. “This is his home and his country, and he would never betray it,” they said. Ho’s sister-in-law, Donna En Ning Lee, said Ho “has not – nor will he ever – evade the law” and offered to put her house up as a bail bond. Zeidenberg said Ho was not a flight risk, had no criminal history or drug or alcohol problems, and was prepared to submit to house arrest with an ankle bracelet to monitor his movements.
