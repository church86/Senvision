The new livery, considered a “once in a generation” revision, follows Kuwait Airways’ recent announcement of its new fiveyear business plan made earlier in September of this year. The new livery and delivery of the Boeing 777-300ERs mark the airline’s first major steps towards achieving the goals it set out in its “Transformation Strategy”. Officials believe that the acquisition of the Boeing 777-300ERs into the fleet is a game-changer and will play an immediate and significant role in serving its long-haul destinations and foster the opening of new routes. The branding change, more than just a cosmetic upgrade, hopes to send a clear message to passengers, stakeholders and the communityat- large, of the change that is undergoing across and throughout the whole operation and organization of the airline. For this, the fresh and dynamic look will also be reflected in Kuwait Airways’ comprehensive approach to delivering on all areas of “operational, commercial and service excellence” Launch “The launch of our new livery is an unreservedly clear statement-ofintent,” said Mrs Rasha Al-Roumi, Chairperson and CEO of Kuwait Airways.“While the outward change to our aircraft will be obvious, we also hope to demonstrate that a much deeper and thorough transformation process is underway; one that will reassert our pioneering legacy in the region’s aviation industry and restore a sense of pride in the national carrier of Kuwait. Ultimately, such changes will be in pursuit of asserting our position as the preferred choice for passengers, linking Kuwait to the world,” Al-Roumi added. The new logo retains a revision of the iconic blue bird, but is now more prominently displayed on the body of the aircraft from the tail and across the rear end of the plane. Its two-tonal blues symbolize a meeting of the sea and sky, signifying the point at which new horizons will be crossed, juxtaposed with the subtle inclusion of the pearl designs in a nod to Kuwait’s historic maritime and trading roots. “While a new livery change and the delivery of our first Boeing 777-300ER demonstrate a clear and new direction, it should be said that Kuwait Airways consider the human element is the main factor of any success and that dedication and commitment to our passengers remains unchanged. We will, therefore, deepen our commitment in our areas of strength, act on the areas we can improve on and, going forward, maintain a consistent delivery of service excellence across all areas of the business,” Al-Roumi concluded. Kuwait Airways, the national carrier, was founded in 1953 as a private company with 50% owned by the Kuwaiti government making it the oldest one-state official carrier, in the Arabian Gulf region. In 1962, the Kuwaiti government became the sole owner of the airline. On 21st October 2013, Kuwait Airways officially became a joint stock company. Kuwait Airways’ current fleet of 22 aircraft includes seven A320- 200CEO, five A330, four A340-300, three A330-200, two Boeing 777-200 and one Boeing 747-400.In 2016, Kuwait Airways announced its fiveyear transformation plan, in order to re-establish the legacy and pride of the national carrier of the State of Kuwait, as the preferred airline linking Kuwait to the world. In 2015, Kuwait Airways announced its decision to upgrade its fleet and ordered ten Boeing 777- 300ER, fifteen A330neo and ten A350. The addition of the 10 new Boeing 777-300ERs by the fourth quarter of 2017 will see the airline develop into owning one of the youngest commercial fleet, in the region. “We are really proud of the Boeing 777 and all it offers passengers and the operators. But we are even more thrilled when we talk about the role the 777 aircraft pays in our customer success. It is a huge honour for us that the first 777- 300 ER for Kuwait Airways was chosen as the first aircraft to carry the new Kuwait Airways brand. Boeing is honoured to be part of this very significant transformation. The 777- 300 ER is ideally suited to be the flagship for Kuwait Airways and as the airline expands its fleet and network,” Elizabeth H. Lund Vice President of the 777 Programme stated. She continued, “The 777 has the longest range capability for any commercial airplane and leads the industry in passenger experience. The beautiful 777 with the new and fresh livery is representative of the future of Kuwait airways and the new interior is even more extraordinary than the outside and it will provide a passenger experience like no other in the world.” The Boeing 777 series is the market leader with a staggering 1,587 planes ordered of which more than 163 airplanes currently in backlog. Boeing builds and delivers more than8 777s a month in the largest building in the world by volume. The 777-300ER is the newest generation 777 of which more than 800 have been ordered since entry into service. The 777-300ER is the largest twin-engine airplane in the world and allows airlines to carry 10 to 45% more passengers than competing airplanes with Class Leading Reliability at 99.5%. The standard configuration of the airplane is 73.9 m in length with a maximum takeoff weight of 351,530 kg and total Cargo Volume of 201.6 m3. It can cover a range of 13,650 km at a cruise speed of Mach0.84 and carry up to 396 passengers. The First Class Configuration will feature 80 degree pitched, full flatbed seats 26” wide, private suites, Dining Facility, 24” screen, Full aisle access. Meanwhile, the Business Class Configuration will feature 64 degree inclined 22” seats and 16” screen. The Economy Class will include 35 or 32/33 degree pitch seating with 11” screens. Power supply, Wi-Fi and GSM service will be available throughout the aircraft.

SEATTLE/KUWAIT: As part of a high-level delegation to Seattle, USA, ahead of the delivery of the first of 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, Rasha Al-Roumi, Chairperson and CEO of Kuwait Airways, the national carrier of the State of Kuwait, went on a tour of The Boeing factory at Everett, to look at the first of the new additions to the airline’s fleet. Roumi was given a tour of the Boeing factory and was also briefed on the progress of Kuwait Airways’ second Boeing 777-300ER currently being built. The first airplane is scheduled to be officially handed over by November 2016. Under the delivery agreement, Kuwait Airways will have all 10 aircraft delivered and in commercial service by Q3 2017. As part of her visit, Roumi met with Elizabeth Lund, Vice-President and General Manager of the 777 program. Lund leads the design, development, certification, production and delivery of all models of the Boeing 777 family of airplanes currently in production. While on the tour, the Kuwait Airways delegation was informed that Boeing is using the latest “moving line” production technologies and systems to build the airline’s 10 new aircrafts. This allows the airplane manufacturer to produce one 777-300ER – from start to finish – in just 46 working days. On completion of the tour, Roumi said: “We are delighted to be here in Seattle and to note the progress of both our first and second Boeing 777-300ERs . These new additions are in line with Kuwait Airways’ ‘Transformation Strategy’ that will see the airline have the youngest commercial airline fleet – in the world – by 2021 and offer a superior product for our passengers.” While the arrival of the Boeing 777-300ERs will improve Kuwait Airways’ fleet, the aircraft will also open up future possibilities for the airline to serve new, long-haul routes and destinations. This is part of the airline’s stated goal of becoming the “preferred airline linking Kuwait to the world.” Share This article was published on 23/10/2016 Most Read Railway project offered for bidding next year CBK re-issues first Kuwaiti coin ‘baiza’ New Saudi rules, fees for helpers, vehicles, cattle Egyptian duo held on visa forgery charges Dashti out of election race after final court ruling India banned cash without homework: Congress leader Court bars royal candidate, reinstates ex-MP Hashem Illegal Sponsorship & Absconding Jihadists say Trump's victory a rallying call for new recruits Crackdown on abuse of state lands off Seventh Ring Road Business Cartoon E-Paper Health Kuwait Legal Clinic Lifestyle Opinion Sports Technology Top Stories World About Us Contact Us Rate card 2016 RSS © 2016, ↑ Kuwait Times

Travel News & Advice Aeroplanes of the future: From ultra-luxury AirCruises to planes that turn into trains and passenger seats that make us human batteries The future of flight is looking increasingly barmy. Here’s what we’ve got to look forward to Laura Chubb @LauraChubb1 Saturday 22 October 2016 10:30 BST The Clip-Air design, where detachable aircraft cabins can turn into trains Clip-Air “Air cruises” – ultra-luxury planes flying groups of guests on round-the-world itineraries – just might be the next big thing in travel. That’s if high-end operator Crystal Cruises’ new Crystal AirCruises plane, launching next autumn, is a hit. Crystal’s Boeing 777-200LR will be kitted out with lie-flat seats, dining tables, divans and a bar, with room for 84 guests to fly in style. The company is also said to be planning themed flights, with the likes of visiting Michelin-starred chefs – though cabaret acts are unlikely to feature. Itineraries are planned to last either 14, 21 or 28 days, and passengers will stay in luxury hotels when on the ground. How Crystal expects its AirCruises plane to look While experiencing the AirCruises plane will only be a matter for the privileged few, it got us thinking about other aviation innovations slated to take to the skies in the not-too-distant future. Here are some of our favourite plans and patents for the aeroplanes of tomorrow. The plane that turns into a train The “Clip-Air” concept is the brainchild of the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Lausanne, Switzerland, and involves a detachable fuselage that can be transferred from an “airframe” onto train tracks. Theoretically, this would mean passengers can transfer from a plane to a train without ever leaving their seat. While it’s unlikely this could become a reality for several decades, it’s not the first time the idea of a detachable passenger cabin has been mooted. Last year, Airbus filed a patent for that very idea, arguing that it would save time to board passengers onto a removable cabin, and that the plane could even undergo maintenance while passengers boarded elsewhere. Read more Budget airlines rated: What you get for your money The cabin that will make you feel zen Just last week, Airbus said it was seriously considering the possibility of coating the interior of cabins in a light-emitting material, onto which they would then project images of the outside environment – be that a blue sky with clouds, or a night sky with stars. The idea is that it would improve the cabin environment for passengers – though if you’re already afraid of flying, the sensation of whizzing through the air at several hundred miles per hour with no tin can to protect you might not help.  An innovation you will definitely be seeing, however, is the company’s solution to improving overhead storage – and not a minute too soon. The new A350 and A330neo models have taller overhead bins where bags sit vertically, as though on a book shelf, which should be far more efficient than the horizontal madness we have now. Plans for in-built VR helmets filed by Airbus (United States Patent and Trademark Office) Seats with in-built VR helmets Another Airbus idea is the unfortunately named “sensory helmet”, which would be built into passenger seat headrests so you can isolate yourself in your own VR world (ie, pretend you’re not living the nightmare of modern commercial aviation). The patent says the helmet would “preferentially” also have a function where nice odours could be diffused into it. Particularly useful on a long-haul journey after the inflight meal has been digested. Boeing’s folding wings The plans for Boeing’s 777-9X model – which will be the largest twin-engine jet in the world – show such an enormous wingspan that the tips will need to fold up in order for the craft to fit into airports. The wingspan, of just over 235ft, will be reduced by 12ft when the hinged tips fold up. Locking pins will stop the wings from accidentally folding up during the flight. Read more These are the worst inflight meals we've ever seen Benches instead of seats More from Airbus, and this time it's replacing conventional aeroplane passenger seats with, erm, benches. The patent, published earlier this year, would bring an end to defined seat width, depending on how many people are fit onto the bench – which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on how the benches are sold. The new Boeing model will have folding wings (Boeing) The flat-pack plane Amazingly, the flat-pack plane is a real thing. Cambridge, England-based company e-Go has created a one-person aircraft that can be taken apart and packed away after a flight. The plane is actually available on pre-order now, and will set you back a tidy £50,000. The company is now working on multi-seater flat-pack planes, so watch this space. The e-Go plane has detachable wings so you can take it apart and store it easily post-flight (e-goaeroplanes.com) Energy-harvesting seats Our final entry is the energy-harvesting seats proposed by France’s Zodiac Aerotechnics, which proposes a sort of Matrix-style dystopia where humans become batteries. Passenger seats on commercial flights would capture “ambient energy” from human bodies to provide power and lower the overall energy consumption in an aircraft cabin. Creepy much?

(Photo courtesy of St. Margaret's Episcopal School) By CANDLER CUSATO / CAPPIES REVIEWER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Passengers, fasten your seat belts for the turbulent but hysterical ride that is St. Margaret’s production of “Boeing Boeing,” in which amorous scoundrel Bernard and his right-hand man Robert struggle to keep his three engagements to flight attendants airborne when they all arrive unexpectedly at his Paris apartment because of a snowstorm and the new Super Boeing aircraft. With uproariously funny actors onstage and seamless technical direction behind the scenes, St. Margaret’s production of “Boeing Boeing” soars. Bernard and Robert, played by Tyler Ashman and Jaden Cloobeck, respectively, hilariously mirror a married couple with their witty banter and degradation from suave to inconsolably stressed as the play’s conflict evolves and doors open to reveal yet another flight attendant arriving to greet her fiance. Ashman remains somewhat restrained while Cloobeck sprints around the apartment screaming as their evening slowly descends into madness. As cynical French maid Berthe, Casey Healy is constant amid a swirling vortex of insanity, with her unceasing French frown and careless flicks of a cigarette while Bernard’s well-crafted plan falls to pieces. St. Margaret’s shines in a partnership between acting, costumes and hair and makeup. While seamless American, Italian and German accents are all that can be heard onstage, the costumers, under the direction of Hailey Hageman and Elizabeth Haugen, enhance these stereotypes via colorful outfits. Hair and makeup, courtesy of Alyssa Chong, Valentina Martino and Zoe Mellard, aptly reflect these cultural generalizations as well, for Gretchen, a German flight attendant, has her hair permanently glued to her head in tight braids while Gloria, her American counterpart, sports bright blue eyeshadow characteristic of 1960s U.S. fashion. With apt comedic timing and attention to minute technical details, St. Margaret’s adds its own hilarious spin to this modern farce, ensuring that the comedy, like the ideal flight, is nonstop.

Georgia was born in Neihart, MT, on August 25, 1937. When she was young, her family relocated to a logging camp outside Bly, OR, because her father worked for Weyerhaeuser. She grew up in the mountains of Oregon watching wild horses and enjoying the outdoors. She attended Bly High School until her family relocated to Klamath Falls, OR, her senior year of high school. After graduation, she attended Southern Oregon University, where she was a cheerleader. In the 1950’s, she moved to Seattle, WA, and was employed by the Boeing Company as a draftsman. She met her husband, Paul Dunning, while they were both employed by the Boeing Company. They married May 9, 1959, and made their home in the Seattle area. In the early 70’s, they moved to the Wenatchee Valley, where they raised their four children. Georgia was an active member of her church and community. When she was not busy raising children or watching her grandchildren, she volunteered her time at the Mission Ridge Ski School, Chelan County 4-H, Wenatchee Valley Softball League, Sweet Adeline’s, she sang in the church choir, played the guitar, led many prayer groups, and was instrumental in starting the perpetual prayer chapel at St. Joseph’s Convent. Preceding Georgia in death were her parents. Surviving Georgia are her two sisters and her brother. Also surviving are Georgia’s husband, Paul; her four children: Andrea, Laureen, Tyler, and Maurya; and her five grandchildren. A special thank you to Denise Sewell of ResCare and Hospice Services of Confluence Health for their excellent care of Georgia. A Memorial Mass will be held on Friday, October 28, 2016, at 2:00 p.m., at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church. Memorial donations may be made to St. Joseph’s Convent, 600 St. Joseph Place, Wenatchee, WA 98801. Arrangements are by Telford’s Chapel of the Valley, East Wenatchee, WA. Questions about commenting?

Only four of its fleet of 10 aircraft are flying. Saddled with $300-million of debt, the airline has been struggling to survive, despite having a monopoly on all domestic routes. Image: TIMES MEDIA GROUP Zimbabwe's aviation industry is flying high. But the national airline, Air Zimbabwe, which is reportedly bleeding about $3-million (about R42-million) a month in losses, is yet to take off and enjoy the boom. Instead, foreign airlines such as SAA, its SA Airlink unit, British Airways, Fastjet, Emirates, Kenyan Airways, Ethiopian Airways and Air Namibia have cashed in on the growth opportunities offered by Harare's open-skies policy. The policy is a push by the government of President Robert Mugabe to allow new players into the aviation market. Economic observers have, however, warned that while the policy would boost foreign airlines' presence, it would ultimately sink the ailing national carrier. Air Zimbabwe enjoys a monopoly on all domestic routes: Harare-Bulawayo, Harare-Victoria Falls, Harare-Kariba, Bulawayo-Victoria Falls. But on regional routes - Harare-Johannesburg, Johannesburg-Victoria Falls, Bulawayo-Johannesburg, Air Zimbabwe is getting a run for its money. Airline on endangered list Now the distressed airline is looking to the son of the late former vice-president, Simon Muzenda, and Mugabe's son-in-law to turn around its fortunes. It will not be an easy feat for Ripton Muzenda and Simba Chikore, who were recently appointed the CEO and chief operating officer respectively . Muzenda is a former pilot and chief instructor with the airline, while Chikore had a short stint as a pilot at Air Zimbabwe and with a Middle Eastern airline. The appointments have sparked anger from the opposition, which claims they were largely influenced by nepotism, ignoring more qualified candidates. Air Zimbabwe's acting CEO since September 2013 had been Edmund Makona . Chikore in particular has been at the receiving end of much criticism over his appointment. The airline is often ridiculed on social media as "Air Simbabwe" or simply as "Air Sim"- a tweak of its official Air Zim tag. Jacob Mafume, spokesman of the People's Democratic Party, said Chikore's appointment was a bitter joke for suffering Zimbabweans. "The man has not even run a chicken coop in his life. His only qualification is being the son-in-law of Mugabe. We know Mugabe uses the airline as his personal transport, but surely this has consolidated our status as a kangaroo republic," he said. Transport Minister Joram Gumbo, however, has defended the appointments and said the selection process was above board. Air Zimbabwe faces significant challenges, including a bloated workforce, an obsolete aircraft fleet and dwindling passenger numbers. Estimates are that the airline carries about 200000 travellers a year, a significant drop from its peak in the 1990s of one million travellers a year. The fall in passenger numbers has been fuelled by the unreliable service; the airline is prone to flight cancellations and delays. Just last week, Air Zimbabwe cancelled a flight from Harare to Bulawayo after passengers had endured a seven-hour delay. The flight was scheduled to leave at 5pm, but airline officials announced the cancellation to passengers at midnight. "Air Zimbabwe is the example of lack of competition and monopoly in an industry," said Gamu Chinamasa, who was inconvenienced by the flight delay. "It is so disappointing. If they allowed, or Fastjet agreed to, certain local routes, they would pull up their socks. Air Zimbabwe is relaxed, it's disgusting." Air Zimbabwe's fleet comprises two Boeing 767s, three 737s, three MA60s and two Airbus A320s. Of these, only four are flying - an Airbus, a Boeing 767, a 737 and one MA60. Last year, in an effort to help shore it up, the government took on the airline's $300-million debt. Despite this lifeline, the situation has remained bleak as no new investment flows in from the state. Air Zimbabwe has been unable to keep up with the competition. Its competitors for the regional routes have added more flights on the routes or tweaked up offers to travellers. Emirates says may cut Africa flights because of economic challenges This week, an aviation source said Fastjet was planning to add another flight on the lucrative Harare-Johannesburg route early next month. "The demand has been overwhelming," said the source. Fastjet already operates two daily flights between Harare and Johannesburg. It is also understood that Fastjet is keen to enter the domestic market, where Air Zimbabwe has a monopoly. The Harare to Johannesburg route is the most fiercely fought over by SAA, BA, Fastjet and Air Zimbabwe. The Civil Aviation Authority estimates that SAA controls about 30% of the market. Last month, Airlink launched a second daily flight to Bulawayo from Johannesburg. Air Zimbabwe also operates a flight on that route. Karin Murray, the sales and marketing manager for Airlink, said the new morning flight would not only provide additional flexibility when planning traveller itineraries, but would provide additional capacity on the route. "Airlink has also added additional capacity over the Christmas season with an afternoon flight which will operate from December 12 2016 to January 15 2017," said Murray. For now, Air Zimbabwe's hopes of a turnaround lie with its high-flying duo of Muzenda and Chikore. Don't miss out on this story Login, upgrade or subscribe to continue reading.

Share story By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg News Rockwell Collins, with its $6.4 billion takeover of B/E Aerospace, is betting big that airplanes will get smarter as everything from lie-flat seats to toilet valves flash data in real time to airline crews and maintenance workers on the ground. The acquisition is the largest in the avionics company’s 83-year history, eclipsing its $1.39 billion takeover of Arinc in 2013. That deal, just 11 days after Kelly Ortberg was named chief executive, gave Rockwell Collins new ways to pipe data into airplanes. With B/E Aerospace, Ortberg gains the largest equipment supplier for aircraft cabins — and the chance to provide reams of new information to airline operators. “It sets us up for the future,” Ortberg said in an interview Sunday. “We’ve made major investments in next-generation airplanes. That trend is going to translate into the interiors of aircraft.” Most Read Stories ‘Deadliest Catch’ cast member Jake Harris hospitalized; police investigating attack What the national media are saying about Seahawks' 'magnificent' win over Patriots Patriots' Rob Gronkowski has punctured lung according to one report Should California, Oregon and Washington join Canada? #Calexit talk envelops West Coast 5,000 Seattle-area students walk out of class to protest election of Trump  WATCHUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. The transaction vastly broadens a product portfolio that has been centered on aircraft communications and computing equipment since the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company was spun out of Rockwell International in 2001. The deal, slated to close in early 2017, is the latest in a spate of mergers involving suppliers to Boeing and Airbus, which are squeezing suppliers as they brace for slower growth after a decadelong sales cycle. “It’s an opportunity to build a smarter plane,” Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said. “Given the pricing pressure, you’ll probably see more deals like this.” B/E Aerospace investors will get $34.10 in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, for a total consideration of $62 a share, the companies said Sunday. That’s a 23 percent premium over B/E Aerospace’s closing price Friday. With the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt, the purchase comes to $8.3 billion, they said. Shares of Rockwell Collins have fallen 8.5 percent this year, while B/E Aerospace gained almost 20 percent. B/E Aerospace is the largest supplier of aircraft-cabin equipment, ranging from modular lavatories to luxurious seats as expensive as a Ferrari. On a pro forma basis, the combined manufacturer would have had almost 30,000 employees, $8.1 billion in revenue and $1.9 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, debt and amortization for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to the statement. There is virtually no overlap in the two companies’ product portfolios. “For the most part they are pretty complementary,” Aboulafia said. “Rockwell tends to be on the small planes. B/E on the bigger ones, particularly widebodies.” The savings flowing from the merger, pegged at about $160 million, would mostly come from combining suppliers and eliminating overlapping headquarters functions, Ortberg said. Those so-called synergies don’t include the potential boost to sales that would open up when the companies are combined, Ortberg said. Rockwell Collins has a base of business-aviation dealers that could offer to retrofit private jets with B/E Aerospace’s interiors. The Wellington, Fla., based company has very strong ties with airline customers that Rockwell Collins may be able to leverage to sell more of its avionics equipment and inflight-entertainment systems. The end result may translate to better in-flight service. For example, sensors in luxury seats in first- and business-class cabins, could notify flight attendants when a passenger is waking up on a long-haul flight and ready for a hot towel or glass of orange juice. “The smart cabin is here,” Amin Khoury, co-founder and chairman of B/E Aerospace, said Sunday. “It’s not something that may happen in the future. It’s happening now.” The boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which will still need to pass muster with shareholders. Werner Lieberherr, B/E Aerospace’s chief executive, will be named executive vice president and chief operating officer of a newly created aircraft-interiors division after the merger closes. Khoury will stay on as a consultant to Ortberg. Separately, Rockwell Collins said profit from continuing operations in its fiscal fourth quarter rose to $1.58 a share, up from $1.38 a year earlier, according to a statement Sunday. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $1.57, according to the average of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the period rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier to $1.45 billion, trailing the average analyst estimate of $1.48 billion. Equipment sales were hurt by lower plane-maker production rates, including Airbus’ A330 widebody jetliner, the company said. For its 2017 fiscal year, the company said it expects revenue between $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion — that’s on a stand-alone basis and doesn’t account for the deal with B/E Aerospace.

No stream of neighbourhood kids in luminous ghost costumes or this year’s de rigueur characters (Pokemon’s Pikachu or Ash Ketchum, anyone?) collecting candy door to door, no taking off for dress-up parties, and definitely no flirtation with fireworks. We’re no killjoys, however (we leave sweets on the doorstep under a flashing witch proclaiming “free candy”). It’s just that October 31 becomes quite simply the most terrifying day of the year for our 14-year-old beagle Billy – even without the spine-chilling, fright-centric tombs and ghouls mooching around people’s yards. Billy’s nerves, like those of many dogs in the city, have never been able to buffer the bangs of myriad fireworks in the hood. After many Halloweens spent with him hiding under a bed, licking his lips, shaking intensely and staring wildly before occasionally going into a seizure-like state for a few minutes, for the past few years we lapped up a hotdog tip: check out of the festivities and go straight to the airport. Fireworks are banned in the vicinity of airports. According to Transport Canada’s Canadian Aviation Regulations it is illegal to “launch a model rocket or a rocket of a type used in a fireworks display into cloud or in a manner that is or is likely to be hazardous to aviation safety.” Billy’s Halloween tradition now revolves around a visual, but silent, treat — all from the comfort of a fully soundproofed suite at the Fairmont Vancouver Airport hotel. We watch a swath of fireworks splattering across the Vancouver skyline in the distance, while close up there’s more than a few Airbus A380s and Boeing 747s wheeling past on the tarmac below With its triple glazing “only-six-per-cent-of-sound” reaches the nervous nelly pooch. Billy enjoys his Halloween in a soundproofed suite at the Fairmont Vancouver Airport hotel. Lucy Hyslop / PNG Dr. Rebecca Ledger, an animal behaviour scientist and Vancouver Sun columnist, says Billy’s symptoms are a common reaction in dogs to loud noises, and they can be far worse. “I’ve had (animal) patients who have jumped out of third-storey windows, bolted through traffic and gone missing for days, and who have developed PTSD as a result of a noisy event,” she says.  Ledger says some dogs have a genetic predisposition to noise phobia, while others are “bomb-proof”. Triggers are typically noises that are loud and sudden, such as a newspaper stand slamming shut or a fire alarm. Ledger suggests calling your vet ahead of an obvious date such as Halloween to see if a panic attack could be avoidable using a sedative.  “If this is not possible, then let your dog hide to get away from the noise as best he can,” she says. “Some dogs are happier in the bathroom, in the basement, in a closet, or under the bed where the noise is deadened. You can provide a den using a cardboard box covered with blankets too.” Other tips include keeping windows and curtains shut, and playing music to mask the noise (although we tried cranking up the radio or television, but it wasn’t easy to synchronize it perfectly with the erratically timed firework displays). Owners can also reach for the dog version of earplugs. “I love the Happy Hoodie, which is a soft snood that covers the dog’s ears and keeps the noise out,” Ledger says. Most owners worry that being attentive or cuddling the dog when its scared will reinforce the firework fear, Ledger says. “If consoling your dog in the moment helps, then do it. But, then if you really want to work on teaching your dog not to be afraid, then speak to a veterinary behaviourist about how to successfully desensitize the dog way ahead of time before the next event.”  If you’re de-stressing your pooch (and yourself) at the airport, there’s even a dog-friendly park. A winding, undulating strip with firs, pathway and even a tiny waterfall and pond, Chester Johnson Park is punctuated by the historic totems that most people pass at the airport. There’s also McDonald Beach, an off-leash area a few minutes’ drive away on Sea Island — and both supply dog relief bags, to boot.  Having booked almost a year in advance at a lower rate, Billy the spoiled pooch is still getting his 4-diamond experience again this fall. Even if we have a feeling his hearing has completely gone in old age anyway. Lucy Hyslop’s 14-year-old beagle Billy.

By DougCameron DanaMattioli DanaCimilluca Rockwell Collins Inc. agreed to pay $6.4 billion to buy B/E Aerospace Inc. in a deal that would unite two of the biggest suppliers to airlines and plane makers. The proposed deal, confirmed by the companies on Sunday, continues the consolidation of the aerospace industry over the past two years as suppliers adjust to pressures from Airbus Group SE AIR, +0.18%  and Boeing Co. BA, -1.25%   to cut costs. The deal requires approvals by regulators and shareholders and values B/E Aerospace BEAV, -0.05%   at $62 a share in cash and stock, a 22.5% premium to Friday’s closing share price. The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday that the companies were in advanced talks. Rockwell Collins COL, -0.43%   Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg said in an interview that the combination offered substantial cost synergies and the ability to cross-sell electronics and plane fittings, and positions the enlarged company to lead the development of “smart” aircraft.

The $6.4 billion purchase of B/E Aerospace Inc. eclipses the 83-year-old avionics maker’s takeover of Arinc Inc. in 2013. That deal, just 11 days after Kelly Ortberg was named chief executive officer, provided new ways to pipe data into planes. With B/E Aerospace, Ortberg gains the largest equipment supplier for aircraft cabins -- and the chance to provide reams of new information to airline operators. “It sets us up for the future,” Ortberg said in an interview Sunday. “We’ve made major investments in next-generation airplanes. That trend is going to translate into the interiors of aircraft.” The transaction vastly broadens a product portfolio that has been centered on aircraft communications and computing equipment since Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company was spun out of Rockwell International in 2001. The deal, which is slated to close in early 2017, is the latest in a spate of mergers involving suppliers to Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE, which are squeezing costs as they brace for slower growth following a decade-long sales cycle. “It’s an opportunity to build a smarter plane,” Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said by telephone. “Given the pricing pressure you’ll probably see more deals like this.” Share Reaction B/E Aerospace investors will get $34.10 in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, for a total consideration of $62 a share, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That’s a 23 percent premium over B/E Aerospace’s closing price on Friday. With the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt, the purchase comes to $8.3 billion, according to the statement. B/E Aerospace jumped 16 percent to $58.70 at 9:36 a.m. Monday in New York, while Rockwell Collins fell as much as 4.2 percent to $80.88 for the biggest intraday decline in six months. B/E Aerospace gained almost 20 percent this year through Friday, while Rockwell Collins had declined 8.5 percent. “Considering that the commercial aerospace cycle is mature, the deal price is not cheap,” Ronald Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America Corp., said in a note to clients. B/E Aerospace is the largest supplier of aircraft cabin equipment, ranging from modular lavatories to luxurious seats as expensive as a Ferrari. On a pro-forma basis, the combined manufacturer would have had almost 30,000 employees, $8.1 billion in revenue and $1.9 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, debt and amortization for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2016, according to the statement. The savings flowing from the merger, pegged at about $160 million, would mostly come from combining suppliers and eliminating overlapping headquarters functions, Ortberg said. Those so-called synergies don’t include the potential boost to sales that would open up when the companies are combined, Ortberg said. “At first glance, we find it difficult to clearly see how Rockwell Collins could extract $160 million,” Epstein said. ‘Smart Cabin’ Rockwell Collins has a base of business-aviation dealers that could offer to retrofit private jets with B/E Aerospace’s interiors. The Wellington, Florida-based company has very strong ties with airline customers that Rockwell Collins may be able to leverage to sell more of its avionics equipment and inflight entertainment systems. The end result may translate to better inflight service. For example, sensors in luxury seats in first- and business-class cabins, could notify flight attendants when a passenger is waking up on a long-haul flight and ready for a hot towel or glass of orange juice. “The smart cabin is here,” Amin Khoury, co-founder and chairman of B/E Aerospace, said in an interview Sunday. “It’s not something that may happen in the future. It’s happening now.” The boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which will still need to pass muster with shareholders. Werner Lieberherr, B/E Aerospace’s chief executive, will be named executive vice-president and chief operating officer of a newly created aircraft interiors division after the merger closes. Khoury will stay on as a consultant to Ortberg. Fourth-Quarter Earnings Separately, Rockwell Collins said profit from continuing operations in its fiscal fourth quarter rose to $1.58 a share, up from $1.38 a year earlier, according to a statement on Sunday. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $1.57, according to the average of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales in the period rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier to $1.45 billion, trailing the average analyst estimate of $1.48 billion. Equipment sales were hurt by lower planemaker production rates, including Airbus’s A330 widebody jetliner, the company said. For its 2017 fiscal year, the company said it expects revenue between $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion -- that’s on a standalone basis, and doesn’t account for the deal with B/E Aerospace.

We can conjure objects into our real world as if by magic with AR, and with Pikachu and friends earning up to $10m per day, R&D departments are searching for the next phase A Pokémon Go! player hunts Pokémon in Tokyo, Japan. Photograph: Aflo/Rex/Shutterstock Simon Parkin Sunday 23 October 2016 03.30 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger While Dorothy, blue-skirted and pigtailed, clutching a wicker basket and a bewildered dog under her arm, surveys the weird flowers and pygmy huts around her, she’s sure of just one thing: she’s not in Kansas any more. L Frank Baum’s character was, it turns out, born slightly too early. In 1901, a year after the publication of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Baum wrote The Master Key, a novel credited with the invention of augmented reality via a pair of imagined spectacles that could map information on to whatever or whomever its wearer looked at. Had Dorothy owned a pair, she might have learned that she’d been whisked to Oz, or that her new friend the Tin Man was in need of a heart, even, perhaps, that a wicked witch is burned not by fire, but by water. It was almost a century until Baum’s invention gained a label. In a 1992 research paper, the Boeing engineers Thomas Caudell and David Mizell described a pair of “see-thru virtual reality goggles”, a device that would enhance the vision of factory workers with the complicated task of piecing together a jumbo jet’s nests of internal wiring with dynamically changing labels and information. Caudell termed this principle of annotating the seen world “augmented reality”, thereby formalising for Silicon Valley’s mavens and investors a fresh and unplundered field of technological opportunity, one that would eventually lead to the invention of Google Glass, a pair of information-spewing spectacles built, unbelievably, to Baum’s century-old definition. Who wouldn’t like a natural history programme where the dinosaurs roam across your room? If the breathless press releases are to be believed, 2016 has been the year of virtual reality – a discarded technology that, thanks to the revolution in low-cost components heralded by smartphones, is currently enjoying a lavish revival. Sony, Facebook and HTC have all launched expensive, miraculous visors that transport us into fabricated realities, fooling the brain into believing that, like Dorothy, we’ve been bodily transported to another place. At its best, VR allows us to visit places too remote, too dangerous or too expensive to otherwise reach. Documentarians are using the nascent medium to allow us to experience life through the eyes of another. But VR technology also has numerous drawbacks. As well as the cost (just 3% of Britons are expected to invest in a serious headset this year, the cheapest of which costs £350, even without the PlayStation needed to run it) there’s also the sense of vulnerability that wearers experience while sitting blind in front of the television, as well as the perils of bumping into furniture. As one Microsoft spokesperson put it, VR users are “best advised to stay seated or keep still to avoid collisions”. AR, while not having quite the same transporting effects, gets around this issue by layering its simulated elements over the real world. Through a pair of AR glasses, or a smartphone’s camera, you are able to see both the elbow-y chair and teetering lamp in front of you, and the data that overlays it. Microsoft’s apparent scepticism about VR is understandable; the company has instead focused millions of R&D dollars into AR (or, as the company prefers to term it, “mixed reality”) via its HoloLens, a see-through PC-in-a-visor that launches in November for the precise and gargantuan cost of £2,719. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Star Chart lets you annotate the night sky using GPS positioning on your smartphone. Photograph: Escape Velocity Ltd Microsoft believes that HoloLens is the next evolution for AR, technology that we have seen for years whenever, for example, a weather reporter gestures toward a virtual map behind them in a television studio, or a football pundit offers an assessment of the starting 11 in a football match, as digital versions of the players magically appear in front of them on the desk. In HoloLens the data isn’t merely layered on top of the world you’re looking at. It’s conjured and anchored into the environment around you. In this way, you can play Minecraft on the dining room table, walking around the room in order to get a different perspective on your creation. For Microsoft, it’s a way to pull the software on which we rely from our smartphone screens into the room, a holographic conjuring act that, as the spokesperson puts it, enables us to “interact with them in the same way we interact with physical objects”. For Caudell, who coined the term AR, the technology, which he believed would be adopted across industries such as architecture, automotive design, building construction and even medicine never quite took off in the ways he expected. “There were technical and cultural issues at that time that kept it in the research lab,” he says. “In that sense it was probably ahead of its time.” The pervasiveness and power of smartphones has, however, “drastically opened up the market,” he says. Meanwhile, the success of AR games such as Pokémon Go!, which was downloaded more than 100 million times in its first month, reportedly earning $10m per day at the height of its popularity, has attracted widespread attention and investment. “It’s hard to say whether all the attention is warranted,” says Caudell. “But the potential for benefit is huge.” New to Snapchat? Here’s how to join the conversation Read more At the BBC, which has been using AR elements in its programming for more than a decade, the next generation of technology is opening up extraordinary possibilities. “It’s becoming possible to break down all the aspects of a traditional programme – like a presenter, an overlay and even the sound – and treat them as separate objects,” explains Graham Thomas, from the corporation’s R&D department. This could enable, Thomas claims, new kinds of TV programming. “It might be as simple as swapping out the usual presenter of a show for one who uses sign language, or automatically editing a news report to fit the time you have available. Or it might allow you to create AR experiences by reusing the objects from a TV show in a novel way. Who wouldn’t like a natural history programme where the dinosaurs roam across your coffee table?” This kind of speculative pitching may sell AR to venture capitalists (according to Digi-Capital, investment in VR and AR in the 12 months from March 2015 to March 2016 exceeded $1.7bn) but consumers soon tire of gimmickry. “As with any emerging technology, the experiences need to be compelling enough once the novelty has worn off,” says Thomas. Besides, simplicity, rather than ambition, is where AR has proved itself. Snapchat, the social media platform beloved of tweens, where your messages self-destruct after a few seconds, has produced perhaps the most widely used AR app in the world via its novelty camera filters which, for example, add dog ears and a lolling tongue in real time to the camera feed of one’s face. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Inkhunter allows you to visualise how a tattoo might look on your body. Photograph: Inkhunter For Alex Fleetwood, the designer of Beasts of Balance, a forthcoming boardgame that uses AR to complement the play experience, Snapchat’s AR filters show how the technology can remain compelling, at scale. “Adding fun things to video has become a natural extension of putting emoji at the end of your DMs,” he says. While some point to HoloLens and MagicLeap (another AR headset that accounts for the majority of that $1.7bn in investment) as the future of AR, for Fleetwood Snapchat’s lighter, less invasive approach is a better vision. “I believe in AR much more than VR, which in my view really is a bubble. But we need to get away from the idea that AR means wearing a computer on your face. Smartphones have already intervened in our social dynamics in ways we’re still coming to terms with. I think faces are going to be a big no-go area for most people.” For AR’s architects, the possibilities of further democratising information, and placing relevant facts and directions on to the real world, may be enough to convince us to move technology from our palms to our faces. “I consider accurate, readily available information a human right,” says Caudell. “Maybe AR technology will help spread the information riches to everyone. But, yes, as with any invasive technology, I remain concerned about the unintended consequences.” As with so many technological breakthroughs and refinements in the past decade, humanity’s engineers are realising science fiction’s blueprints, without reconciling them with science fiction’s accompanying warnings. In Baum’s The Master Key, which was subtitled with a phrase that offers a rather delicious description of Silicon Valley – An Electrical Fairy Tale, Founded Upon the Mysteries of Electricity and the Optimism of Its Devotees – the protagonist is given the magical spectacles by a demon. After a fortnight’s adventuring, he concludes that neither he nor the world is ready for the specs. On the third week, he returns the invention until, he says, that time when humankind knows how to use them. “There are competing notions of what AR is going to be,” says Fleetwood. “There are the people who think we’re going to be living in some mass consensual Neal Stephenson novel. I’m very against that. I hope we’ll see those companies that put design and empathy at the heart of what they do with AR winning out.” From star-gazing to bone-labelling... 10 apps that enhance reality Facebook Twitter Pinterest Quiver lets characters from children’s colouring pages come to life. 1. Prynt This crowdfunded adaptor attaches to your smartphone, allowing you to instantly print out 2x3in photos. Also when you take a picture, the Prynt app automatically records a digital video and creates a link to that photo on your phone. 2. Bamzooki This CBBC programme, broadcast between 2004 and 2010, provided an early large-scale glimpse into the potential of AR. Children could create digital creatures on a website that were then pitted against each other in a TV studio, while the audience watched via a graphics system that mixed the creatures into the real world. There is talk at the BBC of a similar programme returning, one that potentially allows children to pit their creatures against each other on the kitchen table or in the playground. 3. Lego Most Lego stores now feature widescreen TV on the wall, relaying a continual live feed of the view directly in front of the screen. If you step into the camera’s field with a box of Lego, a virtual, animated representation of the kit inside the box will come to life in front you. 4. Inkhunter This simple app lets you see what a tattoo will look like on your body by superimposing the image on to the camera feed from your smartphone. The app comes with a range of tattoo designs that can be edited and shared with friends. It’s also possible to upload your own designs to see how well they suit you. 5. Star Chart An elegant and hugely popular AR app for smartphones that annotates the night sky. Simply angle your phone toward the heavens and, by using GPS positioning, the app will label the stars, moons and planets above you. A quicker and potentially more effective way of learning about our galaxy than any text book. 6. Snapchat In the past year, the social media platform, whose videos are reportedly watched more than 6bn times a day, subtly shifted its focus on to AR through a selection of lenses. These lenses modify the phone’s camera feed in humorous ways, swapping people’s faces, “embiggening” their eyes, allowing them, for example, to puke rainbows. Snapchat became the first company to make a profit from AR on a large scale by selling and allowing companies to sponsor lenses. 7. Google Translate Google’s revelatory translation technology, underpinned by computer learning to constantly improve its interpretation, can now be used to annotate foreign text on the fly, using your phone’s camera feed. While the technology isn’t great at handling reams of text, particularly in non-roman scripts, it can prove invaluable at handling signage. 8. Arnatomy Perhaps the closest to Tom Caudell’s original vision [see main story] for AR, ARnatomy is able to identify and digitally label bones and muscles for medical students. It uses the camera to identify replicas of human bones, and when the user places a bone in front of the camera, it identifies which bone it is and adds visuals pointing to the parts of the bone, such as where muscles attach. 9. Smartspecs SmartSpecs enhance the visual appearance of everyday objects to augment vision for partially sighted people. By a combination of a 3D camera and Android-powered software, the specs highlight the edges and features of nearby objects – from walls, tables, doorways, signposts, buggies, and even faces – to enhance visibility. 10. Quiver This relatively simple yet effective use of AR brings colouring books to life. Print out the black and white drawings, colour them in in the traditional manner. When you view the completed picture through your phone’s camera using the Quiver app the picture comes to animated life on screen. Touch the screen and you can interact and play games with the character you have created.

It's a pilotless passenger aircraft that aims to someday add a vertical component to your commute. Think of Uber-like air taxis that can beat the traffic on Highway 101 by flying over it. Airbus has shared few details about the aircraft, but recently posted its first conceptual renderings on a Medium blog. The drawings depict a craft that can take off and land vertically. It has helicopter-like struts, and two sets of tilting wings each with four electric motors. There's room for a passenger under a canopy that retracts like a motorcycle helmet visor. Airbus, a rival of American icon Boeing (BA), is best known for its large jetliners like the double-decker A380. But it's also pouring big money into the future, and holds an advantage that many aviation startups with radical concepts don't have: Experience and funding. It is developing Vahana through its A3 unit, which formally opened this year in San Jose, the heart of California's tech community. Airbus made an initial $150 million funding commitment for its new venture capital unit, which is seeking out investments in disruptive technologies to speed up innovations in aerospace. "The aircraft we're building doesn't need a runway, is self-piloted, and can automatically detect and avoid obstacles and other aircraft," A3 chief executive Rodin Lyasoff wrote in September. "Designed to carry a single passenger or cargo, we're aiming to make it the first certified passenger aircraft without a pilot." Related: Billion-dollar startups The project hopes to fly a full-size prototype by the end of 2017 and eventually have something it can sell by 2020, Lyasoff wrote. For sure, commercial or passenger use of such a machine faces significant hurdles, including a lack of established standards for electric planes and any aircraft that doesn't have pilots. Airbus isn't the only manufacturing industry pillar to explore new areas of mobility. Car-makers Toyota and Honda have sought to expand into aviation. Honda delivered its first private jet in 2015 after three decades developing new aerospace technology. Related: Hybrid plane could help develop future electric airliners Airbus is trying to tap into a nascent, but fast-growing, field: the use of battery-powered electric propulsion technology to enable on-demand services. In this case, the vision is for air taxis that use "urban airways in a predictable and controlled manner," wrote Lyasoff. Airbus announced last year that one of the first A3 projects would be a collaboration with Uber to prove a new business model for helicopter operators. NASA, too, is investing heavily in researching electric propulsion and plans to fly its own design, the X-57, in 2018. Of course, flying taxis that don't have pilots pose some tricky safety issues. Airbus says that "sense and avoid" technology will be used to prevent midair collisions, and a ballistic parachute would deploy if a craft's engines malfunction. Airbus has intentionally separated A3 from the rest of its manufacturing operations in Europe, China and the U.S. Unlike its buttoned-up parent, A3 has hallmarks of a Silicon Valley startup: It has a recruiting profile on its website for "Jane Jackalope" -- a job listing for an executive who is a "jackalope of all trades."

An Avianca Boeing 787 on a flight from Madrid to Bogota with some 200 passengers aboard was cruising at high altitude near Venezuela's western border with Colombia Friday evening when a Venezuelan military plane was spotted on radar flying a short distance away, the Colombian Defense Ministry said in a statement yesterday. The Avianca pilot immediately notified Colombian aviation authorities and sharply diverted from the flight path. Four minutes later, the military aircraft split away and the jetliner resumed its course, the ministry said. More than 90 minutes after the flight landed safely in Bogota, Venezuela's air defense authorities told their Colombian counterparts that the military aircraft was on a routine patrol. Avianca said it was halting flights to Venezuela and would reroute several flights to Europe to avoid Venezuelan air space. But yesterday, the airline issued a statement saying it would resume flights to Venezuela today "following clarifications between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela." Venezuelan officials had not commented publicly on the incident, which comes amid a tension-filled standoff between President Nicolas Maduro and his opponents over the decision to suspend a recall referendum against the embattled socialist leader. Maduro frequently accuses neighboring Colombia of plotting with his critics to undermine his rule. Relations between the two nations have been hit by a number of crises over the past decade as Venezuela's role as Latin America's leftist stalwart has clashed with Colombia's traditionally staunch support for the United States. The two countries' foreign ministers spoke to each other and Maduro, who is on a multi-nation tour of the Middle East, personally ordered an investigation, the Colombian Defense Ministry said. Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas and his Venezuelan counterpart, Gen. Vladimir Padrino, also spoke and agreed to strengthen their early warning communications systems, the ministry added. Colombians across the political spectrum expressed alarm, attributing political overtones to the incident. "These maneuvers put in serious risk the lives of the passengers on the plane," said Rodrigo Lara, president of the government-aligned Radical Change party. "It's more evidence of the unpredictability of Nicolas Maduro's government." Avianca is one of the few foreign airlines still serving Caracas after a number of carriers slashed service or stopped selling tickets to Venezuelans because Maduro's government, facing a severe cash crunch triggered by low oil prices, hasn't allowed them to repatriate some $3.8 billion in funds held in the country.

An Avianca Boeing 787 on a flight from Madrid to Bogota with some 200 passengers aboard was cruising at high altitude near Venezuela's western border with Colombia Friday evening when a Venezuelan military plane was spotted on radar flying a short distance away, the Colombian Defense Ministry said in a statement yesterday. The Avianca pilot immediately notified Colombian aviation authorities and sharply diverted from the flight path. Four minutes later, the military aircraft split away and the jetliner resumed its course, the ministry said. More than 90 minutes after the flight landed safely in Bogota, Venezuela's air defense authorities told their Colombian counterparts that the military aircraft was on a routine patrol. Avianca said it was halting flights to Venezuela and would reroute several flights to Europe to avoid Venezuelan air space. But yesterday, the airline issued a statement saying it would resume flights to Venezuela today "following clarifications between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela." Venezuelan officials had not commented publicly on the incident, which comes amid a tension-filled standoff between President Nicolas Maduro and his opponents over the decision to suspend a recall referendum against the embattled socialist leader. Maduro frequently accuses neighboring Colombia of plotting with his critics to undermine his rule. Relations between the two nations have been hit by a number of crises over the past decade as Venezuela's role as Latin America's leftist stalwart has clashed with Colombia's traditionally staunch support for the United States. The two countries' foreign ministers spoke to each other and Maduro, who is on a multi-nation tour of the Middle East, personally ordered an investigation, the Colombian Defense Ministry said. Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas and his Venezuelan counterpart, Gen. Vladimir Padrino, also spoke and agreed to strengthen their early warning communications systems, the ministry added. Colombians across the political spectrum expressed alarm, attributing political overtones to the incident. "These maneuvers put in serious risk the lives of the passengers on the plane," said Rodrigo Lara, president of the government-aligned Radical Change party. "It's more evidence of the unpredictability of Nicolas Maduro's government."

The warplane briefly approached the airliner flying from Madrid to Bogota on Friday, prompting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to order an investigation. The incident took place Friday night, when Avianca's Boeing Dreamliner carrying 150 passengers detected the Venezuelan warplane "at close range," where it remained four minutes, the Colombian government said on Saturday. The fighter jet then turned north and roared away. The incident prompted diplomatic discussions and Maduro's order for an investigation. But Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, downplayed the incident early Saturday. "The ministers have spoken and cleared it all up, everything is normal," he said. "There's no need to worry." On the Venezuelan side, lawmaker Diosdado Cabello later called it a "regrettable misunderstanding. "I understand, to the best of my knowledge, there was a regrettable misunderstanding. It was nothing planned against Avianca in any way at all. It will be taken care of," said Cabello, who is also the number two in Maduro's administration. In the end, the suspension of two daily flights between Bogota and Caracas one daily flight between Caracas and Lima never took effect. The flights are to run as normal on Sunday, Avianca said. The airline had previously reduced the frequency of its flights to crisis-wracked Venezuela. Analysts have warned of a risk of violent unrest in this country of 30 million people. Hit by the fall in crude oil prices, the Venezuelan economy has crashed. Food shortages have prompted looting in recent months. Opposition leaders in Caracas plan mass street protests for next week, accusing the socialist government of staging a coup by blocking efforts for a recall referendum against the unpopular Maduro.

REUTERS/John Vizcaino By Girish Gupta and Julia Symmes Cobb | BOGOTA/CARACAS BOGOTA/CARACAS Colombia's Avianca airline AVT_p.CN will restart flights to Venezuela after one of its aircraft was approached by at least one Venezuelan warplane on Friday, creating a diplomatic incident and prompting the airline to cancel flights to and from the socialist country. Avianca said it would resume flights on Sunday, after cancelling transport to Venezuela when a passenger jet flying from Madrid to Bogota was briefly approached by Venezuelan military aircraft on Friday evening, resulting in diplomatic conversations and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordering an investigation. "After clarifications between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela about the incident registered last night in Venezuelan skies with an Avianca plane, the Colombian civil aviation authority has authorized the restart of operations to and from Venezuela," Avianca said in a statement on Saturday evening. The South American neighbors have for years had a volatile relationship, with Venezuela's socialist government sometimes accusing Colombia of provocation, and claims in the other direction that Caracas has supported Colombian guerrillas. The two countries' lengthy border is a constant source of tension. Data from online tracker FlightRadar24 showed Avianca's flights were avoiding Venezuela on Saturday and a source from the company confirmed to Reuters that flights to Venezuela had been canceled. Flight data also showed the Avianca Boeing Dreamliner took a sharp turn when flying over west Venezuela around 2000 local time (2000 EST/0000 GMT) on Friday, in line with a statement about the incident released by the Colombian defense ministry. Both nations' defense and foreign ministers discussed the plane incident, the statement said. It said Maduro "personally ordered the investigation into the case." "The ministers have spoken and cleared it all up, everything is normal," Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said during a visit to cacao growers on Saturday afternoon. "There's no need to worry." Venezuelan authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Colombian statement cited Venezuelan authorities as saying its warplane was on a "navigation mission."

An Avianca Boeing 787 on a flight from Madrid to Bogota with some 200 passengers aboard was cruising at high altitude near Venezuela's western border with Colombia Friday evening when a Venezuelan military plane was spotted on radar flying a short distance away, the Colombian Defence Ministry said in a statement. The Avianca pilot immediately notified Colombian aviation authorities and sharply diverted from the flight path. Four minutes later, the military aircraft split away and the jetliner resumed its course, the ministry said. More than 90 minutes after the flight landed safely in Bogota, Venezuela's air defence authorities told their Colombian counterparts that the military aircraft was on a routine patrol. Avianca said it was halting flights to Venezuela and would reroute several flights to Europe to avoid Venezuelan air space. But on Saturday, the airline issued a statement saying it would resume flights to Venezuela on Sunday "following clarifications between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela." Venezuelan officials had not commented publicly on the incident, which comes amid a tension-filled standoff between President Nicolas Maduro and his opponents over the decision to suspend a recall referendum against the embattled socialist leader. Maduro frequently accuses neighbouring Colombia of plotting with his critics to undermine his rule. Relations between the two nations have been hit by a number of crises over the past decade as Venezuela's role as Latin America's leftist stalwart has clashed with Colombia's traditionally staunch support for the United States. The two countries' foreign ministers spoke to each other and Maduro, who is on a multi-nation tour of the Middle East, personally ordered an investigation, the Colombian Defence Ministry said. Defence Minister Luis Carlos Villegas and his Venezuelan counterpart, Gen. Vladimir Padrino, also spoke and agreed to strengthen their early warning communications systems, the ministry added.

"These manoeuvrs put in serious risk the lives of the passengers on the plane," said Rodrigo Lara, president of the government-aligned Radical Change party. "It's more evidence of the unpredictability of Nicolas Maduro's government." Avianca is one of the few foreign airlines still serving Caracas after a number of carriers slashed service or stopped selling tickets to Venezuelans because Maduro's government, facing a severe cash crunch triggered by low oil prices, hasn't allowed them to repatriate some $3.8 billion in funds held in the country.

Venezuelan authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Colombian statement cited Venezuelan authorities as saying its warplane was on a "navigation mission."

According to the aviation company’s statement, its passenger plane bound for Minsk was forced to return to Zhulyany airport after departing from Kiev after the aircraft’s pilot received an order from a Ukrainian traffic controller to immediately head back, with no further explanation. “On October 21, 2016, Belavia Boeing 737-800 number EW-456PA, carrying out flight V2-840 from Zhulyany (Kiev) to Minsk was forced to return to the departure airport. There were 136 passengers and six crew members on board,” Belavia said in a statement, noting that, according to the flight schedule, the plane was a mere 50 kilometers from the Belarusian border when it was ordered to turn back. “It was also stated [by the traffic controllers] that in case the order was not fulfilled, fighter jets would be sent into the air,” the statement continued. The conversation between the pilot and air traffic controllers, including the threat to send fighter jets to intercept the plane, has been recorded and is currently in possession of Belavia, the company’s deputy director general, Igor Cherginets, told RIA Novosti news agency. The pilot in command of the plane later confirmed he had received the fighter jets threat from the ground.

We were in the Kiev sector. He contacted us and said that we must return to the Zhulyany airport," captain Viktor Shyshlo told Belarus television on Sunday, as quoted by RIA Novosti. "He [the air traffic controller] said that we would be informed on the cause [of diversion] on the ground, and that if we didn't follow the order to return, fighter jets would be scrambled," the pilot said, adding that his passengers' safety was his priority and that the crew "must follow all commands from the ground." Upon landing in Kiev, one of the passengers was taken off the flight by Ukrainian law enforcement before the plane was refueled and allowed to continue its flight to Minsk. Belavia airlines offered an apology to its passengers for the inconvenience, saying it intends to request compensation for the detour from Ukraine’s aviation authorities. However, Ukraine’s aviation authorities, insist the plane was ordered to return to Kiev to comply with an order from the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU), which explained that they had received intelligence about a possible threat to national security on board the plane in question. “Yesterday, our office received information about a foreign citizen and a possible threat to national security of our country. At the time we received this information, the person in question, as it appeared, was on board the Belavia airlines aircraft, which was supposed to depart to Minsk,” the chief of staff of the SSU, Alexander Tkachuk, told 112 Ukraine broadcaster, claiming that the SSU had acted within the framework of the law. He also refuted claims that Ukraine had threatened to scramble fighter jets to intercept the plane, calling them “absurd.” The passenger who appears to have been the cause of the incident was later released by authorities the same day and left Kiev for Minsk at 7pm. According to Strana.ua news outlet, he has been identified as Armen Martirosyan, a journalist, blogger, and anti-Maidan activist. According to the outlet, Martirosyan left Kiev and moved to Moscow back in 2014 after the Maidan revolution in Ukraine. In a Facebook post published after the incident, he wrote that he has already returned to Moscow and will reveal the details of his detention in Kiev and plans for further action after he speaks to his lawyers. Responding to a question about how he had managed to get away so quickly in the comments to this post, he wrote that “a friend’s call can solve many problems.” Belarus’ Foreign Ministry has filed a note of protest with the Ukrainian authorities over the forced return of the aircraft, and, on Saturday, called in the Chargé d’affaires of Ukraine in the Republic of Belarus, Valery Dzhigun, to express its discontentment with the incident. Belarus now expects an official apology and is demanding compensation for all financial costs and expenses incurred as a result of the actions of the Ukrainian authorities. Belarusian Ambassador to Ukraine Igor Sokol has also been instructed to submit a similar note of protest with Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry.

Ken Colburn: How safe are portable battery packs? Ken Colburn, Special for The Republic | azcentral.com 5:02 a.m. MST October 21, 2016 Despite the stories of exploding batteries, it’s quite rare when you consider all the devices we have with lithium ion batteries Take precautions to charge batteries safely. (Photo: Getty Images) Story Highlights Lithium Ion batteries are in just about every rechargeable device we own There is a potential for a "thermal runaway" chain reaction whenever the battery becomes overheated I’d suggest you stick to name brand chargers Question: How safe are portable power banks used to charge a cell phone or tablet? Answer: With all the exploding battery stories surrounding the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, there seems to be a heightened awareness of battery issues, which is actually a good thing. Lithium Ion batteries are in just about every rechargeable device we own and there have been many instances of them catching on fire in everything from laptops to hover boards to Tesla cars and even Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. In fact, there have been over 40 recalls by the Consumer Product Safety Commission since 2002 for products with defective lithium ion batteries. Despite all of the stories of exploding batteries, it’s actually quite rare when you take into consideration the number of devices we have with lithium ion batteries. Why batteries catch fire The very nature of how they work is also what subjects them to becoming a fire hazard. There is a potential for a "thermal runaway" chain reaction whenever the battery becomes overheated, so keeping any device as cool as possible is important. Well-made batteries have safety features built into the battery itself to prevent overcharging and overheating, which is why exploding batteries are relatively rare. Common mistakes The biggest mistake that most people make when using or charging a device with a lithium ion battery is contributing to the overheating. For example, using a laptop for extended periods on a soft surface, like a pillow or comforter usually blocks off any air vents and acts like an insulator, which keeps the heat from dissipating. This scenario can be even more hazardous if you’re charging the laptop at the same time as charging always generates additional heat. If your device has been exposed to direct sunlight and is hot to the touch, you should wait until it reaches room temperature before attempting to recharge it. Using the wrong charger to recharge your battery is another major contributor to problems, especially when too much energy is passed during the charging process. If you ever lose your charger, it’s always safest to replace it with the original manufacturers replacement instead of a third-party charger. Portable chargers To date, I’m not aware of any portable chargers that have been recalled because of a battery defect, but knowing that the design of the unit is a critical factor, I’d suggest you stick to name brand chargers. I’ve always been a fan of the products from Mophie (http://mophie.com), Anker (https://anker.com)  and IOGear (https://iogear.com). Choosing a charger A portable battery’s capacity is rated in milliamps hours or mAh and amperage (A) with the higher the numbers, the more capacity it has to charge your devices. Generally speaking, the higher the capacity, the larger the battery as well so finding the right combination of size and capacity is key. Start by determining the battery capacity of the item(s) you want to charge and then divide the capacity of the portable charger by that number to determine how many charges you can expect. If you plan on charging larger devices, like a tablet, you’ll also need to make sure the amperage is high enough to get the job done (usually 2A).

Here are five sound suggestions. Selena Maranjian (TMFSelena) Oct 23, 2016 at 8:50AM Image source: Getty Images. Viewing the dollars that you spend as investments can help you make smarter financial decisions. If you have $1,000 to spare, for example, instead of just buying a fancy new suit or TV, think about how you might best deploy it. Here are five smart things you can spend $1,000 on. Plump up an emergency fund If you're not independently wealthy, you probably need an emergency fund stocked with about three to nine months' worth of living expenses. If you experience a job loss or medical setback and your income shrinks or disappears for a while, you will need to be able to keep your roof over your head and food in your belly and the lights on. You'll need to be able to pay your insurance bills and keep your car running, too, among many other basic needs. If you already have such a fund, or a way to cover living expenses for a protracted period, great. If not, boosting your financial security with that $1,000 is a smart move. Image source: Getty Images. Pay off debt Next, do you have a significant debt burden? High-interest rate debt is especially dangerous, as it can spiral out of control rather quickly and can be very hard to pay off. Consider this example: If you carry a balance of $20,000 with a 25% annual interest rate and a minimum payment of 4%, it will take you 20 years to pay off that debt, and in the process you'll pay a total of more than $41,000. Whether you owe $2,000 or $20,000, applying $1,000 to reducing your debt can make a big difference in your financial health. If your interest rate is 25%, you can avoid paying $250 in interest! Invest in dividend-paying stock If you've got an emergency fund and are out of debt, parking that $1,000 in shares of stock that can grow and generate income is a powerful thing to do. If you invest in a stock that grows by 10% annually, your $1,000 can turn into $10,835 over 25 years. Better yet, if it kicks out 4% interest, you'll have $40 suddenly appear in your portfolio in the first year. If that payout grows by 6% annually over 25 years, it will eventually be generating $172 in annual income -- not bad for an initial investment of just $1,000. But wait -- there's more! Over the 25 years, your dividends would total more than $2,000 -- that's more than double your initial investment and separate from the stock-price appreciation. Image source: Getty Images. Start a child investing Another fine thing to do with $1,000 is to get one or more of your children (or grandchildren, nieces, nephews, neighbors) started investing. You might start them off with a copy of our book, The Motley Fool Investment Guide for Teens, and open a custodial brokerage account with them. Have discussions about companies and how they grow and face challenges. Have the kid(s) choose a few companies that interest them -- perhaps such as Apple, Boeing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Disney, Netflix, Nike, or Starbucks. You might buy a few shares of a few of them and then follow them in the news, watching as the stocks rise or fall. The kids will learn how the stock market works and can see how money can be made (and lost) in it. Treat yourself -- to an experience Finally, if all your financial ducks are in a row, you might simply treat yourself with that $1,000. Don't just buy a new toy, though. Studies have shown that spending money on experiences instead of material things tends to deliver sense of well-being. Experiences, after all, create memories that can be savored for a long time. Consider spending your money on travel or on lessons or on tickets to some great performances. Spend a little time thinking about the best ways in which you can spend any available dollars and you'll likely be happy you did.   Longtime Fool specialist Selena Maranjian, whom you can follow on Twitter, owns shares of Apple, Boeing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Netflix, Starbucks, and Walt Disney.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch By Alwyn Scott After two years of looking to expand, aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins Inc has struck a deal to buy aircraft interior maker B/E Aerospace Inc for $62 a share in cash and stock, the companies said on Sunday. The acquisition, valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt, expands the range of products Rockwell Collins supplies to major commercial and business aircraft and broadens its customer base internationally. Rockwell on Sunday also reported a 14 percent increase in profit to $1.58 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, on a 4 percent rise in sales. The acquisition, which is expected to be completed next spring, allows both companies to sell to each other’s customers and to deploy Rockwell’s capability with onboard connectivity to make internet-enabled seats, galleys, lavatories and other cabin systems that B/E Aerospace provides. “B/E is very strong in relationships with airlines,” Rockwell Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said in an interview. “We're stronger with aircraft makers as well as business aviation operators and the military. We’ll be able to sell our respective products into a much broader market base than either of us could do independently.” B/E Aerospace plans to use Rockwell’s dealer network and relationships with business jet owners, for example, to know when jets are coming in for avionics upgrades. “Having that information and time to market directly to the owners of the aircraft is a tremendous opportunity that we're looking to take advantage of,” said Amin Khoury, B/E Aerospace founder and chairman. “It's not something we can do on our own.” The combination is expected to produce cost savings of about $160 million, with 90 percent captured in the first full year of the acquisition, and provide a double-digit percentage boost to per-share earnings in the first full year, the companies said. They also anticipate it generating more than $6 billion in free cash flow over five years. The cost savings come from eliminating public company administration at B/E Aerospace, greater buying power with suppliers, consolidating information technology system and using low-cost factory labor across the combined company, Ortberg said. LITTLE PRODUCT OVERLAP Rockwell agreed to pay $34.10 a share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins stock, a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace's closing price on Friday. The purchase will curb Rockwell’s appetite for big deals for about three years, but the company will still be looking for smaller acquisitions while paying down debt, Ortberg said. The companies have little product overlap. Rockwell is best known for avionics, flight control systems and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other systems. Rockwell, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has market value of about $11 billion, more than twice the size of Wellington, Florida-based B/E Aerospace, which has a market value of $5.1 billion. The offer represents a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace's closing price on Friday. B/E Aerospace brings more aftermarket and aircraft retrofit business to Rockwell, which is mainly focused on new equipment, and also adds exposure to twin-aisle aircraft, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group. Combined sales will be about evenly split between the U.S. domestic market and international markets, Ortberg said. Pricing pressures from Boeing Co and Airbus are one driver of such a deal. "But it's also a pretty clear indicator that the market has peaked in terms of deliveries and orders," Aboulafia said of new aircraft sales. "In this environment, consolidation is inevitable as a cost-control move." Ortberg said that while cost was a factor, "It’s really the transition to the digital airplane that's creating the perfect timing to bring these two entities together.” Rockwell’s board set up a committee two years ago to examine whether to grow by expanding into new markets or partnering to use existing sales channels. “We thought that (latter strategy) was a much better approach,” he said.

AT&T to buy Time Warner: The two companies will hold a joint call Monday with more details on the $85 billion deal announced Saturday. The merger will be the one of the biggest media tie-ups of all time if it is approved by federal regulators. The acquisition positions AT&T to compete with Comcast and Disney, the biggest names in media and entertainment. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes will remain at the helm while the deal is under review, which could take more than a year. (Time Warner is the parent company of CNN.) 2. Big week for Apple: The consumer tech giant is expected to unveil a fresh line of Mac computers at a media event on Thursday. The MacBook Pro hasn’t gotten a major refresh in four years, and the MacBook Air has been largely the same since 2010. The event comes on the heels of Apple’s third quarter results, which it shares on Tuesday. We’ll get very early numbers on the iPhone 7, which went on sale around the world last month. 3. Earnings galore: We’re in the thick of earnings season. This week’s substantial batch includes Samsung, Visa, Ford, Amazon, Boeing, Coke, Alphabet and Twitter. Samsung’s call on Wednesday could signal the extent of damage wrought by the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 catastrophe. Investors will also dial in Wednesday to see if Nintendo offers more details on its newly announced Switch console. Visa’s results on Monday will show how much its deal with Costco is paying off. And on Thursday, Twitter’s call could provide much-needed insight on the company’s future — especially now that takeover prospects look bleak. 4. Economic bellwethers: The United States will release its first read on third quarter GDP Friday. Economists (and, most likely, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton) are crossing their fingers for stronger numbers than were posted this spring. America’s economy grew only 1.2% between April and June, compared to the same period the year before. The number fell below many predictions. 5. Coming this week: Monday – AT&T and Time Warner call and AT&T earnings, Visa earnings Tuesday – Apple, GM, Fiat-Chrysler and Chipotle earnings Wednesday – Southwest Airlines, Nintendo, Airbus, Boeing, Coca-Cola earnings Thursday – Apple’s Mac reveal; Alphabet, Samsung, Amazon, Twitter, Ford, UPS, ConocoPhillips earnings Friday – MasterCard and Anheuser-Busch earnings, third-quarter U.S. GDP AT&T, Time Warner deal faces tough regulatory fight Gabler Congratulates Owners of The UPS Store Related Posts Rebats Available to Help Residents Conserve Energy, Money 10 car companies make automatic brakes standard From life sentence to White House guest: one ex-con’s journey Investors still greedy despite job market woes Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Lamborghini has signed a new research cooperation deal with MIT and their Italy Program. This plan seeks to spearhead the development the new-millennium Supercar by allowing the Institute's professors and students to work alongside the firm's engineers, mainly in the field of new materials. At EmTech, Boston's annual symposium on emerging technologies, the Institute for Foreign Commerce (ICE) sponsered a panel dedicated to trailblazing “Made in Italy” manufacturers and their partnerships with American businesses. Members of the “Innovation through Collaboration” panel included ICE president Michele Scannavini, Federmacchine board member and ex-president Alberto Maria Sacchi, and Lamborghini CEO/president Stefano Domenicali. “It's a great opportunity to discuss Italian contributions to technology,” says Scannavini. “We seek to increase our efforts in industrial and commercial digitalization, and to foster interactions between Italian and American researchers. In 2017 we will host road shows in four American cities, dedicated to aerospace, biotech, start-ups, and advanced manufacturing.” Sacchi adds that, “Italy is already one of the world leaders in surplus manufacturing, thanks to a machinery industry that understands production chains and is capable of providing flexible solutions. Nowadays, even manufacturers can adapt and change their structure along with the impetuous evolution of technology. The United States can play a very important role in developing the machinery industry, if our companies can conform to their production chains.” In this sense, “the Lamborghini-MIT deal is a shining example of this cooperation paradigm”. Domenicali emphasized that the objective of “becoming trendsetters in the luxury and sports vehicle sector” is aided by their relationship with MIT, “the frontier of innovation”. Also participating in the panel was Armando Varricchio, Italian ambassador to the US, who claimed that this wa2 a building block “in cooperations between Italian industry and American research.” The presence of advanced manufacturers has become one of the country's “industrial miracles”. More than 500 Italian machinery firms do business in the US, with clients such as Boeing, Ford, and NASA. Lamborghini is working on carbon fibers with Boeing. The Ministry of Economic Development and IBM are developing the first European IBM Watson healthcare center. And Italy, at the vanguard of Industry 4.0, holds many records: more than 30% of exports are in industrial machinery, and Italy is second in the world in industry competitiveness. Italy is currently the third-largest European exporter of flexible manufacturing technologies, such as robotics, to the United States, valued at $9.6 billion. © ITALY EUROPE 24 - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED About us Contact us Subscribe Suggestions Privacy policy | Extended cookie policy

As an oxy-acetylene regulator and torch repair business, Welding Apparatus was a primary repair center throughout the Northwest. By 1978, a full line of welding supplies, equipment and gases were added, and the business became known as Anvil Welding Supply. After selling the welding supply business in 1996, maintenance welding alloys and welding inspection were the company's primary focus. It is from welding inspection and the current state of economy that the idea of a welding school developed. Here he works with student Wyatt Steinebach. The business is 4227 E. Trent.DAN PELLE danp@spokesman.com (Dan Pelle / The Spokesman-Review) SUNDAY, OCT. 23, 2016 Front and Center: Lonnie Benn turned a passion for welding as a teenager into a successful career By Michael Guilfoil Correspondent Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Five facts Father started business: 1960 Lonnie Benn bought it: 1980 Employees: three (including two co-owners) Students: mostly young men seeking to become certified welders More information: anvilweldinginstruction.com; (509) 891-5914 Some kids are content to build treehouses. Not Lonnie Benn. “I built an open-cockpit submarine, maybe 20 feet long, in my backyard. I never finished it because I couldn’t afford the motor and batteries. But I had the diving tanks and valve systems and all that stuff.” That same year, Benn enrolled in Spokane Community College’s two-year welding program. “When they found out I was 15, they kicked me out. I went back when I was 16, and by the time I graduated from West Valley High School, I was pretty much done with the SCC program.” Benn has been around welding more than five decades. “And when you’re on the job,” he says, “you’re always teaching people.” So four years ago, he and his wife, Brenda, launched Anvil Welding Instruction at 4227 E. Trent. “Lots of young people want to learn a trade,” Benn explained, “and I enjoy helping them.” During a recent interview, Benn discussed building a swing set in Thailand, the revelation that led to his trade school, and the magic of old TV westerns. S-R: Where did you grow up? Benn: I was born in Renton, Washington. When I was 13, my dad quit his job as a Linde factory repairman and started repairing cylinder regulators over here. The business was originally called – and is still legally called – Welding Apparatus Repair. In the ’60s and ’70s, we were the king of regulator repair, with clients as far away as Wyoming. S-R: Were you involved with the business back then? Benn: Sure. When I’d come home from school, that’s what I’d do. Then I learned to braze and weld, and did stuff for other people. I welded on a lot of other kids’ cars. (Editor’s note: Brazing, soldering and welding are all techniques for joining pieces of metal. Soldering involves melting a filler at below 700 degrees to bond metals. Brazing requires heat of 700 to 1,600 degrees, depending on the filler. Welding fuses two similar metals together by melting them at around 2,400 degrees. When properly done, a weld is as strong as the surrounding metal.) S-R: What was your first welding project? Benn: I started out just cutting people’s names in fireplace grates when I was 14. S-R: Then what? Benn: This will sound crazy, but I was a fan of “Sea Hunt” (the 1958-61 TV series featuring actor Lloyd Bridges), so when I was 15, I built an open-cockpit submarine in my backyard. S-R: Did you have a favorite class in high school? Benn: I was really good at science, and I liked my shop class – welding. S-R: You mentioned also taking welding classes at SCC. Did you finish that program? Benn: No, I didn’t have enough money, so I got a job. And as soon as I quit college, I was drafted and joined the Air Force. Since I had a welding background, they sent me to Georgia to weld on jet parts, which was great. After a year, I was put in charge of a welding shop in Thailand and fixed all kinds of stuff – from plumbing, fencing and Dumpsters to building a swing set for the base hospital. S-R: How long were you in the Air Force? Benn: Three and a half years. After I got out, I started working for my dad again, repairing regulators and torches. Then in the mid-’70s I became a factory rep, traveling all over teaching people how to use the manufacturer’s welding products. A few years later, when a local liquid-gas company began dropping all its small accounts, I returned to the family business. We picked up a lot of those accounts and grew like crazy. S-R: Until? Benn: In the late ’90s, when the whole (gas supply) industry became more like Costco – a few big, national companies. We were surviving, but knew there wasn’t much future in it. So when we had a real good offer, we sold the business. S-R: And you changed careers again? Benn: Yes. I’d already done sales and repairs, so I studied for a couple of years, working weekends at Home Depot, and got my welding inspection license. After that, I inspected dams and hundreds of buildings around here, including the Convention Center addition. S-R: What led to you starting your school? Benn: I was on an inspection job in South Dakota, and it suddenly came to me that it was time to do what I enjoy most, which it teaching others this trade. I’m not against college, but so many people graduate and then flounder, working in fast food. At this school, we can take people who have never welded or used a grinder, and in 10 weeks they can become certified, with lots of job opportunities. S-R: Did people line up to take your welding classes? Benn: No, we struggled for the first year and a half. We started with three students and four welding machines. SNAP loaned us $5,000 to buy one more machine, and the Boeing Employees Credit Union and SNAP just awarded us a $5,000 grant. Currently we have 13 students, and no openings until December. S-R: How else has the business evolved? Benn: We started out primarily appealing to hobbyists, but we realized we’d never make it focusing on that market. So we spent four months and a few thousand dollars getting a state license to operate a private vocational school. After that, WorkSource automatically became one of our customers. And we have our WABO welding certification, which is required on commercial job sites. S-R: Spokane Community College still teaches welding. How is Anvil different? Benn: The community college’s certification course takes nine months. Here we can certify you in five or 10 weeks, and I think it’s a better course. I’ve been a welder in all sorts of industries. It’s a hard trade to learn – sort of like learning to write your name the first time – but because we’re small, right away we can show students what they’re doing wrong. S-R: How much do your courses cost? Benn: The basic course is $3,000, including all accessories needed to get started. That’s 160 hours over five weeks. Advanced class, such as learning aerospace welding, cost between $1,300 and $2,600. Recreational welders can pay $60 for a half day of instruction and/or use of equipment on Saturdays. S-R: Who else teaches welding locally? Benn: OXARC has their school, so we’re competitors. S-R: Did you have a mentor? Benn: Eldon Steelman, who helped start the OXARC school, has been a good friend, and he has a lot of sayings I use. For instance, when new students come in, I tell them, “By the time you hate me and hate welding, that’s when you’re just starting to learn.” S-R: What’s the best business advice you’ve gotten? Benn: The whole thing isn’t about money. It’s about having a vision and doing what’s best for your students, even if they don’t know it. S-R: Do you have a mantra in class? Benn: “It’s all about the puddle” – controlling that red-hot liquid where you’re joining two pieces of metal. S-R: What do you like most about your job? Benn: Seeing young people leave here excited about their future. S-R: What do you like least? Benn: Students with real talent who don’t apply themselves. S-R: What’s their age range? Benn: Some have been as old as their late 50s, but generally 18 to 23, and mostly men. S-R: What’s the career outlook? Benn: The American Welding Society predicts there will be a huge demand for welders during the next 20 years. Our graduates get jobs right away, because a lot of older welders are retiring. S-R: What’s a typical starting wage? Benn: $13 or $15 an hour for local, indoor jobs. Outside jobs, where they work on dams or buildings, start at $20 to $30 an hour. S-R: What sort of person is best suited for this trade? Benn: Good welders look at everything that makes it work – the rods, the machines, metallurgy. It’s a huge subject. People leave here thinking they know it all because now they’re certified. And I tell them, “Just wait three or four years.” S-R: What do people ask when they discover you weld? Benn: Everyone has something they need welded. S-R: How do you relax? Benn: I watch about a half-hour of “Gunsmoke” or “Death Valley Days” every night. They haven’t made anything much better since I was in high school. S-R: What’s at the top of your bucket list? Benn: I’d like to take a week or two off and travel. S-R: When’s the last time you had a vacation? Benn: (laugh) Three-and-half or four years ago … something like that. This interview has been condensed.

Scientists Say Temporary Oxygen Deprivation Might Cure Jet Lag © Sputnik/ Maksim Blinov Tech 04:43 23.10.2016Get short URL 280449 According to a recent study, airplanes might start to pump less oxygen to their cabins in effort to help passengers cope with jet lag. © Flickr/ The 621st Contingency Response Wing Wings, Tail Completed for Civilian Freighter Version of C-130J Airplane - Lockheed MartinJet lag, that terrible state of travel-upended internal rhythms and wrecked sleep, has plagued transcontinental air passengers for decades. Now, scientists might have finally discovered a cure for the condition: temporary oxygen deprivation. A group of researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and the University of Bristol in England has discovered that there's a connection between jet lag and oxygen. The study, published October 20 in the journal Cell Metabolism, explains that the researchers used mice, who are nocturnal animals, to determine what factors influence our circadian systems — the biological clocks that tune all our organs and keeps is in sync with change of day to night. The scientists noted that mice consumed more oxygen during their active phase (which is night) than during their sleep phase (day), and found out that the difference is expressed deep within the very cells that our tissues are made of. Later, they conducted a series of experiments both with tissue samples and live mice to determine whether oxygen regulation can alter biological rhythms. First, the scientists created an artificial cycle of 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. Then, they suddenly changed the phase, altering the cycle by six hours — the equivalent of a flight from Chicago to London. Several hours prior to that shift, some mice were given less oxygen than they would normally breathe, 16% instead of the 21% that makes up Earth's typical air. © Wikipedia/ Ken Fielding US Approves $1.9Bln Sale of Boeing Refuelling Aircraft to JapanIt turned out that mice who took inless oxygen managed to tune into the new cycle of "day" and "night" "considerably" faster than their counterparts, who breathed normal air. The scientists also tested a brief two-hour "pulse" of only 14% oxygen. This also returned positive results, as mice adapted to the new schedule even faster. When traveling in an average airliner, people breathe some 16 percent oxygen, which is about as much as air 8,000 feet above sea level would contain. The reduced amount of oxygen contributes to the feeling of being airsick — an unpleasant effect that airlines try to get rid of. Recent developments in aircraft design allow for more oxygen to be pumped into cabins, which might help people get rid of air sickness, but will likely increase jet lag in return. Now, airlines may consider letting you suffocate a little so you can sleep better when back on the ground. ...

Stop Video Replay 2:38 News break – October 23 UP NEXT VIDEO News break – October 23. Source: Sunrise News break – October 23 The warplane briefly approached the airliner flying from Madrid to Bogota on Friday, prompting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to order an investigation. The incident took place Friday night, when Avianca's Boeing Dreamliner carrying 150 passengers detected the Venezuelan warplane "at close range," where it remained four minutes, the Colombian government said on Saturday. The fighter jet then turned north and roared away. The incident prompted diplomatic discussions and Maduro's order for an investigation. But Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, downplayed the incident early Saturday. "The ministers have spoken and cleared it all up, everything is normal," he said. "There's no need to worry." On the Venezuelan side, lawmaker Diosdado Cabello later called it a "regrettable misunderstanding. "I understand, to the best of my knowledge, there was a regrettable misunderstanding. It was nothing planned against Avianca in any way at all. It will be taken care of," said Cabello, who is also the number two in Maduro's administration. In the end, the suspension of two daily flights between Bogota and Caracas one daily flight between Caracas and Lima never took effect. The flights are to run as normal on Sunday, Avianca said. The airline had previously reduced the frequency of its flights to crisis-wracked Venezuela. Analysts have warned of a risk of violent unrest in this country of 30 million people. Hit by the fall in crude oil prices, the Venezuelan economy has crashed. Food shortages have prompted looting in recent months. Opposition leaders in Caracas plan mass street protests for next week, accusing the socialist government of staging a coup by blocking efforts for a recall referendum against the unpopular Maduro.

Photo: Ariana Cubillos, Associated Press Venezuela braces for tensions over recall 1 / 2 Back to Gallery CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela is bracing for turbulence after the socialist government blocked a presidential recall referendum in a move opposition leaders are calling a coup. The opposition urged supporters to take to the streets, beginning with a march on a major highway Saturday led by the wives of jailed activists, while a leading government figure, Diosdado Cabello, called for the arrest of high-profile government critics. Polls suggest socialist President Nicolas Maduro would lose a recall vote. But that became a moot issue Thursday when election officials issued an order suspending a recall signature drive a week before it was to start. “What we saw yesterday was a coup,” said former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, who had been the leading champion of the recall effort. “We’ll remain peaceful, but we will not be taken for fools. We must defend our country.” International condemnation was swift. Twelve western hemisphere nations, including the U.S. and even leftist-run governments such as Chile and Uruguay, said in a statement Friday that the suspension of the referendum and travel restrictions on the opposition leadership affects the prospect for dialogue and finding a peaceful solution to the nation’s crisis. In another sign of growing regional tensions, Colombia’s flagship airline on Saturday briefly grounded all flights to Caracas after a mid-air incident involving one of its planes and the Venezuelan air force. Avianca said one of its Boeing 787s was flying near Venezuela’s western border with Colombia when a Venezuelan military aircraft was spotted on radar flying a short distance away. The commercial jet diverted from its course but landed safely. The socialists won power nearly two decades ago with the election of the popular former President Hugo Chavez, and for years enjoyed easy election victories. But with the economy in free fall, polls show most Venezuelans have turned against the party, and over the years, the administration has gradually become increasingly autocratic.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 3:30 AM, October 23, 2016 Updated: 5:50 AM, October 23, 2016 BOGOTA/CARACAS - Colombia's Avianca airline is avoiding Venezuelan airspace after a flight from Spain was approached by at least one warplane on Friday, creating a diplomatic incident, according to flight data, an airline source and authorities. Colombia's Defense Ministry said the plane flying from Madrid to Bogota was briefly approached by a Venezuelan military plane, resulting in diplomatic conversations and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordering an investigation. There was as yet no official word from Avianca, but a source at the carrier told Reuters it had suspended flights to and over Venezuela after two warplanes approached its plane on Friday evening, forcing it out of Venezuelan airspace. Data from online tracker FlightRadar24 confirmed Avianca's flights were avoiding Venezuela on Saturday. It also showed Avianca's Boeing Dreamliner took a sharp turn when flying over west Venezuela around 2000 local time (2000 EST/0000 GMT), in line with a statement by Colombian authorities. Both nations' defense and foreign ministers have discussed the plane incident, Colombia said. It said Maduro "personally ordered the investigation into the case." "The ministers have spoken and cleared it all up, everything is normal," Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said during a visit to cacao growers. "There's no need to worry." The South American neighbors have for years had a volatile relationship, with Venezuela's socialist government sometimes accusing Colombia of provocation, and claims in the other direction that Caracas has supported Colombian guerrillas.

Avianca said it would resume flights on Sunday, after cancelling transport to Venezuela when a passenger jet flying from Madrid to Bogota was briefly approached by Venezuelan military aircraft on Friday evening, resulting in diplomatic conversations and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordering an investigation. "After clarifications between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela about the incident registered last night in Venezuelan skies with an Avianca plane, the Colombian civil aviation authority has authorized the restart of operations to and from Venezuela," Avianca said in a statement on Saturday evening. The South American neighbors have for years had a volatile relationship, with Venezuela's socialist government sometimes accusing Colombia of provocation, and claims in the other direction that Caracas has supported Colombian guerrillas. The two countries' lengthy border is a constant source of tension. Data from online tracker FlightRadar24 showed Avianca's flights were avoiding Venezuela on Saturday and a source from the company confirmed to Reuters that flights to Venezuela had been cancelled. Flight data also showed the Avianca Boeing Dreamliner took a sharp turn when flying over west Venezuela around 2000 local time (2000 EST/0000 GMT) on Friday, in line with a statement about the incident released by the Colombian defense ministry. Both nations' defense and foreign ministers discussed the plane incident, the statement said. It said Maduro "personally ordered the investigation into the case." "The ministers have spoken and cleared it all up, everything is normal," Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said during a visit to cacao growers on Saturday afternoon. "There's no need to worry." Venezuelan authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Colombian statement cited Venezuelan authorities as saying its warplane was on a "navigation mission."

Containers arriving and leaving the Wando Welch Terminal are unloaded and loaded for shipment. Foreign trade is a large part of the South Carolina economy. Tim Dominick tdominick@thestate.com i By Jeff Wilkinson jwilkinson@thestate.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s nominee for president, might be leading in the polls in South Carolina, but his economic positions on immigration and foreign trade would hurt the Palmetto State’s economy, experts say. However, Sen. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has softened her support for a major free trade deal as the campaign has progressed, they say. And free trade is perhaps the most important economic issue for South Carolina workers because the state is manufacturing heavy, export and import dependent and has one of the nation’s leading ports. Like the majority of the America public, economists and business leaders interviewed are not overly enamored with either candidate. One economist even refused to comment because he felt the plans weren’t worthy of comment. But the majority of those interviewed feel Clinton’s proposed economic policies – particularly her call for comprehensive immigration reform – are more in line with South Carolina’s economic goals. “Both candidates appear to be less focused on free trade relative to Obama, Bush – both W. and H.W. – Bill Clinton and Reagan,” said Mark Witte, College of Charleston economist and director of the school’s Master of Business Administration program. “And given that so much of South Carolina’s trade relations are with Europe, free trade is a big, big deal for workers here.” Witte added that Trump’s opposition to free trade deals that he deems poor might play well in the unionized rust belt, but don’t apply or are counterproductive to the growing manufacturing base in South Carolina. We don’t have the same problem as other states (in the Midwest and Northeast) have. We’re not shipping jobs off to Mexico. Europe is shipping jobs here. Mark Witte, College of Charleston economist “We don’t have the same problem as other states” in the Midwest and Northeast, he added. “We’re not shipping jobs off to Mexico. Europe is shipping jobs here.” ‘Economic pillars’ The three pillars of South Carolina’s economy are manufacturing, tourism and agribusiness. All three would be negatively impacted by Trump’s positions on either free trade or immigration, economists say. “Tourism and agriculture are the top two industries in the state,” said Joseph Von Nessen, an economist with the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, which is home to the nation’s leading international business program. “Manufacturing is not quite as large, but is right up there.” Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis compiled by Von Nessen show: Manufacturing represents about 12 percent of employment in South Carolina, and contributes about $33 billion in gross state product ▪  Manufacturing represents about 12 percent of employment in South Carolina, and contributes about $33 billion in gross state product. ▪  Tourism represents approximately 13 percent of employment and $10 billion in gross state product. ▪  Agribusiness is about 6 percent of the state’s employment and $27 billion in gross state product. Although economists say Trump’s policies would threatened the stability of the state’s main industries, a majority of South Carolinians – particular poorer whites in rural areas where jobs are scarce – still support him. Raising tariffs? Lowing taxes? Experts interviewed said that Trump’s stance on free trade – such as his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and his threats to raise tariffs against Mexico and China – could cost South Carolina jobs. Clemson economist Scott Baier, interim chairman of the school’s John E. Walker Department of Economics, said, “The immediate impact would be on consumers and producers that use imported intermediate goods,” referring to parts used in the manufacture of other products. In 2015, South Carolina imported more than $9 billion in goods from China and Mexico. In 2015, he said, the state imported more than $9 billion in goods from China and Mexico. “Many of these imports were used as intermediate goods,” he said. “If the state would have to turn to other suppliers, it would up the costs of doing business and may cost jobs in the state rather than create jobs.” For example, nearly 50 percent of the nation’s auto parts are imported from Mexico and China, Baier said, and the port of Charleston is one of the leading destinations for those auto imports. “In addition, you worry about a trade war where China and Mexico would raise tariffs on our goods,” he said. “This could reduce the market for our exports and slow job growth in South Carolina.” Trump has said his tax plans, which would cut income taxes across the board and drastically lower corporate taxes to 15 percent from 35 percent, would spur job growth. “You will find varying estimates on the economic impact of the two candidates’ plans,” Baier said. “The success of Secretary Clinton's fiscal plan depends largely on the faith that the government expenditures will help grow the economy and that the higher taxes on top income earners will have little impact on the how they choose to work and spend. For Mr Trump, the success of his plan depends on the belief that lower taxes creates the incentive for the private sector to create jobs and boost economic growth as well as Mr Trump's ability to reduce government expenditures.” ‘Our customers are in Europe’ Witte, the College of Charleston economist, said opposition to TPP by both Trump and now Clinton, as well as Trump’s threat to dismantle NAFTA, would have less impact on South Carolina than other parts of the country. However, a future trade agreement with the European Union – an agreement called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – could be a huge boost to the state, he said. But negotiations on that agreement have stalled because of opposition by some unions, charities, non-governmental organizations and environmentalists, particularly in Europe. “It’s all about where your clients are,” Witte said. “Our customers are in Europe. If we have a free trade agreement with them, we’ll be able to export more to them” because the goods – mostly cars and tires – could be sold for a lower price. Witte added that if Trump imposes tariffs on China and Mexico, trade would likely shift to other cheap labor countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh and India. That would having little impact on U.S. consumers, he said, “but inconvenience many multi-national firms.” If we make it hard for (multi-national corporations) to compete, one of the things they will cut will be jobs Republican consultant Chip Felkel Republican consultant Chip Felkel of Greenville noted that those multi-national firms are driving South Carolina’s new manufacturing base – firms like BMW, Michelin, Boeing, Continental and Volvo. “You’ve got a manufacturing community that is so critical to our economy,” he said. “If we make it hard for them to compete, one of the things they will cut will be jobs.” Efforts to interview S.C. Commerce Secretary Bobby Hitt for this story were unsuccessful. However in a prepared statement he said: “There are numerous factors that impact the global business environment. And, from a business perspective, South Carolina remains committed to ensuring that we maintain a business-friendly climate – one that provides our companies with the resources they need to succeed in marketplaces around the world.” ‘Keep them in the system’ Tourism and agriculture, the other two pillars of South Carolina’s economy, rely heavily on foreign workers, along with the vital construction industry. Trump has made tougher immigration laws and coming down hard on illegal immigrants the bedrock of his campaign. Clinton has promised comprehensive immigration reform involving guest worker programs and a path to citizenship to allow illegal immigrants to keep working, but as yet hasn’t delivered any firm plan on how to do it. “Clinton is making comprehensive immigration a priority, but we don’t know what those plans would look like,” Witte said. “Trump has been very audible about limiting immigration. But illegal immigration exists because legal immigration is so difficult.” John Durst, president and CEO of the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association, said his organization for years has joined state and national hospitality, agriculture and construction associations to call for immigration reform. “And that appears to be consistent with the position Senator Clinton has taken,” he said. Some mass exodus is not going to help this state Republican consultant Chip Felkel Felkel, the Republican consultant, added that Trump’s plan to deport illegal immigrants rather than create a way for them to continue working legally would have disastrous affects on the state. “What has launched Trump for so many people is his pounding the table and saying he was the savior to fix immigration,” he said. “But some mass exodus is not going to help this state. Those small business people that run hotels on the Grand Strand or farm in the Pee Dee would be crippled. “Yes, there has to be better enforcement of the laws on the books,” he said. “But we need a viable, prudent, logical solution. Register legally, make amends, pay a fine, go to the back of the line, but stay in the system.” But the experts also noted that no president can implement immigration reform or create trade policy without the consent of Congress. “A lot of what happens will depend on who controls the House and Senate,” said Baier, the Clemson economist. “While we often complain about gridlock, sometimes gridlock is a good thing. It can slow the implementation of bad policies or at lease allow us to rethink and formulate new policies that will likely lead to better outcomes.” The candidates’ economic positions FOREIGN TRADE ▪  Trump would potentially place large tariffs on goods from China and Mexico, which represent 50 percent of the imports used to manufacture cars produced in South Carolina. ▪  Trump opposes the TPP and would repeal NAFTA if, he says, other countries aren't playing fair. ▪  Clinton helped negotiate TPP, but now she says she opposes it. She prefers small tweaks to the status quo in terms of foreign trade. IMMIGRATION ▪  Trump wants to build a wall to prevent illegal immigration, close the borders and has even suggested millions of illegals be deported. ▪  Clinton wants immigration reform which conceivably would make it easier for workers to come in legally and those already here to become legal. ▪  Trump opposes any pathway to legal status for those now here illegally, and has called for an end to “birth right citizenship” presently granted to anyone born in the United States regardless of their parents’ citizenship. TAXES ▪  Trump wants to lower taxes across the board, especially for the rich, and drop significantly taxes on corporate America. He would lower revenues over 10 years to $9.6 trillion, according to the Tax Policy Center’s study. ▪  Clinton would leave the middle class about the same and raise dramatically the taxes on the top 1 percent. She said her plan would increase revenues by $1.1 trillion a year. ▪  Clinton would raise from 40 percent to 45 percent the estate taxes on individuals who receive more than $3.5 million in inheritance and couples who receive more than $7 million. Trump would eliminate the so called “death tax.” Related content If US-EU trade deal is dead, what does that mean for South Carolina?

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Oct 23, 2016 - Page 16　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Bombardier to cut 7,500 more jobs; deliveries delayed AFP, MONTREAL A new Bombardier CS100 passenger jetliner waits on the tarmac at Zurich Airport, Switzerland, on July 6. Photo: AFP Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc on Friday said it was cutting 7,500 jobs, its second major layoff announcement this year following delays in deliveries of its C-series airplanes. The job cuts, to be completed by the end of 2018, are expected to mostly hit administrative posts, with two-thirds from the transport division, a Bombardier spokesman said. These layoffs come on the heels of a February announcement to eliminate 7,000 manufacturing jobs. The two rounds of job cuts account for about 20 percent of Montreal-based Bombardier’s workforce. Bombardier, which has taken on debt to finance its ambitious plane-building program, said the latest downsizing would result in annual savings of about US$300 million as part of a five-year plan to turn the firm around. “The actions announced today will ensure we have the right cost structure, workforce and organization to compete and win in the future,” chief executive Alain Bellemare said in a statement. Bombardier has been trying to accelerate production of the C Series, as well as to develop the new Global 7000 business jet, scheduled to begin production in 2018. The company announced plans to hire as many as 3,750 employees to speed these initiatives, according to Canadian media reports. Bellemare said the new jobs would be added in low-cost countries and more established higher-cost operations. “It’s the only way that we can protect the thousands of jobs in the industry and at Bombardier. It’s a very competitive industry and it’s important to take the necessary steps to remain competitive in this context,” he was quoted as saying Bombardier had touted the C Series, its first completely new aircraft in the 100 to 150-seat category in more than 25 years, as a means to cut into the dominance of US aerospace giant Boeing Co and European rival Airbus Group SE. However, the project has been stymied by delays, with Bombardier announcing last month that it cut its this year’s forecast for deliveries of the plane from 15 to seven due to engine delivery delays from Pratt & Whitney. Costs for the C Series program have risen to US$5.4 billion, Bombardier has estimated. The Quebec government came to the rescue of Bombardier last year, investing US$1.0 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in its C Series plane program.

No pricing details were given in the filing. The company intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol INTR. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, RBC Capital and Credit Agricole CIB.   This global leasing company acquires and leases passenger aircraft to a diverse group of airlines throughout the world. Intrepid’s strategy is to firmly establish it as a leading aircraft lessor of primarily, though not exclusively, young, modern, fuel-efficient twin-engine wide-body passenger aircraft with long-term leases to well-established airlines, while seeking to maximize long-term earnings growth and returns through the economic cycle. The company believes its portfolio that consists mainly of wide-body aircraft will allow it to meet the needs of airlines’ growing preference for larger gauge aircraft due to increasing demand for air travel. Intrepid believes that it is the only aircraft lessor primarily focused on acquiring and leasing twin-engine wide-body passenger aircraft, which it believes is a relatively less competitive market segment that has substantial latent demand. The company also intends to expand its fleet mix by acquiring select narrow-body passenger aircraft that it expects to have long useful lives and that are currently in widespread use and in-demand by airlines, while still maintaining a greater focus on acquiring wide-body aircraft. In the filing the company said: Our owned and committed portfolio includes popular twin-engine widebody passenger aircraft such as the Airbus A330-300, Airbus A330-200, Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, as well as the popular Airbus A321 narrowbody passenger aircraft. As of June 30, 2016, we owned 28 aircraft. Our owned aircraft as of June 30, 2016 have an average age of 2.9 years and our aircraft on lease have an average remaining lease term of 8.5 years. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to continue to purchase aircraft currently on order with Boeing and Airbus, as well as for general corporate purposes to support continued growth.

Modi, who visited the city for the first time after becoming Prime Minister, said the airport will add another bright spot to the city. "I am happy that after the formation of the new NDA government, two airports in the country have become a part of the green movement. "The first was in Kochi and the second such airport is being dedicated to the nation at Vadodara. This airport will be zero discharge, waste to wealth, energy saving and environment friendly," he said. "It will be considered as one of the top-class airports of the country," Modi said. He said the airport is constructed on the principle of green infrastructure using bricks of fly ash. "Construction of such iconic buildings on green concept will encourage citizens to take up construction on these lines," said the Prime Minister. Spread in an area of 17,500 sq mt, the new integrated terminal has been built at a cost of Rs 160 crore. It has been designed to handle 700 passengers, including international fliers, per hour with 18 check-in counters, which would help in a seamless boarding process. It took about seven years to complete the project as the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel had laid the foundation stone in 2009. The 8,100-meter-long runway of the Vadodra airport can handle small and narrow body aircraft such as Airbus 320 and Boeing 737s. Besides national carrier Air India, private airlines likes IndiGo and Jet airways are operating from here. Stressing on the need to focus on connectivity for development, Modi said the first Railway University to be set up here is an important decision in this direction and will impact the next century. "The government has taken a very important decision whose impact will be felt for nearly 100 years. And the decision is that country's first railway university will be constructed in Vadodara," Modi said addressing public after inaugurating the terminal. Modi had won 2014 Lok Sabha elections with record landslide margin from Vadodara constituency. He also won from Varanasi and later vacated Vadodra. The PM also said the varsity will help in carrying out innovation and modernisation for the Indian Railways. "Connectivity is becoming very important in this century," he said. He also brought up the work to increase the height of Sardar Sarovar dam in neighbouring Narmada district. Modi said his government did two things soon after assuming office in 2014. "The first was the permission to increase height of Sardar Sarovar dam, a work that was waiting since five decades, struggling, and facing difficulties," he said. The second he said was the airport project. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration The next President will take power with significant space decisions looming Moon or Mars? SLS or private rockets? The next president will face big questions. by Eric Berger - Oct 22, 2016 1:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 117 Trump and Clinton, should we send them into space? Aurich / Getty At the upper edge of the atmosphere, where the sky kisses outer space, a few molecules of nitrogen and oxygen bounce around. If we consider the presidential election as playing out at the surface of the Earth, amid a thick atmosphere of invective and accusation, it is not a stretch to say the relative importance of space policy lies somewhere near the edge of space, bouncing around inconsequentially, like these stray molecules. Even so, the next president of the United States will have the ability, if not the desire, to shape the future of America’s civil space programs—especially with major decision points on the horizon, including the privatization of spaceflight and the details of where humans should go beyond low-Earth orbit. For this reason, we’re going to look at what changes a new president might make and what attitudes each candidate has had toward space. Among the first tasks of a new administration is to launch a transition team to review major federal programs. With a budget that comprises about 0.4 percent of all federal spending and a significant chunk of the country’s discretionary funds, NASA will face meaningful scrutiny. Such transition teams will delve far beyond the rhetoric of hashtags, like #JourneyToMars, and get under the hood of the space agency’s programs and whether funding exists to carry them out. Mark Albrecht served as President George H.W. Bush’s principal advisor on space, and he has been enmeshed in such policy discussions for the better part of three decades. He’s lived through several presidential transitions, and he can say exactly what will happen to NASA and its human spaceflight programs when either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump become the next president of the United States. “The first thing a new administration will do is an independent review of the status of programs, and what they find will surprise no one,” Albrecht said. Inevitably, he said, an independent commission will discover an ever-growing bureaucracy and underfunded, over-ambitious programs. Whether the new president acts on these findings is another question entirely. The modern NASA Before digging into positions held by Clinton and Trump, let’s get some perspective on how NASA has changed since the days of Apollo. During a US human spaceflight panel discussion titled “Lost in Space,” held at Rice University in October, Albrecht described how NASA has grown from a lean agency focused on beating the Soviets to the Moon into one that now serves many masters. “NASA takes on more and more activities, everything from more Earth science to exploration activities to high-speed computing,” Albrecht said. “I’m sure there’s stem cell research being done somewhere at some NASA center. Over time, those pieces begin to grow constituencies, and, like anything else, they get a little more money every year. That cycle goes on and on.” NASA How did our space policy get to where it is today? We look at the key players during the administration of President Barack Obama. NASA How did our space policy get to where it is today? We look at the key players during the administration of President Barack Obama. NASA Obama chose four-time astronaut Charles Bolden as NASA's administrator. Bolden has embraced the Journey to Mars but has not said how much it will cost or how NASA will pay for it. NASA NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, speaking to shuttle commander Chris Ferguson, sought to make sweeping changes to NASA in 2010 by turning over rocket building entirely to private companies and allowing the space agency to focus on innovating spaceflight technology. She left NASA in 2013. NASA Florida Sen. Bill Nelson wanted no part of Garver's changes. He spearheaded a "compromise" that allowed NASA to continue building large rockets. The Senate wrote the specs for the Space Launch System, leading some to dub it the "Senate Launch System." NASA Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was the co-leader of the compromise with Nelson. She felt NASA would lose essential capabilities without an SLS-like program. She also tried without success to keep the space shuttle flying beyond 2011. NASA Alabama Senator Richard Shelby has emerged as the chief supporter of the SLS rocket in the Senate. The rocket is being designed and tested in his home state. Each year since 2011, as a lead Senate appropriator, Shelby has added more money to NASA's budget for the rocket than NASA has said it needed. NASA Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski has worked to make sure that other areas of NASA's budget, including the costly and oft-delayed James Webb Space Telescope, have received ample funding. NASA Elon Musk, of SpaceX, has benefited from NASA contracts to develop commercial cargo and crew services. His company could almost certainly develop a lower-cost large rocket than the SLS, but the Senate wanted no part of that. NASA Mike Griffin, NASA's administrator under George W. Bush, wanted to remain in that position for Obama. But the president rejected Griffin's Constellation plan—and Griffin himself. If a Republican wins the 2016 election, Griffin could return to NASA or elsewhere to shape policy. NASA John Holdren, President Obama's science adviser and director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, has favored Earth science over human spaceflight. NASA Bill Gerstenmaier, who has overseen NASA's human spaceflight programs since 2005, has tried to make the best of the Orion capsule, the SLS rocket, President Obama's grand goal of Mars, and limited funding. The bureaucracy has infected large projects like NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, Albrecht said. When these big projects start out, they have “optimistic” estimates for cost, schedule, and technical challenges. Those estimates eventually catch up with the programs. And while NASA’s top line budget might increase to account for these problems, much of those increases are consumed by new constituencies that have cropped up in recent decades. Accordingly, when the National Academies or an independent panel review these big exploration programs in 2017 or 2018, they will find them to be underfunded, behind schedule, and, given budget projections, a long way from delivering significant accomplishments. Yes, it's possible that the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft will fly together in late 2018, but these vehicles are unlikely to carry humans into space until 2023, and human landings on Mars remain more than two decades away. Will the new president care? Space hasn’t been a meaningful issue in the 2016 presidential election to date, and it’s unlikely to become one. This is part of the problem with NASA overall—it simply has lost its relevance to the nation’s strategic interests. In the 1960s, NASA served as a champion of US preeminence during the Cold War. In the 1980s and 1990s, the space shuttle launched national security satellites. Now? The agency has a much reduced role. Certainly, NASA represents a potent projection of soft power, and it has utility in easing geopolitical tensions thanks to the healthy US-Russian partnership to sustain the International Space Station. But when the president confronts the major issues of the day, such as border security, terrorism, the economy and more, NASA is not essential to resolving any of these. James Muncy, a Republican-leaning space policy expert based in Washington, DC, said NASA and civil space efforts won’t rank high enough to be addressed during the early days of either a Clinton or Trump presidency. The agency will probably drift awhile, he said, along its present course. “Neither President Clinton nor President Trump is going to make any major changes in US civil space policy for the first couple years of their term,” Muncy bluntly declared. “So it would be nice if everyone just chilled out. Congress can write another ‘don’t terminate any contracts’ provision into the omnibus if they want, but it’s a waste of words. The next president may trim NASA’s budget, but they will not change direction because that would require thinking and caring about NASA. Hint: they don’t.” The wild card Probably the biggest change in the aerospace industry since President Obama took office in 2009 is the emergence of SpaceX, which has provided substantially lower-cost launch services to NASA, the private sector, and the US military. Now SpaceX, along with other companies such as Blue Origin, are continuing to develop new, larger rockets, which on paper promise to significantly undercut the price of NASA’s SLS rocket. During his remarks at Rice University, Albrecht addressed this issue as something a new administration and Congress will have to grapple with. “For a few years now, we’ve been watching the private sector leaping and bounding ahead,” Albrecht said. This may cause a “confidence problem” for NASA; decision-makers may start to ask whether NASA should be building large launch systems when the private sector can do it at a lower cost. Some may begin to wonder why NASA isn’t facilitating the private companies instead of trying to compete with them, he said. For now, NASA’s response to such questions has been that it has a special competence, along with its traditional aerospace contractors such as Boeing, to design and build large rockets. Congress has bought into that. This viewpoint will remain defensible for a few years more, but it may be a very different conversation in 2020, when not only is SLS flying, but both SpaceX and Blue Origin have heavy lift options at a fraction of the cost of the government rocket. So what could change? With all this said, we can glean some insights into how each of the presidential administrations might eventually change NASA. The big questions with human spaceflight concern the fate of the large, costly SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, especially in light of the rise of commercial space, and how NASA should employ its big rockets to explore the solar system. In the case of SLS and Orion, Congress is explicit in its support of these large, multibillion dollar programs that provide a multitude of jobs across many states. Killing either of them outright would require a significant investment of political capital in convincing a skeptical Congress. (This might become marginally easier if Democrats take the Senate, as it would remove SLS champion and Alabama Senator Richard Shelby from his powerful subcommittee chairmanship, which has oversight of NASA’s budget). Were a president skeptical of these big vehicles, instead of making a full frontal attack, a potential policy may entail providing basic funding to keep SLS and Orion going while waiting to see if SpaceX, Blue Origin, or other private providers come through with much less costly private options by the end of the decade. The bigger question may well become how NASA will use the vehicles. President Obama set NASA on a course to have astronauts visit a near-Earth asteroid before sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. However, due to funding, the crewed asteroid mission has devolved into a robotic spacecraft that would return a small lump of rock to near the Moon. Neither Congress nor the scientific community have embraced this mission, and it will probably be modified or canceled. Substantial questions also remain about the viability of NASA’s Journey to Mars absent a significant infusion of funding to the space agency’s exploration budget.

Dedicating the new integrated terminal building of the airport here, Modi noted that India in the near future would probably become the third country in the world in terms of airport activity benchmarks and "if you think only 80 to 100 airports are enough, then we are trying to create hurdles in the country's growth". He said the country's development can take new dimensions if attention is given to tier-2 and tier-3 cities, which have the same potential, and referred to government's new regional connectivity scheme. Attacking the previous governments, he said, "Earlier airports were set up, planes would fly but the country did not have an aviation policy. "How to take the sector forward in next five or ten years and take care of its and passengers' needs, what should be done for common people, there was no vision in place earlier. It was just moving," he said. "After the new NDA government came to power, for the first time since independence it formulated a new aviation policy for the country," he said inaugurating the terminal building which is now the country's second green airport after Kochi. He said the new aviation policy will take care of the consumers' needs and the growth of the sector. Modi said that the aviation sector is growing at a very fast pace and more middle-class families aspire to travel by air. "It is estimated that within five years, the situation in India would be such that the airports in the country would have as much footfall in a year as America's total population. "You can well imagine how this sector is growing. India in the near future would probably become the third country in the world in terms of airport activity benchmarks. This will help increase employment opportunities and would spur economic activity," he said. Spread in an area of 17,500 sq mt, the new integrated terminal has been built at a cost of Rs 160 crore. It has been designed to handle 700 passengers, including international fliers, per hour with 18 check-in counters, which would help in a seamless boarding process. It took about seven years to complete the project as the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel had laid the foundation stone in 2009. The 8,100-meter-long runway of the Vadodra airport can handle small and narrow body aircraft such as Airbus 320 and Boeing 737s. Besides national carrier Air India, private airlines likes IndiGo and Jet aiways are operating from here. This airport will be zero discharge, waste to wealth, energy saving and environment friendly, the PM said. Speaking about the potential of tier-2 and tier-3 cities,he said the government brought "out a new regional connectivity scheme under which people can travel with airfares of only Rs 2,500 for up to 500 kms distance." Claiming that his government had taken a number of steps to promote the aviation sector, Modi said, "I am happy that after the formation of the new NDA government, two airports in the country have become a part of the green movement." He said when such iconic buildings come up, the common people get encouraged to use economically viable and environment-friendly technology. "Connectivity plays an important role in the world today, both physical and digital connectivity is required and if we need highways, we also need I-ways (Information ways). "Similarly, air traffic is also needed. Air services are required in a big way for growth of tourism in the country. Better air connectivity means more tourists and this means better economic growth. There are immense possibility for tourism growth in India. Keeping that in view, this government has decided to promote the aviation sector," he said. Earlier, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajpathi Raju said since the NDA government came to power, air passengers traffic has "grown by over 20 per cent".

(Reuters/Shamil Zhumatov) Share Written by Akshat Rathi Obsession Space Business October 22, 2016 This week the ExoMars team placed a satellite in orbit around the red planet but failed to land the accompanying spacecraft. Scientifically the mission was largely a success: the satellite will soon start sniffing the Martian atmosphere for signs of present or past life. But the lander’s failure is symbolic of the fortunes of Russia’s Roscosmos, which is an equal partner with the European Space Agency (ESA) on ExoMars. Russia is one of two nations (the other is China) currently capable of putting humans into space, and at that job it’s been spectacularly reliable. Without Russia’s Soyuz rockets, there would be no US astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). But on other fronts the once mighty Russian (previously Soviet) space program has floundered. Its last successful interplanetary mission was to Venus in 1984. With Mars, it’s had a string of almost unmitigated failures since its first attempted flyby in 1960. At its height, Soviet spending on space rivaled America’s (pdf, p. 5). But now Roscosmos’s budget for the coming decade is equal to NASA’s for a single year. The $7.5 billion Vostochny Cosmodrome—a new launch site intended to restore Roscosmos’s glory—has been hit with spiraling costs, delays, strikes, and even admissions of embezzlement. Russia has also had to delay an ambitious new moon program, which includes building a lunar complex and orbital station. Worse still, Roscomos’s lucrative contracts to send NASA astronauts to the ISS may not continue beyond 2017, when SpaceX or Boeing start human launches. So ExoMars matters a lot to Roscosmos. The mission’s next phase involves sending a rover to Mars in 2021. ESA is to build the rover while Roscosmos is to redesign the failed landing gear based on the data gathered this week. If that mission fails too, it’ll wound ESA’s pride, but it could ruin Russia’s. This was published as part of the weekend edition of the Quartz Daily Brief.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 24 October 2016 | MYT 7:04 AM Rockwell broadens its reach with $6.4 billion purchase of B/E Aerospace Cockpit equipment made by Rockwell Collins and used in a CH-47 Chinook helicopter is pictured at the ILA Berlin Air Show in Schoenefeld, south of Berlin, Germany, June 1, 2016. REUTERS LONDON:  After two years of looking to expand, aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins Inc has struck a deal to buy aircraft interior maker B/E Aerospace Inc for $62 a share in cash and stock, the companies said on Sunday. The acquisition, valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt, expands the range of products Rockwell Collins supplies to major commercial and business aircraft and broadens its customer base internationally. Rockwell on Sunday also reported a 14 percent increase in profit to $1.58 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, on a 4 percent rise in sales. The acquisition, which is expected to be completed next spring, allows both companies to sell to each other’s customers and to deploy Rockwell’s capability with onboard connectivity to make internet-enabled seats, galleys, lavatories and other cabin systems that B/E Aerospace provides. “B/E is very strong in relationships with airlines,” Rockwell Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said in an interview. “We're stronger with aircraft makers as well as business aviation operators and the military. We’ll be able to sell our respective products into a much broader market base than either of us could do independently.” B/E Aerospace plans to use Rockwell’s dealer network and relationships with business jet owners, for example, to know when jets are coming in for avionics upgrades. “Having that information and time to market directly to the owners of the aircraft is a tremendous opportunity that we're looking to take advantage of,” said Amin Khoury, B/E Aerospace founder and chairman. “It's not something we can do on our own.” The combination is expected to produce cost savings of about $160 million, with 90 percent captured in the first full year of the acquisition, and provide a double-digit percentage boost to per-share earnings in the first full year, the companies said. They also anticipate it generating more than $6 billion in free cash flow over five years. The cost savings come from eliminating public company administration at B/E Aerospace, greater buying power with suppliers, consolidating information technology system and using low-cost factory labor across the combined company, Ortberg said. - Reuters LITTLE PRODUCT OVERLAP Rockwell agreed to pay $34.10 a share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins stock, a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace's closing price on Friday. The purchase will curb Rockwell’s appetite for big deals for about three years, but the company will still be looking for smaller acquisitions while paying down debt, Ortberg said. The companies have little product overlap. Rockwell is best known for avionics, flight control systems and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other systems. Rockwell, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has market value of about $11 billion, more than twice the size of Wellington, Florida-based B/E Aerospace, which has a market value of $5.1 billion. The offer represents a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace's closing price on Friday. B/E Aerospace brings more aftermarket and aircraft retrofit business to Rockwell, which is mainly focused on new equipment, and also adds exposure to twin-aisle aircraft, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group. Combined sales will be about evenly split between the U.S. domestic market and international markets, Ortberg said. Pricing pressures from Boeing Co and Airbus are one driver of such a deal. "But it's also a pretty clear indicator that the market has peaked in terms of deliveries and orders," Aboulafia said of new aircraft sales. "In this environment, consolidation is inevitable as a cost-control move." Ortberg said that while cost was a factor, "It’s really the transition to the digital airplane that's creating the perfect timing to bring these two entities together.” Rockwell’s board set up a committee two years ago to examine whether to grow by expanding into new markets or partnering to use existing sales channels. “We thought that (latter strategy) was a much better approach,” he said.

They also anticipate it generating more than $6 billion in free cash flow over five years. The cost savings come from eliminating public company administration at B/E Aerospace, greater buying power with suppliers, consolidating information technology system and using low-cost factory labor across the combined company, Ortberg said. LITTLE PRODUCT OVERLAP Rockwell agreed to pay $34.10 a share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins stock, a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace’s closing price on Friday. The purchase will curb Rockwell’s appetite for big deals for about three years, but the company will still be looking for smaller acquisitions while paying down debt, Ortberg said. The companies have little product overlap. Rockwell is best known for avionics, flight control systems and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other systems. Rockwell, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has market value of about $11 billion, more than twice the size of Wellington, Florida-based B/E Aerospace, which has a market value of $5.1 billion. The offer represents a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace’s closing price on Friday. B/E Aerospace brings more aftermarket and aircraft retrofit business to Rockwell, which is mainly focused on new equipment, and also adds exposure to twin-aisle aircraft, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group. Combined sales will be about evenly split between the U.S. domestic market and international markets, Ortberg said. Pricing pressures from Boeing Co and Airbus are one driver of such a deal. “But it’s also a pretty clear indicator that the market has peaked in terms of deliveries and orders,” Aboulafia said of new aircraft sales. “In this environment, consolidation is inevitable as a cost-control move.” Ortberg said that while cost was a factor, “It’s really the transition to the digital airplane that’s creating the perfect timing to bring these two entities together.” Rockwell’s board set up a committee two years ago to examine whether to grow by expanding into new markets or partnering to use existing sales channels. “We thought that (latter strategy) was a much better approach,” he said.

The acquisition, valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt, expands the range of products Rockwell Collins supplies to major commercial and business aircraft and broadens its customer based internationally.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:50 AM, October 24, 2016 Updated: 6:30 AM, October 24, 2016 After two years of looking to expand, aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins Inc has struck a deal to buy aircraft interior maker B/E Aerospace Inc for $62 a share in cash and stock, the companies said on Sunday. The acquisition, valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt, expands the range of products Rockwell Collins supplies to major commercial and business aircraft and broadens its customer base internationally. Rockwell on Sunday also reported a 14 percent increase in profit to $1.58 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, on a 4 percent rise in sales. The acquisition, which is expected to be completed next spring, allows both companies to sell to each other’s customers and to deploy Rockwell’s capability with onboard connectivity to make internet-enabled seats, galleys, lavatories and other cabin systems that B/E Aerospace provides. “B/E is very strong in relationships with airlines,” Rockwell Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said in an interview. “We're stronger with aircraft makers as well as business aviation operators and the military.

Discover Card MasterCard: Is It A Bittersweet Trump Victory? (Seeking Alpha) More than a third of the Dow Jones Industrials are on deck to report quarterly results this week. Wall Street expectations are perhaps highest for a chemicals giant and a leading credit services company. However, just one of these two is expected to show growth on the top line. The third-quarter earnings reporting season is in full swing, and more than a third of the Dow Jones Industrial Average components have shared their latest results so far. Most of the rest of the 30 Dow members are on tap to report this week, and the Wall Street expectations are perhaps highest for E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: D), better known as DuPont, and Visa Inc (NYSE: V). The Wall Street consensus forecasts call for earnings at both to have increased by double-digit percentages from the same period of last year. But analysts see top line growth from only one of them, for the period when DuPont moved forward on its merger with Dow Chemical and Visa provided the card of choice for Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST). When Delaware-based conglomerate DuPont shares its third-quarter results, the Wall Street forecast is that it will post a profit of $0.20 per share and $4.86 billion in revenue. That would compare with the earnings of $0.13 per share and revenue of $4.87 billion last year. It also would be the lowest revenue and second lowest profit results in the past eight quarters. The consensus of just eight Estimize respondents have pegged EPS at $0.23 and revenue at $5.35 billion for the three months that ended in September. In the previous two quarters, Estimize overestimated on the bottom line numbers, though the revenue number was just about on target for the second quarter. Related Link: This Week's Dow Earnings: Low Expectations For Exxon And Chevron Wall Street's consensus forecast for Visa is for earnings per share (EPS) to have risen by 11 cents from the same period of last year to $0.73. That estimate is unchanged in the past 60 days. The consensus of 137 Estimize respondents calls for $0.74 for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended in September. Note that Wall Street has underestimated EPS results in the past three quarters. Estimize predicts that the revenue of this San Francisco-based payments technology giant will total $4.20 billion for the quarter, up more than 16 percent from the year-ago period. Wall Street is a bit more optimistic, with its consensus forecast set at $4.23 billion. Back in the third quarter, Visa's revenue narrowly missed both forecasts. Visa is scheduled to report its results after the closing bell on Monday, while DuPont is expected to post its numbers first thing the following morning. Also this week, the consensus forecasts call for per-share earnings at Dow members Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola and Exxon Mobil to be lower than a year ago. The EPS at Procter & Gamble are anticipated to be about the same as in the year-ago period. On the other hand, the consensus forecasts call for a gain in EPS at Boeing, Caterpillar, Merck, 3M and United Technologies, relative to a year ago. Only a handful of Dow components will be left to report after that, but watch for upcoming results from Cisco, Pfizer and Walt Disney. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

The airport is located in Harni area on the outskirts of Vadodara. After the function, Modi will head to Navlakhi ground, where artificial limbs, tri-cycles and other assistive devices will be distributed to over 8000 'Divyangs'. The event has been jointly organised by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Kanpur-based Artificial Limb Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO), and Vadodara district administration, stated a government release. This will be Modi's fourth visit in last three months to his home state, where Assembly elections are due next year. On his 66th birthday on 17 September, Modi had inaugurated various irrigation and drinking water projects in the tribal district of Dahod. He had attended a Divyang camp at Navsari in south Gujarat. In August, he had visited Gujarat twice — once to condole death of Pramukh Swami Maharaj at Botad district and then to inaugurate the ambitious Sauni Irrigation Scheme in Jamnagar district. Harni is only the second "green building" airport in country. Airport Authority of India (AAI) chairman Guruprasad Mohapatra told PTI in Vadodara on Saturday that new terminal will enhance the combined passenger handling capacity of airport by almost four-fold. It took more than seven years for completing the new international terminal building project, foundation stone for which was laid in February 2009 by then Civil Aviation Minister. "At present, flights to Mumbai, Delhi, Goa and Bengaluru are operated at this airport by Air India, Jet Airways, Jet Connect, Indigo and Etihad Airways," Airport Director Sono Marandi said, adding that international flights can be launched after receiving requisite proposals from carriers. "We cannot fly directly to far away countries like UK, US, Canada etc. owing to runway constraints. However, (operating) flights to closer foreign destinations like Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok etc. is possible," he said. Marandi said that length of the existing runway is only 8100 feet and it has not been extended despite the construction of new international terminal, due to unavailability of land. "It is not large enough to facilitate landing of big aircraft like Boeing 744 which are used for long-distance international flights. Currently, the airport can handle medium-range flier aircraft like Airbus-320 and Boeing-737 etc," he added. Project in-charge Narendra Kumar Shukla said that handling of passengers will become much easier now and that boarding will become smoother for flyers. "The new terminal is designed in such a flexible way that its use for domestic and international operations can be varied as per needs," he added.
