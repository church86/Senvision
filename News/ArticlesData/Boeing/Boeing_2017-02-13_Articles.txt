CEO Oscar Munoz was on hand for the occasion, performing a ceremonial ribbon-cutting at the airport and performing gate duties as United showed off the jet. True to the role, Munoz scanned the boarding passes of media members and other VIPs flying on what the airline billed as its debut flight of the aircraft. RELATED: United hints at widebody fleet plans with Polaris retrofits (FlightGlobal) Still, Monday’s flight was a not a regular "revenue" flight, but rather part of a continuing publicity blitz by United to show off its new business-class cabin. The 777-300ER, United’s first plane to get its updated Polaris seat, will enter revenue service for the first time on Thursday (Feb. 16). Initially, it will fly domestically between Newark Liberty and San Francisco – a hub-to-hub route for United that connects two of its biggest bases and will allow crews to become familiar with the cabin layout on the new aircraft. United will expand its 777-300ER service to international routes as more models of the plane enter its fleet. The airline says the new Polaris-outfitted planes will begin flying between San Francisco and Hong Kong on March 25 when the 777-300ER will replace United’s Boeing 747-400s that currently fly the route. As for Monday’s flight, that came as United has been hyping its new Polaris cabin and service. It’s all part of a broader turnaround strategy at the company, which finally seems to have found some forward momentum after an extended run of inconsistent operations and customer service following its 2010 merger with Continental.

It represents the new spirit of United," Munoz said in remarks before the launch, according to Travel Weekly. Indeed, many have credited Munoz – who took over as the company’s CEO in late 2015 – for restoring a sense of optimism at United. In addition to working to update the carrier’s product, Munoz has been assembling a respected management team that many industry observers believe could restore the company as a formidable force in the U.S. airline industry. For now, all eyes are on United’s overhauled “Polaris” business class cabin. United has already rolled out in-flight service elements of Polaris, but the new seat and cabin design will debut with this first 777-300ER before slowly rolling out to more of United’s long-haul fleet. United’s new Polaris seats have so far received generally positive feedback. Each of the lie-flat seats in the cabin includes direct-aisle access – a significant improvement from the carrier’s current business-class layout that requires many customers to climb over their neighbors to get in and out of their seats. Other amenities, like Saks Fifth Avenue bedding, have been mostly well-received.

United had already announced plans to move to a similar "high-density" layout on several of its older Boeing 777 aircraft. Seth Miller was on United’s demonstration flight on behalf of the Runway Girl Network, a site dedicated to covering seats, aircraft interiors and other items that account for “passenger experience.” He reviewed the flight, including this take on the economy cabin: “The decision to go 10-abreast in economy class is not surprising but also not particularly comforting for those who fly in the back. The seats are tight, with three of us rubbing shoulders and elbows while trying out the space. I’ve done the 3-4-3 layout a few times now and it feels even a smidgen tighter to me than the Boeing 787’s 3-3-3 layout, though that may just be psychological, as one sees an extra human in each row of the 10-abreast 777.” Overall, United’s new 777-300ERs will include 102 Economy Plus seats and 204 standard economy seats. Unlike on many international carriers, United’s Economy Plus seats come only with about three extra inches of legroom; they will not include separate recliner seat types that have become increasingly common in the so-called “premium economy” cabins of international carriers like Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, Qantas, Cathay Pacific and others.

Home India news ‘America First’ not a concern for ‘Make in India’, says , Manohar Parrikar ‘America First’ not a concern for ‘Make in India’, says , Manohar Parrikar The government on Tuesday said the ‘America First’ call of US President Donald Trump was not a concern for India or the ‘Make in India’ programme. By: FE Bureau | Bengaluru | Published: February 15, 2017 4:23 AM Manohar parrikar (PTI) The government on Tuesday said the ‘America First’ call of US President Donald Trump was not a concern for India or the ‘Make in India’ programme. Responding to media queries if Trump’s ‘America First’ would come in the way of ‘Make in India’ and stop US firms from participating in the programme, defence minister Manohar Parrikar said: “You should have put this question to Boeing, they are there at the exhibition… Boeing, Lockheed Martin etc. What I will say is what I want… I want you to make in India; if someone wants to shift production to someplace else, it is his choice.” “I am not concerned,” he said, adding that he has so far just heard of it, and there has been no official communication from the US government. Explaining it further, the minister said: “The OEM (original equipment manufacturer) helping a strategic partner will need their government’s approval. If they are proposing something, their government will give them in-principle approval so that they can quote. The company will not be able to quote, maybe their some other branch will quote.” Civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju, meanwhile, said Boeing was already manufacturing beams in Nagpur, and HAL is making doors for Airbus. “Aviation manufacturing is crossing a lot of countries, so it is better to ask the companies what their stand is,” Raju said. Parrikar also announced that the decision on many big-ticket projects like procuring the much-awaited fighter jet planes and self-propelled guns is likely to be taken this year. He said work on a second manufacturing line for indigenously developed Light Combat Aircraft Tejas will also commence in the next three months to boost production. “Many of the private-sector projects like SP (self-propelled) gun, C-295 (Airbus transporter aircraft) and even single and twin-engine fighter jets are in an advanced stage of decision making. We expect to get these in line during the current calender year,” he said in response to a question. Parrikar said HAL has been asked to outsource in “large quantity” several production areas in various sectors. “For example, for the LCA model we are putting up a second (production) line for which R359 crore has been approved by the government. It is expected this work will start in three months. “In about one-and-a-half years the actual production will start. A lot of indigenous capability has to be developed through the local industry,” the defence minister said. While inaugurating the 11th edition of Aero India, Parrikar earlier said: “We encourage Indian companies in defence manufacturing, but we would also like to encourage foreign companies. The government is working on ways to increase private player participation in defence manufacturing.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

RedEye Your weekend plans. Delivered. Business In S.C., Boeing goes all out to defeat Wednesday's vote on union Boeing union vote Travis Dove / Bloomberg Dreamliner 787s sit on the production line at Boeing's final assembly facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Dec. 6, 2016. Dreamliner 787s sit on the production line at Boeing's final assembly facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Dec. 6, 2016. (Travis Dove / Bloomberg) Josh EidelsonBloomberg At a Monday rally in a North Charleston hotel conference room, South Carolina state Rep. David Mack, D, looked out on about a hundred supporters of the long-shot campaign to unionize the city's Boeing plant. Noting the aggressive opposition from management and the state business lobby, including a battery of anti-union commercials on local TV, Mack quipped, "After seeing some of those commercials, I was almost afraid to come in here." Boeing has ample cause for confidence about staying union-free in South Carolina, the nation's least unionized state where a previous attempt to organize the aircraft factory fizzled before a vote. But the company isn't leaving anything to chance Wednesday, when about 3,000 employees are eligible to vote on whether to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The election is the latest round in a long-running, frequently ugly, unusually politicized struggle between the company and the union, which represents about 30,000 Boeing workers in the Seattle area. Boeing union vote Travis Dove / Bloomberg An employee works on the surface of an overhead compartment at Boeing's building in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Dec. 6, 2016. An employee works on the surface of an overhead compartment at Boeing's building in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Dec. 6, 2016. (Travis Dove / Bloomberg) It was freedom from strikes and escalating wages, a Boeing executive said in 2010, that was the overriding motivation for the company to place its new production line for 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina rather than Washington. The union brought a charge to the National Labor Relations Board alleging retaliation. The NLRB's general counsel issued a complaint, sparking a firestorm of criticism from Republicans including then-Gov. Nikki Haley and several presidential candidates. The IAM agreed to drop the case upon reaching a new contract for its Washington members. Boeing's southward shift was oft-touted by business and political leaders such as Haley, who saw union-avoidance as such a selling point in luring investment that she said she'd discourage unionized companies from coming to her state, so they didn't "taint the water" there. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the plant Friday. "If the machinists won at Boeing, it would be an earthquake in the south," said University of California, Santa Barbara labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein. So Boeing and its allies are pulling out all the stops to make sure that doesn't happen. The airplane giant ran 485 local TV spots between Jan. 31 and Feb. 6 urging workers to vote against the IAM, according to data from advertising tracker Kantar Media/CMAG. Additional anti-union ads from the South Carolina Manufacturers Institute had aired 350 times by February 6, including one that ran locally during the Super Bowl. Boeing has also deployed radio, billboards, YouTube videos, social media, e-mails and mailings to reach its employees, according to the union. If the machinists won at Boeing, it would be an earthquake in the south. — Nelson Lichtenstein, University of California, Santa Barbara labor historian The IAM says Boeing has been pressing its case aggressively in the workplace as well, including through mandatory meetings, casual conversations on the shop floor, TV screens placed in break rooms, free anti-union T-shirts, and a giant stack of food, diapers, and clothing labeled as all the things employees could buy for the same cost as annual union dues. A postcard titled "The Truth About IAM Wage Claims," one of several the IAM says have been distributed by management at morning meetings, urges employees to "Just say NO to the IAM" and features an image of Pinocchio. On Monday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO and president Kevin McAllister joined Boeing South Carolina general manager Joan Robinson-Berry for group meetings with employees, at which a Boeing spokesperson said they discussed "the importance of their decision" about unionization. Workers say the executives suggested unionization would mean giving away all of their rights to the union and could ruin the plant's competitiveness. "They were threatening us basically" through "innuendo," said employee Don Winckles. "They take the worst possible scenario and throw it out there, and a lot of people buy it, even though those people don't like the way things are now." The machinists union says Boeing has taken classic labor-busting tactics to unusual extremes. "It's on steroids right now," said Mike Evans, the lead organizer on the campaign. Along with stoking fears about dues and strikes, Evans said, managers have suggested to employees that if they unionized they could stop getting bonuses and their jobs could be moved to China. Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Merida said in an email that "we are not making threats or asking teammates how they will vote or what they think of the union." Under federal law, employers aren't allowed to threaten to punish employees if they unionize, but have leeway to make negative predictions about what could happen afterward. Merida said Boeing is "making every effort" to inform employees that the union's "motivation for their interest is financial and could be strongly influenced by their commitment to protect jobs in Washington State."

(Travis Dove / Bloomberg) In 2014, Washington State employees narrowly approved a contract freezing their pensions in order to get Boeing to build its 777X jet there. The IAM, whose demonstrated ability to disrupt Puget Sound production once brought great clout at the bargaining table, has been struggling to regain leverage. In 2015, when the IAM petitioned the NLRB for an election to unionize the South Carolina plant, Haley used Facebook and Twitter, a radio ad for Boeing, and her State of the State address to urge employees to reject the union. Citing "misinformation" from Boeing and "unprecedented political interference," the IAM withdrew its petition for an election five days before it had been scheduled to take place. While Haley has departed to serve as United Nations ambassador, Boeing still has friends ready to lend a hand. "Organized labor has no place in our state," said Lewis Gossett, a former head of the state's labor department. "A lot of like-minded companies don't want to see them in South Carolina." Gossett is president of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance and of its education arm, which is running ads comparing joining the IAM to gambling in a casino and suggesting the union president needs dues to fund his family members' salaries. Gossett said the ads were launched without any input from Boeing officials, including the one who sits on SCMA's board. The "VOTE NO" TV ads Boeing is running itself take a more positive tack, featuring employees talking about their child or their guitar, and saying "if you dream big with Boeing, you can go anywhere."

(Travis Dove / Bloomberg) On Monday, the state's senior U.S. senator, Lindsey Graham, D, told reporters that he'd urge employees to remember that "if we destroy the business model that led Boeing to South Carolina, this plant will not be able to grow," according to the Charleston City Paper. The IAM has responded with ads of its own, featuring Boeing union members in Puget Sound sharing messages like "You deserve the same benefits that we have." But it says the company's campaign has taken a toll, leaving some of its strong supporters too intimidated to talk to the media. "There's a heavy fear factor here," said Evans, who until last month was one of only two full-time organizers working on the campaign. He declined to share what percentage of the South Carolina facility's eligible workforce signed the IAM's petition for an NLRB election; only 30 percent was legally required. "A lot of people are afraid that if Boeing finds out they're voting yes, that it will be against them," said eight-year employee Kitt Johnson, who was disappointed more of his co-workers didn't show up to Monday's rally. "I'm hoping that that fear doesn't blow into the election." Given how aggressive companies' anti-union campaigns can be, no union should count on employees who won't show their support in public to vote for the union in private, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a senior lecturer at Cornell's labor relations school. "If a worker does not come out and publicly say they'll vote for the union, that means they also are not going to vote for the union."

Boeing came to South Carolina more than seven years ago to establish a second assembly line for its 787 Dreamliner aircraft. At least part of the attraction, analysts said, was the area’s lightly unionized labor force – giving the company more leverage over the union at its main operations outside Seattle. Now that equation is being put to the test. Workers will vote Wednesday on whether to unionize, an early test of organized labor’s strength in the Trump era. A vote to form the union would be a major victory for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which the workers would join. “If Boeing loses, it removes the ability to hold nonunion Charleston over the heads of the union in Seattle, to beat up that union for more concessions in the future,” said Scott Hamilton, managing director of Leeham Co., an aviation analysis firm in Bainbridge Island, Washington. The stakes appear even higher amid reports that President Donald Trump will visit the South Carolina plant Friday. Trump has criticized Boeing over the cost of a new Air Force One project, but it is also a major employer and exporter, as well as a military contractor – one that Trump has pitted against Lockheed Martin in seeking price savings on fighter jets. Boeing has roughly 7,500 workers in South Carolina, primarily in North Charleston and Ladson, of whom a little over 3,000 are eligible for the union. There are about 30,000 unionized workers at its facilities in the Puget Sound area, where it turns out other aircraft models as well. The machinists made a similar union push in North Charleston nearly two years ago, but called off a vote a several days before the scheduled election, complaining of a deluge of misinformation from management and pressure from local politicians. Two Boeing officials, who would not speak for attribution, expressed confidence that the company would turn back the unionization effort and suggested that the union was racing to act before Trump appoints two members to vacant seats on the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union elections, and overturns its Democratic majority. If the union were to win, Boeing would have to file any objections to a regional official of the agency within days, with any subsequent appeal going to the board in Washington. Mike Evans, the machinists’ lead organizer in South Carolina, rejected that suggestion, saying the union believes it has the votes to prevail. “If we weren’t ready, we’d still be down here sharing information, getting up the facts of the benefits of collective bargaining,” he said. “We feel we’ve reached that and have a significant amount of support. That’s what dictates, ‘Why now?’” Under rules overseen by the labor board, unions can call an election once at least 30 percent of eligible workers have signed up to authorize one, but the unions typically wait until they have a substantially higher level of support to improve their odds of success. The machinists may also benefit from two years’ worth of accumulated frustrations among workers. Evans said workers felt their evaluations were frequently arbitrary, an issue that the company promised to address before the first scheduled vote. “Whatever changes were promised it’s been more of the same,” AJ Russo, a production coordinator at the Boeing plant in North Charleston, said in an interview after a pro-union rally Monday, at which he spoke. How workers are treated “depends on where you’re standing, what day it is.” The issue is all the more salient because the company recently announced it would undergo a round of job reductions that will affect its South Carolina operations amid intense competition from its chief rival, Airbus. Management has not ruled out involuntary layoffs if the company is unable to hit its goal for cost savings. While the cuts discussed so far would not affect union-eligible workers, they are a source of anxiety, Evans said. In addition to making the evaluation and layoff process fairer in the eyes of workers, a union could bargain for higher wages. The average wage for unionized Boeing workers in Washington state is about $31 per hour, versus about $23 per hour for union-eligible workers in South Carolina, according to data from the company and the union. Boeing has said the difference is driven partly by the local cost of living and labor market conditions, and partly by the longer average tenure of workers in Washington. The union says pay tops out at a certain point, making additional tenure relevant only to issues like benefits and job security, not wages. Even if the union prevailed, it would not necessarily restore the leverage it enjoyed before the Dreamliner plant opened in North Charleston. South Carolina is a “right to work” state, meaning workers do not have to join the union or pay union fees as a condition of employment. According to Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia, this was an important consideration in Boeing’s decision to locate in North Charleston. “If you have just enough folks who will cross the picket lines, you can still get certification and testing work done,” Aboulafia said, alluding to the possibility of a strike. “That can make a difference in keeping some revenue coming in.” Evans and his fellow organizers appear to have some other advantages over the 2015 effort, when local political leaders campaigned aggressively against the union. Nikki Haley, then South Carolina’s governor and now the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, portrayed the machinists’ union as a group of meddling outsiders who had resisted Boeing’s move to South Carolina. “I want our workforce to remember that if it were up to the IAM, there would be noBoeing in Charleston,” Haley said at a campaign stop a few weeks before the scheduled 2015 unionization vote, according to the local Post and Courier. She was alluding to the union’s charge that Boeing was setting up the plant to undermine the right of workers in Washington to strike. This time, the political powers that be appear to have been largely silent. In addition, Evans said the company had been more forthcoming with information about eligible workers than it was in 2015, making outreach easier. Under NLRB rules enacted later that year, companies are required to hand over the names of union-eligible workers earlier in the election process. Still, the campaign faces considerable obstacles. A local business group tied to the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance, of which Boeing is a member, has been running advertisements on local television, including one depicting a thuggish casino boss urging people to roll dice at a craps table. The message is that the union wants workers to gamble away what they have. Boeing implies that a vote to unionize would mean inserting the union into the relationship between workers and managers, something the union says is false. Organizers say that union stewards would be available when workers felt they had been mistreated, but that otherwise workers would be left to interact with managers as they saw fit. The company has also sought to play up a split between the union and the South Carolina workers by invoking the union’s efforts to preserve production in Washington. “We have not forgotten the IAM’s history in South Carolina, including their repeated insults regarding our teammates’ abilities,” said Joan Robinson-Berry, general manager of Boeing South Carolina, in a statement after the union vote was announced in January. And then there is the general challenge of South Carolina’s political culture, famously hostile to unions. “I taught undergrads here at the university for many years,” said Hoyt N. Wheeler, an emeritus business professor at the University of South Carolina who taught labor relations and employment law. “The local students are violently opposed to unions. They knew absolutely nothing about them, but they had strong opinions.” If the vote succeeds, Wheeler said, it could go a long way toward demystifying unions in the state. “One of the things that happens in a state like South Carolina where you don’t have organized workers is it’s hard for people to learn anything about a union, what it is,” he said. “You don’t have neighbors, friends, relatives in a union,” he added. “It would be good to have an example like that in South Carolina.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:10 How is a blade born in N.C.?

The state’s business lobby and political leaders have lent Boeing a hand in its anti-union campaign. (Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times) Boeing has cause for confidence about staying union-free in South Carolina, where a previous attempt to organize its aircraft factory fizzled. But when 3,000 employees vote Wednesday on joining the Machinists, it could be close and the company isn’t leaving anything to chance. Share story By Josh Eidelson Bloomberg News At a Monday rally in a North Charleston hotel conference room, South Carolina State Rep. David Mack looked out on about 100 supporters of the longshot campaign to unionize the city’s Boeing plant. Noting the aggressive opposition from management and the state business lobby, including a battery of anti-union commercials on local TV, the Charleston Democrat quipped: “After seeing some of those commercials, I was almost afraid to come in here.” Boeing has ample cause for confidence about staying union-free in South Carolina, the least unionized state in the U.S., where a previous attempt to organize the aircraft factory fizzled before a vote. But the company isn’t leaving anything to chance Wednesday, when about 3,000 employees are eligible to vote on whether to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Previous stories Jan. 20: War of words starts as Machinists union files for organizing vote at Boeing South Carolina The election is the latest round in a long-running, frequently ugly, unusually politicized struggle between the company and the union, which represents about 30,000 Boeing workers in the Seattle area.

It was freedom from strikes and escalating wages, a Boeing executive said in 2010, that was the overriding motivation for the company to place its new production line for 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina. The union brought a charge to the National Labor Relations Board alleging retaliation. The NLRB’s general counsel issued a complaint, sparking a firestorm of criticism from Republicans, including then-Governor Nikki Haley and several presidential candidates. The IAM agreed to drop the case upon reaching a new contract for its Washington members. Boeing’s southward shift was oft-touted by business and political leaders such as Haley, who saw union-avoidance as such a selling point in luring investment that she said she’d discourage unionized companies from coming to her state, so they didn’t “taint the water” there. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the plant Friday. “If the Machinists won at Boeing, it would be an earthquake in the South,” said University of California, Santa Barbara, labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein. So Boeing and its allies are pulling out all the stops to make sure that doesn’t happen. The jet maker ran 485 local TV spots between Jan. 31 and Feb. 6 urging workers to vote against the IAM, according to data from advertising tracker Kantar Media/CMAG. Additional anti-union ads from the South Carolina Manufacturers Institute had aired 350 times by Feb. 6, including one that ran locally during the Super Bowl. Boeing has also deployed radio, billboards, YouTube videos, social media, emails and mailings to reach its employees, according to the union. The IAM says Boeing has been pressing its case aggressively in the workplace as well, including through mandatory meetings, casual conversations on the shop floor, TV screens placed in break rooms, free anti-union T-shirts, and a giant stack of food, diapers and clothing labeled as all the things employees could buy for the same cost as annual union dues. A postcard titled “The Truth About IAM Wage Claims,” one of several the IAM says have been distributed by management at morning meetings, urges employees to “Just say NO to the IAM” and features an image of Pinocchio.

In 2015, when the IAM petitioned the NLRB for an election to unionize the South Carolina plant, Haley used Facebook and Twitter, a radio ad for Boeing, and her State of the State address to urge employees to reject the union. Citing “misinformation” from Boeing and “unprecedented political interference,” the IAM withdrew its petition for an election five days before it had been scheduled to take place. The IAM has run ads of its own, featuring Boeing union members in Puget Sound sharing messages like “You deserve the same benefits that we have.” With assistance from Julie Johnsson Greg Giroux and John McCormick.   Employees work on computers at Boeing’s final assembly facility in North Charleston, South Carolina.

( Travis Dove/Bloomberg) At a Monday rally in a North Charleston hotel conference room, South Carolina state Rep. David Mack, D, looked out on about a hundred supporters of the long-shot campaign to unionize the city's Boeing plant. Noting the aggressive opposition from management and the state business lobby, including a battery of anti-union commercials on local TV, Mack quipped, "After seeing some of those commercials, I was almost afraid to come in here." Boeing has ample cause for confidence about staying union-free in South Carolina, the nation's least unionized state where a previous attempt to organize the aircraft factory fizzled before a vote. But the company isn't leaving anything to chance Wednesday, when about 3,000 employees are eligible to vote on whether to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The election is the latest round in a long-running, frequently ugly, unusually politicized struggle between the company and the union, which represents about 30,000 Boeing workers in the Seattle area. It was freedom from strikes and escalating wages, a Boeing executive said in 2010, that was the overriding motivation for the company to place its new production line for 787 Dreamliners in South Carolina rather than Washington. The union brought a charge to the National Labor Relations Board alleging retaliation. The NLRB's general counsel issued a complaint, sparking a firestorm of criticism from Republicans including then-Gov. Nikki Haley and several presidential candidates. The IAM agreed to drop the case upon reaching a new contract for its Washington members. Boeing's southward shift was oft-touted by business and political leaders such as Haley, who saw union-avoidance as such a selling point in luring investment that she said she'd discourage unionized companies from coming to her state, so they didn't "taint the water" there. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the plant Friday. "If the Machinists won at Boeing, it would be an earthquake in the South," said University of California, Santa Barbara labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein. So Boeing and its allies are pulling out all the stops to make sure that doesn't happen. The airplane giant ran 485 local TV spots between Jan. 31 and Feb. 6 urging workers to vote against the IAM, according to data from advertising tracker Kantar Media/CMAG. Additional anti-union ads from the South Carolina Manufacturers Institute had aired 350 times by February 6, including one that ran locally during the Super Bowl. Boeing has also deployed radio, billboards, YouTube videos, social media, emails and mailings to reach its employees, according to the union. The IAM says Boeing has been pressing its case aggressively in the workplace as well, including through mandatory meetings, casual conversations on the shop floor, TV screens placed in break rooms, free anti-union T-shirts, and a giant stack of food, diapers, and clothing labeled as all the things employees could buy for the same cost as annual union dues. A postcard titled "The Truth About IAM Wage Claims," one of several the IAM says have been distributed by management at morning meetings, urges employees to "Just say NO to the IAM" and features an image of Pinocchio. On Monday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO and president Kevin McAllister joined Boeing South Carolina general manager Joan Robinson-Berry for group meetings with employees, at which a Boeing spokesperson said they discussed "the importance of their decision" about unionization. Workers say the executives suggested unionization would mean giving away all of their rights to the union and could ruin the plant's competitiveness. "They were threatening us basically" through "innuendo," said employee Don Winckles. "They take the worst possible scenario and throw it out there, and a lot of people buy it, even though those people don't like the way things are now." The machinists union says Boeing has taken classic labor-busting tactics to unusual extremes. "It's on steroids right now," said Mike Evans, the lead organizer on the campaign. Along with stoking fears about dues and strikes, Evans said, managers have suggested to employees that if they unionized they could stop getting bonuses and their jobs could be moved to China. Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Merida said in an email that "we are not making threats or asking teammates how they will vote or what they think of the union." Under federal law, employers aren't allowed to threaten to punish employees if they unionize, but have leeway to make negative predictions about what could happen afterward. Merida said Boeing is "making every effort" to inform employees that the union's "motivation for their interest is financial and could be strongly influenced by their commitment to protect jobs in Washington State." In 2014, Washington State employees narrowly approved a contract freezing their pensions in order to get Boeing to build its 777X jet there. The IAM, whose demonstrated ability to disrupt Puget Sound production once brought great clout at the bargaining table, has been struggling to regain leverage. In 2015, when the IAM petitioned the NLRB for an election to unionize the South Carolina plant, Haley used Facebook and Twitter, a radio ad for Boeing, and her State of the State address to urge employees to reject the union. Citing "misinformation" from Boeing and "unprecedented political interference," the IAM withdrew its petition for an election five days before it had been scheduled to take place. While Haley has departed to serve as United Nations ambassador, Boeing still has friends ready to lend a hand. "Organized labor has no place in our state," said Lewis Gossett, a former head of the state's labor department. "A lot of like-minded companies don't want to see them in South Carolina." What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Who's hired? Check our People in Business How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Gossett is president of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance and of its education arm, which is running ads comparing joining the IAM to gambling in a casino and suggesting the union president needs dues to fund his family members' salaries. Gossett said the ads were launched without any input from Boeing officials, including the one who sits on SCMA's board. The "VOTE NO" TV ads Boeing is running itself take a more positive tack, featuring employees talking about their child or their guitar, and saying "if you dream big with Boeing, you can go anywhere." On Monday, the state's senior U.S. senator, Lindsey Graham, D, told reporters that he'd urge employees to remember that "if we destroy the business model that led Boeing to South Carolina, this plant will not be able to grow," according to the Charleston City Paper. The IAM has responded with ads of its own, featuring Boeing union members in Puget Sound sharing messages like "You deserve the same benefits that we have." But it says the company's campaign has taken a toll, leaving some of its strong supporters too intimidated to talk to the media. "There's a heavy fear factor here," said Evans, who until last month was one of only two full-time organizers working on the campaign. He declined to share what percentage of the South Carolina facility's eligible workforce signed the IAM's petition for an NLRB election; only 30 percent was legally required. "A lot of people are afraid that if Boeing finds out they're voting yes, that it will be against them," said eight-year employee Kitt Johnson, who was disappointed more of his co-workers didn't show up to Monday's rally. "I'm hoping that that fear doesn't blow into the election." Given how aggressive companies' anti-union campaigns can be, no union should count on employees who won't show their support in public to vote for the union in private, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a senior lecturer at Cornell's labor relations school. "If a worker does not come out and publicly say they'll vote for the union, that means they also are not going to vote for the union."

The visit would come two days after a critical unionization vote at the Boeing site. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter President Donald Trump is expected to attend the rollout of Boeing’s first 787-10, the new and largest model of the Dreamliner family, on Friday in North Charleston, South Carolina, according to media reports from both Washington, D.C., and South Carolina. Several reports cited an FAA notice warning pilots to “expect VIP movement February 17, 2017 in the vicinity of Charleston, SC. Pilots can expect airspace restrictions.” It would be the first visit of a sitting president to Boeing’s South Carolina facility, where the 787-10 model will be exclusively built. Boeing declined to comment.

If Trump’s visit happens, it will come just two days after a critical unionization vote at the manufacturing site. On Wednesday, some 3,000 production workers at the plant will decide whether to let the International Association of Machinists (IAM) union represent them in a state that is extremely hostile to unions. The vote has triggered a bitter propaganda war between the IAM and Boeing, with TV and billboard ads and social-media campaigns trying to sway the result. The visit could mark the warming of Trump’s relations with Boeing. The company’s leadership has been trying to get back on track with Trump ever since a tweet in December about the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One being “out of control”got things off to a bad start. Trump has also thrown into doubt Boeing’s ability to finalize a big jet order from Iran. When Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump last month, he discussed how to reduce costs on the presidential jet. Trump also used the talk with Muilenburg to criticize the pricing of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 jet fighter, which he also deemed too expensive, by implying that the Pentagon might order more Boeing F/A-18 fighters instead — even though those aircraft are not comparable. Muilenburg’s meeting with Trump may already have achieved one unexpected victory for Boeing: Trump seems to have reversed his opposition to the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which helps finance overseas sales of Boeing commercial airplanes. During the election campaign, Trump fell in line with conservative Republicans who oppose the Ex-Im Bank as “corporate welfare.” But last week, a group of U.S. senators who met with the president reported that Trump told them he had changed his mind, persuaded by Muilenburg’s arguments that the bank supports American jobs at no cost to the taxpayer. His visit would come a year to the day since Trump warned, in a South Carolina appearance, that unless he was elected, Boeing within a few short years would ship all its jobs from the state to China, where Boeing had agreed to open a joint venture to paint planes and install seats and other interior fixtures. “They are going to build that plant, they are going to devalue the hell out of their currency, and all of a sudden you’re gonna be reading a big front-page story, all over the place, that Boeing is going to leave South Carolina, they’re going to make all their planes in China. Because that’s what they do,” Trump told an audience in Walterboro, S.C. “And our leaders aren’t smart enough to stop it, OK?” Aerospace analysts at the time scoffed at his dire prediction, noting Boeing’s massive investment in the South Carolina complex.

Delivery of the single-aisle 737 MAX models, which replace the current 737 "NG" introduced in 1997, is crucial for Boeing to hit the financial targets it has promised investors and to offset slowing output of some of its largest jets such as the 777 and 747. Airlines want the MAX because it burns significantly less fuel than current models. The world's largest plane maker is creating up to five MAX versions, while planning to increase output to 57 planes a month in 2019, from 42 a month at present. The first MAX model in production, known as the MAX-8, is on track to reach customers by mid-year. "We are anticipating our certification of the airplane within a matter of days-weeks," Keith Leverkuhn, 737 general manager, said at a Monday briefing embargoed until Tuesday. The stamp of approval by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration would come about a year after the MAX-8's first flight and allow Boeing to begin delivering the $110 million, 162-seat jetliner in the second quarter, he said. Deliveries trigger the bulk of airline payments. Norwegian Air Shuttle will be one of the first airlines to fly the plane commercially, likely ahead of launch customer Southwest Airlines Co, which was first to order the MAX but is taking longer to put it into service. Boeing expects the MAX to account for as much as 15 percent of the 500 or more 737s it expects to deliver in 2017, rising to nearly 100 percent by 2020. Boeing on Monday showed off the first 737 MAX-9 sitting near the end of the assembly line at its factory in Renton, Washington. The nearly completed jet, which carries a list price of $116.6 million and seats 178, will undergo about nine months of testing after first flight in April. MAX-10 TAKES SHAPE Boeing is mulling an even larger version, the 737 MAX-10, to take on rival Airbus, which has had strong sales of its A321neo that is a larger competitor to the MAX-9. The MAX-10 would be 66 inches (1.68 m) longer than the MAX-9, with the same engine thrust. The major change will be the landing gear, which must be taller to accommodate the longer fuselage. Boeing expects to test various landing gear designs this year "to see which one ... is going to be the best solution," Leverkuhn said. Boeing is about 90 percent finished with design drawings for the smallest version, the 737 MAX-7. A high-density MAX-200, with seating for 200 passengers, rounds out the model line. Sales of Boeing's larger twin-aisle planes have slowed sharply and the company is cutting output of the profitable 777 by 40 percent this year. It will rely on the 737 and 787 to make up a large part of the financial difference. Introducing new models while increasing production rates requires Boeing to solve any factory issues quickly. So far, Leverkuhn said, "the hours to build the MAX are meeting our expectation."

Delivery of the single-aisle 737 MAX models, which replace the current 737 "NG" introduced in 1997, is crucial for Boeing to hit the financial targets it has promised investors and to offset slowing output of some of its largest jets such as the 777 and 747. Airlines want the MAX because it burns significantly less fuel than current models.

Now, it appears as if self-flying passenger drones are next -- and they could flying in one major city as soon as this July. That’s according to a plan revealed Monday in Dubai, where the head of the Dubai Roads and Transportation Authority said it wants to develop passenger-carrying drones as a way to move people around the United Arab Emirates’ biggest city. Officials said flights could begin in July, though few other details were offered. The Associated Press reports the drone type being pursued for Dubai’s passenger service is the Chinese-made EHang 184, “an egg-shaped craft with four legs sticking out, each with two small propellers.” FULL REPORT: Up, up and away: Passenger-carrying drone to fly in Dubai How would it work? A rider would add a destination on a touch screen in front of the passenger seat. From there, the drone would lift off and “automatically” fly to the passengers’ destination.  AP says the EHang 184 drone has a battery life that allows for 30 minutes of flying and could cover about 30 miles. The drones can handle a flier and a small bag weighing up to a combined total of 220 pounds.

This is 10 times better,” Yan, said to the Daily Mail. “Everything is calculated in the backend to pick the most optimal route for you, so there is no collision with the other drones flying,” Yan added to the newspaper. “On the drone itself we have built pretty sophisticated back up services so if another system fails then another will take over.” Dubai’s plans for the EHang 184 were unveiled during the World Government Summit being held there. "This is not only a model," Mattar al-Tayer, head of Dubai's Roads and Transportation Authority, told AP. "We have actually experimented with this vehicle flying in Dubai's skies."

(Travis Dove/Bloomberg via Getty Images)   Workers at Boeing’s aircraft plant in South Carolina are voting Wednesday on whether to join a union, capping a multi-year campaign. The road to victory will not be easy. Anti-union sentiment runs high in South Carolina, where union membership is just 1.6 percent—the lowest in the nation. The state is also “right-to-work,” which means members are not required to pay for the costs associated with representation. The campaign is being run by the International Association of Machinists (IAM) and involves some 3,000 Boeing workers in North Charleston, South Carolina. In 2015, IAM cancelled a vote, citing “an atmosphere of threats, harassment and unprecedented political interference.” Since a new election was scheduled last month, Boeing workers who spoke to In These Times say that Boeing has been unrelenting in its opposition to the union. “It’s just a constant barrage—any opportunity they’ve had, they’ve hit us with [an] anti-union message,” says Randy Toler, a worker. Boeing did not respond immediately to a request to comment. “A normal day consists of, you go to work, you’ll hear something anti-union at your morning meeting, there will be some [literature] handed out, so when you take your breaks in the break area they've got the TVs running and they play anti-union commercials throughout the day, and you top that off when you get home. You've got the [anti-union] commercials, radio and TV, and then you check your mailbox and you've got [anti-union literature] in your mailbox,” says Elliott Slater, another worker. One prominent example of the company’s anti-union campaign was a recent breakroom display of $800 worth of diapers and children’s clothes. As Toler explains, “They’re trying to say, ‘This represents your [annual] union dues. You can buy all this stuff had you not paid union dues.’ My response back to that is why don’t they show you the house that you would have been able to make a down payment on because you would have gotten higher wages because you belong to the union?” Coincidentally, $800 is about the difference in monthly wages between union and nonunion workers nationwide, according to a recent report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “I would gladly pay my union dues to be able to make a better life,” says Toler. Boeing’s overt anti-union campaigning is paired with “whisper campaigns,” which is “something that gets told to a small group of employees, possibly from their manager or somebody, and kind of catches fire and becomes factual and we have to spend a lot of time reeling that back to get the truth out and the facts,” says Mike Evans, lead IAM organizer. “A lot of times it just comes in very lightly and gets into the drinking water and causes the campaign a lot of trouble.” These whisper campaigns, along with the very public anti-union statements made by local and state politicians, are what helped tank the 2015 election. “Last time, there was a lot of discussion that the plant would close for three months just to plan to negotiate with the IAM,” says Evans. “You’re never going to find that in writing anywhere. You’re never going to see that in an e-mail blast from the vice-president or management. You’re never going to see that, but it’s just something that they bring out to threaten the workers with.” The anti-union activity at Boeing has some workers worried that IAM’s current effort will come down to just a few votes. “A month ago, I would have said we had a small majority of people that were going to vote in favor of the union and I was pretty confident about it, but now my confidence is eroding,” says Toler. “I think it’s just due to that constant barrage of misinformation that we’re getting hit with. It’s almost generational here. The younger people are more strongly against it.” “I remember my father being in the union and seeing how people were paid and how the middle-class families were better off as a result of being in unions. I remember that. And the younger folks don’t have that connection,” Toler says. But Evans says that IAM has a “much more robust campaign, as far as support goes” compared to its previous effort because the situation at Boeing has not improved since 2015. “The workers here are somewhere around 30 percent to 36 percent, on average, below their counterparts of the same tenure in Washington [state], but then Boeing keeps telling these people that they’re getting a fair shake,” Evans says. “Their attacks on the workers, you know, is ‘well, you’re getting paid pretty well for the area,’ but we’re talking about an industry that carries a lot of wealth for people—making a lot of people rich.” Never has independent journalism mattered more.

A win for the Machinists union, which wants to represent nearly 3,000 workers at the new plant, would be a rare victory for labor in the South. Manufacturers have been drawn to the region because unions are much less common there than in the North. That's why Boeing spent billions to open its newest plant in North Charleston. Its aim was to have a non-union facility. The plant will get additional attention this week. President Donald Trump plans to visit the plant on Friday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday. Trump has clashed with Boeing on the cost of the new Air Force One. And his criticism of the Iran nuclear deal has placed an $8 billion sale of Boeing jets to Iran Air at risk. Related: Trump move on Iran could cost jobs at Boeing But the Machinists, which represents most of the factory workers at Boeing, won the right to have a vote to unionize the South Carolina facility. A win would give the union even more leverage over Boeing in talks, preventing it from continuing production of its 787 Dreamliner jet during a strike at unionized plants. A union loss would further encourage other manufacturers to open union-free plants in the South. A union win Wednesday "won't be a turnaround for their labor movement. But it'd be a major step forward," said Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations and labor historian at Clark University. "Just having enough support to hold an election is a very big deal. I think most of the workers at the Boeing plant had a predisposition to vote against the union." But Chaison said it's still an uphill fight -- about 40% to 50% of organizing votes fail, he said. South Carolina has the lowest share of unionized workers of any state -- less than 2%. When Boeing moved to open the South Carolina plant, the company said it wanted to assure customers of the 787 Dreamliner, which is built there, that strikes wouldn't upset its production schedule. Workers assemble 787 Dreamliner jets at Boeing plant in South Carolina. The union filed an unfair labor practice, seeking to shut the plant before it even opened in 2011. The Obama administration's labor board sided with the union, arguing that Boeing was trying to punish workers for past strikes by opening a non-union plant in South Carolina instead of Washington. Before the labor board made a final decision, the union and Boeing reached a deal and the union dropped its complaint. Now the fight is on again. The South Carolina workers who want union representation say their unionized peers in Washington earn about $10 an hour more than they do. The top wage in Washington for the most common job category is $36 an hour, while it tops out at $22 an hour in South Carolina, according to Mike Evans, a union organizer. "Do your children deserve as much as the children of Boeing children in Seattle?" said a union blog post to employees in South Carolina. For its part, Boeing says pay scales are driven by wages in the local market, and that the South Carolina plant already pays better wages than a union-represented Boeing plant in Alabama. The company has warned workers they may be forced to go on strike against their wishes if the union comes in. Related: Boeing pitches China facility as Trump-friendly "The [Machinists union] has actively worked to prevent the success of Boeing South Carolina from the beginning of the operation here," the company said. "We have developed a culture of working together. This site doesn't have a union, and it doesn't need one." Boeing (BA) has been cutting back on jobs -- employment in its commercial aircraft division is down about 8,000, or nearly 10%, in the last year. But many of those cuts have come from lines building narrow-body jets, not the 787. The battle between Boeing and the union won't end with Wednesday's vote. If it loses, the union could try for another vote in a year. If it wins, it would then start trying to negotiate a contract with Boeing to cover the South Carolina workers. That would probably be a contentious process. --CNN's Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.

Trump’s visit – detailed earlier this week by reporter David Wren of The (Charleston, S.C.) Post and Courier – has been confirmed as a product unveiling ceremony at the Boeing manufacturing facility in North Charleston, S.C., according to our sources. Boeing’s South Carolina plant is rolling out the first Dreamliner 787-10 this Friday morning (February 17).   An extended length version of its next-generation, composite fiber passenger airliner, the plane is rumored to be the most fuel-efficient passenger plane in the world. As of this writing, there are 154 orders from nine customers for the $300 million jet – which is 224-feet long and can seat approximately 330 passengers.  The original Dreamliner – the 787-8 – is 186-feet long and can seat approximately 242 passengers. According to our sources, the unveiling ceremony in North Charleston will be a private event with attendance limited to Boeing employees – the same employees who would have voted less than forty-eight hours previously on whether to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) union. Our sources say the union is unlikely to win that election, which is being overseen by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Trump will appear onstage alongside S.C. governor Henry McMaster and Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, we’re told.  He will have a private meeting with McMaster at some point during the trip, although details of that confab were not immediately available. McMaster owes his position to Trump, who appointed former S.C. governor Nikki Haley as his ambassador to the United Nations – clearing the way for the 69-year-old politician to ascend to the office he’s long-coveted. Trump’s South Carolina sources refused to comment on the details of the event, referring all inquiries back to the White House. Obviously this website has had a contentious relationship with Boeing over the years as we have sought to hold the company accountable for the $1 billion in taxpayer-provided incentives it has received from the Palmetto State over the last eight years (we oppose such government largesse on principle). Trump has sparred with Boeing, too, challenging the company’s cost estimates on its next Air Force One planes.

Education Databases: Searchable databases on demographics, test scores, financial information and te BY GEORGE WILL / Published: February 13, 2017 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     WASHINGTON — At their post-Civil War apogee, 19th-century Republicans were the party of activist government, using protectionism to pick commercial winners and promising wondrous benefits from government’s deft interventions in economic life. Today, a Republican administration promises that wisely wielded Washington power can rearrange commercial activities in ways superior to those produced by private-sector calculations in free market transactions. According to the Financial Times, which interviewed him, Peter Navarro, head of the president’s National Trade Council, says an administration priority is “unwinding and repatriating the international supply chains on which many U.S. multinational companies rely.” This will make life interesting for, among many others, America’s third- and 24th-largest corporations, Apple and Boeing. The tiny print on the back of iPhones accurately says it is “assembled,” not manufactured, in China. The American Enterprise Institute’s James Pethokoukis notes that parts come from South Korea, Japan, Italy, Taiwan, Germany and the United States. Components of Boeing airliners’ wings come from Japan, South Korea and Australia; horizontal stabilizers and center fuselages from Italy; cargo access doors from Sweden; passenger entry doors from France; landing gear doors from Canada; engines and landing gear from Britain. Navarro’s “unwinding and repatriating” is, to say no more, part of an improbable project: making American greater by making Apple, Boeing and many other corporations much less efficient and less competitive. This will further slow economic growth, making even more unattainable the 4 percent (more than double the economy’s average growth this century) or higher growth that the administration says will enable it to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure (including a $15 billion or so wall on the Mexican border, begun after nearly a decade of net negative immigration from Mexico), while substantially increasing military spending, leaving entitlements unreformed and delivering enormous tax cuts. Cuts that, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (co-chaired by Republican Mitch Daniels and Democrat Leon Panetta, both former directors of the Office of Management and Budget), will reduce revenues by $5.8 trillion over 10 years. This, as the Congressional Budget Office projects that even without any of the administration’s proposed spending spree and tax cuts, under current law the national debt would increase by $9.4 trillion. Speaking of supply chains: In her book “The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy,” Georgetown University’s Pietra Rivoli recounts a conversation with a man from Shanghai who said that if she would come to China he would help her see various places involved in producing the inexpensive T-shirts exported to America. She would see where the yarn is spun, the fabric is knit and the shirts are sewn. Asked if she could see where the cotton is grown, the man from China said he could not show her that because the cotton probably is grown in “Teksa.” Rivoli spun a globe around to China and asked him to point to Teksa. “He took the globe and spun it back around the other way. ‘Here, I think it is grown here.’ I followed his finger. Patrick was pointing at Texas.” Today’s Republican administration promises protection against the destruction of American jobs by the Chinese, Mexicans and other foreigners. The really prolific destroyers are: Americans. As Reason’s John Tamny says, Americans streaming movies from Netflix (based in Los Gatos, Calif.) erase American jobs in movie theaters and DVD rental stores. Americans buying books from Seattle-based Amazon have caused many American bookstores to do what Borders’ (400 stores, 11,000 employees) did: disappear. Americans using San Francisco-based Uber destroy taxi drivers’ jobs. Evidently our protectors in the administration must believe this: The destruction of American jobs because Americans buy goods or services of some American companies rather than those of other American companies is benign. But the destruction of American jobs because Americans buy goods or services of foreign companies is intolerable. An administration confident about conducting interventions in the economy should demonstrate care when bandying numbers. But in defending the sensible idea of reducing government regulation of the financial sector, Gary Cohn, director of the president’s National Economic Council, said this would save “literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year.” Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers notes the implausibility: “Total bank profits last year were about $170 billion.” Deregulation will more than double profits? As today’s Republicans celebrate a protectionist administration that is confident that Washington’s superior wisdom can improve upon the market’s allocation of economic resources, Democrats must resent Republican plagiarism. Who will protect Americans from their protectors? GEORGE WILL writes for The Washington Post. georgewill@washpost.com.

USA TODAY NETWORK United Airlines said it's investigating after one of its pilots took to a plane’s intercom system this past Saturday with a bizarre rant that spooked passengers and touched on Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and her own divorce. The pilot boarded the plane dressed in street clothes, and her “long, bizarre speech” spooked more than a dozen passengers into leaving the aircraft, The Washington Post reports. United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart confirmed to The Associated Press the pilot wasn't in uniform when she boarded the plane Saturday. He said the carrier brought in a replacement pilot for the Austin-to-San Francisco flight, which ultimately was delayed by about two hours. Passengers on the flight shared details of the unusual incident on social media, posting commentary and even video of the pilot talking to passengers over the intercom system.

"She started off by saying that she had not voted for either Trump or Clinton because they're a bunch of liars. ... It just really sort of went downhill from there and didn't make a lot of sense to any of us," O'Neal added. The Austin American-Statesmen cited a YouTube video of the incident – since removed – that the paper said showed some of the pilot's rant. In that video, the American-Statesman quoted the pilot as trying to reassure passengers by saying: "Don't worry, I'm going to let my co-pilot fly [the plane]. He's a man.” So, y'all. I'm shaking right now. I just left my @united flight 455 'cos the captain demonstrated that she was not mentally in a safe space.— Randy Reiss (@undeadsinatra) February 11, 2017 Chris Moore tells the Washington Post he at first thought the woman was simply another customer on the flight. “I thought she was a first-class passenger, complaining,” he said to the Post. “Then she grabs the mic.” Hobart, the United spokesman, told AP that the company didn't immediately have additional information about the incident and said he didn’t know why the pilot was allowed on the plane in plain clothes. He said the company would launch an investigation and discuss the matter with the pilot. “We hold our employees to the highest standards and have replaced this pilot with a new one to operate the flight, which has since departed from Austin,” the airline said in a formal statement. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.” TWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky Photo tour: Planespotting at San Francisco International (SFO) IN PICTURES: United Airlines launches San Francisco-Singapore nonstops FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn United Airlines launches San Francisco-Singapore nonstops  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

The cockpit crew making a test flight with Boeing’s new 737 MAX this past Saturday was tasked with a nine-hour flight, part of routine endurance testing for a new aircraft type. But instead of flying in circles or some other ho-hum route, the pilots got creative. “For eight of its nine hours aloft, the 737 MAX worked on its aerial penmanship writing a 997 km (619 mi) long, 277 km (172 mi) high ‘MAX’ over the states of Washington and Montana,” writes flight-tracking site FlightRadar24, one of the first to report on the unique flight plan. “The ‘MAX’ portion of the flight covered approximately 5,534 km (3,439 miles),” the website added on its blog, which included a flight-tracking map simulating the plane's route.

"We did conduct a roughly 9-hour test flight over the weekend," Kim said by email. "It's just one of the many tests we're doing to validate the 737 MAX's industry leading range and reliability." Of course, this isn’t the first time Boeing’s test pilots have gotten creative. You may recall that time in June 2011 when test pilots on Boeing’s then new 747-8 – the latest variant of that aircraft – made a 2,500-mile trip to Pittsburgh so the crew could order a sandwich from Primanti Bros., a well-known local restaurant. There was also the 2014 test flight when another 747 crew flew in the outline of a giant “12” over eastern Washington state. That flight, operated with a 747 painted in the colors of the Seattle Seahawks, was a tribute to the NFL team's boisterous home crowd that makes Seattle fans a figurative "12th man" on the field for the team's games.

By Paul Ausick February 14, 2017 9:05 am EST Print Email Tweet In a meeting last Thursday between President Trump and executives of several U.S. airlines, the headline outcome was Trump’s proposal to fix a “totally out of whack” revamping of the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) overhaul of the country’s air traffic control system. The president was sympathetic to changing the FAA’s behind-schedule and over-budget upgrade while at the same time making no promises. Trump also sidestepped another issue that has roiled U.S. carriers: the Obama administration’s refusal to take the carriers’ side in a dispute over the Open Skies agreement that allows three Middle Eastern airlines to fly disputed routes to the United States. U.S. legacy carriers United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL), American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) and Delta Air Lines Co. (NYSE: DAL) used the occasion of the meeting with Trump to make their case for imposing limits to the Open Skies deal. While the President was again sympathetic, he also was aware of the impact on Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) of reducing flights — and future purchases of new aircraft — for Emirates Airlines, Etihad Airlines and Qatar Airways. According to a report in Politico this was Trump’s response: “I know you’re under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers. I’ve been hearing that a little bit,” Trump said at the start of the discussion. “At the same time, we want to make life good for them, also. They come with big investments. In many cases, those investments are made by their governments. But they are still big investments.” The airlines and the pilots union are also unhappy with the Ireland-based subsidiary of Norwegian Airlines, which plans to begin transatlantic flights later this year at a rumored one-way fare of $75. The airline plans to fly from second-tier airports on both sides of the Atlantic and to use both its current fleet of Boeing 787s and new 737-9s that are scheduled for delivery beginning this spring. The pilots union has complained about the makeup of flight crews, but the airline has said that 50% of its crews and pilots are or will be U.S.-based. This issue did not come up at the airlines’ meeting with Trump, according to Politico. The U.S. Travel Association, an industry group representing “all components of the travel industry,” sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last Friday supporting the existing Open Skies agreement: By reducing government interference in air travel, [Open Skies] agreements have led to hundreds of thousands of new American travel and manufacturing jobs, billions in U.S. economic growth, lower airfares for travelers, more flights to airports to and beyond major gateways, and new opportunities for U.S. airlines. … While their arguments are couched in compelling terms, the Big Three airlines are not seeking a level playing field to compete. Instead, they are lobbying for government intrusion that would benefit themselves, but hurt American manufacturing jobs, threaten U.S. economic growth and undermine U.S. national security interests. Norwegian, Emirates and Qatar Airways are among Boeing’s top 10 customers. Emirates currently has unfilled orders for 174 aircraft, 24 of the existing 777-300ER and 150 of the 777X scheduled for deliveries beginning in 2020. Norwegian has 144 undelivered planes on Boeing’s order book: 125 of both current generation and 737 MAX planes and 19 787-9s. Qatar Airways is awaiting delivery of 105 planes: 75 777s, including 60 of the 777X and 30 787-9s. These planes total well over $100 billion in new orders. If the orders are cut or cancelled, it could be difficult, if not impossible, for Boeing to replace them and that could mean thousands of lost manufacturing jobs in the United States. It is highly unlikely that President Trump will sign up for that.

A win for the Machinists union, which wants to represent nearly 3,000 workers at the new plant, would be a rare victory for labor in the South. Manufacturers have been drawn to the region because unions are much less common there than in the North. That's why Boeing spent billions to open its newest plant in North Charleston. Its aim was to have a non-union facility. The plant will get additional attention this week. President Donald Trump plans to visit the plant on Friday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday. Trump has clashed with Boeing on the cost of the new Air Force One. And his criticism of the Iran nuclear deal has placed an $8 billion sale of Boeing jets to Iran Air at risk. But the Machinists, which represents most of the factory workers at Boeing, won the right to have a vote to unionize the South Carolina facility. A win would give the union even more leverage over Boeing in talks, preventing it from continuing production of its 787 Dreamliner jet during a strike at unionized plants. A union loss would further encourage other manufacturers to open union-free plants in the South. A union win Wednesday "won't be a turnaround for their labor movement. But it'd be a major step forward," said Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations and labor historian at Clark University. "Just having enough support to hold an election is a very big deal. I think most of the workers at the Boeing plant had a predisposition to vote against the union." But Chaison said it's still an uphill fight -- about 40% to 50% of organizing votes fail, he said. South Carolina has the lowest share of unionized workers of any state -- less than 2%. When Boeing moved to open the South Carolina plant, the company said it wanted to assure customers of the 787 Dreamliner, which is built there, that strikes wouldn't upset its production schedule. The union filed an unfair labor practice, seeking to shut the plant before it even opened in 2011. The Obama administration's labor board sided with the union, arguing that Boeing was trying to punish workers for past strikes by opening a non-union plant in South Carolina instead of Washington. Before the labor board made a final decision, the union and Boeing reached a deal and the union dropped its complaint. Now the fight is on again. The South Carolina workers who want union representation say their unionized peers in Washington earn about $10 an hour more than they do. The top wage in Washington for the most common job category is $36 an hour, while it tops out at $22 an hour in South Carolina, according to Mike Evans, a union organizer. "Do your children deserve as much as the children of Boeing children in Seattle?" said a union blog post to employees in South Carolina. For its part, Boeing says pay scales are driven by wages in the local market, and that the South Carolina plant already pays better wages than a union-represented Boeing plant in Alabama. The company has warned workers they may be forced to go on strike against their wishes if the union comes in. "The [Machinists union] has actively worked to prevent the success of Boeing South Carolina from the beginning of the operation here," the company said. "We have developed a culture of working together. This site doesn't have a union, and it doesn't need one." Boeing has been cutting back on jobs -- employment in its commercial aircraft division is down about 8,000, or nearly 10%, in the last year. But many of those cuts have come from lines building narrow-body jets, not the 787. The battle between Boeing and the union won't end with Wednesday's vote. If it loses, the union could try for another vote in a year. If it wins, it would then start trying to negotiate a contract with Boeing to cover the South Carolina workers. That would probably be a contentious process. --CNN's Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Back to site Labor Unions Economic development How a Union Vote in Charleston Could Change the Labor Movement in the South How a Union Vote in Charleston Could Change the Labor Movement in the South Boeing is fighting a union drive at its 787 Dreamliner plant. By Mike ElkTwitter February 13, 2017 Facebook Twitter Email Print Boeing workers at a ceremony showing the first 787 Dreamliner jet in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 27, 2012. (Reuters / Mary Ann Chastain) Mike Evans has worked as an organizer for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) for more than two decades. He says he’s never had an organizing experience like he’s had in Charleston, South Carolina—home of a 6,000-worker Boeing plant. Ad Policy This post originally appeared at TalkPoverty.org. Last year, when the union tried to sponsor the city’s Cooper River Bridge Run, its check was returned. “We got a letter saying that what we do as a union doesn’t fit with their other sponsors”—which included Boeing, says Evans. The union then tried to sponsor the Knights of Columbus 5K race on Thanksgiving. “They sent the check back after consulting with their board,” says Evans. “They didn’t want to give us any ability to brand ourselves as being part of the community.” Organizers of both events declined to comment on why the union’s sponsorship was rejected. This Wednesday, the workers at the plant will vote on whether to unionize. * * * The Boeing 787 Dreamliner plant in North Charleston is the crown jewel of South Carolina’s economic rebirth. Union opponents point to a state economy that is currently growing at twice the rate of the US economy. However, that growth hasn’t meant equal opportunity for all. South Carolina has the 11th highest poverty rate in the United States, with 16.7 percent of its residents living below the poverty line. Despite the opening of new manufacturing plants, the state’s poverty rate is actually higher than when the recession began in 2008. One contributing factor is a lack of unions throughout the state, which depresses wages. In fact, research shows that unions increase workers’ wages and benefits, reduce inequality and poverty, and boost economic mobility across generations. At the North Charleston plant, for example, Evans says that workers in some job classifications are paid half as much as their unionized counterparts in Washington State, and that they often have second or third jobs to help make ends meet. As a result, the IAM has been trying to organize since the plant first opened in 2011.

If there is a picnic in the city, they are there.” Boeing has countered with billboards and TV ads painting the IAM as an out-of-state organization that previously tried to prevent the plant from opening in order to keep jobs in Washington State. To support its case, Boeing has focused heavily on an NLRB complaint that the union filed in 2011 and later withdrew. In it, the IAM alleged that the company shifted work to South Carolina in order to retaliate against Washington State–based union workers who went on strike in 2009. “Boeing has always believed in South Carolina, but the IAM hasn’t,” reads the introduction to a video at WeAreBoeingSC.com, an anti-union website built by the corporation. “Now they want our teammates and our community to forget about how they tried to shut us down.” Boeing workers have been forced to attend anti-union seminars. Management even set up two tables at the plant—one with diapers and children’s clothing, another with groceries—each representing the $800 dollars in union dues that workers would pay annually. This isn’t the first time Boeing has taken on an IAM organizing effort at the plant. In 2015, the company organized town-hall meetings with workers and promised to address their complaints. Many workers believed Boeing’s assurances, and support for the union waned. Fearing a loss, the IAM called off the election. The stakes are higher now than ever. Get The Nation in your inbox. But the union says this time around is different—some of the goodwill workers felt towards the company has worn off. “We are getting much more support than last time because of [Boeing’s] broken promises,” says Evans. Workers say that the plant has reneged on promises to be more responsive to feedback, hold regular meetings with workers to hear criticism, increase wages, and make scheduling more consistent. GET A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR JUST $9.50! Subscribe “I have honestly never worked anywhere, union or not, that flip-flops so much as Boeing has lately,” says Sean Cribb, a production worker at the plant. “They can’t decide overtime rules, [or] work schedules. They are moving management around so much that none of them can learn the work package so they can better assist their team.” Although Boeing declined to comment on any of these specific allegations—and it’s worth noting that US labor protections are so weak that none of this anti-union activity is illegal—spokesperson Elizabeth Merida said in a statement, “[Boeing] believe[s] our team is best served by having a direct relationship with the company and working as one team as we continue to build on the great successes that have already been achieved here.” * * * Union officials say a win on February 15 could be a watershed moment, opening the door for organizing in the South, beginning with the BMW plant in Spartanburg or the soon-to-open Volvo plant in Berkeley County. “This would be the breakthrough of the century if they would win,” says Riley. That’s because corporations and their political allies routinely argue—with great success—that unions in the North are the main reason so many corporations are heading south. South Carolina has the lowest unionization rate of any state in the nation, with only 2.1 percent of its workers organized. Former Governor Nikki Haley was explicit about her desire to keep unions out. “You’ve heard me say many times I wear heels. It’s not for a fashion statement. It’s because we’re kicking them every day, and we’ll continue to kick them,” she said. But Evans and other organizers say a win in North Charleston would be a huge step toward ending that anti-union legacy, finally giving workers in South Carolina a voice in addressing wages and increasing inequality. “This is such a tough environment. There is really a lack of any structure that tells people that they can do this,” says Evans. “When they see workers at Boeing get a first contract and it’s decent, I think a lot more people in the South will want to reach out.” 0 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print Mike Elk Twitter Mike Elk is an award-winning labor reporter, who previously served as a labor reporter at POLITICO and In These Times.

Export to a third nation is an additional bonus. If someone wants to shift a facility to India it’s their choice, or they wants to assemble a new one. I am no way concerned with it,” said Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar after inaugurating the biennial Aero India show on Tuesday. “If they’re proposing something, their government has to give them in-principle approval so that they can quote it to me. If something is not given or someone has not given it to them, then they cannot give a quote to me,” he said, but did not clarify whether a request for proposal has been issued. Parrikar was responding to queries on US President Donald Trump’s push for Make in America, to revive US manufacturing and generate local jobs. In October, India floated a request for information to global jet makers to partner with Indian companies and jointly bid to sell single-engine fighters for the Indian Air Force. The contest is different from the 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft, which was finalised with a 36-plane order from France’s Rafale, which will begin delivery from September 2019. Lockheed Martin has offered to transfer its Fort Worth production line to India and make the latest Block-70 of F-16 fighters. Saab, which makes the Gripen fighter, has not only offered to help with Mark-1 and Mark-2 of India’s light combat aircraft Tejas, but also co-develop the advanced medium combat aircraft, which the Defence Research and Development Organisation plans to develop. Independently, the Indian Navy has floated a tender to supply and produce 57 twin-engine carrier-borne fighters, for which Boeing has expressed interest to participate with its F-18 twin-engine planes. It opted to buy from the global market after it publicly rejected the navy version of the Tejas, saying it was overweight and would not meet its requirements. Parrikar also reiterated the country’s stand that 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence in select areas would be allowed only to bridge technology gaps, than a blanket approval. “Suppose someone comes to manufacture engines, which we don’t have technology in, I will definitely consider it. 100 per cent FDI in areas where I do not have any expertise, I will definitely consider it. What’s the point of getting stuck and continuing to import?” he said.

Documents obtained this month by The Seattle Times through a Freedom of Information Act request show the cases revealed a disquieting pattern of falsified paperwork and ignored procedures that created quality issues on the production lines of Boeing and its suppliers. The FAA found that Boeing repeatedly failed to follow protocols designed to guard against production errors that put safety at risk. Some tasks were signed off as completed and checked when they were not. Other work was done without authorization. The result was multiple errors in manufacturing, some of which passed right through the system to airplanes in service. Boeing also failed to take corrective action in a timely way after issues were discovered, the FAA found. In one case, Air Canada ground crews in January 2015 discovered a 3-foot-wide puddle of fuel that had leaked from an engine pylon of the airline’s first 787 Dreamliner after it landed at an unnamed airport. Leaking fuel around a hot engine is a fire hazard. An FAA investigation revealed that Boeing had noted the leak nine months earlier, before it delivered the plane, and had supposedly reworked the pylon at a Seattle-area plant in the city of Everett to fix the problem. A mechanic and a quality-control inspector signed off on the rework as completed. But as the FAA noted, this “did not represent work performed.” In other words, the repair work hadn’t been done. Even after this instance of leaking fuel discovered on a jet carrying passengers, Boeing’s actions to prevent such an error from reoccurring were “unsatisfactory,” the FAA found. The FAA investigations also reached down into Boeing’s supply chain, where a more egregious violation was noted. In January 2015, a mechanic rigging a large 777 cargo door at a Boeing supplier was questioned about his work by an FAA investigator. The mechanic acknowledged that “he does not use the inspection tools required and enters false inspection data on the work order.” “He admitted to falsely entering the data for approximately 7-8 years,” the FAA letter of investigation states. Capt. John Cox, a veteran pilot and founder of Washington, D.C.-based aviation safety consultancy Safety Operating Systems, said this startling admission worried him far more than any of the inadvertent mistakes listed in the FAA investigation. “When you have a deliberate act, and a culture that condones such a deliberate act, that is of much greater concern from a safety standpoint,” Cox said. “If the culture is, ‘We’ve got to get it out the door,’ and we start creating workarounds and normalized deviations from required procedures, that’s a culture that it is far more likely to experience serious safety issues.” (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) In addition to the relatively light fine in 2015, Boeing committed as part of the settlement to improve its internal quality oversight and management procedures. The FAA also put Boeing on probation for five years, subject to $24 million in additional penalties if it fails to carry through on those improvements. However, this is not the first time the FAA has found Boeing’s manufacturing controls wanting. Stay Informed. Get Top stories in your inbox. * indicates required Email Address * An intensive FAA audit in 2000 found “systemic” failures in the jetmaker’s quality control processes – chiefly inadequate inspection and deviance from required manufacturing procedures. That earlier investigation shook up the company’s relations with the FAA and prompted Boeing to add hundreds of full-time quality inspectors. Seventeen years after that audit, the 2015 FAA settlement represents a new shake-up as some of the same issues resurface. Responding to Seattle Times questions, Boeing defended its broad commitment to quality and safety, and offered specific responses to some of the incidents detailed in the reports. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said, “None of these matters involved immediate safety of flight.” He added that the settlement “reflects the FAA’s recognition that (Boeing) has made a number of substantial improvements to its quality and compliance systems” following the investigations. “Boeing has worked with the FAA and invested significant resources to implement these improvements . including enhancing management oversight and accountability,” Alder said. As for the fuel-leak incident on the Air Canada 787, Alder said a subsequent audit determined that “this was an isolated event,” and the company took “immediate corrective action” against both the Boeing mechanic and the Boeing inspector involved. Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the incident was one of “the typical types of issues that arise when introducing a new aircraft type.” Regarding the falsified supplier data in the rigging of 777 cargo doors, Alder said that after this incident, all 777 large cargo doors manufactured by that supplier were re-checked and met specifications. He added that Boeing’s standard tests would in any case have detected any non-conformance in the doors before delivery. Nevertheless, he said the supplier’s senior leadership had to present to Boeing a detailed plan to make sure it wouldn’t happen again, and the mechanic who had been falsifying data was retrained. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) Fuel leaks, missing tools, crossed wires Other failures in quality workmanship cited by the FAA included: -After an FAA audit of 787 production processes found loose nuts incorrectly installed without a locking safety wire, Boeing’s corrective action was found “insufficient to prevent further occurrences.” Subsequently, airlines found heavy fuel leaks on 787s in passenger service, due to lock wire being either missing or installed backward. The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive warning airlines the situation was “unsafe” and ordering immediate inspection of the same fuel connections on all 787s to prevent possible fuel fires. Following that directive, airlines found five more 787s with the faulty fuel couplings. Boeing says it has revised work instructions and employee training “to prevent this from happening again.” -The wrong tool was used to rig a 777 passenger door, and was then discovered left inside the door after a flight. And another tool was found post-flight left inside the leading edge of a 777 wing. Boeing says it has changed procedures so that employees are required to check out and check in tools, and some are decorated with bright paint or with streamers “to increase tool visibility.” -Wiring bundles “on numerous aircraft at numerous station locations within the aircraft” had wires that were excessively taut, or bent too acutely, or riding over one another with crossovers unprotected, or installed without sufficient clearance. Poorly installed wiring can lead to electrical shorts. -Composites were cooked at too high a temperature at Boeing’s advanced composites center. -Tubing was not installed per the engineering drawing in 777s. -Decompression panels in the cargo bay of a 787 were improperly installed. A constant thread throughout the catalog of concerns in the investigation documents is that Boeing production workers and quality inspectors signed off on work that had not been done. Rules were also violated through lack of a required paper trail. Every step in the building of an airplane is supposed to be copiously documented, checked and rechecked. Yet the FAA found that parts and assemblies were removed and reworked, then reinstalled “without documentation or quality authorization,” the investigations showed. The FAA now has fewer on-site quality inspectors than it did 17 years ago and relies on Boeing to follow precise procedural checks to assure airplane safety. The safety agency’s main role is to check that Boeing sticks to the required quality assurance processes. Under the settlement, Boeing must provide the names and addresses of individual employees found to have falsely stamped any work, so the FAA could potentially initiate criminal prosecutions of such employees – though that has never actually happened at Boeing. The settlement also addresses weaknesses in Boeing’s supply chain. Boeing agreed to audit by last month a minimum percentage of its parts suppliers – the percentage was redacted in the documents the FAA provided – to determine if any are “accepting work that is not complete.” As part of the settlement, the FAA said it agreed to limit the fine to $12 million only because of Boeing’s “current and planned remedial efforts.” Capt. Cox said he generally has a high regard for Boeing’s commitment to safety and its system of repeated independent checks and so was surprised to hear of crucial details overlooked and failures passing through unnoticed. “First the worker and then a quality-assurance inspector both failing to address an issue such as a proper lockwire installation, this is not the Boeing way of doing business I’ve been familiar with – which is a culture of safety, a culture of procedural compliance,” he said. Given the millions of individual tasks that go into building each of the roughly 10,0000 Boeing aircraft now safely flying around the world, Cox said “it’s pretty self-evident that they have good solid procedures.” Still, he added, “they are not perfect.” “This audit found weaknesses and gives them the opportunity to improve. It sounds like the FAA did their job.” Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Tumblr Telegram Related Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology senior has worked as a rocket structural design and analysis engineer since June 2016. She designs rocket components for ventures to Mars and other deep space destination, and analyzes them to ensure they won’t break during flight. She’s living out a dream she’s had since she was 11 years old. Guinn remembers seeing a plane and wanting to know how to build one. “I’d had a passion to become a mathematician, inventor — everything you can think of under STEM (science, technology, engineering and math), but when I looked at the plane, I wanted to do that,” Guinn tells USA TODAY College. “I got stuck on that.” (Photo: Tiera Guinn) That interest sparked her desire to study aerospace engineering, which led to her current role. After a Boeing representative visited MIT in 2016, Guinn accepted her dream job with the company working on NASA projects. She works with the structural design and analysis team at Boeing’s Huntsville, Ala. location on school breaks and puts in about 20 hours a week working remotely from campus — all while maintaining a semester’s load of classes. “I’ve seen the design (for the rocket) come into fruition somewhat so far,” says Guinn, 22. “I love looking at something I’m designing and realizing it will be built.” Guinn’s success doesn’t surprise her mentor Orren Williams, who taught her high school engineering classes. “She’s fulfilling her dream, but it wasn’t handed to her — she has worked every step of the way,” Williams says. “She was one of those students who made me get up in morning looking forward to go to class.” Guinn says her drive comes from the significance of her work. “The best part is knowing that what I’m building is going to affect the world and mankind,” she says. “This rocket can really change what we visualize as possible.” Guinn counts Katherine Johnson, a NASA mathematician, as one of her role models. Johnson’s work made instrumental strides in sending the first American to space. What’s more, it inspired the Oscar-nominated, box office hit Hidden Figures. RELATED: In honor of ‘Hidden Figures,’ here are 10 trailblazing women who changed STEM forever “Even in those times, when everything was against her, she still did what she wanted to get done and made history as a result,” Guinn says. “She’s been a huge motivation in my study.” Like Johnson, Guinn is no stranger to challenges. She says she focuses on the support she has received instead of the obstacles yet to come. “My parents always told me that others don’t declare the fate of your destiny,” she says. “It’s up to you to achieve the dream you set in the first place.” Guinn will become a full-time employee in August and will continue to work with rockets. “My most memorable experience in college has been implementing what I’ve learned and experienced,” says Guinn, who serves on the Black Women’s Alliance and also choreographs African dance at MIT. “It’s great because it gets to continue after I graduate.” She may have already achieved her childhood dream, but Guinn shows no signs of slowing down. She plans to create an organization for low-income students that will inspire them to reach their goals as well. “I always like to make the dream larger after it’s achieved,” Guinn says. “I want to pass on the resources I’ve received and much more.” Brooke Metz is a member of the USA TODAY College contributor network.

Ancient cities like Rome, by contrast, look like a pile of spaghetti from a bird’s eye view. It’s not just an aesthetic difference—it’s fundamentally easier to walk around the small blocks of downtown Manhattan (where the Dutch first established a trading post in 1624) versus the wide lanes of Irvine, California, a master-planned suburb built in the 1960s. To get a better idea, check out these grid maps by UC Berkeley city planning researcher Geoff Boeing (as spotted over on FlowingData). Boeing’s visualizations compare aerial views of different cities around the world through one-square-mile snapshots, created using an algorithm that pulls from OpenStreetMap. The unified scale of the visualizations makes it easy to quantify how walking around different places feels. City blocks differ in both size and shape. An aerial view of downtown Paris looks like a windshield that just had a bad encounter with a flying rock. A similar view of Portland looks like a chicken-wire fence. If you look closely, you can compare the width of streets and highways: The maps also show where even the most uniform city grids are interrupted. Since the 1960s, Portland’s dense, walking-friendly blocks have had a giant highway cut through them. Atlanta, too, is a tangle of highways. San Francisco is filled with alleys, as is Tunis. If you look at all of the grids, you can see the difference between cities that were meticulously planned and those that sprang up organically. Dubai and Sacramento look like they were drawn by a city planner’s pencil, but Osaka and Boston clearly expanded more haphazardly over the centuries. The symmetrical boulevards and diagonal side streets of Paris are the result of the 19th century plans of Georges-Eugène Haussmann, who was hired by Napoleon to help remake the city. They are all a good reminder that the easiest cities to get around don’t always have the simplest maps. Rome may look like a tangle of winding streets, but that tight network is much easier to traverse than the very few streets that intersect in a square mile of Irvine’s street grid. And from street level, those tiny blocks tend to look a lot more interesting than big suburban intersections.

Rep. David Mack told several hundred people gathered at a rally Monday in North Charleston that unionizing workers at the plant in his district would be good for South Carolina’s economy. Mack says people will spend more money if they have more take-home wages in their pockets.

(AP) — Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers gathered Monday to hear from union leaders why they should vote to organize in a state where union membership is the lowest in the country. Workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for an hour rallied at a hotel just a mile from Boeing’s North Charleston operation where, on Wednesday, nearly 3,000 workers are set to vote on whether to form a union and be represented by the Machinists. Organizers, community leaders and members of other unions voiced messages of support to the few hundred workers gathered in a large conference room. Ned Blevins, an Orthodox priest from Knoxville, Tennessee, even told attendees they would be “doing God’s work” both in standing up to company bosses and in fighting for their rights to unionize. Boeing employs a total of about 8,000 workers in North Charleston, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner. Engineers at the 100,000-square-foot center work on everything from electromagnetics and advanced aircraft production to chemical technology. Their work is used not only for the company’s commercial airliners but in defense and aerospace applications.

The Machinists petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a vote nearly two years ago but called it off after organizers said they’d been threatened during home visits to plant employees. The union has had members in the Charleston area before, winning the right to represent workers at Vought Aircraft Industries in 2007, a plant that Boeing later bought. Less than two years later, plant workers voted overwhelmingly against union representation. The global aviation company came to South Carolina in part because the state has a minuscule union presence. For decades, state politicians and business leaders have preached that unions hurt the workforce, not help it. During Gov. Nikki Haley’s first year in office, the National Labor Relations Board went to court to block Boeing from making its Dreamliner jet at a new North Charleston factory, saying Chicago-based Boeing built the South Carolina plant in retaliation for past union strikes at the company’s Washington state operations. The NLRB officially dropped its high-profile case later after the Machinists union in Washington approved a 4-year contract extension with Boeing and agreed to withdraw its charge that the company violated federal labor laws. Under the deal, Boeing promised to build the new version of its 737 airplane in Washington state. South Carolina is a right to work state, meaning workers can’t be compelled to join unions, even if the organizations represent them. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state’s union membership — 1.6 percent — is the lowest in the country. But some of Boeing’s South Carolina workforce was previously represented by unions in other places. On Monday, mechanic Steve Winckles said he was a stop steward while working at an airport in New York and doesn’t buy management’s argument that union representation could actually mean more conflict. “I think we need some stability,” he said. “It’s time.” ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Richards/AFP/Getty Images Two 787 Dreamliner aircraft are seen at the Boeing production facilities in 2012 in North Charleston, S.C. This week, Boeing workers in South Carolina will vote whether to unionize. Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images You can't drive anywhere in Charleston without being reminded of the upcoming vote at Boeing. On Wednesday, about 3,000 workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will decide whether they want to join the International Association of Machinists, or IAM. The state has the lowest union membership rate in the country. Around Charleston, Boeing has billboards, T-shirts and ads criticizing the IAM. And the union is countering with its own rallies and ads. Business Boeing To Start Trump Era With New Wave Of Downsizing State leaders have long fought efforts to unionize, arguing it damages South Carolina's competitiveness. In 2011, Boeing moved some assembly of its 787 Dreamliner plane from a union plant in Everett, Wash., to South Carolina. The National Labor Relations Board alleged the company's move was partially to retaliate against Boeing's Washington workers after they struck for higher pay and a better contract. But the charge was eventually dropped. At a recent union meeting near the plant in North Charleston, several workers are grabbing pizza and soda. Union organizer Mike Evans compares salaries at different Boeing sites, 24 of which the IAM represents. "I know what my members are getting paid up in Everett and in St. Louis and in Hunstville, Ala.," Evans says. "Is this good enough for you guys, or do you guys want a change?" According to the company, the pay varies by location. Trump's Presidency Poses Potential Threat To Labor Unions Joan Robinson-Berry leads Boeing's local operation. It's one of the biggest private employers in the Charleston area and is in line with average hourly wages in the area. "Most communities are paid to market," Robinson-Berry says. "Whether you're in a union or not, you're paid to market." Article continues after sponsorship It is cheaper for Boeing to build planes in South Carolina. In 2015, workers tried to organize, but the union canceled the vote citing confusion among workers. Robinson-Berry says the union is bad for business. "Our story is always consistent," she says. "We think this is a facility where we don't need a union. And our direct relationship with our employees to continue to grow this wonderful campus is our vision." South Carolina has enjoyed a manufacturing renaissance. Politicians don't just market the state as pro-business and non-union. During the 2015 campaign to unionize Boeing, the governor at the time, Nikki Haley, was featured in an anti-union radio ad. Lee Adler, with Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, says if workers organize at Boeing this year, it would be a big deal. "It would be as dramatic a private-sector union win as has occurred in the last decade," he says, "and would be a very, very inspirational moment for organized labor that's having a very tough time right now." Labor Unions Appear Set For More State-Level Defeats In 2017 It's a tough time especially in the Southeast, where many states have right-to-work laws that don't require workers to join labor unions or pay dues to keep a job. While overall union membership is down, there have been some gains. In the last few years, auto workers at plants in Tennessee and Alabama have organized. For Boeing employee Chris Jones, this vote has been a long time in the making. He's been working toward this week's vote for six years. "If we go to a vote, and if we lose, I'm OK with that because at least we got a say in it," he says. "It's overwhelmingly obvious that we've never had a voice." unions Boeing South Carolina Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business Documents show safety issues led to major fine for Boeing MONDAY, FEB. 13, 2017, 1:04 P.M. Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS SEATTLE – Newly released documents show that Boeing paid $12 million in late 2015 to settle Federal Aviation Administration investigations into safety issues. Though it was revealed in 2015 that Boeing paid the settlement, documents The Seattle Times obtained this month reveal the investigations came after a pattern of ignored procedures created quality issues on the production lines of Boeing and its suppliers. The FAA found that Boeing repeatedly failed to follow protocols designed to guard against production errors that put safety at risk. Some paperwork was falsified in that it was signed off as completed and checked when they were not. Other work was done without authorization. Some of the errors in manufacturing passed right through the system to airplanes in service. Boeing officials say they are committed to quality and safety. “None of these matters involved immediate safety of flight,” said Boeing spokesman Doug Alder. In one case, Air Canada crews in January discovered a puddle of fuel that had leaked from an engine pylon of the airline’s first 787 Dreamliner after it landed at an unnamed airport. Leaking fuel around a hot engine is a fire hazard. The FAA found that Boeing had noted the leak nine months earlier, before it delivered the plane, and had supposedly reworked the pylon to fix the problem. A mechanic and a quality- control inspector signed off on the rework as completed, but the FAA noted that “did not represent work performed.” Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the incident was one of “the typical types of issues that arise when introducing a new aircraft type.” In January 2015, a mechanic questioned by an FAA investigator admitted to falsely entering data about what tools he uses for inspections for seven or eight years. Capt. John Cox, a veteran pilot and founder of Washington, D.C.-based aviation safety consultancy Safety Operating Systems, said that admission is more startling than the errors themselves. “If the culture is, `We’ve got to get it out the door,’ and we start creating workarounds and normalized deviations from required procedures, that’s a culture that it is far more likely to experience serious safety issues,” he said. Adler, the Boeing spokesman, said many of the FAA documents reflect that the company has made a number of substantial improvements to its compliance systems following the investigations. “Boeing has worked with the FAA and invested significant resources to implement these improvements . including enhancing management oversight and accountability,” Alder said.

"If the culture is, 'We've got to get it out the door,' and we start creating workarounds and normalized deviations from required procedures, that's a culture that it is far more likely to experience serious safety issues," he said. Adler, the Boeing spokesman, said many of the FAA documents reflect that the company has made a number of substantial improvements to its compliance systems following the investigations. "Boeing has worked with the FAA and invested significant resources to implement these improvements . including enhancing management oversight and accountability," Alder said. ___ Information from: The Seattle Times, http://www.seattletimes.com Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Life Buy/Sell Business Close The Boeing Company logo.  (AP Photo/Reed Saxon) Documents show safety issues led to major fine for Boeing Associated Press Feb 13, 2017 (…) The Boeing Company logo.  (AP Photo/Reed Saxon) SEATTLE • Newly released documents show that Boeing paid $12 million in late 2015 to settle Federal Aviation Administration investigations into safety issues. Though it was revealed in 2015 that Boeing paid the settlement, documents The Seattle Times  obtained this month reveal the investigations came after a pattern of ignored procedures created quality issues on the production lines of Boeing and its suppliers. The FAA found that Boeing repeatedly failed to follow protocols designed to guard against production errors that put safety at risk. Some paperwork was falsified in that it was signed off as completed and checked when they were not. Other work was done without authorization. Some of the errors in manufacturing passed right through the system to airplanes in service. Boeing officials say they are committed to quality and safety. "None of these matters involved immediate safety of flight," said Boeing spokesman Doug Alder. In one case, Air Canada crews in January discovered a puddle of fuel that had leaked from an engine pylon of the airline's first 787 Dreamliner after it landed at an unnamed airport. Leaking fuel around a hot engine is a fire hazard. The FAA found that Boeing had noted the leak nine months earlier, before it delivered the plane, and had supposedly reworked the pylon to fix the problem. A mechanic and a quality-control inspector signed off on the rework as completed, but the FAA noted that "did not represent work performed." Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the incident was one of "the typical types of issues that arise when introducing a new aircraft type." In January 2015, a mechanic questioned by an FAA investigator admitted to falsely entering data about what tools he uses for inspections for seven or eight years.

Emirates Airline President Tim Clark said he is looking at buying smaller single-aisle jets, better known for tighter cabins and fewer amenities, rather than its opulent airliners with showers and walkup bars. Clark, longtime president of the world's largest international airline, told CNN's Richard Quest there are three different studies on his desk today. Over the next 18 months the airline will decide between adding the smaller aircraft like the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320, combining that with a deal for smaller twin-aisle jets, or continuing to only buy twin-aisle aircraft. Buying a new fleet of small single-aisle jets would be a radical departure for the Dubai-based airline. Emirates today relies solely on double-deck Airbus A380 superjumbo jets and Boeing 777s that seat from 266 all the way up to 615 passengers. It is the largest operator in the world for both. Related: The world's shortest superjumbo flight It's been more than 20 years since the airline last flew a single-aisle jet in its fleet and Emirates' strategy shift may set up a cut-throat competition between Boeing and Airbus, the two biggest airplane makers. Emirates uses its advantageous geography on the north side of the Arabian peninsula to reach billions of people within an eight hour flight. Its strategy is designed to connect two distant points on the planet using a single stop in Dubai, but its massive jets aren't right for every route. The airline in the coming years is plotting a move to a sprawling new airport, Dubai World Central, from its home at Dubai Internationa. Clark said the greater number of runways and gates means it could serve smaller cities. Related: Dubai airport widens gap over London's Heathrow Airport But before a decision is made, Emirates must first weather a brewing storm in the global economy and declining per passenger profit. Falling oil prices have been a boon for travelers seeking lower fares, but "we are notorious in our business of racing to the bottom whenever there is some advantage given to us and this is no exception," he said. "The last three of four years as the oil prices come off, we have reduced our fares to point of...stupidity in my view. That has affected our bottom line," said Clark. "We have a difficult time in global economics. We have a difficult time in global geopolitics and there is a degree of volatility out there." Emirates already has tens of billions of dollars of aircraft on order with both the Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in Europe, but it has slowed down its plans for buying more. The three options on Clark's desk again delays a decision on whether or not to buy Boeing 787s or Airbus A350s. Emirates canceled an order for 70 A350s in 2014 and recently deferred a batch of superjumbo A380s to 2018 and 2019. Related: Airbus isn't giving up on its A380 superjumbo "When the time is right we will decide," said Clark. "But so far, we are just biding our time to see which way it all pans out." At at a time when Middle East carriers are looking to curry favor with the Trump administration to ensure they continue to be allowed access to U.S. airports, Emirates' decision on big airplane purchases from the U.S. or Europe could have a political tinge. Related: Trump faces delicate balancing act between U.S. and foreign airlines U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines, have urged the State Department to review a treaty that allows the airlines of the U.S. and the home countries of fast-growing Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways unfettered access to each other's airports. As the trio has expanded in the U.S., that has drawn claims of illegal subsidies for the foreign airlines. It's a claim the state-supported trio denies. President Trump signaled in a meeting February 9 with airline CEOs that the administration will work to protect U.S. carriers from foreign competition, but has not specified how. Sean Spicer, White House Press Secretary, has also indicated that preserving manufacturing jobs like those at Boeing is a driving force behind the administration's thinking.

SEATTLE - Though Boeing paid $12 million in late 2015 to settle more than a dozen Federal Aviation Administration investigations, details of the problems found by the safety agency were not disclosed at the time. Documents obtained this month by The Seattle Times through a Freedom of Information Act request show the cases revealed a disquieting pattern of falsified paperwork and ignored procedures that created quality issues on the production lines of Boeing and its suppliers. The FAA found that Boeing repeatedly failed to follow protocols designed to guard against production errors that put safety at risk. Some tasks were signed off as completed and checked when they were not. Other work was done without authorization. The result was multiple errors in manufacturing, some of which passed right through the system to airplanes in service. Boeing also failed to take corrective action in a timely way after issues were discovered, the FAA found. In one case, Air Canada ground crews in January 2015 discovered a 3-foot-wide puddle of fuel that had leaked from an engine pylon of the airline's first 787 Dreamliner after it landed at an unnamed airport. Leaking fuel around a hot engine is a fire hazard. An FAA investigation revealed that Boeing had noted the leak nine months earlier, before it delivered the plane, and had supposedly reworked the pylon at the Everett plant to fix the problem. A mechanic and a quality-control inspector signed off on the rework as completed. But as the FAA noted, this "did not represent work performed." In other words, the repair work hadn't been done. Even after this instance of leaking fuel discovered on a jet carrying passengers, Boeing's actions to prevent such an error from happening again were "unsatisfactory," the FAA found. The FAA investigations also reached down into Boeing's supply chain, where a more egregious violation was noted. In January 2015, a mechanic rigging a large 777 cargo door at a Boeing supplier was questioned about his work by an FAA investigator. The mechanic acknowledged that "he does not use the inspection tools required and enters false inspection data on the work order." "He admitted to falsely entering the data for approximately 7-8 years," the FAA letter of investigation states. Capt. John Cox, a veteran pilot and founder of Washington, D.C.-based aviation safety consultancy Safety Operating Systems, said this startling admission worried him far more than any of the inadvertent mistakes listed in the FAA investigation. "When you have a deliberate act, and a culture that condones such a deliberate act, that is of much greater concern from a safety standpoint," Cox said. "If the culture is, 'We've got to get it out the door,' and we start creating workarounds and normalized deviations from required procedures, that's a culture that is far more likely to experience serious safety issues." Corrective action In addition to the relatively light fine in 2015, Boeing committed as part of the settlement to improve its internal quality oversight and management procedures. The FAA also put Boeing on probation for five years, subject to $24 million in additional penalties if it fails to carry through on those improvements. However, this is not the first time the FAA has found Boeing's manufacturing controls wanting. An intensive FAA audit in 2000 found "systemic" failures in the jetmaker's quality control processes -- chiefly inadequate inspection and deviance from required manufacturing procedures. That earlier investigation shook up the company's relations with the FAA and prompted Boeing to add hundreds of full-time quality inspectors. Seventeen years after that audit, the 2015 FAA settlement represents a new shake-up as some of the same issues resurface. Responding to Seattle Times questions, Boeing defended its broad commitment to quality and safety, and offered specific responses to some of the incidents detailed in the reports. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said, "None of these matters involved immediate safety of flight." He added that the settlement "reflects the FAA's recognition that (Boeing) has made a number of substantial improvements to its quality and compliance systems" following the investigations. "Boeing has worked with the FAA and invested significant resources to implement these improvements ... including enhancing management oversight and accountability," Alder said. As for the fuel-leak incident on the Air Canada 787, Alder said a subsequent audit determined that "this was an isolated event," and the company took "immediate corrective action" against both the Boeing mechanic and the Boeing inspector involved. Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the incident was one of "the typical types of issues that arise when introducing a new aircraft type." Regarding the falsified supplier data in the rigging of 777 cargo doors, Alder said that after this incident, all 777 large cargo doors manufactured by that supplier were re-checked and met specifications. He added that Boeing's standard tests would in any case have detected any non-conformance in the doors before delivery. Nevertheless, he said the supplier's senior leadership had to present to Boeing a detailed plan to make sure it wouldn't happen again, and the mechanic who had been falsifying data was retrained. Other failures in quality workmanship cited by the FAA included: * After an FAA audit of 787 production processes found loose nuts incorrectly installed without a locking safety wire, Boeing's corrective action was found "insufficient to prevent further occurrences." Subsequently, airlines found heavy fuel leaks on 787s in passenger service, due to lock wire being either missing or installed backward. The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive warning airlines the situation was "unsafe" and ordering immediate inspection of the same fuel connections on all 787s to prevent possible fuel fires. Following that directive, airlines found five more 787s with the faulty fuel couplings. New instructions, more training Boeing says it has revised work instructions and employee training "to prevent this from happening again." * The wrong tool was used to rig a 777 passenger door, and was then discovered left inside the door after a flight. And another tool was found post-flight left inside the leading edge of a 777 wing. Boeing says it has changed procedures so that employees are required to check out and check in tools, and some are decorated with bright paint or with streamers "to increase tool visibility." * Wiring bundles "on numerous aircraft at numerous station locations within the aircraft" had wires that were excessively taut, or bent too acutely, or riding over one another with crossovers unprotected, or installed without sufficient clearance. Poorly installed wiring can lead to electrical shorts. * Composites were cooked at too high a temperature at Boeing's advanced composites center on Marginal Way. * Tubing was not installed per the engineering drawing in 777s. * Decompression panels in the cargo bay of a 787 were improperly installed. A constant thread throughout the catalog of concerns in the investigation documents is that Boeing production workers and quality inspectors signed off on work that had not been done. Rules were also violated through lack of a required paper trail. Every step in the building of an airplane is supposed to be copiously documented, checked and rechecked. Yet the FAA found that parts and assemblies were removed and reworked, then reinstalled "without documentation or quality authorization," the investigations showed. A culture of safety The FAA now has fewer on-site quality inspectors than it did 17 years ago and relies on Boeing to follow precise procedural checks to assure airplane safety. The safety agency's main role is to check that Boeing sticks to the required quality assurance processes. Under the settlement, Boeing must provide the names and addresses of individual employees found to have falsely stamped any work, so the FAA could potentially initiate criminal prosecutions of such employees -- though that has never actually happened at Boeing. The settlement also addresses weaknesses in Boeing's supply chain. Boeing agreed to audit by last month a minimum percentage of its parts suppliers -- the percentage was redacted in the documents the FAA provided -- to determine if any are "accepting work that is not complete." As part of the settlement, the FAA said it agreed to limit the fine to $12 million only because of Boeing's "current and planned remedial efforts." Capt. Cox said he generally has a high regard for Boeing's commitment to safety and its system of repeated independent checks and so was surprised to hear of crucial details overlooked and failures passing through unnoticed. "First the worker and then a quality-assurance inspector both failing to address an issue such as a proper lockwire installation, this is not the Boeing way of doing business I've been familiar with -- which is a culture of safety, a culture of procedural compliance," he said. Given the millions of individual tasks that go into building each of the roughly 10,0000 Boeing aircraft now safely flying around the world, Cox said "it's pretty self-evident that they have good solid procedures." Still, he added, "they are not perfect." "This audit found weaknesses and gives them the opportunity to improve. It sounds like the FAA did their job." - The Seattle Times Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

President Trump signaled in a meeting February 9 with airline CEOs that the administration will work to protect U.S. carriers from foreign competition, but has not specified how. Sean Spicer, White House Press Secretary, has also indicated that preserving manufacturing jobs like those at Boeing is a driving force behind the administration's thinking.

Richards/AFP/Getty Images Two 787 Dreamliner aircraft are seen at the Boeing production facilities in 2012 in North Charleston, S.C. This week, Boeing workers in South Carolina will vote whether to unionize. Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images You can't drive anywhere in Charleston without being reminded of the upcoming vote at Boeing. On Wednesday, about 3,000 workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will decide whether they want to join the International Association of Machinists, or IAM. The state has the lowest union membership rate in the country. Around Charleston, Boeing has billboards, T-shirts and ads criticizing the IAM. And the union is countering with its own rallies and ads. Business Boeing To Start Trump Era With New Wave Of Downsizing State leaders have long fought efforts to unionize, arguing it damages South Carolina's competitiveness. In 2011, Boeing moved some assembly of its 787 Dreamliner plane from a union plant in Everett, Wash., to South Carolina. The National Labor Relations Board alleged the company's move was partially to retaliate against Boeing's Washington workers after they struck for higher pay and a better contract. But the charge was eventually dropped. At a recent union meeting near the plant in North Charleston, several workers are grabbing pizza and soda. Union organizer Mike Evans compares salaries at different Boeing sites, 24 of which the IAM represents. "I know what my members are getting paid up in Everett and in St. Louis and in Hunstville, Ala.," Evans says. "Is this good enough for you guys, or do you guys want a change?" According to the company, the pay varies by location. Trump's Presidency Poses Potential Threat To Labor Unions Joan Robinson-Berry leads Boeing's local operation. It's one of the biggest private employers in the Charleston area and is in line with average hourly wages in the area. "Most communities are paid to market," Robinson-Berry says. "Whether you're in a union or not, you're paid to market." Article continues after sponsorship It is cheaper for Boeing to build planes in South Carolina. In 2015, workers tried to organize, but the union canceled the vote citing confusion among workers. Robinson-Berry says the union is bad for business. "Our story is always consistent," she says. "We think this is a facility where we don't need a union. And our direct relationship with our employees to continue to grow this wonderful campus is our vision." South Carolina has enjoyed a manufacturing renaissance. Politicians don't just market the state as pro-business and non-union. During the 2015 campaign to unionize Boeing, the governor at the time, Nikki Haley, was featured in an anti-union radio ad. Lee Adler, with Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, says if workers organize at Boeing this year, it would be a big deal. "It would be as dramatic a private-sector union win as has occurred in the last decade," he says, "and would be a very, very inspirational moment for organized labor that's having a very tough time right now." Labor Unions Appear Set For More State-Level Defeats In 2017 It's a tough time especially in the Southeast, where many states have right-to-work laws that don't require workers to join labor unions or pay dues to keep a job. While overall union membership is down, there have been some gains. In the last few years, auto workers at plants in Tennessee and Alabama have organized. For Boeing employee Chris Jones, this vote has been a long time in the making. He's been working toward this week's vote for six years. "If we go to a vote, and if we lose, I'm OK with that because at least we got a say in it," he says. "It's overwhelmingly obvious that we've never had a voice." unions Boeing South Carolina Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only

Emirates Airline President Tim Clark said he is looking at buying smaller single-aisle jets, better known for tighter cabins and fewer amenities, rather than its opulent airliners with showers and walkup bars. Clark, longtime president of the world’s largest international airline, told CNN’s Richard Quest there are three different studies on his desk today. Over the next 18 months the airline will decide between adding the smaller aircraft like the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320, combining that with a deal for smaller twin-aisle jets, or continuing to only buy twin-aisle aircraft. Buying a new fleet of small single-aisle jets would be a radical departure for the Dubai-based airline. Emirates today relies solely on double-deck Airbus A380 superjumbo jets and Boeing 777s that seat from 266 all the way up to 615 passengers. It is the largest operator in the world for both. It’s been more than 20 years since the airline last flew a single-aisle jet in its fleet and Emirates’ strategy shift may set up a cut-throat competition between Boeing and Airbus, the two biggest airplane makers. Emirates uses its advantageous geography on the north side of the Arabian peninsula to reach billions of people within an eight hour flight. Its strategy is designed to connect two distant points on the planet using a single stop in Dubai, but its massive jets aren’t right for every route. The airline in the coming years is plotting a move to a sprawling new airport, Dubai World Central, from its home at Dubai Internationa. Clark said the greater number of runways and gates means it could serve smaller cities. But before a decision is made, Emirates must first weather a brewing storm in the global economy and declining per passenger profit. Falling oil prices have been a boon for travelers seeking lower fares, but “we are notorious in our business of racing to the bottom whenever there is some advantage given to us and this is no exception,” he said. “The last three of four years as the oil prices come off, we have reduced our fares to point of…stupidity in my view. That has affected our bottom line,” said Clark. “We have a difficult time in global economics. We have a difficult time in global geopolitics and there is a degree of volatility out there.” Emirates already has tens of billions of dollars of aircraft on order with both the Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in Europe, but it has slowed down its plans for buying more. The three options on Clark’s desk again delays a decision on whether or not to buy Boeing 787s or Airbus A350s. Emirates canceled an order for 70 A350s in 2014 and recently deferred a batch of superjumbo A380s to 2018 and 2019. “When the time is right we will decide,” said Clark. “But so far, we are just biding our time to see which way it all pans out.” At at a time when Middle East carriers are looking to curry favor with the Trump administration to ensure they continue to be allowed access to U.S. airports, Emirates’ decision on big airplane purchases from the U.S. or Europe could have a political tinge. U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines, have urged the State Department to review a treaty that allows the airlines of the U.S. and the home countries of fast-growing Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways unfettered access to each other’s airports. As the trio has expanded in the U.S., that has drawn claims of illegal subsidies for the foreign airlines. It’s a claim the state-supported trio denies. President Trump signaled in a meeting February 9 with airline CEOs that the administration will work to protect U.S. carriers from foreign competition, but has not specified how. Sean Spicer, White House Press Secretary, has also indicated that preserving manufacturing jobs like those at Boeing is a driving force behind the administration’s thinking.

REUTERS/Randall Hill/File Photo 10/10 By Alwyn Scott and Harriet McLeod | NEW YORK/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. NEW YORK/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. Boeing Co faces its first union vote on Wednesday at its aircraft factory in South Carolina, a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The world's largest planemaker is running a hardball campaign against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which is trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. "It would be a major, major win for the machinists if they got this," said Arthur Schwartz, an independent consultant who worked in labor relations at General Motors Co for two decades and does not represent either side. Opposition is strong in South Carolina, which is one of 28 states that does not require workers to join a union, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is the highest with 23.6 percent. The IAM canceled a voted at the Boeing plant in April 2015 after it claimed there was "political interference" from state officials and "misinformation" spread among workers. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. Boeing told Reuters in an emailed statement that in the current campaign it has hired the same lawyer who helped it defend against the IAM previously. Videos and posts on Boeing's web and social media sites portray the IAM as a "divisive" force that fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers into strikes. In one video on Boeing's site a production manager at Boeing South Carolina describes the tension and lost income from striking twice while he worked as a union machinist in Renton, Washington. "There was times where I wondered where I was going to be able to feed my kid," said the manager, Daniel Mihalic, over ominous music. "Please vote 'no' on February 15." Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent. The company said factory officials were unavailable for comment because "their time is committed to ensuring our teammates understand the voting process, the realities of union representation and the advantages of a nonunion environment." Boeing's videos are being aired on local TV stations - including during the Super Bowl - and also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, said in an interview. When the IAM filed for a vote with the National Labor Relations Board last month, Slater and others said, a display of diapers and clothing appeared in a break room. "The goods on display would cost your family $800," a sign said. "You have better things to do with your money than pay union dues." Slater said workers want higher wages and more certainty about their shifts, which change often. The IAM said hourly workers in South Carolina earn about 36 percent less than their counterparts in Washington. "We're tired of the back-and-forth, the constant inundation of the anti-union rhetoric," Slater said. "We're just ready to vote." STANDARD PLAY BOOK Boeing's campaign follows the usual "union avoidance" play book used by many manufacturers, labor experts said. That contrasts with the relationship Detroit automakers and the United Auto Workers union have forged. After years of struggle, the companies decided bad union relations were unproductive, former labor negotiators for Ford Motor Co and GM said. "Ford was the last to get organized of the Big Three, but we were the first to understand that we had a business partner in the UAW and we were going to work with them. We're not going to fight them," said Marty Mulloy, who served for nine years as Ford's vice president of labor affairs, retiring in 2013. Ford found negative campaigns did not work, he said, and would not use one today. "My experience has been working collaboratively with unions yields better results," Mulloy said. Going negative "just takes the animosity to another level. You take it from, 'I disagree with you on principle,' to 'I'm going to hire some people to try to discredit you and your institution.'" Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, which represents more than 35,000 union workers at Boeing in Washington state, said members are sending videos and posting words of support on Boeing's South Carolina Facebook page. But they have not paid much attention to Boeing's counter campaign, having seen such tactics before. "Personally, I hate seeing this in any anti-union campaign," he said. "I like people having a free choice on what they want to do, being able to ask questions and not seeing intimidation."

It took awhile for a coalition of supporters of the House GOP plan to crop up — and since then it’s taken a little bit longer to get a fuller rundown of the group’s membership. But wait no more: Morning Tax has 21 of the American Made Coalition’s current roster of around 25 members — and growing, according to coalition officials. Those 21: Blue Diamond Growers, Boeing, Caterpillar, Celanese, Celgene, Cook Medical, CoorsTek, Dow Chemical, Eli Lilly, General Electric, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, McIlhenny, Merck, Oracle, Pfizer, Qualcomm, Raytheon, S&P Global, United Technologies Corporation, Varian Medical Systems. Story Continued Below There’s definitely some capital-E exporters in that group, like GE, Boeing and Caterpillar, that would certainly benefit from the House’s border adjustment policy that would exempt exports from taxation. But there are also some lesser-known exporters, too, like Blue Diamond — think California almonds. And there’s Pfizer, which became perhaps the poster child for why the federal government needed to do more to stop corporate inversions, and which saw its merger with Allergan scuttled by the Treasury’s so-called “serial inverter” rules. Proponents of the House GOP plan say it would take away the incentive for those offshore deals. “Our coalition members represent exporters and importers, both small and large companies stretched across nearly every sector of the economy,” said John Gentzel, a spokesman for the group. WELCOME TO A NEW WEEK, and we’d like to wish a happy birthday to Toddler Tax, who turned two over the weekend, and to Brother Tax, who’s celebrating a slightly larger number than that today. On this day in 2004, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced it had found a white dwarf star that doubled as a diamond that weighs 10 billion trillion trillion carats — named Lucy, after The Beatles’ song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” What’s going on out there?

DRIVING MONDAY: The Senate is expected to confirm Steven Mnuchin, formerly of Goldman Sachs and a producer of dozens of movies, to be Treasury secretary on Monday evening. The Wall Street Journal notes that Mnuchin having to wait more than three weeks into President Donald Trump’s term for confirmation, and the expected narrow margin in the Senate, could put him behind the eight-ball a bit, with the National Economic Council’s Gary Cohn playing “an increasingly influential role.” (More on Cohn below.) A SWISS MISS: Swiss voters were having none of a proposal to revamp how the country taxes corporations on Sunday, in what our European colleague Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli called an unexpected outcome. The proposed new regime would have brought a country not exactly known for financial transparency more in line with global norms, by getting rid of a perk for multinationals that gave them incentives for making their money elsewhere and still headquartering in Switzerland. But three in five Swiss voters rejected the plan, which some on the left thought was still tilted too much toward business and would leave the country strapped for revenue. So what are the Swiss to do now? Apparently, there’s not much of a Plan B. The Wall Street Journal: “Swiss finance minister Ueli Maurer said at a press conference Sunday that Switzerland is committed to changing its corporate tax system but that there isn’t much wiggle room to revise the plan that was voted down. He said it was unlikely now that a new program will be in place by January 2019, which is when the tax overhaul was slated to go into effect.” NAVIGATING THE BAT: David Perdue, a former retail executive, has certainly been among the more strident critics among Senate Republicans of the House’s tax reform plan and especially its border adjustment framework. But like a fair number of Georgia Republicans before him, Perdue is also a big fan of the FairTax, a version of which he introduced in his first 10 days in the Senate. What’s interesting there is that the FairTax, which would junk all current federal taxes in place of a national sales tax, also uses a border adjustment. Megan Whittemore, a spokeswoman for Perdue, said the two situations weren’t really comparable, telling Morning Tax that the FairTax “would be an entirely new tax system that eliminates personal, corporate, and payroll taxes altogether. The current tax rewrite before Congress adds a new layer of tax complexity on top of the existing system as opposed to a simplification of the whole thing.” But Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation wasn’t buying that argument, saying the border adjustment served basically the same function in both plans. Perdue wrote last week that the House plan would lead to lower economic growth and higher price tags for consumers. But Pomerleau, whose group has had some nice things to say about the House plan and the border adjustment framework, told Morning Tax in an email that “the economics are the same, so most of his criticisms apply to the FairTax as well.” WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE? The Republican Study Committee, the large group of House conservatives, isn’t close to reaching a consensus on border adjustability, Bloomberg BNA’s Aaron Lorenzo reports. Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), the group’s chairman, said “it’s probably the most all-over-the-map discussion we had” at a meeting in New York last week. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) is himself an RSC member. THE DOOR REVOLVES: Rep. Tom Price’s departure from Congress to take over as Health and Human Services secretary is just the latest personnel move at the House Ways and Means Committee — at a time when the panel is seeking once-in-a-generation type goals, Pro Tax’s Brian Faler reports. There are already three GOP tax writers in the House (Sam Johnson, Lynn Jenkins and Kristi Noem) who have announced they won’t be coming back after this Congress, and more departures could be on the way. The downsides of having new members on the committee when chasing tax reform seem pretty clear, but Brian writes there are potential upsides as well — like newer members being more flexible, or having different perspectives. Also of note: The House GOP steering committee will meet Tuesday to decide Price’s replacement. Rep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.) has been among the names discussed for that opening. ABOUT THAT REPATRIATION: It’s hard to escape that Cohn is getting a lot of press these days. Bloomberg recently examined Cohn’s lead role in crafting Trump’s tax plan, which is expected in the next couple weeks. Cohn has suggested using a lower tax rate on offshore corporate profits to help pay for Trump’s infrastructure ambitions. For whatever it’s worth, Stat News noted recently that the pharmaceutical industry didn’t exactly follow through on its vow to create American jobs through the repatriation holiday enacted during the George W. Bush administration. Pharma did the opposite, actually, according to a report from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations back when former Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) was heading the panel. The findings included this tally from Pfizer: $35.5 billion repatriated, $13 billion in increased payouts to executives and almost 12,000 jobs lost over three years. RECONCILING WHAT? Stan Collender, the former longtime budget aide in the House and Senate, doesn’t see good tidings coming out of the House and Senate’s plans to use budget reconciliation to quash Obamacare and overhaul the tax code. In short, Collender writes at Forbes that Republicans are already facing a time crunch — they’ve got around three months to finish off their Affordable Care Act work, or the timeline starts to crumble. INTERNATIONAL UPDATE BAD TIDINGS AT MOSSACK FONSECA: Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca, the founding lawyers of the firm at the center of the Panama Papers, are being detained in Panama after being indicted on money-laundering charges, Reuters reports. Panama’s attorney general said that the authorities’ investigation “allegedly identifies the Panamanian firm as a criminal organization that is dedicated to hiding assets or money from suspicious origins.” STATE NEWS GETTING SERIOUS: It’s not just about the wine in Sonoma County, Calif. The Santa Rosa Press-Democrat reports that voters in the county are grappling with how to vote on a “cannabis business tax” to help ease the cost of implementing legal pot. “An approved tax, at the proposed initial rates would generate $6.3 million a year from cannabis businesses outside city limits. County officials say the funding is critical to usher the pot industry out of the legal shadows,” Guy Kovner reports.

USA TODAY NETWORK United Airlines said it's investigating after one of its pilots took to a plane’s intercom system this past Saturday with a bizarre rant that spooked passengers and touched on Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and her own divorce. The pilot boarded the plane dressed in street clothes, and her “long, bizarre speech” spooked more than a dozen passengers into leaving the aircraft, The Washington Post reports. United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart confirmed to The Associated Press the pilot wasn't in uniform when she boarded the plane Saturday. He said the carrier brought in a replacement pilot for the Austin-to-San Francisco flight, which ultimately was delayed by about two hours. Passengers on the flight shared details of the unusual incident on social media, posting commentary and even video of the pilot talking to passengers over the intercom system. Several passengers expressed concern about the woman’s mental stability.

"She started off by saying that she had not voted for either Trump or Clinton because they're a bunch of liars. ... It just really sort of went downhill from there and didn't make a lot of sense to any of us," O'Neal added. The Austin American-Statesmen cited a YouTube video of the incident – since removed – that the paper said showed some of the pilot's rant. In that video, the American-Statesman quoted the pilot as trying to reassure passengers by saying: "Don't worry, I'm going to let my co-pilot fly [the plane]. He's a man.” So, y'all.

He said the company would launch an investigation and discuss the matter with the pilot. “We hold our employees to the highest standards and have replaced this pilot with a new one to operate the flight, which has since departed from Austin,” the airline said in a formal statement. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.” TWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky Photo tour: Planespotting at San Francisco International (SFO) IN PICTURES: United Airlines launches San Francisco-Singapore nonstops FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn United Airlines launches San Francisco-Singapore nonstops  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

(AP) — Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers and union members are holding a rally in support of collective bargaining rights in the state where union membership is the lowest in the country. Boeing workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are holding a rally Monday at the Crowne Plaza Charleston Airport Hotel in North Charleston. Organizers are expected to speak, as are members of the community who support the effort. The rally is happening a mile from Boeing’s North Charleston operation, where nearly 3,000 workers vote Wednesday on whether to form a union and be represented by the Machinists. What impact will the Trump administration have on feds? Read the latest in our First 100 Days section. Boeing employs a total of about 8,000 workers in North Charleston, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner. Engineers at the 100,000-square-foot center work on everything from electromagnetics and advanced aircraft production to chemical technology. Their work is used not only for the company’s commercial airliners but in defense and aerospace applications. Advertisement The Machinists petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a vote nearly two years ago but called it off after organizers said they’d been threatened during home visits to plant employees. The union has had members in the Charleston area before, winning the right to represent workers at Vought Aircraft Industries in 2007, a plant that Boeing later bought. Less than two years later, plant workers voted against union representation. The global aviation company came to South Carolina in part because the state has a minuscule union presence. For decades, state politicians and business leaders have preached that unions hurt the workforce, not help it. South Carolina is a right to work state, meaning workers can’t be compelled to join unions, even if the organizations represent them. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state’s union membership — 1.6 percent — is the lowest in the country. Boeing has headquarters in Chicago. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Continue Reading Below The world's largest planemaker is running a hardball campaign against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which is trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. "It would be a major, major win for the machinists if they got this," said Arthur Schwartz, an independent consultant who worked in labor relations at General Motors Co for two decades and does not represent either side. Opposition is strong in South Carolina, which is one of 28 states that does not require workers to join a union, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is the highest with 23.6 percent. The IAM canceled a voted at the Boeing plant in April 2015 after it claimed there was "political interference" from state officials and "misinformation" spread among workers. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. Boeing told Reuters in an emailed statement that in the current campaign it has hired the same lawyer who helped it defend against the IAM previously.

Wall St Extends Record Run as 'Trump Trade' Reignites Auto CEOs Want Trump to Order Review of 2025 Fuel Rules Trump Says 'Big-League' Tax Reform Details Coming in Weeks Videos and posts on Boeing's web and social media sites portray the IAM as a "divisive" force that fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers into strikes. In one video on Boeing's site a production manager at Boeing South Carolina describes the tension and lost income from striking twice while he worked as a union machinist in Renton, Washington. "There was times where I wondered where I was going to be able to feed my kid," said the manager, Daniel Mihalic, over ominous music. "Please vote 'no' on February 15." Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent. The company said factory officials were unavailable for comment because "their time is committed to ensuring our teammates understand the voting process, the realities of union representation and the advantages of a nonunion environment." Boeing's videos are being aired on local TV stations - including during the Super Bowl - and also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, said in an interview. When the IAM filed for a vote with the National Labor Relations Board last month, Slater and others said, a display of diapers and clothing appeared in a break room. "The goods on display would cost your family $800," a sign said. "You have better things to do with your money than pay union dues." Slater said workers want higher wages and more certainty about their shifts, which change often. The IAM said hourly workers in South Carolina earn about 36 percent less than their counterparts in Washington. "We're tired of the back-and-forth, the constant inundation of the anti-union rhetoric," Slater said. "We're just ready to vote."   STANDARD PLAY BOOK Boeing's campaign follows the usual "union avoidance" play book used by many manufacturers, labor experts said. That contrasts with the relationship Detroit automakers and the United Auto Workers union have forged. After years of struggle, the companies decided bad union relations were unproductive, former labor negotiators for Ford Motor Co and GM said. "Ford was the last to get organized of the Big Three, but we were the first to understand that we had a business partner in the UAW and we were going to work with them. We're not going to fight them," said Marty Mulloy, who served for nine years as Ford's vice president of labor affairs, retiring in 2013. Ford found negative campaigns did not work, he said, and would not use one today. "My experience has been working collaboratively with unions yields better results," Mulloy said. Going negative "just takes the animosity to another level. You take it from, 'I disagree with you on principle,' to 'I'm going to hire some people to try to discredit you and your institution.'" Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, which represents more than 35,000 union workers at Boeing in Washington state, said members are sending videos and posting words of support on Boeing's South Carolina Facebook page. But they have not paid much attention to Boeing's counter campaign, having seen such tactics before. "Personally, I hate seeing this in any anti-union campaign," he said. "I like people having a free choice on what they want to do, being able to ask questions and not seeing intimidation."

(AP) — Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers gathered Monday to hear from union leaders why they should vote to organize in a state where union membership is the lowest in the country. Workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for an hour rallied at a hotel just a mile from Boeing's North Charleston operation where, on Wednesday, nearly 3,000 workers are set to vote on whether to form a union and be represented by the Machinists. Organizers, community leaders and members of other unions voiced messages of support to the few hundred workers gathered in a large conference room. Ned Blevins, an Orthodox priest from Knoxville, Tennessee, even told attendees they would be "doing God's work" both in standing up to company bosses and in fighting for their rights to unionize. Boeing employs a total of about 8,000 workers in North Charleston, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner. Engineers at the 100,000-square-foot center work on everything from electromagnetics and advanced aircraft production to chemical technology. Their work is used not only for the company's commercial airliners but in defense and aerospace applications. The Machinists petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a vote nearly two years ago but called it off after organizers said they'd been threatened during home visits to plant employees. The union has had members in the Charleston area before, winning the right to represent workers at Vought Aircraft Industries in 2007, a plant that Boeing later bought. Less than two years later, plant workers voted overwhelmingly against union representation. The global aviation company came to South Carolina in part because the state has a minuscule union presence. For decades, state politicians and business leaders have preached that unions hurt the workforce, not help it. During Gov. Nikki Haley's first year in office, the National Labor Relations Board went to court to block Boeing from making its Dreamliner jet at a new North Charleston factory, saying Chicago-based Boeing built the South Carolina plant in retaliation for past union strikes at the company's Washington state operations. The NLRB officially dropped its high-profile case later after the Machinists union in Washington approved a 4-year contract extension with Boeing and agreed to withdraw its charge that the company violated federal labor laws. Under the deal, Boeing promised to build the new version of its 737 airplane in Washington state. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

South Carolina is a right to work state, meaning workers can't be compelled to join unions, even if the organizations represent them. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state's union membership — 1.6 percent — is the lowest in the country. But some of Boeing's South Carolina workforce was previously represented by unions in other places. On Monday, mechanic Steve Winckles said he was a stop steward while working at an airport in New York and doesn't buy management's argument that union representation could actually mean more conflict.

South Carolina is a right to work state, meaning workers can't be compelled to join unions, even if the organizations represent them. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state's union membership - 1.6 percent - is the lowest in the country.

Home India news Showdown of America First versus Made-in-India looms at Aero India 2017 Showdown of America First versus Made-in-India looms at Aero India 2017 Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. promised to build plants in India if the world’s biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before President Donald Trump’s America First call. By: Bloomberg | Published: February 13, 2017 12:58 PM RDO-Embraer AEW&CS (Air-Borne Early Warning and Control System) aircraft on a sortie during a rehersal ahead of AERO INDIA 2017 at Yelahanka air base in Bengaluru on Sunday. PTI Photo Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. promised to build plants in India if the world’s biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before President Donald Trump’s America First call. This week will be a test for that promise as the biggest U.S. defense contractors, Russia’s MiG Corp., and Europe’s Airbus SE line up to display their wares at an air show in Bengaluru in southern India. Even as they compete for deals, they could find themselves torn between Trump’s push for companies to keep jobs in the U.S. — he has singled out a number of multinational firms on Twitter for public criticism — and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own program that seeks to tie military contracts to some of the manufacturing being done in India. “All of us in Washington are guessing where Trump is going to land on these issues,” said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. “He has certainly been very clear in his tweets and direct outreach to American companies that he wants to try to ensure that people don’t move production facilities and try to retain jobs in the U.S.” India’s Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will use the airshow to outline Modi’s plans to boost the domestic defense industry by giving contracts to local companies, as well as asking foreign manufacturers to tie up with Indian firms, according to people familiar with the plan who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Modi’s promise to shell out $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, submarines, howitzers and helmets to modernize his armed forces came with one call — Make in India. Sensing an opportunity, local conglomerates Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. have expanded more into the defense sector and formed joint ventures with international manufacturers. India, which has traditionally relied on Russia and the former Soviet Union for fighter jets, is increasingly warming to the U.S. In his first phone conversation with Parrikar, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis committed to build upon the “tremendous progress in bilateral defense cooperation made in recent years,” a Pentagon spokesman said last week. Watch this also: Modi’s domestic manufacturing program is a centerpiece of his economic policy that seeks to boost manufacturing to 25 percent of gross domestic product by 2022 from 18 percent now, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. French Deal Lockheed Martin offered to make its F-16 fighter jet in India, after India scrapped an initial tender with Paris-based Dassault Aviation SA for 126 planes. India later decided to directly buy just 36 fighter jets from the French government. That still leaves the country short of planes, meaning potential deals worth billions of dollars are on offer. Trump’s administration will want to take a fresh look at some of Lockheed’s proposals, including plans to build the F-16 in India, the company said. All previous orders from India have created jobs for Boeing in the U.S., Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said in an interview. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Boeing as well as Sweden’s Saab AB are offering to shift some production to India as they seek to win contracts. Boeing and Lockheed have also been on the receiving end of Trump’s criticism in recent times. “The politics of it looks bad, in terms of the appearance back in the U.S. — especially when he’s talking about an America First campaign,” said Anit Mukherjee, a former Indian Army major and an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with the Make in India thing — which in itself is a big question mark — then perhaps he might intervene on that.” U.S.-India defense ties have grown in recent years, in part as India’s neighbor China has increased its military clout in the region. India has also sought to diversify its sources of arms imports from a Cold War-era reliance on Russian weapons. The potential for U.S. companies to win business by manufacturing “not so state-of-the-art” equipment in India could be a trade off for Trump, said Amit Cowshish, a former financial adviser to India’s defense ministry and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Indian Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. Trump’s protectionist rhetoric so far seems to be aimed at products consumed in the U.S. and not at jobs created overseas to support a foreign market, said New Delhi-based Ankur Gupta, vice president for aerospace and defense at Ernst & Young. Still, “he’s completely unpredictable on this,” said Mukherjee from RSIS, referring to possible Trump intervention over foreign manufacturing by U.S. firms. “It has a potential to create problems. I’m sure it will be discussed between Indian and U.S. officials.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

File/Grace Beahm/Staff web only top story What you need to know about the Boeing vote in South Carolina By David Wren David Wren Feb 11, 2017 Updated Feb 13, 2017 (…) Buy Now Boeing Co. production workers in North Charleston voted Wednesday on whether they want to join the International Association of Machinists. File/Grace Beahm/Staff Hourly production workers at Boeing Co.'s 787 Dreamliner plant and other facilities in North Charleston will vote Wednesday on whether they want to be represented by the International Association of Machinists union. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions: Who conducts the election? Representatives from the National Labor Relations Board will conduct the election and count the ballots. Boeing and the IAM are allowed to observe the election as it takes place. Is voting mandatory? No. Will the union or Boeing know how someone voted? No, the election is conducted by a secret ballot. How is a winner determined? The winner must receive at least one more vote than the loser. What if a vote is challenged? Either side can challenge an employee's vote by stating the challenge to an NLRB official at the time the vote is taking place. Challenged votes are placed in an envelope and are not counted with other ballots. If the number of challenged votes would not make a difference in the outcome of the election, they are not included in the results. What would prompt a challenge? Usually an ineligible employee trying to cast a ballot. When will a winner be announced? Wednesday, after the votes have been counted. What happens if the IAM wins the election? The union will begin holding meetings and conducting surveys of workers to determine the key issues they want to address in a contract. Representatives from the IAM and Boeing will then negotiate a contract that must be ratified by a majority of union members. Contracts typically cover issues such as wages, hours and overtime, work breaks, seniority and grievance procedures. How long does that process take? Usually about six months. How long does the contract last? Typically between three and five years. Who would be covered under the contract? The contract would be specific to non-management, production workers at Boeing's North Charleston facilities. It would not cover IAM workers at other facilities. What happens in the interim between a union election and contract ratification? The status quo exists and Boeing cannot make arbitrary or wholesale changes to such things as scheduling, pay or benefits. Can union officials enter Boeing property before a contract is ratified? No, unless they are invited onto the property by Boeing. If the union wins the election, do workers have to join? No. South Carolina is a right-to-work state, which means employees cannot be forced to join a collective bargaining unit. If eligible workers don't join the union, will they still be covered by the contract that's negotiated? Yes. Reach David Wren at 843-937-5550 and follow him on Twitter @David_Wren_. More information IAM showdown at Boeing's North Charleston plant not necessarily a harbinger of S.C. union activity It's being billed as the biggest test for organized labor in South Carolina since textile mills dominated the Palmetto State's economy decades ago.

Anurag KotokyIain MarlowN. C. Bipindra Narendra Modi’s domestic manufacturing programme is a centrepiece of his economic policy that seeks to boost manufacturing to 25% of GDP by 2022 from 18% now, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. Photo: PTI New Delhi: Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. promised to build plants in India if the world’s biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before US President Donald Trump’s America First call. This week will be a test for that promise as the biggest US defence contractors, Russia’s MiG Corp., and Europe’s Airbus SE line up to display their wares at an air show in Bengaluru in southern India. Even as they compete for deals, they could find themselves torn between Trump’s push for companies to keep jobs in the US—he has singled out a number of multinational firms on Twitter for public criticism—and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own programme that seeks to tie military contracts to some of the manufacturing being done in India. “All of us in Washington are guessing where Trump is going to land on these issues,” said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. “He has certainly been very clear in his tweets and direct outreach to American companies that he wants to try to ensure that people don’t move production facilities and try to retain jobs in the U.S.” India’s defence minister Manohar Parrikar will use the airshow to outline Modi’s plans to boost the domestic defence industry by giving contracts to local companies, as well as asking foreign manufacturers to tie up with Indian firms, according to people familiar with the plan who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Modi’s promise to shell out $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, submarines, howitzers and helmets to modernize his armed forces came with one call—Make in India. Sensing an opportunity, local conglomerates Tata group, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd and Larsen & Toubro Ltd have expanded more into the defence sector and formed joint ventures with international manufacturers. India, which has traditionally relied on Russia and the former Soviet Union for fighter jets, is increasingly warming to the US. In his first phone conversation with Parrikar, defence secretary Jim Mattis committed to build upon the “tremendous progress in bilateral defense cooperation made in recent years,” a Pentagon spokesman said last week. Modi’s domestic manufacturing program is a centrepiece of his economic policy that seeks to boost manufacturing to 25% of gross domestic product by 2022 from 18% now, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. French deal Lockheed Martin offered to make its F-16 fighter jet in India, after India scrapped an initial tender with Paris-based Dassault Aviation SA for 126 planes. India later decided to directly buy just 36 fighter jets from the French government. That still leaves the country short of planes, meaning potential deals worth billions of dollars are on offer. Trump’s administration will want to take a fresh look at some of Lockheed’s proposals, including plans to build the F-16 in India, the company said. All previous orders from India have created jobs for Boeing in the US, Boeing India president Pratyush Kumar said in an interview. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Boeing as well as Sweden’s Saab AB are offering to shift some production to India as they seek to win contracts. Boeing and Lockheed have also been on the receiving end of Trump’s criticism in recent times. “The politics of it looks bad, in terms of the appearance back in the U.S.—especially when he’s talking about an America First campaign,” said Anit Mukherjee, a former Indian Army major and an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with the Make in India thing -- which in itself is a big question mark -- then perhaps he might intervene on that.” US-India defence ties have grown in recent years, in part as India’s neighbour China has increased its military clout in the region. India has also sought to diversify its sources of arms imports from a Cold War-era reliance on Russian weapons. The potential for US companies to win business by manufacturing “not so state-of-the-art” equipment in India could be a trade off for Trump, said Amit Cowshish, a former financial adviser to India’s defence ministry and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Indian Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. Trump’s protectionist rhetoric so far seems to be aimed at products consumed in the US and not at jobs created overseas to support a foreign market, said New Delhi-based Ankur Gupta, vice president for aerospace and defence at Ernst & Young. Still, “he’s completely unpredictable on this,” said Mukherjee from RSIS, referring to possible Trump intervention over foreign manufacturing by US firms. “It has a potential to create problems. I’m sure it will be discussed between Indian and US officials.” Bloomberg Anurag KotokyIain MarlowN. C.

The Executive Forum on Bermuda Captive Insurance Solutions will visit Chicago March 7 and Boston March 9, offering insurance buyers, risk managers and financial executives an opportunity to learn more about captive insurance and the benefits Bermuda offers as a blue-chip international financial centre. Captive insurance, or self-insurance, allows global corporations a cost-effective way to efficiently manage today’s complex risks, including healthcare and cyber risks, as well as enterprise risk management. “I’m delighted to have as many captive industry partners and their clients involved in helping promote our captive insurance sector,” said BDA Business Development Manager Jereme Ramsay. “We have a very busy schedule in both cities, with two main forums for company executives, along with six mini-forums for brokers, and we’re also hosting a special healthcare-related presentation and networking reception in Boston—all over a three-day period.” The forums are scheduled for 8:30–11:30am both days and will feature two sessions: the first, Captive Solutions & Strategies, explains what a captive insurer is, how to structure a captive, key reasons to set up a captive, along with common risks insured, citing several case studies. A second session focuses on regulatory, tax and legal frameworks, and includes two case studies presented by law firm Baker McKenzie and US manufacturing multinational Boeing. Participants in BDA’s Chicago and Boston captive insurance forums [top, from left]: GM’s Al Gier, Janita Burke of Estera, Richard Daley of JLT, Rick Irvine of PwC, Leslie Robinson of BMA, Tom Kelly of KPMG; [bottom, from left]: Adam Miholic of Marsh, Jamie Sewell of Boeing, Dennis Silvia of Cedar Consulting, Bob Spencer of Baker McKenzie, Nick Warren of Willis Towers Watson, and Michael Serricchio of Marsh “I’m pleased to take part in this forum to help highlight the many advantages of Bermuda as a captive domicile,” said Jamie Sewell, Chicago-based Manager for Risk Management & Insurance for Boeing. “We chose Bermuda specifically for our captive because it’s a respected, well-regulated jurisdiction and its insurance and reinsurance sectors are world-renowned.” Bermuda’s captive insurance market is the global leader, with close to 800 companies generating more than $55 billion in annual gross written premiums. The presence of commercial insurance and reinsurance companies on the island allows captive owners and operators to access open-market underwriting capacity not found in other captive domiciles, making Bermuda a one-stop-shop. Notably, captives are also increasingly popular tools for wealth preservation and succession planning for HNWIs and family offices. Ramsay said the US remains Bermuda’s greatest source of captives—generating most new formations in recent years. “With increasing competition in the captive space, especially with the rise of pop-up domiciles in the US, we feel it’s more critical than ever to promote Bermuda’s value as a top-tier jurisdiction and highlight our robust re/insurance market,” he noted. “The heightened involvement and support by industry speaks to the collaborative efforts of the BDA, our regulator and private sector to maintain Bermuda’s leading position as the domicile of choice for captive insurance business.” Industry speakers include Boeing’s Sewell; Al Gier, Global Director of Corporate Risk Management & Insurance for General Motors, who also serves as President of the Bermuda Captive Owners Association [BCOA]; Richard Daley, President of JLT Insurance Management, Bermuda; Robert Spencer, former chief financial officer for Baker McKenzie in Chicago; and Leslie Robinson, Assistant Director of Licensing & Authorisations for the Bermuda Monetary Authority [BMA]. Other participating firms include: Cedar Consulting of Bermuda, Estera Services [Bermuda], Marsh, KPMG Bermuda, Marsh, PwC Bermuda and Willis Towers Watson Management. “The forum is a great opportunity for insurance brokers and risk managers situated in Boston and Chicago to learn about the benefits of managing risk through captives in Bermuda directly from key industry panellists and captive owners,” noted speaker Janita Burke, of Estera. “Attendees will learn about Bermuda’s ability to offer diverse solutions to challenging and complex risk strategies and why Bermuda as a domicile has become the global leader in captive insurance.” There is no cost to attend the half-day sessions; registration can be done here for Chicago and here for Boston. The dedicated evening healthcare event is being held in Boston as the city is a key market for Bermuda’s captive insurance and re/insurance for the healthcare sector, serving major hospital and long-term care chains, physicians groups and research laboratories.

Wednesday’s vote comes two years after a planned vote on unionization, which was called off by the union just days beforehand. Officials from the National Labor Relations Board will conduct an election Wednesday while Boeing and IAM representatives observe. South Carolina has the lowest rate of unionization, with 1.6 percent of workers belonging to a union. North Carolina is the second lowest state, with a rate of 3.0 percent. (RELATED: Union Membership Continues To Decline) Trump is expected to visit Friday in order to congratulate his pick to serve as U.N. ambassador, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and to visit the Boeing plant in North Charleston. The Boeing unionization vote is viewed by many as the largest test for organized labor in South Carolina in decades. The Dreamliner has turned into a profitable venture for the company, after a decade of losses. Air carriers around the world are placing orders with Boeing for the wide-bodied 787. Singapore Air Lines recently purchased 39 additional planes, a contract worth $13.8 billion. During the campaign, Trump blasted Boeing for plans to build a factory in China. While the plant was intended to paint planes that were bound for Southeast Asia, Trump mentioned the company numerous times, asserting the plant would cost American jobs. The world’s largest airplane manufacturer is careful to keep a healthy relationship with Southeast Asia because of region’s expanding markets and increasing demands for wide-bodied long haul planes. “Notice: Expect VIP movement February 17, 2017 in the vicinity of Charleston, SC,” said a Federal Aviation Administration advisory released Sunday.

On Monday, Richard Safran of Buckingham Research became at least the third analyst covering the jumbo-jet maker to say the stock is more likely to fall than continue its climb. A trio doesn't sound all that notable, but the percentage of Boeing's analyst universe with the equivalent of a "sell" outlook hasn't been this large since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

STV MySTV STV Player News Competitions Scotland Glasgow & West Edinburgh & East Aberdeen & North Dundee & Tayside Stirling & Central Highlands & Islands UK International Politics Sport Features Entertainment Weather Home Entertainment Harrison Ford 'in near-miss with packed passenger jet' ITV 14 February 2017 Share via email Share via Facebook Share via Twitter Share via Whatsapp The Hollywood star reportedly nearly struck a Boeing after coming down to land in the wrong place. Ford apparently asked controllers: 'Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?' AP Harrison Ford narrowly missed striking a packed passenger jet carrying 116 people after getting confused over where he was supposed to land, according to reports. The Hollywood star, who holds a private pilot license, only just overshot the American Airlines plane after accidentally coming down on a taxiing lane instead of a runway in California, according to NBC News. He was reportedly then caught on air traffic recordings asking: "Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?" Ford's famed Star Wars character Han Solo would never be caught making such a basic error. But it was just the latest in a series of mishaps for the actor, who has repeatedly come to grief while flying his collection of vintage small planes. Officials work on the wreckage of a vintage plane crashed by Ford in 2015. AP Ford crashed a World War II era plane on a golf course in Los Angeles in 2015 after suffering engine problems. He also downed a helicopter in 1999 during a training session. However, Ford, who trained as a pilot in the 1950s, is generally considered to be an good pilot in flying circles. The passenger plane in the latest incident suffered no damage and was able to take off for Dallas as planned shortly afterwards. Ford may be left to answer a few questions though, as landing in a taxi lane breaches national regulations. An investigation into the accident has since reportedly been launched, which could hit the actor with sanctions up to the loss of his pilot's license.

Aviator is a Jeppesen and Boeing collaboration that integrates typically independent EFB features into a single point of access that reduces pilot time spent with data entry and accessing individual apps. It also shares data between EFB functions to streamline workflows, reduce pilot head-down time, eliminate human errors and enhance operational efficiency. “Jeppesen Aviator is the result of a joint development process by Jeppesen and Boeing to understand customer needs related to EFB functionality provided in a single, unified flight deck resource,” said Tim Huegel, director, Jeppesen Flight Deck Solutions. “We look forward to introducing Aviator with our airline customers worldwide to highlight the advantages of a fully integrated pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight resource and continue to refine this dynamic solution for the next generation of EFB interaction.” Aviator combines multiple Jeppesen and Boeing EFB functions in a single framework for airline and military pilots, including: · Jeppesen FliteDeck Pro: the global standard for interactive airline and military enroute and terminal charting, digital navigation and other EFB functions. · Jeppesen Content Viewer: displays essential electronic document browser material from the airline or operator directly in Aviator, instead of through its own module. · Electronic Flight Folder: provides transmission of key day-of flight data, including weather and flight plan information. · Onboard Performance Tool: allows flight crews to calculate takeoff, landing and weight & balance functions, based on current weather and runway conditions. · Software Development Kit (SDK): allows for integration of Aviator with approved applications to expand an airline’s EFB suite across fleet and operations. Aviator features multiple sources of information redundancy, to ensure operational continuity and reduce the risk of grounded aircraft. This includes the digital navigation backup solution Trip Kit on Demand, backup stored flight plans and device-to-device synching to share flight plans, flight information and trip kits, ensuring the flight crew has the same information across their mobile devices.   Aviator also reduces the impact of user training requirements, through the common interface platform and familiar functionality across all Aviator features. Please see our product Web page for more information on Jeppesen Aviator.

While aviation schools are preparing students for the job, each technician entering the field must pass the FAA’s Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) Certification before being hired. Fulcrum Labs is answering the call by helping to better prepare students success in pass rates with its newly launched FAA A&P Certification Prep Course. It is the first test prep experience of its kind in this field that combines personalized, adaptive learning and predictive analytics to help aviation maintenance technicians prepare for the high-stakes test in the most convenient, effective and efficient way possible. The launch of Fulcrum’s training course could not come at a better time. Boeing forecasts that between now and 2035, the aviation industry will need to supply more than two million new aviation personnel, including 679,000 maintenance technicians over the next 20 years. Boeing goes on to say that meeting this demand will require innovative solutions, as well as new technologies and training methods to meet a wide range of learning styles. “Creating a test prep experience that not only fits into learners’ demanding schedules, but also engages them on an individual basis and produces better outcomes is a win-win,” said Patrick Weir, CEO of Fulcrum Labs. “Our methodologies eliminate the time intensive, one-size-fits-all test prep environment. Our analytics measure the exact depth and degree to which each concept has been mastered, helping learners pinpoint where they are achieving objectives, where they are struggling, and where they need to dedicate study time and resources. It’s a model aimed at giving learners a jumpstart on their career and helping the aviation industry meet its extraordinary demand.” Fulcrum Labs is revolutionizing the aviation training industry with its Personalized Adaptive Learning and Predictive Analytics (PALPA™) SaaS platform, giving learners the opportunity to tailor their test-prep experience, which greatly increases engagement and motivation. Fulcrum’s competency-based learning approach allows learners to unlock lessons at a pace and level that is right for them. In fact, Fulcrum’s go-at-your-own-pace approach has been shown to reduce test prep times by 20-50%. Curriculum for Fulcrum’s FAA A&P Certification Prep Course was developed by instructional designers and subject matter experts from the Aviation Institute of Maintenance. Aviation Institute of Maintenance VP of Operations, Dr. Joel English pointed out, “Our institution has built online courses for over a decade, but when it came to developing an online course that prepared students for a high stakes professional certification exam, we knew that we would need to turn to a technology company that could provide a high quality platform and create cutting edge educational content.  Fulcrum Labs is the perfect fit. Their courses are founded on a unique adaptive learning platform and all instruction is amplified through strikingly beautiful execution. The results are very encouraging.” The course covers everything a technician needs to know to pass the General, Airframe and Powerplant written tests. Learners can master material in discrete five-to seven-minute lessons. The course features 97 animated videos that explain complex theories, as well as real world test problems. Learners also have access to more than 1000 practice activities to help them get acquainted and comfortable with the test environment. About Fulcrum Labs Founded in 2014, Fulcrum Labs is an enterprise grade Personalized, Adaptive Learning and Predictive Analytics (PALPA™) SaaS platform designed for organizations tired of DIY instructional tools and death by PowerPoint. Fulcrum couples proven cognitive science and adaptive learning technology with the storytelling power of award-winning animators and production veterans to bring engaging content to the learning and development sector.

Trump Olivier Douliery TNS 1 of 2 i By Jamie Self jself@thestate.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story President Donald Trump is coming to North Charleston to visit Boeing Friday. S.C. Gov. Henry McMaster, a Trump political ally, will join the president, the governor’s office confirmed. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed Trump’s trip to the Palmetto State during a press briefing Tuesday. Trump’s trip is timed to the aircraft manufacturer’s unveiling of the stretched version of its 787 airplane. “This visit will give the president an opportunity to celebrate a huge milestone for thousands of workers at Boeing, America's No. 1 exporter in the millions of American workers involved in aerospace,” Spicer said. “This trip has been months in the making, and we're thrilled to celebrate the roll-out of this amazing plane.” The visit will be the first time a sitting president has been to Boeing’s North Charleston plant. McMaster’s appearance with Trump is not surprising. The Richland Republican was the first statewide office holder in the nation to endorse the bombastic billionaire reality-television star, helping Trump to win 33 percent of the votes in South Carolina’s crucial GOP primary, taking first place. McMaster also gave a nominating speech for Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last year. He became governor last month when Trump picked former Gov. Nikki Haley to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. McMaster and his wife Peggy will be in Charleston Thursday, attending the preview of the 35th annual Southeastern Wildlife Exposition. Trump’s visit to Boeing comes a week after Trump expressed support for the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which helps Boeing sell planes overseas, according to Senate Democrats who met with the president. His trip also would follow Wednesday’s scheduled unionization vote for Boeing’s North Charleston production employees. Trump’s relationship with Boeing has been rocky. During the campaign, he predicted the airplane builder would move U.S. jobs to China. He also criticized Boeing for what he said were two excessively priced Boeing 747s that the company is building for the president to use as Air Force 1. Trump likely is stopping in Charleston before he heads to Florida for the third weekend in a row. Charleston International Airport is almost exactly half way between the White House in Washington, D.C., and Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, his new self-proclaimed winter White House.

Photos Videos Elections 2017 TECH2 FAKING NEWS हिंदी You are here: Latest News Fwire News Boeing expects 737 MAX-9 to fly in April as larger version takes shape | Reuters ReutersFeb, 15 2017 00:00:08 IST #Reuters By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Tuesday it plans to fly its new 737 MAX-9 aircraft for the first time in April, a further sign the company will start delivering the large version of the workhorse plane in 2018.Delivery of the single-aisle 737 MAX models, which replace the current 737 "NG" introduced in 1997, is crucial for Boeing to hit the financial targets it has promised investors and to offset slowing output of some of its largest jets such as the 777 and 747. Airlines want the MAX because it burns significantly less fuel than current models. The world's largest plane maker is creating up to five MAX versions, while planning to increase output to 57 planes a month in 2019, from 42 a month at present. The first MAX model in production, known as the MAX-8, is on track to reach customers by mid-year."We are anticipating our certification of the airplane within a matter of days-weeks," Keith Leverkuhn, 737 general manager, said at a Monday briefing embargoed until Tuesday. The stamp of approval by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration would come about a year after the MAX-8's first flight and allow Boeing to begin delivering the $110 million, 162-seat jetliner in the second quarter, he said. Deliveries trigger the bulk of airline payments. Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL) will be one of the first airlines to fly the plane commercially, likely ahead of launch customer Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N), which was first to order the MAX but is taking longer to put it into service. Boeing expects the MAX to account for as much as 15 percent of the 500 or more 737s it expects to deliver in 2017, rising to nearly 100 percent by 2020.Boeing on Monday showed off the first 737 MAX-9 sitting near the end of the assembly line at its factory in Renton, Washington. The nearly completed jet, which carries a list price of $116.6 million and seats 178, will undergo about nine months of testing after first flight in April. MAX-10 TAKES SHAPE Boeing is mulling an even larger version, the 737 MAX-10, to take on rival Airbus (AIR.PA), which has had strong sales of its A321neo that is a larger competitor to the MAX-9. The MAX-10 would be 66 inches (1.68 m) longer than the MAX-9, with the same engine thrust. The major change will be the landing gear, which must be taller to accommodate the longer fuselage. Boeing expects to test various landing gear designs this year "to see which one ... is going to be the best solution," Leverkuhn said.Boeing is about 90 percent finished with design drawings for the smallest version, the 737 MAX-7. A high-density MAX-200, with seating for 200 passengers, rounds out the model line.Sales of Boeing's larger twin-aisle planes have slowed sharply and the company is cutting output of the profitable 777 by 40 percent this year. It will rely on the 737 and 787 to make up a large part of the financial difference.Introducing new models while increasing production rates requires Boeing to solve any factory issues quickly. So far, Leverkuhn said, "the hours to build the MAX are meeting our expectation."

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Tuesday said it was not his concern that some companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin could find themselves torn between the slogans of "America First" of US President Donald Trump and "Make in India" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. These companies can sign military contracts by quoting from any plant existing around the globe, he told reporters after inaugurating the five-day Aero India air show at Yelahanka airbase here. "These companies are multinational in all regards. They may have a plant in Europe. They may have plant in some other parts of the world. They may have a plant in the US. They can quote from any of these areas. So, it is not my concern and I do not worry about it much because interpretations are taken wrongly. "Let things be more clear but basically my requirement is the government has to agree to it, whichever government agrees to it," he said. Parrikar said he was nowhere concerned with restrictions, if any, on the movement of the companies from US to India. "If a company head wants to shift his facility from anywhere else it is his choice whether he sets up a new one. I am nowhere concerned if there is a restriction on some movement. As far as I am concerned, as of now, there is no so such issue. No one has written to me. I am only hearing it in the media," he added. Some industry experts have raised concern that Trump's push for "America First" rhetoric could intervene when the companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with shifting of manufacturing units to India, responding to Modi's "Make In India" slogan. Parrikar said it is for the original equipment manufacturers, which provide technology and help strategic partner set up joint venture with Indian companies, to get approvals from their country. Meanwhile, Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapati Raju said the Airports Authority of India has decided to invest Rs 17,500 crore in the next five years for improving the existing airports. If the growth rate has to be sustained and taken forward, the country needs to innovate and invest, he said. "I am very happy that the Ministry of Defence has now partnered with civil aviation so that synergies of development help not only them but also our civil aviation because the sector is basically job creator," Raju said. He said the sector needs to increase connectivity within the country and hence the civil aviation ministry recently brought out the regional connectivity scheme. If the country is able to bring in 50 more active airports to the exiting 70-odd active airports, India can become the third largest civil aviation market in the world, the minister said. "Right now, we are ranked ninth. So we are working on it and trying to bring this synergy along with our defence synergy," he added.

REUTERS/Jason RedmondMore By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co <BA.N> said on Tuesday it plans to fly its new 737 MAX-9 aircraft for the first time in April, a further sign the company will start delivering the large version of the workhorse plane in 2018. Delivery of the single-aisle 737 MAX models, which replace the current 737 "NG" introduced in 1997, is crucial for Boeing to hit the financial targets it has promised investors and to offset slowing output of some of its largest jets such as the 777 and 747. Airlines want the MAX because it burns significantly less fuel than current models. The world's largest plane maker is creating up to five MAX versions, while planning to increase output to 57 planes a month in 2019, from 42 a month at present. The first MAX model in production, known as the MAX-8, is on track to reach customers by mid-year. "We are anticipating our certification of the airplane within a matter of days-weeks," Keith Leverkuhn, 737 general manager, said at a Monday briefing embargoed until Tuesday. The stamp of approval by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration would come about a year after the MAX-8's first flight and allow Boeing to begin delivering the $110 million, 162-seat jetliner in the second quarter, he said. Deliveries trigger the bulk of airline payments. Norwegian Air Shuttle <NWC.OL> will be one of the first airlines to fly the plane commercially, likely ahead of launch customer Southwest Airlines Co <LUV.N>, which was first to order the MAX but is taking longer to put it into service. Boeing expects the MAX to account for as much as 15 percent of the 500 or more 737s it expects to deliver in 2017, rising to nearly 100 percent by 2020. Boeing on Monday showed off the first 737 MAX-9 sitting near the end of the assembly line at its factory in Renton, Washington. The nearly completed jet, which carries a list price of $116.6 million and seats 178, will undergo about nine months of testing after first flight in April. MAX-10 TAKES SHAPE Boeing is mulling an even larger version, the 737 MAX-10, to take on rival Airbus <AIR.PA>, which has had strong sales of its A321neo that is a larger competitor to the MAX-9. The MAX-10 would be 66 inches (1.68 m) longer than the MAX-9, with the same engine thrust. The major change will be the landing gear, which must be taller to accommodate the longer fuselage. Boeing expects to test various landing gear designs this year "to see which one ... is going to be the best solution," Leverkuhn said. Boeing is about 90 percent finished with design drawings for the smallest version, the 737 MAX-7. A high-density MAX-200, with seating for 200 passengers, rounds out the model line. Sales of Boeing's larger twin-aisle planes have slowed sharply and the company is cutting output of the profitable 777 by 40 percent this year. It will rely on the 737 and 787 to make up a large part of the financial difference. Introducing new models while increasing production rates requires Boeing to solve any factory issues quickly.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File photo 1/2 left right FILE PHOTO - An Airbus A380 takes part in a flying display during the 48th Paris Air Show at the Le Bourget airport near Paris, June 16, 2009. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File photo 2/2 By Tim Hepher | PARIS PARIS France honored the A380 superjumbo with a place in its national aerospace museum on Tuesday, granting it equal status with the Boeing 747 even as questions pile up over the future of the industry's biggest jets. The A380 test plane, the fourth to be built and the second to actually fly in 2005, flew to Le Bourget near Paris from Toulouse with 50 technicians who will spend months adapting it for public view. It is the first time Airbus has transferred one of its test planes to a museum and a victory for curators who for years have coveted the world's largest jetliner, designed to carry up to 853 people in all-economy seating or 544 in standard layout. The plane will see out its retirement alongside a vintage 747 once flown by Air France and is expected to become a popular tourist attraction when it goes on display in 2018. But after fewer than 10 years in service, the A380's double-decker design is less successful commercially than designers hoped. Air France recently swapped its remaining order for two A380s for three smaller Airbus A350s, symbolizing the shift in demand to a new generation of lightweight jets. Airbus insists the A380 still has a future and rejects any link between the exhibit and the A380's commercial fortunes. Boeing has also put three of its 787 Dreamliners in museums. "Museums are not just about preserving the past; they are also a window on the future," said Jacques Rocca, president of the Airitage association, set up to preserve Airbus artefacts. SHOW-STOPPER In the 1990s, Airbus's vision of the future was a super-capacity airliner able to revolutionize air travel and displace the profitable 747 by linking the world's largest travel hubs. Boeing disagreed and later developed the smaller 787, though it hedged its bets by updating the 747, with disappointing results. Since 2005, the A380 superjumbo has been a show-stopper at events like the Paris Airshow, yards from the aerospace museum at Le Bourget. Airbus and Dubai's Emirates, the largest A380 operator, say its roomy cabin is a hit with passengers. Despite this, the A380 has not proved as popular with fleet planners because of the risks of being unable to fill it up in a fragile economy, as well as advances in twin-jet design. Airbus sees demand for 1,264 very large jets like the A380 and 747-8 over 20 years: higher than Boeing's forecast of 530. But it is also expected to confirm in its annual results next week that the A380 will go back into loss after its biggest customer Emirates deferred some deliveries this year. An Airbus spokesman reaffirmed the company's delivery targets.

These companies can sign military contracts by quoting from any plant existing around the globe, Parrikar told reporters after inaugurating the five-day "Aero India" air show at Yelahanka airbase here. "These companies are multinational in all regards. They may have plant in Europe. They may have plant in some other parts of the world. They may have plant in USA. They can quote from any of these areas. So it is not my concern and I don't worry about it much because interpretations are taken wrongly...", he said. "Let things be more clear, but basically my requirement is the government has to agree to it, whichever government agrees to it."He said he was nowhere concerned with restrictions, if so, on the movement of the companies from US to India. "If a company wants to shift his facility from anywhere else it is his choice whether he sets up a new one. I am nowhere concerned with it, and if there is a restriction on some movement. As far as I am concerned, as of now, there is no so such issue. No one has written to me. I am only hearing it in the media," he added. Some industry experts have raised concerns that Trump's push for "America First" rhetoric could perhaps intervene when the companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with shifting of manufacturing units to India, responding to Modi's "Make In India' slogan. "As far as I am concerned, as of now, there is no such issue. No one has written to me, I only hear it in the media," he said. Parrikar said it is for the OEMs, who provide technology and help strategic partner to set up joint venture with Indian companies, to get approvals from their country. Union Civil Aviation Minister Pusapati Ashok Gajapati Raju said the Airports Authority of India has decided to invest Rs 17,500 crore in the next five years for improving the existing airports. If the growth rate has to be sustained and taken forward, the country needs to innovate and invest, he added. I am very happy actually that the Ministry of Defence has partnered now with civil aviation, so that the synergies of development will help, not only them, but also our civil aviation because civil aviation is basically job creator", he said. Raju also said the civil aviation also needs to increase the connectivity within the country, and hence the civil aviation ministry has recently brought out the regional connectivity scheme. If the country is able to bring in 50 more active airports to the exiting 70-odd active airports, India can become the third largest civil aviation market in the world. "Right now, we are ranked ninth. So we are working on it and trying to bring this synergy along with our defence synergy," he added.

The order includes flexibility for the SIA Group to substitute the 787-10 orders for other variants of the 787 family.   The General Electric GE9X is the sole engine type for the 777-9s, which are intended primarily for use on longhaul routes.

(AP) — Community leaders say it’s time for Boeing employees to have union representation to protect their wages and well-being. Rep. David Mack told several hundred people gathered at a rally Monday in North Charleston that unionizing workers at the plant in his district would be good for South Carolina’s economy. Mack says people will spend more money if they have more take-home wages in their pockets. Nearly 3,000 South Carolina Boeing employees vote Wednesday on whether or not to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Monday’s rally took place about a mile from the Chicago-based company’s facilities. The global aviation company came to South Carolina in part because the state has a minuscule union presence and state politicians and business leaders have for decades preached that unions hurt the workforce, not help it.

By: PTI | Bengaluru | Published:February 14, 2017 10:23 pm Union Minister Manohar Parrikar. (File Photo) Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said it was not his concern that some companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin could find themselves torn between the slogans of “America First” of US President Donald Trump and “Make in India” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. These companies can sign military contracts by quoting from any plant existing around the globe, he told reporters after inaugurating the five-day Aero India air show at Yelahanka airbase here. Watch What Else Is Making News “These companies are multinational in all regards. They may have a plant in Europe. They may have plant in some other parts of the world. They may have a plant in the US. They can quote from any of these areas. So, it is not my concern and I do not worry about it much because interpretations are taken wrongly. “Let things be more clear but basically my requirement is the government has to agree to it, whichever government agrees to it,” he said. Parrikar said he was nowhere concerned with restrictions, if any, on the movement of the companies from US to India. “If a company head wants to shift his facility from anywhere else it is his choice whether he sets up a new one. I am nowhere concerned if there is a restriction on some movement. As far as I am concerned, as of now, there is no so such issue. No one has written to me. I am only hearing it in the media,” he added. Some industry experts have raised concern that Trump’s push for “America First” rhetoric could intervene when the companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with shifting of manufacturing units to India, responding to Modi’s “Make In India” slogan. Parrikar said it is for the original equipment manufacturers, which provide technology and help strategic partner set up joint venture with Indian companies, to get approvals from their country. Meanwhile, Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapati Raju said the Airports Authority of India has decided to invest Rs 17,500 crore in the next five years for improving the existing airports. If the growth rate has to be sustained and taken forward, the country needs to innovate and invest, he said. “I am very happy that the Ministry of Defence has now partnered with civil aviation so that synergies of development help not only them but also our civil aviation because the sector is basically job creator,” Raju said. He said the sector needs to increase connectivity within the country and hence the civil aviation ministry recently brought out the regional connectivity scheme. If the country is able to bring in 50 more active airports to the exiting 70-odd active airports, India can become the third largest civil aviation market in the world, the minister said. “Right now, we are ranked ninth. So we are working on it and trying to bring this synergy along with our defence synergy,” he added.

Parrikar, in his inaugural address, invited aerospace firms to make their products in India, which had opened up the defence sector for foreign direct investment, partnerships, collaborations and joint ventures. "We have an ecosystem for defence manufacturing, with ease of doing business for global firms, a liberalised investment policy and norms to set up production units, joint ventures and research facilities across the country," he said as he inaugurated the 11th edition of the five-day biennial expo here. Asked if new US President Donald Trump's 'America First' may have any affect on the 'Make in India' and stop US firms from participating in the programme, Parrikar said it was not his concern. "You should have put this question to Boeing, they are there at the exhibition... Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc. "What I will say is what I want... I want you to Make in India. If someone wants to shift production to some other place, it is his choice. I am not concerned," Parrikar said at a press conference on the sidelines of "Aero India 2017". This edition of Aero India, for the first time, combined the defence and civil aviation segments into a holistic event with the co-involvement of the Defence and Civil Aviation Ministries in the event. Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajpathi Raju was also present at the inaugural event. Raju, speaking at the occasion, highlighted that India was the fastest growing aviation sector in passenger terms in the world and held tremendous potential to graduate from the present position of being ninth in the world to being the third largest by 2022. Among the highlights on the opening day was handing over of the Indigenous Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&C) christened 'Netra' to the Indian Air Force, making India the fourth nation to have developed the technology on its own, after US, Russia and Israel. Parrikar also unveiled the full scale mock-up of Indian Multi-Role Helicopter (IMRH) at Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) Pavilion. A colourful flypast showcased India's increasing capability in manufacturing aircraft, with first ever public display of Light Utility Helicopter LUH. The Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) meanwhile left the spectators enthralled, with its manoeuvres, taking a steep rise, and even flying backwards. India is one of the few countries to have developed a combat helicopter. The air Show witnessed a fly past by the Make in India formation consisting of HTT-40, Hawk-i, Dornier-228, Su-30MKI and the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft. This was followed by the fighters tearing through the skies displaying a host of aerobatic manoeuvres - the Su 30 MKIA followed by Sweden's SAAB Gripen, Tejas LCA, the American F-16 Falcon and the French Rafale.

The A380 test plane, the fourth to be built and the second to actually fly in 2005, flew to Le Bourget near Paris from Toulouse with 50 technicians who will spend months adapting it for public view. It is the first time Airbus has transferred one of its test planes to a museum and a victory for curators who for years have coveted the world's largest jetliner, designed to carry up to 853 people in all-economy seating or 544 in standard layout. A380 Airbus performs acrobatic stunts!! @ Farnborough Airshow 2014 The plane will see out its retirement alongside a vintage 747 once flown by Air France and is expected to become a popular tourist attraction when it goes on display in 2018. But after fewer than 10 years in service, the A380's double-decker design is less successful commercially than designers hoped. Air France recently swapped its remaining order for two A380s for three smaller Airbus A350s, symbolising the shift in demand to a new generation of lightweight jets. Airbus insists the A380 still has a future and rejects any link between the exhibit and the A380's commercial fortunes. Boeing has also put three of its 787 Dreamliners in museums. "Museums are not just about preserving the past; they are also a window on the future," said Jacques Rocca, president of the Airitage association, set up to preserve Airbus artefacts. SHOW-STOPPER In the 1990s, Airbus' vision of the future was a super-capacity airliner able to revolutionise air travel and displace the profitable 747 by linking the world's largest travel hubs. Boeing disagreed and later developed the smaller 787, though it hedged its bets by updating the 747, with disappointing results. Since 2005, the A380 superjumbo has been a show-stopper at events like the Paris Airshow, yards from the aerospace museum at Le Bourget. Airbus and Dubai's Emirates, the largest A380 operator, say its roomy cabin is a hit with passengers. Despite this, the A380 has not proved as popular with fleet planners because of the risks of being unable to fill it up in a fragile economy, as well as advances in twin-jet design. Airbus sees demand for 1,264 very large jets like the A380 and 747-8 over 20 years: higher than Boeing's forecast of 530. But it is also expected to confirm in its annual results next week that the A380 will go back into loss after its biggest customer Emirates deferred some deliveries this year. An Airbus spokesman reaffirmed the company's delivery targets.

After Trump had twitter-shamed Carrier and Boeing into making public concessions—one on jobs, the other on the price of Air Force One—automakers Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and Hyundai, technology companies Amazon, Sprint, and Softbank, pharmaceutical multinational Bayer, and retail giant Walmart all quickly announced plans to hire or invest in the United States. Many immediately got a tweet-on-the-back: “Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!” Trump tweeted in January. At the time, on these pages, I wondered out loud how many more companies will give Trump a honeymoon on jobs? ADVERTISEMENT It’s clear the honeymoon is over (if ever there was one). One of the most remarkable developments of this already remarkable period has been how quickly the CEOs of major U.S. companies have turned on Trump. The proximate cause was Trump’s executive order banning all refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States.   In response, Lyft donated $1 million to the ACLU, Airbnb offered free housing to refugees left in limbo, Starbucks defiantly pledged to hire 10,000 refugees, and 97 technology companies including Apple, eBay, Facebook, and Google filed an amicus brief against the executive order. Just a few weeks earlier, the CEOs of many of these same technology companies had joined then-President-elect Trump’s technology summit at Trump Tower. What has happened—and this is the underlying cause of many CEOs’ about-face—is the realization that business is political, that it cannot go into hiding, and that companies must increasingly take sides. In a thought-provoking article published last Friday, Andrew Sullivan writes that “[o]ne of the great achievements of free society in a stable democracy is that many people, for much of the time, need not think about politics at all.” Similarly, many American CEOs, especially the entrepreneurs powering Silicon Valley, have long felt they could choose to be apolitical, to avoid taking sides on contentious issues. “[B]ecause we live under the rule of law,” Sullivan continues, “we can afford to turn the news off at times.” If CEOs have quickly learned that they cannot turn off the news, that not thinking about politics is not an option, then the credit largely goes to business’ two most important stakeholders: its customers and its employees. Uber’s travel ban debacle powerfully illustrates the point. For CEO Travis Kalanick and his company, it seemed to make political sense to join Trump’s business advisory council. After all, the incoming administration might get to write the rules for autonomous cars on which Uber has so much riding. It may have also made business sense for Uber to drop surge pricing and try to get market share when the New York Taxi Workers Alliance announced its drivers would stop driving to John F. Kennedy Airport in solidarity with anti-Trump protesters there. But the strategy dramatically backfired when #DeleteUber began trending on Twitter. Nobody knows how many customers deleted the app or how much brand damage this unforced error inflicted, but we know the effects on Uber’s strategy: Kalanick resigned from Trump’s council, sought to reassure his employees that the company stood with its many immigrant drivers and progressive urban customers, and pledged financial and legal support for any Uber driver affected by the ban. And of course, Uber joined the amicus brief. Uber’s u-turn fueled already growing efforts to mobilize customers against companies that progressives see as political or business associates of Trump and his family. Nordstrom was the next big win for the “resistance movement” when the company announced plans to drop Ivanka Trump’s fashion line from its stores and website. The company maintains that sales of the younger Trump’s products had fallen dramatically during the campaign and that it had communicated the decision to Ivanka more than a month ago. But it is hard to explain Nordstrom’s public stance in recent days without the efforts of #grabyourwallet and similar platforms channeling progressive resistance to Trump into consumer boycotts. Even Tesla, long the darling of urban progressives, has seen customers take to Twitter to publicly announce they are canceling their orders because of Elon Musk’s membership in the same business council that Travis Kalanick was forced off of by the #DeleteUber backlash. You don’t need a crystal ball to predict that boycotts of Trump-affiliated businesses will continue. After all, they are working. Shannon Coulter, co-founder of #grabyourwallet tweeted on Feb. 10 that more than half of the 15 companies that have so far been dropped from the boycott list (for “complying” with Trump opponents’ demands) have done so in the past 10 days. As importantly, at least some boycotts are clearly getting under Trump’s skin: his Twitter blasting of Nordstrom not only sent shock waves through government ethics watchdogs, it also let the company’s share price soar. What does all of this mean? It means that companies have multiple stakeholders. Trump and the federal government more generally are a clear one. Indeed, for many companies, the administration is a very important stakeholder. But it is far from the only one. Equally important, and for many companies in fact more important, are their customers and employees. As much as even Silicon Valley CEOs might want to play nice with Trump at least for the time being—lower taxes, less regulation, and more infrastructure spending is a winning formula in most boardrooms—policies such as the immigration ban that are direct attacks on the diverse workplaces many of these CEOs have carefully nurtured, and the growing resistance to all things Trump among particularly affluent urban customers, are forcing more and more companies to take sides. As CEOs find themselves increasingly between a rock and a hard place, between Trump on the one hand side and other key stakeholders on the other, the days when business could choose not to think about politics—when turning off the news was seen as an option—are clearly over.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 February 2017 by Military News Triform Partners with Leading Aerospace Supplier An India-based aerospace supplier was looking to expand their capacity to meet the increasing demands of their customers which include Boeing and Airbus. They approached Beckwood with an interest in the Triform line of sheet hydroforming and stretch forming equipment to fulfill several newly awarded contracts. Beckwood is the only OEM in the world able to provide such a diverse mix of forming technologies, making them the ideal single-source supplier of precision forming equipment. To meet the customer’s requirements, Beckwood supplied a Triform tray-style fluid cell sheet hydroforming press and an extrusion stretch forming machine. Throughout the sales and engineering processes, Triform collaborated with the manufacturer to develop the ideal machinery based on their part requirements. With a 24″ x 96″ forming area and a dual shuttle system to maximize efficiency, the Triform model 2496-5BD is ideal for the low volume, high mix production requirements in the aerospace industry. During the fluid cell forming process, blank sheet material is placed over a single, unmated tool which sits on the working surface. A pressurized rubber diaphragm extends over the tool and blank, exerting equal pressure on every square inch of the part’s surface. The even application of pressure offers net shape part production while minimizing wrinkles, improving part definition, and reducing hand finishing. The 2496-5BD’s tray-style working surface not only allows the manufacturer to form large parts utilizing a single tool, but also enables them to form multiple small parts in a single cycle, increasing output. Also included in the package was a 28-ton extrusion stretch form machine. Capable of forming parts up to 120″ long, the machine boasts recipe handling capabilities and a bar code scanner for easy set-up and repeatable forming results. During the stretch forming process, metal sheets or extrusions are stretched to exceed their inherent elastic limit and formed around contoured dies to create the desired shape. This “stretching” results in stronger finished parts with better shape control, surface quality, and yield strength than rolled or drawn parts. Standard on every Triform press are several proprietary uptime-focused technologies designed to shift maintenance efforts from reactive to proactive. Using closed-loop monitoring, the on-board Pre-Preventive Maintenance system (PPM) measures component and system performance in real time and relays critical maintenance data via on-screen notifications and email. To facilitate fast, complimentary troubleshooting and remote support, a PressLink connect module was included on both machines. PressLink allows Triform technicians to access a machine’s programming structure in order to identify and resolve issues without the need for an on-site visit. “Triform is proud to support the rapidly growing aerospace market in India,” said Beckwood President, Jeffrey Debus. “Our precision machinery and unrivaled service and support capabilities keep us on the leading edge of technology and offer our customers a competitive advantage in the marketplace.” About Beckwood Press Company Beckwood Press Company is a leading hydraulic press manufacturer, located in St. Louis, MO USA. They offer quality, custom hydraulic presses for virtually every industry and application, including a line of temperature controlled presses for compression molding, composite forming and high-temperature Hot Forming / SPF applications. Beckwood also manufactures the Triform line of Sheet Hydroforming Presses in both Fluid Cell and Deep Draw configurations, hydraulic ring expanders / sizers, hot joggle presses, as well as a line of stretch forming machines for both extrusion, sheet / leading edge applications.

Photos Videos Topics Live AFG 63/1 (16) - ZIM (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Rahul Gandhi Sasikala Assembly Elections 2017 UP Elections 2017 Raees Home Money Not worried if cos are torn between "America First, "Make in Shares1 Tue, 14 Feb 2017-08:16pm , PTI Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar today said it was not his worry or concern that some companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin could find themselves torn between the slogans of "America First" of US President Donald Trump and "Make in India" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. These companies can sign military contracts by quoting from any plant existing around the globe, Parrikar told reporters after inaugurating the five-day "Aero India" air show at Yelahanka airbase here. "These companies are multinational in all regards. They may have plant in Europe. They may have plant in some other parts of the world. They may have plant in USA. They can quote from any of these areas. So it is not my concern and I don't worry about it much because interpretations are taken wrongly...", he said. "Let things be more clear, but basically my requirement is the government has to agree to it, whichever government agrees to it." He said he was nowhere concerned with restrictions, if so, on the movement of the companies from US to India. "If a company wants to shift his facility from anywhere else it is his choice whether he sets up a new one. I am nowhere concerned with it, and if there is a restriction on some movement. As far as I am concerned, as of now, there is no so such issue. No one has written to me. I am only hearing it in the media," he added. Some industry experts have raised concerns that Trump's push for "America First" rhetoric could perhaps intervene when the companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with shifting of manufacturing units to India, responding to Modi's "Make In India' slogan. "As far as I am concerned, as of now, there is no such issue. No one has written to me, I only hear it in the media," he said. Parrikar said it is for the OEMs, who provide technology and help strategic partner to set up joint venture with Indian companies, to get approvals from their country. Union Civil Aviation Minister Pusapati Ashok Gajapati Raju said the Airports Authority of India has decided to invest Rs 17,500 crore in the next five years for improving the existing airports. If the growth rate has to be sustained and taken forward, the country needs to innovate and invest, he added. I am very happy actually that the Ministry of Defence has partnered now with civil aviation, so that the synergies of development will help, not only them, but also our civil aviation because civil aviation is basically job creator", he said. Raju also said the civil aviation also needs to increase the connectivity within the country, and hence the civil aviation ministry has recently brought out the regional connectivity scheme. If the country is able to bring in 50 more active airports to the exiting 70-odd active airports, India can become the third largest civil aviation market in the world. "Right now, we are ranked ninth. So we are working on it and trying to bring this synergy along with our defence synergy," he added.

IANS Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Parrikar not concerned with 'America First' call Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar on Tuesday said the "America First" call of US President Donald Trump is not a concern for India or the Make in India programme. Asked if Trump's America First would come in the way of Make in India and stop US firms from participating in the programme, Parrikar said: "You should have put this question to Boeing, they are there at the exhibition... Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc." "What I will say is what I want... I want you to Make in India. If someone wants to shift production to some other place, it is his choice. I am not concerned," Parrikar said at a press conference on the sidelines of "Aero India 2017". He also said that he has so far just heard of it, and there is no official communication from the US government. "As far as we are concerned, there is so far no issue, there is no letter. I am only hearing about it," he said. Explaining it further, the minister said: "An OEM (original equipment manufacturer) helping a strategic partner will need their government's approval. If they are proposing something, their government will give them in-principle approval, so that they can quote." Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said that Boeing is already manufacturing beams in Nagpur, and the HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd) is making doors for Airbus.

Leader of the Popular Front for Change and Liberation and representative of the Syrian Opposition’s Moscow group, Qadri Jamil, rejected the proposal of the Supreme Committee for Negotiations to create a united delegation for the Geneva talks. "We had no consultations regarding the issue with anyone, and we will never accept (a situation) that implies more representatives of the ‘Riyadh group’ than of any other formations since experience has shown that the former often halt the talks," he told Izvestia. Related news Intra-Syrian talks in Geneva scheduled for February 23 — UN Russian diplomat urges UN to speed up intra-Syrian talks in Geneva Kremlin believes success of Syria talks in Astana will help to resume Geneva process UN envoy for Syria sending out invitations to intra-Syrian talks Russia expects close anti-terror cooperation with US in Syria As reported earlier, representatives of the High Negotiations Committee offered a 24-member delegation for the talks in Geneva scheduled for February 20. The head of the Hmeymim group delegation to the Geneva talks, Ilian Masaad, told the newspaper an attempt is being made "to put other opposition formations on the back burner." "It is necessary for each group to be represented in the delegation by one or two people," he said, adding that he thinks Staffan de Mistura should set up the delegation and coordinate the issue with global and regional players. Boris Dolgov, senior research fellow at the Center for Arabic and Islamic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, remains skeptical, saying that even if the delegation is ready, it is unlikely to spur progress in the negotiations. "De Mistura can do this, but in the current situation the political process is unlikely to proceed due to a great deal of controversy," he said.   Kommersant: Donbass blockade backfires as Ukraine descends into rolling blackouts For the first time in two years, Ukraine is facing rolling blackouts due to the blockade of coal supplies from Donetsk, which is causing deficiencies in fuel supplies for thermal power stations. Still Kiev has no plans to buy gas or electricity from Russia, and can only step up coal imports, which heightens rotating outage risks, but still hopes the blockade will be lifted soon, Kommersant writes. Read also Moscow urges Kiev to prevent commercial blockade of Donbass Russia still remains Ukraine’s biggest coal supplier, with last year’s exports coming to $906 mln, which is more than 55.5% of the total amount of Ukraine’s coal imports. According to head of Infoline-Analytics Mikhail Burmistrov, Russia’s coal supplies to Ukraine via rail transportation surged 36.2% to 954,400 tonnes in January 2017. Meanwhile, as of February 11, the country’s underground gas storage facilities had 9.04 bln cubic meters left, with daily withdrawal standing at 85-90 mln cubic meters. A source in Ukraine’s Energy Ministry told Kommersant that the high withdrawal is related to the cold spell, but Kiev still wants to avoid gas purchases from Gazprom during this heating season. The source added that the ministry expects the blockage of coal supplies from Donbass to be lifted soon, and has not yet considered the option of restricting gas supplies to the industry, though "it is possible in theory." Kommersant’s source in Gazprom and the Russian Energy Ministry said there has been no progress in gas talks with Ukraine so far.   Kommersant: Rogozin calls off visit to Iran Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin has cancelled his visit to Tehran where he intended to meet the country’s top officials, Kommersant writes citing sources. The plan was to discuss potential bilateral cooperation, primarily in the aviation sector. The issue of purchases of Russia-made passenger jets by Iran was on the agenda. However, sources say the reason for the visit’s cancellation was that the Iranian side leaked information about the visit, while Moscow wanted to keep a lid on it. Read also Russia to promote Sukhoi Superjet-100 aircraft on Iranian market According to a source in the Russian government, both parties planned to discuss "sensitive issues" beyond the meeting of the committee on science and technologies headed by Rogozin. Particularly, "a complex conversation was in the offing about the reasons behind the Iranian partners’ plans to purchase aircraft from western countries," the source said, adding that Moscow "is providing huge support to Tehran, while they’re buying equipment from the ones who humiliate them with sanctions." In early December 2016, Iran Air signed a contract with Boeing to get 80 jets. The agreement stipulates the delivery of 50 Boeing-737s and 30 Boeing-777s to the country over the next 10 years. There is also a contract with Airbus, stipulating the supply of 100 planes to Iran. That being said, the total cost of those two contracts is close to $30 bln, Kommersant writes. On the other hand, aircraft deals with Moscow are much more modest: in 2016, Russia and Iran signed an unbinding document on the supplies of the regional Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft. Russian experts estimate the Iranian market at around 100 jets of this type, though the prospect of signing a firm contract depends not only on talks between the companies, but on the US Department of the Treasury, since SSJ-100 have US-made components, the newspaper adds.   Izvestia: Envoy says Kuril Islands issue requires ‘patience as a virtue’ Moscow has a huge interest in pursuing mutually beneficial and friendly relations "with a country that is the third-biggest economy in the world, famous for its scientific and technological breakthroughs and lays claim to expanding its political role in global affairs," Russian Ambassador to Japan, Yevgeny Afanasyev, said in an interview with Izvestia. According to the diplomat, the relationship between the two neighbors has intensified over the recent year and a half "following the period of a certain slowdown due to Japan’s decision to join in the anti-Russia sanctions initiated by several western countries." However, last year four top-level meetings took place, not to mention regular meetings by the countries’ foreign ministers, heads of other ministries and departments, he added. Related news Japan issues protest to Russia over giving names to 5 islands of Kurile chain Kremlin denies media rumors Kurils to be handed over to Tokyo for temporary use Council for joint economic operations on Southern Kuril Islands set up in Japan Abe says Russia’s military presence on Kuril Islands does not hamper peace treaty talks Tokyo wants Moscow to allow former Kuril Islands residents to fly there by plane Consultations behind closed doors on a peace treaty between Russia and Japan, and cooperation on the South Kuril Islands are presently underway. "This is a required measure for experts from both countries to work hard and calmly to find ways out of delicate issues," Afanasyev said. "For my part, I would recommend not delving into speculations, or getting carried away with pipe dreams, but to strengthen one's patience," he told Izvestia. When asked whether the parties obtained what they wanted during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Japan in end-2016, the ambassador said: "Yes and no." "I mean the sides managed to reach what was possible, but on the whole the results of the visit may be described as breakthrough as they triggered the development of bilateral relations and created the background for bringing them to a game-changing level," he said. "Meanwhile, regarding the economic arena there is still a number of negative trends, including a drop in trade turnover, mainly due to falling energy prices. In order to cope with those problems, the agreements reached by the leaders need to be implemented, and we are ready to do this," Afanasyev stated.   Rossiyskaya Gazeta: Russia moves toward technological independence in agriculture With agriculture becoming a promising business and even a flagship of the Russian national economy over the past 15 years, the country has demonstrated its ability to tackle the issues of food safety and has seriously boosted export potential. However, its purchases of foreign agriculture technology still exceeds $1.8 bln per year. Elena Skrynnik, Russia’s ex-Minister of Agriculture (2009 - 2012) and now head of the International Independent Institute for Agricultural Policy, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta that the dependence on foreign technologies is still open for Russia, despite large-scale import substitution and export expansion. Read also Russia’s PM sets goal of boosting exports of agricultural products to $19 bln According to Skrynnik, systematic state aid and efficient management in the sector, as well as searching for new growth spurts, such as new market channels and technological independence, are crucial factors for maintaining and increasing growth rates in local agriculture." Also, she said, an aggressive external policy on acquiring shares and even whole companies that are the agro-technical leaders in the global market, will speed up the formation of a national technological base in this area. When asked about global examples of efficiently using technologies, Skrynnik mentioned "Japanese centers of excellence and a Brazilian corporation in agricultural research." "They’ve successfully accumulated human and investment resources for carrying out research in cutting-edge areas and spurred the transfer of brand new technologies to the real sector," she explained.   TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in the press reviews {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Top News February 16, 12:13 Foreign customers eye Russian robots after Syria operation — state arms exporter February 16, 12:13 February 16, 11:08 Assad says West has no right to choose Syria’s future February 16, 11:08 February 16, 11:45 Russia and India sign $2 bln defense contracts in 2016 February 16, 11:45 February 16, 11:53 Afghan government seeks launch of talks with Taliban — Russian diplomat February 16, 11:53 In other media Реклама Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Afghan government seeks launch of talks with Taliban — Russian diplomat 2 Foreign customers eye Russian robots after Syria operation — state arms exporter 3 Attempts to build dialogue with Russia from position of strength fruitless — minister 4 Russia and India sign $2 bln defense contracts in 2016 5 UN reports ‘heavy losses’ among Kiev troops, militia in Avdeyevka 6 Russian deputy PM says Moscow, Minsk agreed body text of report on oil, gas issue 7 Minister says economic activity in Russia starting to recover 1 Russian Senate speaker points to intense preparations for meeting between Putin and Trump 2 Flynn reveals details of conversation with Russian ambassador 3 Diplomat on US statements about Crimea: Russia does not give its land away 4 Ukraine declares emergency situation on electricity market due to coal shortage 5 Russia to take part in tender for 400 fighter jets for India 6 First MiG-35 fighter jets to be delivered to Russia’s Defense Ministry 7 Russian lawmaker calls US statements on Crimea alarming 1 Flynn reveals details of conversation with Russian ambassador 2 Russian issue one of most difficult for Trump team — expert 3 Russian Senate speaker points to intense preparations for meeting between Putin and Trump 4 Ships of Russian Baltic Fleet to make voyage to Antarctica this year 5 Flynn resigned due to loss of trust — White House 6 UK scrambles Typhoon fighter jets to escort Russian bombers 7 Flynn’s resignation not to affect Russian-US relations on broad level, lawmaker says TOP STORIES CONFLICT IN SYRIA RUSSIA'S DEFENSE INDUSTRY OIL& GAS INDUSTRY SPACE PROGRAMS Реклама News Russian Politics & Diplomacy World Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

C. BIPINDRA BLOOMBERG NEWS This article was published February 14, 2017 at 1:53 a.m. PHOTO BY BLOOMBERG NEWS / DHIRAJ SINGH A model of an SC-130J Sea Hercules aircraft, made by Lockheed Martin Corp., is displayed during the Aero India air show in Bengaluru, India, in this file photo. Comments aAFont Size Boeing and Lockheed Martin promised to build plants in India if the world's biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before President Donald Trump's "America First" call. This week will be a test for that promise as the biggest U.S. defense contractors, Russia's MiG Corp. and Europe's Airbus, line up to display their wares at an air show in Bengaluru in southern India. Even as they compete for deals, they could find themselves torn between Trump's push for companies to keep jobs in the U.S. -- he has singled out a number of multinational firms on Twitter for public criticism -- and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's own program that seeks to tie military contracts to some of the manufacturing being done in India. "All of us in Washington are guessing where Trump is going to land on these issues," said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "He has certainly been very clear in his tweets and direct outreach to American companies that he wants to try to ensure that people don't move production facilities and try to retain jobs in the U.S." India's Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar will use the air show to outline Modi's plans to strengthen the domestic defense industry by giving contracts to local companies as well as asking foreign manufacturers to tie up with Indian firms, according to people familiar with the plan who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Modi promised government spending of $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, submarines, howitzers and helmets to modernize his armed forces. Sensing an opportunity, conglomerates Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. have expanded more into the defense sector and formed joint ventures with international manufacturers. India, which has traditionally relied on Russia and the former Soviet Union for fighter jets, is increasingly warming to the U.S. In his first phone conversation with Parrikar, Defense Secretary James Mattis committed to build upon the "tremendous progress in bilateral defense cooperation made in recent years," a Pentagon spokesman said last week. Modi's domestic manufacturing program is a centerpiece of his economic policy that seeks to increase manufacturing to 25 percent of gross domestic product by 2022 from the current 18 percent, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. Lockheed Martin offered to make its F-16 fighter jet in India, after India scrapped an initial tender with Paris-based Dassault Aviation for 126 planes. India later decided to directly buy just 36 fighter jets from the French government. That still leaves the country short of planes, meaning potential deals worth billions of dollars are on offer. The Trump administration will want to take a fresh look at some of Lockheed's proposals, including plans to build the F-16 in India, the company said. All previous orders from India have created jobs for Boeing in the U.S., Boeing India's President Pratyush Kumar said in an interview. The Chicago-based manufacturer sees no conflict between Trump's "America First" and Modi's "Make in India" calls, Kumar said separately Monday in Bengaluru, adding that the company is looking to sell F/A-18 jets made in the country. Making fighter jets in India is viable with an order of 100 aircraft, he said. Boeing is looking forward to Indian Navy's interest in buying 57 combat planes that can operate from aircraft carriers, he said. About a third of the nation's 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Boeing as well as Sweden's Saab are offering to shift some production to India as they seek to win contracts. Boeing and Lockheed have also been on the receiving end of Trump's criticism in recent times. "The politics of it looks bad, in terms of the appearance back in the U.S. -- especially when he's talking about an 'America First' campaign," said Anit Mukherjee, a former Indian Army major and an assistant professor at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. "If companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with the 'Make in India' thing -- which in itself is a big question mark -- then perhaps he might intervene on that." U.S.-India defense ties have grown in recent years, in part as India's neighbor China has increased its military clout in the region. India has also sought to diversify its sources of arms imports from a Cold War-era reliance on Russian weapons.

SIA signed a letter of intent with the US airframe manufacturer comprising the 39 firm orders plus six options for each aircraft type, which if exercised will enlarge the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The 777-9s are due for delivery from the 2021/22 financial year and the 787-10s for delivery from the 2020/21 financial year. The proposed order, which is valued at US$13.8 billion based on published list prices, includes flexibility for the SIA Group to substitute the 787-10 orders for other variants of the 787 family. “This major order for widebody aircraft enables us to continue operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet, providing the SIA Group with additional expansion opportunities to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position,” said SIA CEO, Mr Goh Choon Phong. “We are continuing to invest for the future of the SIA Group. This order is also another demonstration of our commitment to further growing the Singapore hub, as we will be able to offer even more travel options for our customers.” The General Electric GE9X is the sole engine type for the 777-9s, which are intended primarily for use on long-haul routes. SIA has selected the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 to power the 787-10s, which are to be operated on medium-range routes. This is the SIA Group’s first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development, the 777-9. SIA is already the launch customer for the 787-10, which is also currently in development, having placed an initial order in 2013 for 30 aircraft for delivery from the 2018/19 financial year. In addition to the 30 previously-ordered 787-10s, SIA has outstanding orders with Airbus for five A380-800s and 57 A350-900s. SilkAir has outstanding orders with Boeing for 37 737 MAX 8s, while Scoot has orders with Boeing for eight 787-8/9s and Tigerair has orders with Airbus for 39 A320neos. "Singapore Airlines has been a valued Boeing customer for more than 50 years and we are honored they have selected the 777X and additional 787-10s to expand its future widebody fleet. They are the most efficient, capable and passenger preferred airplanes in their class," said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President & CEO Kevin McAllister. "We appreciate the trust, commitment and endorsement of Singapore Airlines, and look forward to delivering market-leading capability to one of the world's most widely respected industry leaders."

With the Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) technology, Apache can control the sensory payloads of of Gray Eagle and Army shadow drones.  Boeing was awarded the $24 million contract for expanding the helicopter’s MUM-T capabilities, set to become a part of all Apache configurations. © AP Photo/ Ahn Young-joon South Korea Finalizes Deployment of 36 Newest Apache Helicopters Crews are able to pursue and engage speedy targets from long distances using the drones’ sensors and the attack helicopter’s powerful weaponry. Last year Apache Program Manager Col. Jeff Hager told Scout Warrior in an interview, "Now before the unit even deploys out of the Forward Arming Refueling Point, or FARP, they can actually bring up the UAS (drone) feed, look through the sensors and see the target they are going to attack up to 50 or 60 miles away," adding that the sensors also enable crews to make en-route adjustments if necessary. Hager continued, "They have full situational awareness on that target as they fly inbound and do not lose any data on that target on the way…They don’t go into a situation where they are surprised." The Army established the first MUM-T squadron in March 2015, with the 1/501st Aviation Battalion of the 1st Armoured Division’s Combat Aviation Brigade based in Fort Bliss, Texas renamed as the 3rd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment. This development signaled the debut of a tactical common datalink with the RQ-7B Shadow made by Textron Systems that accompany the Apaches, helping to bolster the service’s scout capabilities.  © Flickr/ Gonzalo Alonso Pentagon Awards Boeing Contract to Boost Apache Combat Copter Capabilities Lt Col RJ Garcia said at the time, "It's an improved capability that supports soldiers on the ground as they execute the various missions that we assign them…Nothing is stove-piped now. We now have the ability to share across multiple levels." Currently pilots flying Apaches in Afghanistan are using an upgraded AH-64E-model which utilizes advanced avionics and communications technology, a hardier 7016 engine and composite rotor blades, giving the helicopter expanded performance and speed. The AH-64E model has the ability to move large amounts of fuel and ammunition in what’s called "high-hot" conditions, withstanding temperatures 95 degrees or higher and altitudes of 6,000 feet. It can also reach speeds of 164 knots, 20 knots faster than the “D” model that preceded it. By 2025 the Army 690 AH-64Es, which according to officials can also carry 1,200 30mm chain gun rounds, 16 Hellfire missiles and 70 2.75mm rockets. ...

Tarun Shukla Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defence, Space and Security. Bengaluru: US aircraft maker Boeing Co. last week launched Boeing Defence India, a local unit aimed to support the company’s growth in the country. Pratyush Kumar, president of Boeing India, will lead the new unit. This is the fourth such global unit for Boeing, after Australia, the UK and Saudi Arabia. In an interview, Leanne Caret, president and chief executive officer of Boeing Defence, Space and Security says the new unit will expand the firm’s footprint in India with a long-term bet on the country. Boeing also does not rule out inorganic growth in India by acquiring firms that may give it technical advantage. Edited excerpts: What is the reason for establishing this new India unit? The establishment of Boeing Defence India is really the next step in our evolution here. We clearly have had a strong partnership (for ) over 75 years, starting in the commercial spectrum and over the last 20 years, we have continued to have more and more defence products and most recently, we have had some really great partnerships with P-8s, Chinook Apache and C-17. But as we look to the future, there is such an incredible talent base here in India and there is real opportunity to use it as a core part of our ecosystem. Boeing Defence India is literally a localized operating company that would report into me; that has responsibilities for defence products and services that we provide through our full spectrum in Boeing Defence and this allows us to take advantage of our global reach but do it in a way we can leverage local talent with a goal to have greater than 95% of our staff to be local hires and then, have key components from engineering all the way through manufacturing, fabrication, final assembly test, all the way up to the life cycle support. Pratt (Pratyush Kumar) will have the operating authority that he needs to really run the business. It’s going to put us on a growth path to continue not only to grow our business but, more importantly, continuing to have those enduring relationships with customers here so that we meet their needs. What was the trigger to establish this? The real reason any company is successful is that you have enduring customer relationships and you really do leverage the power of the enterprise but you also bring it together and you put forward solutions that are aligned to customers’ need and what you tend to find over time is that sometimes, a tendency to do everything from the US and when you have countries such as India which have strong national interest, who clearly have enduring relationships with the US, that its just (an) opportunity to make it more local. And so, about a year and a half ago, we started thinking about what this would look like and how we could go make it happen. Boeing Defence Australia was our first, then we migrated with Boeing Defence UK and then we started Saudi Arabia and now Boeing Defence India. Can you give an example of what this will change when you already have an office and employees in India ? Today, in many cases, you could view this as a facilitator role, the way we have been operating. So, Pratt has had responsibility in terms of all of our customers in the country, he has been the lead on helping us bring in folks from the US helping sell products and services, clearly, addressing customer needs and having reach back. What we are doing is, we are giving him a local team who will now start taking on those responsibilities themselves. They will still have the reach back to the States if needed but they are going to start becoming self-sufficient and more autonomous and with that comes operating responsibility. So, just like any of my other business, they own the customer satisfaction and the performance and as we move forward, for instance, with Make in India— this is a huge initiative that the nation has—we believe that Boeing has a great opportunity to bring an indigenous ecosystem that’s going to allow us to design, build and field aircraft such as fighters in the future and that activity will all report into Pratt. Currently, your sourcing stands at about $500 million from India, which is almost what Airbus does. How will this grow? Our goal is to continue on this trajectory in a way which brings productivity to Boeing (and) at the same time, creates requisite manufacturing base in the country—so, it kind of plays into Make in India; so, it’s a win-win for both. With that, you will continue evolution in terms of engineering presence, manufacturing presence, the deepening of our supply chain. What more can we see in manufacturing and how will India move up in that value chain? My vision is that you will see full-up final assembly at some point here, depending on what the nation wants to do in terms of product and service that they want to buy. You are already seeing us build Apache fuselages and those aren’t just for Indian Air Force, that’s for our Apache products that are going around the globe. So, you are going to continue to see an expansion and evolution of that. What kind of business are you looking from India? You had offered the F-18s. (There is an) RFI (request for information) right now from the Navy, we will be responding with what we believe is the appropriate configuration and we will let government work through the (process) and as and when RFP (request for proposal) gets released, we will respond appropriately that time. Our vision for the future is extremely bold but it is entirely doable. How do you see India US-defence ties under the Trump administration? I am very optimistic. Already in the weeks since our President has been elected, he has come and restated the enduring partnership between India and the United States. I am very positive, this is good for India and it’s a great partnership with the US. Over a 5-10 year time frame, how would you envision Boeing in India? Do you plan to acquire any firms here to grow? I won’t put specific targets; my expectation is, by putting t his framework in place and having local presence and having folks here, we will have that local decision making, not only are we going to grow our engineering and manufacturing capacity, but if there is an opportunity where we can enter markets and acquire technical advantages, we will continue to assess that, but that is part of running the business.

Tarun Shukla A file photo of the Aero Show in Bengaluru. This year’s edition is expected to be the largest in recent times. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint New Delhi: The 11th edition of the Aero India air show which starts in Bengaluru on Tuesday is expected to be one of the largest in recent years, with a focus on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India initiative. Around 270 Indian and 279 foreign firms are slated to participate in the event where some major companies, including Airbus and Boeing Co, are expected to sign deals under the Make in India banner. “It is expected that two lakh business visitors will attend the show. The gross area (of the show) has also increased from 2,50,000 sq. m to 2,60,000 sq. m,” the ministry of defence said in a statement. Defence minister Manohar Parrikar is likely to inaugurate the Bengaluru air show. Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint While Modi had inaugurated the previous Bengaluru air show in 2015, defence minister Manohar Parrikar is likely to open it this year as the event coincides with election activity in several states. The highlight of the show at the city’s Yelahanka Air Force Station will be fighter jets that make up a large part of the 72 aircraft being showcased. Among these will be Rafale fighter jets made by French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation SA. India bought 36 of these aircraft for an estimated $8.9 billion last year in a deal that has been negotiated several times over the years. Dassault Aviation said three fighter jets will participate—one single-seat Rafale C and two of the two-seat Rafale B. Rafale planes have been used by the French armed forces in combat operations for more than a decade. They entered service with the French Navy in 2004 and the Air Force in 2006. Some of the 152 planes delivered so far have been used in combat in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria. Dassault’s Rafale fighter jet. Photo: Reuters India had started hunting for multi-role fighter jets in 2007 but later decided to scrap that tender, instead announcing that it would buy Rafale jets from France under a government-to-government deal agreed during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Paris in 2015. The combat aircraft—delivery of which is expected to begin in September 2019 and be completed by April, 2022—come equipped with state-of-the-art missiles such as Meteor and Scalp, according to the defence ministry. With the air-to-air Meteor missiles, the Indian Air Force will be able to hit targets as distant as 150km, compared with the 80km it was so far capable of targeting. Scalp, an air-to-ground cruise missile with a range in excess of 300km, will also give IAF an edge over adversaries. We are not ruling out India acquisitions: Boeing’s Leanne Caret “Demonstrating Rafale’s capabilities in Aero India reaffirms our total commitment to India’s sovereignty. We have had a long standing relationship with Indian Air Force and industry and, thanks to the unmatched capabilities of the Rafale and to our full involvement in the innovative approach of the “Make in India” initiative, we are entirely dedicated to partner India in meeting its strategic defence and economic needs,” Eric Trappier, chairman and chief executive of Dassault Aviation said in a statement. The Russian Sukhoi 30MKI, Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), Advanced Jet Trainers (AJT) Hawks are also likely to be present at the show. The F-16 fighter jet of Lockheed Martin. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint But all eyes will be on American F-16s and Swedish Saab fighter jet Gripen E and its naval variant Gripen Maritime. Both companies are vying to bag the next multi-billion order from India under the so-called strategic partnership model according to which the manufacturer will be asked to set up an assembly line in India. Airbus said it will showcase its H130 chopper ambulance on static display. “The future of Indian aerospace and defence industry rests on the realization of the ‘Make in India’ vision. I look forward to having conversations around the topic at Aero India,” said Pierre de Bausset, president and managing director at Airbus India. Tata Motors’s Vernon Noronha on the firm’s defence manufacturing strategy “We have partnered with Tata and Mahindra and are working with a host of other companies to script ‘Make in India’ success stories,” he added. The firm said it procures about $500 million (about Rs3,400 crore) worth of products from India annually from around 45 suppliers, generating local employment for more than 6,000 people. The Tata Group said all its key firms will participate in the event, including Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Advanced Materials Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Titan Co. Ltd, Tata Steel (Specialty Steel business in Europe), TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd and Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division. The case for a single, merged air show The five-day show will have exhibitors from the US, France, UK, Russia, Israel, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Ukraine, Singapore, Sweden, Spain, South Africa, Italy, the UAE, South Korea, Hong Kong, the Czech Republic, Canada, Australia, Poland and Greece. Indian Air Force’s Sarang Team,the Surya Kiran Team, the Scandinavian Air Show Team from Sweden and the Evolvkos Aerobatic Team from the UK will perform aerobatics at the show. Aero India, which began in 1996, has become one of the largest air shows in Asia. This show is followed by one in Abu Dhabi and most international players move on to showcase their military ware there over the weekend.

BA stock has increased over 30% in just 5 months, a run that has significantly outpaced other defense stocks over that period. While there has been some good news of late — including higher expectations for overall growth since the election — there also have been several developments that have raised questions about the future of Boeing stock. Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr Competition is tough and it’s getting tougher. Orders have slowed, with output of the 777 being cut ahead of the release of the 777x. Earnings growth has been impressive, but beyond 2017, that growth may get more difficult for BA stock. Boeing stock hardly is expensive, to be sure. BA trades at 18x the midpoint of 2017 earnings guidance — and closer to 13x the company’s anticipated free cash flow. Meanwhile, Boeing continues to outpace rival Airbus Group SE (OTCMKTS:EADSY) in orders and deliveries. But more competition is coming, and external and political pressures could rattle Boeing stock over the next few quarters. Why Boeing Stock Could Hit Some Turbulence The biggest near-term question for BA stock is whether it has simply flown too far, too fast. Boeing shares have more than quadrupled over the last eight years. Over that period, BA has outperformed other major defense stocks, including Airbus, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN). The run includes 17% gains since the election, better performance than all peers but General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD). To be sure, Boeing has performed well since the financial crisis: 2010 Core (i.e., non-GAAP) earnings-per-share was $4.45; the midpoint of 2017 guidance is for $9.20 per share. At that level, BA would more than double EPS in seven years — an average growth rate of 11%. The problem is that BA should be growing earnings in an improving global economy. While the company is considered a defense stock as well, only ~30% of sales come from its Defense, Space & Security segment. Two-thirds of revenue come from commercial airplanes. And in that business, there’s reason to expect a slowdown in growth as soon as the second half of this year. 2016 orders were at the company’s lowest level since 2010. “Book to bill” — the ratio of orders to shipments — hasn’t been this low since 2004. In the near-term, there’s a possibility that the sentiment could reverse toward Boeing stock simply due to valuation and growth stocks. And there are some catalysts on the horizon that could bring those concerns to the forefront. Longer-Term Questions for BA Stock Boeing already has seen first-hand the potential for politics having an impact on defense stocks. A simple Tweet from then-President-elect Trump in December that criticized the cost of the Boeing-made Air Force One led BA stock down over a percentage point. A month later, another Tweet criticizing Lockheed’s F-35 — and raising the possibility of a replacement with Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet — sent LMT stock down, and Boeing stock up.

(IW 500/9) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (IW 500/25) promised to build plants in India if the world’s biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before President Donald Trump’s America First call. This week will be a test for that promise as the biggest U.S. defense contractors, Russia’s MiG Corp., and Europe’s Airbus SE line up to display their wares at an air show in Bengaluru in southern India. Even as they compete for deals, they could find themselves torn between Trump’s push for companies to keep jobs in the U.S. -- he has singled out a number of multinational firms on Twitter for public criticism -- and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own program that seeks to tie military contracts to some of the manufacturing being done in India. Popular Now Leaders Must Have 'Strategic Intelligence' Is Quality a Result or a System? Why It's Not Too Late to Build Your Own Industrial Internet Platform "All of us in Washington are guessing where Trump is going to land on these issues," said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "He has certainly been very clear in his tweets and direct outreach to American companies that he wants to try to ensure that people don’t move production facilities and try to retain jobs in the U.S." India’s Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar will use the airshow to outline Modi’s plans to boost the domestic defense industry by giving contracts to local companies, as well as asking foreign manufacturers to tie up with Indian firms, according to people familiar with the plan who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. "America First"and "Made in India" head for a showdown at air show https://t.co/ty9bvwufF8 pic.twitter.com/3pth4xQFL1 — Bloomberg (@business) February 13, 2017 Modi’s promise to shell out $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, submarines, howitzers and helmets to modernize his armed forces came with one call -- Make in India. Sensing an opportunity, local conglomerates Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. have expanded more into the defense sector and formed joint ventures with international manufacturers. India, which has traditionally relied on Russia and the former Soviet Union for fighter jets, is increasingly warming to the U.S. In his first phone conversation with Parrikar, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis committed to build upon the “tremendous progress in bilateral defense cooperation made in recent years,” a Pentagon spokesman said last week. Modi’s domestic manufacturing program is a centerpiece of his economic policy that seeks to boost manufacturing to 25% of gross domestic product by 2022 from 18% now, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. Lockheed Martin offered to make its F-16 fighter jet in India, after India scrapped an initial tender with Paris-based Dassault Aviation SA for 126 planes. India later decided to directly buy just 36 fighter jets from the French government. That still leaves the country short of planes, meaning potential deals worth billions of dollars are on offer. Trump’s administration will want to take a fresh look at some of Lockheed’s proposals, including plans to build the F-16 in India, the company said. All previous orders from India have created jobs for Boeing in the U.S., Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said in an interview. The Chicago-based manufacturer sees no conflict between Trump’s ‘America First’ and Modi’s ‘Make in India’ calls, Kumar said separately on Monday in Bengaluru, adding the company is looking to sell locally made F/A-18 jets in the country. Making fighter jets in India is viable with an order of 100 aircraft, he said. Boeing is looking forward to Indian Navy’s interest in buying 57 combat planes that can operate from aircraft carriers, he added. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Boeing as well as Sweden’s Saab AB are offering to shift some production to India as they seek to win contracts. Boeing and Lockheed have also been on the receiving end of Trump’s criticism in recent times. "The politics of it looks bad, in terms of the appearance back in the U.S. -- especially when he’s talking about an America First campaign," said Anit Mukherjee, a former Indian Army major and an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. "If companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with the Make in India thing -- which in itself is a big question mark -- then perhaps he might intervene on that." U.S.-India defense ties have grown in recent years, in part as India’s neighbor China has increased its military clout in the region. India has also sought to diversify its sources of arms imports from a Cold War-era reliance on Russian weapons. Saab CEO Hakan Buskhe said Monday that he sees a possible order for more than 100 Gripen fighters from India. The potential for U.S. companies to win business by manufacturing "not so state-of-the-art" equipment in India could be a trade off for Trump, said Amit Cowshish, a former financial adviser to India’s defense ministry and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Indian Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. Trump’s protectionist rhetoric so far seems to be aimed at products consumed in the U.S. and not at jobs created overseas to support a foreign market, said New Delhi-based Ankur Gupta, vice president for aerospace and defense at Ernst & Young. Still, "he’s completely unpredictable on this," said Mukherjee from RSIS, referring to possible Trump intervention over foreign manufacturing by U.S. firms. "It has a potential to create problems. I’m sure it will be discussed between Indian and U.S. officials." By Anurag Kotoky, Iain Marlow and N. C. Bipindra Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:30 PM, February 13, 2017 Updated: 8:10 AM, February 14, 2017 NEW YORK/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. - Boeing Co faces its first union vote on Wednesday at its aircraft factory in South Carolina, a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The world's largest planemaker is running a hardball campaign against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which is trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. "It would be a major, major win for the machinists if they got this," said Arthur Schwartz, an independent consultant who worked in labor relations at General Motors Co for two decades and does not represent either side. Opposition is strong in South Carolina, which is one of 28 states that does not require workers to join a union, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is the highest with 23.6 percent. The IAM canceled a voted at the Boeing plant in April 2015 after it claimed there was "political interference" from state officials and "misinformation" spread among workers. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. Boeing told Reuters in an emailed statement that in the current campaign it has hired the same lawyer who helped it defend against the IAM previously. Videos and posts on Boeing's web and social media sites portray the IAM as a "divisive" force that fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers into strikes. In one video on Boeing's site a production manager at Boeing South Carolina describes the tension and lost income from striking twice while he worked as a union machinist in Renton, Washington. "There was times where I wondered where I was going to be able to feed my kid," said the manager, Daniel Mihalic, over ominous music. "Please vote 'no' on February 15." Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent. The company said factory officials were unavailable for comment because "their time is committed to ensuring our teammates understand the voting process, the realities of union representation and the advantages of a nonunion environment." Boeing's videos are being aired on local TV stations - including during the Super Bowl - and also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, said in an interview. When the IAM filed for a vote with the National Labor Relations Board last month, Slater and others said, a display of diapers and clothing appeared in a break room. "The goods on display would cost your family $800," a sign said. "You have better things to do with your money than pay union dues." Slater said workers want higher wages and more certainty about their shifts, which change often. The IAM said hourly workers in South Carolina earn about 36 percent less than their counterparts in Washington. "We're tired of the back-and-forth, the constant inundation of the anti-union rhetoric," Slater said. "We're just ready to vote." STANDARD PLAY BOOK Boeing's campaign follows the usual "union avoidance" play book used by many manufacturers, labor experts said. That contrasts with the relationship Detroit automakers and the United Auto Workers union have forged. After years of struggle, the companies decided bad union relations were unproductive, former labor negotiators for Ford Motor Co and GM said. "Ford was the last to get organized of the Big Three, but we were the first to understand that we had a business partner in the UAW and we were going to work with them. We're not going to fight them," said Marty Mulloy, who served for nine years as Ford's vice president of labor affairs, retiring in 2013. Ford found negative campaigns did not work, he said, and would not use one today. "My experience has been working collaboratively with unions yields better results," Mulloy said. Going negative "just takes the animosity to another level. You take it from, 'I disagree with you on principle,' to 'I'm going to hire some people to try to discredit you and your institution.'" Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, which represents more than 35,000 union workers at Boeing in Washington state, said members are sending videos and posting words of support on Boeing's South Carolina Facebook page. But they have not paid much attention to Boeing's counter campaign, having seen such tactics before. "Personally, I hate seeing this in any anti-union campaign," he said. "I like people having a free choice on what they want to do, being able to ask questions and not seeing intimidation."

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here By Anurag Kotoky, Iain Marlow and N. C. Bipindra Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. promised to build plants in India if the world’s biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before President Donald Trump’s America First call. This week will be a test for that promise as the biggest US defense contractors, Russia’s MiG Corp., and Europe’s Airbus SE line up to display their wares at an air show in Bengaluru in southern India. Even as they compete for deals, they could find themselves torn between Trump’s push for companies to keep jobs in the US -- he has singled out a number of multinational firms on Twitter for public criticism -- and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own program that seeks to tie military contracts to some of the manufacturing being done in India. "All of us in Washington are guessing where Trump is going to land on these issues," said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "He has certainly been very clear in his tweets and direct outreach to American companies that he wants to try to ensure that people don’t move production facilities and try to retain jobs in the U.S." India’s Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will use the airshow to outline Modi’s plans to boost the domestic defense industry by giving contracts to local companies, as well as asking foreign manufacturers to tie up with Indian firms, according to people familiar with the plan who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Modi’s promise to shell out $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, submarines, howitzers and helmets to modernize his armed forces came with one call -- Make in India. Sensing an opportunity, local conglomerates Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. have expanded more into the defense sector and formed joint ventures with international manufacturers. India, which has traditionally relied on Russia and the former Soviet Union for fighter jets, is increasingly warming to the US. In his first phone conversation with Parrikar, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis committed to build upon the "tremendous progress in bilateral defense cooperation made in recent years," a Pentagon spokesman said last week. Modi’s domestic manufacturing program is a centerpiece of his economic policy that seeks to boost manufacturing to 25 percent of gross domestic product by 2022 from 18 percent now, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. French Deal Lockheed Martin offered to make its F-16 fighter jet in India, after India scrapped an initial tender with Paris-based Dassault Aviation SA for 126 planes. India later decided to directly buy just 36 fighter jets from the French government. That still leaves the country short of planes, meaning potential deals worth billions of dollars are on offer. Trump’s administration will want to take a fresh look at some of Lockheed’s proposals, including plans to build the F-16 in India, the company said. All previous orders from India have created jobs for Boeing in the US, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said in an interview. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Boeing as well as Sweden’s Saab AB are offering to shift some production to India as they seek to win contracts. Boeing and Lockheed have also been on the receiving end of Trump’s criticism in recent times. "The politics of it looks bad, in terms of the appearance back in the U.S. -- especially when he’s talking about an America First campaign," said Anit Mukherjee, a former Indian Army major and an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. "If companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with the Make in India thing -- which in itself is a big question mark -- then perhaps he might intervene on that." U.S.-India defense ties have grown in recent years, in part as India’s neighbor China has increased its military clout in the region. India has also sought to diversify its sources of arms imports from a Cold War-era reliance on Russian weapons. The potential for U.S. companies to win business by manufacturing "not so state-of-the-art" equipment in India could be a trade off for Trump, said Amit Cowshish, a former financial adviser to India’s defense ministry and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Indian Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. Trump’s protectionist rhetoric so far seems to be aimed at products consumed in the U.S. and not at jobs created overseas to support a foreign market, said New Delhi-based Ankur Gupta, vice president for aerospace and defense at Ernst & Young. Still, "he’s completely unpredictable on this," said Mukherjee from RSIS, referring to possible Trump intervention over foreign manufacturing by U.S. firms. "It has a potential to create problems. I’m sure it will be discussed between Indian and U.S. officials." Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now! FROM AROUND THE WEB Want to post your ad?

The government said it has earmarked about N5.8billion for the runway project. This was as an estimated N1.1billion is being spent to fix the Kaduna Airport slated to serve as an alternate airport for all Abuja-bound flights during the six weeks the Abuja airport would be shut. The decision to divert flights to Kaduna airline has however not gone down well with foreign airlines operating into the Abuja airport. Three of the airlines, Lufthansa, British Airways, and South African Airways have all expressed their decision not to fly into the Kaduna airport, citing logistics and safety concerns as reasons. And there are indications that in the weeks ahead many more foreign airlines may pull out of the arrangement. But some observers believes the development present  great opportunity to three local airlines operating schedule flights into Kaduna airport, namely Arik Air, Aero Contractors, and Azman Air. The closure of the Abuja runway no doubt has serious safety, security and cost implications and local and international passengers will have to face the great inconvenience of travelling by road from Kaduna to Abuja amidst several security uncertainties. Airlines, service providers, employees and the national economy will all be negatively impacted by the closure. It is estimated that about N2billion would be lost for the six weeks the Abuja airport would be shut. But industry analysts say the exit of the foreign airlines from the route opens an opportunity for local airlines to boost their revenue or income, if only they know what to do. How did we get here? The Abuja Runway was originally meant to last for 20 years. However, on the balance of probability of the fact that it was underutilised judging from the number of landings on  it, its utilisation was further stretched by an additional 14 years leading to the current deplorable condition and the attendant grave safety implications as evidenced by several near fatal incidents that have occurred as a result of the bad condition of the runway. President of the Aviation Round Table (ART), Mr. Gabriel Olowo, said the rot in infrastructure at Abuja airport could only have happened due to the fact that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), which is responsible for conducting safety oversight of the sector, was docile and failed completely in ensuring that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) religiously complies with the Runway Maintenance Programme for NAIA, which is an operational safety requirement. “The failure of FAAN to strictly follow the Runway Maintenance Programme and conduct regular repairs and rehabilitation as at when due coupled with the lethargic oversight of NCAA have effectively contributed to the situation where it is today,” he said. About Kaduna airport The Kaduna airport is located 22 kilometers northwest of the city of Kaduna. Its 3,000meters and 9,843 fet runway is made from asphalt.  Kaduna Airport no doubt has recorded two major accidents. But the two accidents recorded in 1995 and 2010 were related to flaws on the airport runway, even though the Federal Government had since fixed the runway to be able to cope with local and international flight. The first accident involved a Nigeria Airways Flight 357. On November 13 1995, the Boeing 737-2F9 Nigerian Airways flight, during its second leg of the flight from Jos to Kaduna, over ran the runway at Kaduna Airport, leading to a fire incident that destroyed the aircraft. All 14 crewmembers survived, while 11 of the 124 passengers died. Similarly, on August 20, 2010, Chanchangi Airlines Flight 334, operated by Boeing 737-200 5N-BIF struck the localizer antenna and landed short of the runway. Several passengers were slightly injured and the aircraft was substantially damaged. Chanchangi Airlines thereafter suspended its operations into Kaduna airport following the accident. But things are said to have improved in the recent past and the Kaduna airport runway and other infrastructure have witnessed an upgrade that can allow it serve as alternate to Abuja airport. What some stakeholders say The decision to shut down the Abuja airport and divert flights to Kaduna has indeed divided key stakeholders in the industry, especially Nigerians along lines of those in support of and those against the decision. For instance, Managing director of Centurion Securities, Group Capt. John Ojikutu (Retd) faults the use of Kaduna Airport and suggested the Minna Airport would have been better. Said Ojikutu, “Must we divert Abuja traffic to Kaduna? Why can’t the Minna Airport serve the purpose for the local flights? After all it is closer to Abuja than Kaduna. The runway (Minna) will still accommodate aircraft whose takeoff and landing runs are within 1000 to 2000 metres.” Ojikutu said that the choice of Kaduna for air traffic diversion was one that was bound to  scare most of the foreign airlines away. “While the domestic airlines may find Kaduna airport convenient, the current security threats in that state may not make the airport attractive to the foreign airlines particularly those from the EU and US. “For them to want to use Kaduna for foreign airlines, I have my doubts that the airlines will go there for security reasons,” he said. Also speaking, the chairman, governing board of the Nigerian Aviation Safety Initiative (NASI), Capt. Dung Pam, said Kaduna Airport does not have the capacity to cope with the anticipated traffic. “It is going to be a serious dislocation of the nexus of our air travel system. Every major airport in the country connects to Abuja and Lagos. So, to have that place completely shut down for six weeks will be a huge blow to the travelling public,” he said. Opportunity for local airlines But what analysts agreed to, is that the closure provides an opportunity for local airlines operators to take advantage of the situation by increasing their flights into Kaduna from Lagos and other major cities around the country and making more revenue. Until recently, there were 14 international airlines operating about 70 weekly flights to Abuja. With the withdrawal of Emirates, Delta and Kenya Airways from the route, the weekly flights by the remaining airlines will now be about 55 flights weekly. President of ART, Mr. Gabriel Olowo, said assuming that each inbound and outbound flight has 100 passengers, conservatively there would be 5,500 passengers inbound and 5, 500 as outbound or 11,000 passengers to and from Abuja via Kaduna weekly or about 1600 inbound, and outbound passengers daily. He explained that conservatively, these would require about 20 flights from our domestic airlines if they would be encouraged and reasonably develop capacity to take advantage of this opportunity which the closure of Abuja is likely to create for them. Moreover, the closure will give local helicopter operators an opportunity to operate commuter services between Abuja and Kaduna. Local airlines can also sign code-sharing agreements with foreign airlines, which could allow them airlift passengers drooped at the Lagos airport on behalf of the foreign airlines. Already, Arik Air has announced it has such a partnership with Emirates. It behooves on the other airlines like Aero, Dana, Azman, Medview, First Nation and Air Peace to reach out to the foreign airlines that fly into the Abuja route to sign similar deals with them. Future plans  FAAN should ensure that it develops a Runway Maintenance Programme (RMP) approved by NCAA if none is currently available. NCAA on the other hand must through regular oversight, ensure FAAN’s compliance with approved Runway Maintenance Programme. Furthermore, the Runway Maintenance Programme must be factored on periodic number of landings rather than on the age of the runway. Finally, Periodic Runway Maintenance Programme would make repairs  and maintenance possible if the Runway Maintenance Programme is regularly implemented. Furthermore, government needs to ensure that movement and facilitation of passengers between Abuja and Kaduna is clear and unambiguous in the interest of safety and security. The protection of airline officials and their assets should equally be a top priority. Moreover, the huge funds currently being committed into other sectors all in the name of using Kaduna Airport as an alternative could have been saved and better utilized in the aviation sector if only those responsible for maintaining the runway had been more proactive from the outset. A), and Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) to the tune of over N47billion. But for 2017, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), says airlines would be subjected to more stringent and periodic financial audit. The trend marks a huge departure from previous regulatory functions of the NCAA which was focused predominately on the safety operations of the airlines, their crew and the airports. “We will increase our safety oversight to sustain zero accident in the aviation sector. We are reviewing and strengthening economic regulations and airline operational books are to be sighted with increased regularity and appropriate sanctions will be applied,” said Director General of the NCCA, Captain. Muhtar Usman in a release made available to Daily Sun. The new policy makes it mandatory for airlines to allow the NCAA inspect their financial books to ascertain that airlines were run in line with best practices as it concerns accountability. “We will move to ensure airlines’ compliance with Nigerian civil aviation regulations, all outstanding debts must be paid, while passenger comfort will remain paramount to us,” he added. Usman said at present, the NCAA was engaged in robust regulation,proficient safety oversight, increased surveillance on all certificate holders in the industry, daily ramp inspection, and spot check inspection on maintenance facilities all geared at zero accident rates in the industry. Dana Air, Meridiana partner on Italy-Nigeria route Meridiana Fly, Italy’s fastest growing airline, is partnering Dana Air and Dre Aviation of Ghana to launch flight operations from Italy into Ghana and Nigeria. Speaking to newsmen in Lagos, Dre Aviation’s Mr. Paul Bassam Saade, said, “a prudent approach was taken by Meridiana when entering these highly competitive markets, but we have demonstrated stable operations and a growing commercial presence for them in West Africa and they are pleased with the results. “Supported by Ghana’s first affiliated global aviation advisory firm, Dre Aviation, and one of Nigeria’s leading airlines, Dana Air, Meridiana Fly entered into the West African market with an iconic Boeing 767-300 series aircraft, and a superior on-time performance rate of 99.5 per cent,” he added.   Saade reaffirmed the airline’s commitment to the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets by confirming both routes in its summer schedule for 2017. Commenting further, Saade said, “the airline would be rescheduling its flight times, which now means a late evening departure from Lagos which arrives in Italy’s Milan Malpensa Airport early the next day, allowing Nigerian passengers to onward connect onto Meridiana services into Europe and beyond. “This is a compelling proposition as the fares are much cheaper than other carriers into Europe and offers a real alternative for the travelling public. Our fares start at $350 all in for a one way ticket into Europe,”  he added.  He noted that more frequencies will be added in due course and that Dre Aviation is ramping up the market initiative for the carrier in both Ghana and Nigeria. He said with a record 4.5 million passengers flown in the last eight years of its operation, Dana Air is providing key operational staff to the Nigeria operations. He lauded Dana Air’s safety and technical capabilities, which have seen it currently operating over 27 daily flights from Lagos to Abuja, Port Harcourt, Uyo and Owerri. “The airline is reputed for its superior on-time performance, world-class in-flight service and customer service,” he said. ‎ Medview seeks better cooperation with immigration, airlines Managing Director/CEO of Medview Airlines Limited, Alhaji Muneer Bankole, is seeking greater collaboration between airlines and the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) to ease passenger movements at international airports in the country. Bankole who spoke in Lagos at a send-off ceremony organised for the outgoing Officer-in-Charge of NIS at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, Mrs. Chizoba Adaeze Dibi described both NIS and local airlines as ambassadors or mirror that projects the culture and values of the country to visitors or foreigners, adding that there was need for both establishments to always work together. “From whatever point of entry, immigration represents the image of the country and as local carriers, there is no day or week or month that we also don’t fly and we also represent the Nigerian brand,” said Bankole. “The relationship between airlines and immigration is therefore one that should be seen as mutually beneficial and we will always ensure it remains so,” he added. In her speech, Mrs. Dibi, who has been moved to head the Edo State Command of the NIS, thanked airlines, officials of the immigration, customs, police, banks and Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) for their cooperation in easing her work during her tenure at the Lagos airport. She listed some of her achievements to include boosting the welfare of immigration officers, the speedy facilitation of international passengers at immigration counters, as well as bringing to an end the abuses of Nigerian passengers by some foreign airlines. Mrs. Dibi said the Lagos Airport command of the NIS was recently singled out for commendation by the Comptroller for Immigration owing to improvements in service delivery at immigration counters to passengers coming in and leaving ‎the country. “During my stay, services improved and everyone that uses the Lagos airport can attest to this. I thank everyone that assisted me to bring about those positive changes,” she added.  Share How I cure baldness using these natural techniques. Read story 23 yrs boy started importation with N10,450.

News Public Safety Woman killed in plane crash was Bangladesh student Karen Pearlman and Teri FigueroaContact Reporters A young woman killed in a plane crash near Ramona on Sunday was a student pilot who came from Bangladesh to learn to fly — following in her father’s profession. Friends and family identified the 20-year-old crash victim as Shaira Noor. She was a student of the American Aviation Academy in El Cajon, and was aboard one of the school’s planes with another student and a teacher during an instructional flight.  The other student and the teacher survived the crash, pulling themselves out of the wreckage of the single-engine Cessna 172S and walking to higher ground to get help. Noor’s body was recovered from the plane Monday morning. Her death has stunned family and friends.  A longtime family friend, Atiq Rahman, said Tuesday that he had been in touch with Noor’s parents, who live in Bangladesh. Her father, Zakir Hussain, flies Boeing airplanes as a commercial pilot for Biman airlines. “She wanted to be like her dad, a commercial pilot and she wanted to fly all over the world, that was her goal,” Rahman said. The young woman is also survived by her mother, Simkey Hussain, and brother, Zarik Hussain, who is 18 and lives with his parents in the city of Dhaka.  Rahman, 50, lives in Los Angeles but is currently back in his home country of Bangladesh. He said Noor went by the nickname "Lamisa," which means "beautiful flower.” While attending the school, Noor lived with a family in El Cajon but enjoyed touring the Los Angeles area with family.  "We visited with her in Los Angeles and she took us all around, to the Hollywood sign, to Beverly Hills, to Santa Monica," Rahman said. "She was really a friendly, polite girl.” Another friend, Desai Shubham, called Noor “a shy girl who didn't go out much” but loved flying most of all. Shubham is currently in India but used to live near Noor in El Cajon. He studied flying with her at American Aviation Academy for a year. “She was very passionate for flying,” Shubham said. He said he believes Noor was in the back seat of the plane when it went down. Mark Hannawa, recruiter and student liaison at the American Aviation Academy, said Noor “was like a daughter to me while she was with us.” “We will miss her kindness and soft demeanor,” he said. “All we ask for now is prayers for her and her family, which are grieving.” A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman said the students were learning how to do an emergency landing when their plane went down in a remote and rugged area called Pamo Valley, near Ramona. The survivors, ages 25 and 28, crawled out of the plane and hiked until they could get cell phone service. They were able to call 911 about 2:30 p.m. It took sheriff’s and fire officials about an hour to find them and the crash site, about 9 miles north/northeast of Ramona on the side of a mountain.    Three must-see headlines  <h1>Manchester contacts NFL regarding stadium</h1> <h1>Crime in San Diego drops to new lows</h1> <h1>San Diego could get 3 inches of rain Friday-Saturday</h1>     Manchester contacts NFL regarding stadium Crime in San Diego drops to new lows San Diego could get 3 inches of rain Friday-Saturday   See more videos Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The San Diego Union-Tribune El Cajon National Transportation Safety Board US Politics Latest Most Popular Today's Paper Jobs Homes Cars Contact Us 57°

President Trump hinted at the end of last week that the Administration's tax proposals would be aired in the next two or three weeks. This seems to be a signal of its inclusion in his address to both houses of Congress on February 28. This is not quite a State of the Union speech, but similar and precisely what Obama did in February 2009. Taxes are complicated. Much of the discussion so far has been on the border adjustment, which is a tax on imports and a tax break for exports. If adopted it has far reaching implications, including but not limited to the potential challenge at the World Trade Organization and retaliatory action. There has also been the suggestion to abolish the tax incentives for debt, which also have important implications for many businesses and capital structure of corporations. It could also hit economic activity that is often funded by debt, such as private equity and mergers and acquisition. There is also some discussion of how the global activity of multinational companies should be taxed. Still, underlying much of the discussions is the belief that US corporate taxes are too high. Indeed, the margin Federal tax rates are 35%, and when state taxes are included, the marginal rates rises to 39.2%. The global average is near 25%. It is not a lie. Nor is it fake news. Nevertheless, it is grossly misleading. Such claims focus on the statutory tax rate, not the effective tax rate, or what companies actually pay. The Congressional Research Service estimates that the average effective corporate tax rate is 27.1%, which is slightly below the OECD average of 27.7%. Even this may overstate the case. Consider that the Citizens for Tax Justice found that GE, Boeing, Verizon, and 23 other Fortune 500 companies paid no Federal taxes between 2008 and 2012. More than 100 of the profitable Fortune 500 companies paid no taxes in at least one year in that five year period. The advocacy group found that 288 of profitable Fortune 500 companies paid an effective tax rate of 19.4% between 2008 and 2012. Leaving aside, the issue of how much taxes US corporations actually pay, it lower taxes boosted growth and/or employment they should be worth considering. However, this also does not look true. The Center for Effective Government found that 22 of the 30 profitable Fortune 500 companies that paid the highest corporate tax rate (30%+) in 2008-2012 increased payrolls by 200k. The 30 more profitable Fortune 500 companies that paid little or no taxes in that five-period cut employment by a little more than 50k. The impact of lower taxes on growth appears minimal at best. The Congressional Research Service estimates that a cut in the Federal tax schedule from 35% to 25% may boost growth by less than 0.2%. The reason why this may be so is that corporate tax rates are not the impediment to growth. As counter-intuitive as this may seem, US corporations and many large businesses around the world have more capital than they know what to do with. Is that what is meant when capital is returned to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and dividend increases? This is the central subject of my new book, Political Economy of Tomorrow. The implication of this is if effective US corporate tax rate is reduced, it may be good for equity owners. The US political and economic cycles have been generating tax reform every 20 years beginning with the 1920s, though skipping 1940 when the world was at war. Each was associated with a bull market in equities. At the same time, corporate tax cuts can increase the disparity of wealth. The disparity of wealth (and income) can be a potent political force, as we have seen. A cut in corporate taxes could also and starve the government of revenue, which boosts US debt, and at a time it appears less attractive for foreign investors. The impact on government revenue should not be overstated (and that itself is a problem). Consider that in 1952, corporate taxes accounted for nearly a third of the Federal government's revenue. By 2013, it had fallen to 10%.

Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS Share Adjust Comment Print Former Conservative MP and fighter pilot Laurie Hawn says he was forced from his role as a RCAF honorary colonel because he voiced strong concerns about the Liberal government’s plan to buy the Boeing Super Hornet. But the Royal Canadian Air Force says Hawn was asked to resign because those serving in such honorary positions are not allowed to be political advocates or promote political opinions. Hawn, a former CF-18 pilot, was Honorary Colonel for 401 Tactical Fighter Squadron until Feb. 11 when he was asked to resign by RCAF commander Lt.-Gen. Mike Hood. “Speaking truth to power can be risky,” Hawn said in a recent post on his Facebook page. “I re-confirmed that this week by speaking out rather more forcefully than was appreciated to the Commander of the RCAF and the Chief of the Defence Staff, on the issue of the CF-18 replacement.” Hawn, who as Conservative parliamentary defence secretary was the Harper government’s point man advocating the purchase of the F-35 stealth fighter, outlined on Facebook what he believed were the flaws of the Super Hornet. He accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “foolish and inaccurate statements” on the fighter jet file. “And you thought that Donald Trump was the only purveyor of ‘alternate facts’,” Hawn wrote. Hood asked Hawn to resign on Feb. 11 and Hawn did so, the RCAF confirmed in a statement to the Ottawa Citizen on Tuesday. “As political advocating is not compatible with continued service as an Honorary Colonel, Laurie Hawn has resigned as Honorary Colonel for 401 Tactical Fighter Squadron,” the RCAF noted in the statement. “His leadership and tireless commitment to the RCAF is deeply appreciated.” According to the RCAF, the public and the news media consider honorary appointees to be representatives of the Department of National Defence. “It is very important, however, that Honorary Colonels remain outside any public controversy concerning the Canadian Armed Forces, steer well clear of comments that could possibly threaten operational security and never use the appointment to promote political opinion or to seek political favour for the unit or any member thereof,” according to a policy statement forwarded by the RCAF. Hawn acknowledged on Facebook that, “I have been very critical of the 100% politically motivated plan to buy 18 “interim” Super Hornets for some time.” “Most Canadians may not really care about Super Hornet versus F-35, but I think they do care about the waste of billions of dollars for very little return, especially if it’s purely in the name of politics,” Hawn added. In November the Liberal government announced it was entering into discussions with the U.S. government and Boeing for the eventual acquisition of 18 “interim” Super Hornet jets until a permanent fleet for the existing CF-18 aircraft could be bought. The Liberals said Canada is facing a capability gap because it doesn’t have enough fighter jets to fulfill its military missions. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has blamed the previous Conservative government for bungling the project to replace the aging CF-18s. The Liberal government has acknowledged the decision to buy the 18 Super Hornets will cost more in the long run. Canadian troops simulate attack on Goose Bay airport during exercise involving...

Schweikert: Tax reform as much about economic growth as payroll growth    Tuesday, 14 Feb 2017 | 7:51 AM ET | 04:31 The stock market rally has been fueled in part by hopes that a big tax cut — of one kind or another — would bump up corporate profits and spending. But the proposed tax plan with the most punch so far could have a tough time making it through Congress, and that ultimately could mean disappointment for a heady stock market. It also means the slow wheels of Washington could delay tax reform for longer than the stock market is expecting. "You're going to get a lot of hand-wringing. It's slow, and it's going to be gradual," said Dan Clifton, head of policy research at advisory firm Strategas. The current House Ways and Means Committee proposal would cut the corporate tax rate from a current 35 percent to 20 percent. That would make a difference for the biggest U.S. corporations, which pay about 25 percent on average. But the plan is paid for by the controversial border adjustment tax, which is meeting resistance in the Senate. President Donald Trump has not clearly come down one way or the other on the plan, and he meets Wednesday with big retailers who oppose it. "Whether the Ryan plan passes with the border adjusted tax is highly controversial. ... The Senate is going to be a lot more resistant to it," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. House Speaker Paul Ryan is a big backer of the plan. "I think bottom line is the market is making it seem like there are only winners from tax reform. But with the border adjusted tax, there are going to be winners and losers." show chapters Border tax fight is economists vs. everybody else: Brill    Friday, 10 Feb 2017 | 7:15 AM ET | 03:10 Goldman Sachs economists put the odds of a border adjusted tax at about 20 percent, with opposition growing. Besides concerns about the effect on consumers, the European Union and other trading partners may challenge it with the World Trade Organization. Trump raised market expectations about tax reform when he promised last Thursday he would debut his own plan in the next several weeks, and it's unclear whether it will be like the House proposal or something else. The concern is the effort could become mired in debate, with the border adjustment tax already seeing industries lining up on both sides of it. The border adjusted tax would put a 20 percent tax on all goods coming into the country and no tax on exports. That pits Boeing, General Electric and Dow Chemical, all exporters, against Wal-Mart, Target and other importers. "If that tax reform date looks like it's pushed too far in the future, the market reacts negatively to it. We don't think it kills the bull market, but it could pull the market down 3 to 4 percent near term. A trim, not a haircut," said John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management. Trump has previously proposed a plan that would reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. "Our expectation is the forthcoming White House plan will reduce rates largely by expanding the budget deficit, with a small amount of base broadening. By contrast, we expect that the Senate will consider legislation that broadens the tax base somewhat more, but proposes a smaller cut to the corporate tax rate to limit the budgetary effect," the Goldman economists said. They also said without the border adjustment proposal the tax rate would probably be closer to 25 percent, not much bang for companies already at that rate based on deductions. Small companies, however, would benefit as many of them pay much closer to the 35 percent rate. The loss of the House border adjustment tax from the plan would be significant since it is expected to raise about $1 trillion over 10 years. It would be a dramatic shift in U.S. corporate tax structure to a destination-based tax, which means that companies would not deduct the costs of imported goods, and would not include export revenue in their tax base. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Tuesday on CNBC that in his mind, there would be no tax bill without a border adjusted tax. "I don't know any other way to do it. We've long looked at this. We've had exhaustive hearing after hearing after hearing for eight years," said Nunes, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. He said the committee has found the only way to make meaningful changes is to move to a full consumption-based system. "This is the only way to leapfrog United States tax code in front of every other tax code around the world," said Nunes. Clifton said House leadership has said this before, and the House does not currently have the 218 votes for tax reform with the border adjustment tax, but Ryan and others believe they have more flexibility to get the tax rate lower with it. He said without Trump's endorsement, it's a hard sell to get other House members on board. "It's like 'Hunger Games' for tax lobbyists now," said Clifton. "If you're negatively impacted by the border tax, you're pushing the net interest deductibility." Limiting interest deductibility would be a negative for financial firms. The border adjusted tax is an unknown and for that reason, opponents say it's unclear if it would work quite the way it is expected to. For one, it requires a 25 percent jump in the dollar to prevent the import tax from becoming a tax on consumers and on companies that rely on imported goods. Proponents say it would create American jobs and build up U.S. manufacturing. "Our own case is you couldn't get the full appreciation of the dollar in one go, and in all likelihood the border adjustment tax would not have the neutral effect that academic theory suggests it might, and would materially benefit net exporters rather than net importers," said Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. The House bill also proposes limiting the deductability of net interest expense and instead allowing companies to fully expense, instead of depreciating capital expenditures. Turnill said that could hurt companies that are highly leveraged, but analysts say that's a feature that could stay in an alternate plan. Turnill said he believes that the reflation of the global economy has been the main driver of the market, but tax reform is a factor and the process could result in volatile trading as more reform details emerge. Clifton said a tax plan without border tax adjustment is most likely, and he outlined several scenarios. One is for a plan that includes 100 percent expensing for a few years instead of having companies depreciate capital expenditures. That could take the corporate tax rate to 23 percent, he said. Tax reform could also include a one-time repatriation of the $2 trillion in corporate cash held overseas, also currently in the House plan. The net interest deduction would also be capped under this plan and existing corporate deductions and credit would be removed. A second option is a straight tax cut, a proposal that Trump has discussed. But without revenue generation, it could face opposition and potentially result in higher interest rates, as it could add to U.S. debt. Clifton said a straight cut could get done much quicker, and in 2003, a tax cut boosted GDP growth to 7 percent in the third quarter and 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter. The third fallback plan he sees is a one-time repatriation of overseas cash, together with infrastructure spending. Clifton said the collapsing dam in California is likely to renew calls for major infrastructure plans. He said House conservatives would probably oppose such a plan. "I do think they will get corporate tax reform.They'll be targeting anywhere from 15 to 20 percent, and I do think repatriation will be a part of it," said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. "The big question for markets is going to be the loss of deductions that come along with it. If in fact losing the interest deduction is on the table, that one is important for highly leveraged companies." Arone said it seems like some border adjustability will be included. "The administration has seemed to warm to it a bit more. After an initial comment that it was too complicated, we haven't heard much more in terms of tweets, comments talking it down. ... The market has already anticipated some form of border adjustability. Folks that import already manufactured goods, that type of thing, earnings could be impaired."

(Brad Nettles/The Post And Courier via AP, File) KRMG Facebook Follow KRMG on Twitter By Steve Berg It's importers versus exporters, in the fight over a possible 20-percent U.S. border tax. The battle line is pretty clear-cut. Reuters says major U.S. exporters like Boeing and Pfizer of course love the idea of an import tax. But major importers like Gap and Best Buy hate the idea. In fact, Best Buy, which is the largest electronics retailer in the U.S. says a 20-percent import tax would turn its projected $1-billion annual profit into a $2-billion loss. Leaders from many of the U.S. companies that are dependent on imports are heading to Washington D.C. to meet with lawmakers this week. Click here to read more from Reuters. There are no comments yet.

When the CEO of Intel appeared at the White House to announce a revived effort to build a factory in Chandler, he talked about the need for more favorable tax policies under the Trump administration. The company also stands to get a big tax break at the state level under a legislation introduced in Arizona that was designed for big manufacturing corporations like Intel. Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File AP Photo Arizona state Rep. Jeff Weninger, R-Chandler, laughs after rushing to his desk to vote on a bill at the Capitol in Phoenix on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017. Weninger is proposing a new way for big manufacturing companies like chip-maker Intel to use millions of dollars of tax credits they have on the books but are unable to use. Bob Christie AP Photo 1 of 2 i By BOB CHRISTIE Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story PHOENIX When Intel's CEO appeared at the White House last week to announce a revived effort to build a new factory in Chandler, he talked about the need for more favorable tax policies under the Trump administration. The company also stands to get a big tax break at the state level under legislation introduced in Arizona designed to help big manufacturers like Intel. Manufacturers are sitting on tens of millions of dollars in state income tax credits they can't use because previous cuts in Arizona corporate income taxes favoring them leave them owing no tax here. The legislation by Rep. Jeff Weninger, R-Chandler, would allow them to use those credits in other ways by getting cash refunds or money to offset sales-tax expenses when they invest in new facilities. Manufacturers would they only get half their credits back, the program is capped $10 million per year, and companies must agree to remain in Arizona for five years. The proposal in House Bill 2492 is set for a committee hearing Wednesday. It also contains three other major incentives for big manufacturers like Intel, Raytheon, Honeywell and Boeing. Weninger said the effort is needed to boost the state's competitiveness. He noted increased competition from other states and nations and the need to work to attract and retain high-paying manufacturing jobs. "We have to do whatever we can to remain very, very competitive with those other people," Weninger said in an interview Friday. The proposal was introduced just days before Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced during a meeting with President Donald Trump last week that the company would invest $7 billion to complete a computer chip plant in Chandler. The plant has been vacant since it was built several years ago. The announcement echoed one Intel made in 2011 with former President Barack Obama that never came to fruition. The plant is expected to be completed in three to four years and directly employ about 3,000 new workers. The CEO indicated that the company was counting on a tax break under the new administration. "It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to be manufacturing in the U.S," he said. Weninger said his proposal isn't linked to Intel's announcement and had been in the works for months during talks with big manufacturing companies, including Raytheon, Boeing, Intel and Honeywell. "This is something that's been going on for a long time, these companies all working together, all trying to figure out something where we can make Arizona more and more competitive," he said. But others believe Intel surely will be a major and early beneficiary. "I don't think there's any doubt about that," said Kevin McCarthy, president of the Arizona Tax Research Association. "They've got all the national news surrounding their expansion. There's probably some link there." Three other incentives that would help Intel are wrapped into Weninger's proposal. One is a new jobs=creation program giving big companies about $3 million a year in tax rebates. The second creates a new sales tax exemption for supplies needed in manufacturing clean rooms, while a third lowers property taxes on new equipment already taxed at an ultra-low rate in special trade zones like the one Intel occupies in Chandler. That and other provisions of the proposal trouble McCarthy, whose association generally opposes tax policies that single out classes of taxpayers because others have to pick up the tab. "We have concerns about the breadth of this," he said. "We definitely have concerns about the expansion of accelerated depreciation to Class 6 property. That much I know for sure, because (trade-zone) property applies to well more than the manufacturers who I know are advocating this."

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 169.30 +0.80 +0.47% Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA NWARF ▼ 33.20 -0.08 -0.24% Southwest Airlines Co LUV ▲ 57.29 +1.98 +3.58% Delivery of the single-aisle 737 MAX models, which replace the current 737 "NG" introduced in 1997, is crucial for Boeing to hit the financial targets it has promised investors and to offset slowing output of some of its largest jets such as the 777 and 747. Airlines want the MAX because it burns significantly less fuel than current models. The world's largest plane maker is creating up to five MAX versions, while planning to increase output to 57 planes a month in 2019, from 42 a month at present.© REUTERS/Jason Redmond A worker is pictured next to Boeing's new 737 MAX-9 under construction at their production facility in Renton, Washington The first MAX model in production, known as the MAX-8, is on track to reach customers by mid-year. "We are anticipating our certification of the airplane within a matter of days-weeks," Keith Leverkuhn, 737 general manager, said at a Monday briefing embargoed until Tuesday. The stamp of approval by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration would come about a year after the MAX-8's first flight and allow Boeing to begin delivering the $110 million, 162-seat jetliner in the second quarter, he said. Deliveries trigger the bulk of airline payments. Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL) will be one of the first airlines to fly the plane commercially, likely ahead of launch customer Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N), which was first to order the MAX but is taking longer to put it into service. Boeing expects the MAX to account for as much as 15 percent of the 500 or more 737s it expects to deliver in 2017, rising to nearly 100 percent by 2020. Boeing on Monday showed off the first 737 MAX-9 sitting near the end of the assembly line at its factory in Renton, Washington. The nearly completed jet, which carries a list price of $116.6 million and seats 178, will undergo about nine months of testing after first flight in April. MAX-10 TAKES SHAPE Boeing is mulling an even larger version, the 737 MAX-10, to take on rival Airbus (AIR.PA), which has had strong sales of its A321neo that is a larger competitor to the MAX-9. The MAX-10 would be 66 inches (1.68 m) longer than the MAX-9, with the same engine thrust. The major change will be the landing gear, which must be taller to accommodate the longer fuselage. Boeing expects to test various landing gear designs this year "to see which one ... is going to be the best solution," Leverkuhn said.© REUTERS/Jason Redmond Keith Leverkuhn, vice president in charge of Boeing's 737 program, speaks to reporters at their factory in Renton, Washington Boeing is about 90 percent finished with design drawings for the smallest version, the 737 MAX-7. A high-density MAX-200, with seating for 200 passengers, rounds out the model line. Sales of Boeing's larger twin-aisle planes have slowed sharply and the company is cutting output of the profitable 777 by 40 percent this year.

"We want Air India to survive," Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said at the CNN Asia Business Forum in Bangalore on Monday. "We don't mind where it is, who runs it, as long as it serves the Indian people and our Indian skies." The state-owned airline has been plagued by inefficiency and enormous losses for years. It received a $4.5 billion bailout from the government in 2012. "I can't commit the taxpayers' money for eternity to keep it going," Raju said. "Whether it's owned by government, owned by [someone else], we'd like it to survive." Related: Boeing snags $11 billion order from India's SpiceJet Air travel in India is growing at a furious rate. The country is forecast to overtake the U.K. as the world's third largest aviation market within the next decade. The airline business in India is also highly competitive. Air India is up against private domestic carriers and Middle Eastern airlines like Etihad and Emirates that have aggressively expanded into the country in recent years. "Left to itself, Air India is likely to get grounded," Raju added. "Something has to be done about it, the sooner the better." But he didn't provide any details or timetable for tackling Air India's difficulties. This isn't the first time the privatization of the airline has been suggested. Raju's predecessor, Ajit Singh, hinted at it in 2013, but the idea was slammed by opposition parties. One of those opposition parties, the BJP, is now in government. The question is whether it would have the political will to push through such a challenging privatization.

He was speaking at the Aero India 2017 exhibition, which began here on Tuesday. The Minister’s statement is an important clarification from the government which intends to throw open several big ticket deals under the ‘Make in India’ drive. “In the Strategic Partnership model, one of the requirements is for the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to get its Government’s approval,” Mr. Parrikar said. ‘Not my concern’ Observing that it was not for India to talk to other governments, he said: “It is not my concern.” The policy unveiled by President Trump to bring back manufacturing jobs to America has raised concerns on the fate of the soon-to-be-launched multi-billion fighter aircraft deals in which U.S. defence majors Boeing and Lockheed Martin are vigorously pitching their products. While Lockheed has offered its F-16 for the single engine jet deal, Boeing has offered its F-18 Super Hornet in response to the Navy’s Request For Information (RFI) for 57 carrier-based aircraft. Both have offered to set up assembly facilities in India with extensive technology transfer. Boeing said it was not aware of any policy changes in the U.S. with respect to the offer but declined to elaborate. Kaveri engine Swedish defence major SAAB has offered its Gripen fighter but it flies with a U.S.-built engine in addition to some other components. While company officials say they do not foresee any issues, the concerns are yet to be fully addressed. The indigenous Kaveri jet engine project which was shut down after repeated time and cost overruns will get a new lease of life. “Kaveri is being revived. DRDO is in discussions with Safran as part of offsets under Rafale jet deal,” Mr. Parrikar said.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo By Jeffrey Dastin Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) warned on Friday that government actions to bolster domestic companies against foreign competition could hurt its business, in a possible reference to U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First" agenda. In a routine description of regulatory risks in its 2016 annual filing, the world's largest online retailer said "trade and protectionist measures" might hinder its ability to grow. That language has not appeared in Amazon's warning about government regulation in at least the past five annual filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Seattle-based company has cited trade protection in those filings as a risk to its international sales and operations specifically. The new Republican president has made job creation a cornerstone of his policies, threatening to impose tariffs on imports so companies produce and hire within the United States. Republicans in Congress also have a plan to target imports while excluding export revenue from U.S. corporate income tax, known as a border adjustment tax. The proposal in the U.S. House of Representatives has divided corporate America. Major exporters like Boeing Co (BA.N) have thrown their weight behind it, but a retail association has said it would raise prices for shoppers. It was not clear what kinds of protectionist measures - whether tariffs or other actions - concerned Amazon the most, or from which countries Amazon saw the greatest risk. Amazon so far has declined to comment on Republican lawmakers' border tax plan. It declined comment on the new language in its annual filing, which appeared under the header, "Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business." The filing did not mention the change in leadership of the White House. Separately, Amazon said in the filing that it may face penalties for having delivered consumer products to entities covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, between 2012 and 2016. Products included apparel, consumer electronics, software and books. Amazon said it processed goods worth about $2,400 for an entity controlled or owned by Iran's government, for example. "We do not plan to continue selling to these accounts in the future," Amazon said. "Our review is ongoing and we are enhancing our processes designed to identify transactions associated with individuals and entities covered by the (act)."

The transaction may be unveiled on Feb. 24 when British Airways parent IAG reports full-year results, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the details aren’t yet public. The company is likely to take the jets via a lease deal involving a new order from a third party, one of the people said. The planes will replace four aging Boeing Co. 757s on some Aer Lingus flights to the U.S. as IAG renews the unit’s fleet amid increasing competition from carriers including Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which is establishing an Irish arm and aims to operate trans-Atlantic services using Boeing 737 Max jets. IAG said on Nov. 4 that it had issued a request for proposals for the longer-range LR variant of the A321neo and planned to spend 400 million euros ($425 million) on switching to the model, which will complement the Airbus A330s that form the mainstay of Aer Lingus’s U.S. services. The London-based group declined to comment further when contacted by Bloomberg on Tuesday. Airbus said it doesn’t disclose order discussions. IAG is also in talks with American Airlines about incorporating Aer Lingus in the trans-Atlantic joint venture that BA operates with Spain’s Iberia, and may also bring it into the Oneworld global alliance. The company is separately planning a new low-cost unit serving North America from Barcelona and fed by traffic from its discount division Vueling. Chief Executive Officer Willie Walsh said last week that Aer Lingus’s poor brand recognition in the region probably rules it out as the operating company, leaving Iberia the most likely contender. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photos of the day 02/15 SUBSCRIBE The SpaceX Falcon 9 makes its way into the port of Los Angeles in mid-January for the company's first launch since a fireball engulfed a similar rocket on a Florida launch pad more than five months ago. Chuck Bennett/The Daily Breeze/AP/File | Caption Loading... Lonnie Shekhtman Staff | @LonnieShekhtman February 13, 2017 —The NASA Kennedy Space Center launch pad from which Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin blasted off to the moon has sat dormant for years. In a few days, its next chapter will begin. On Sunday, SpaceX, an aerospace company based in Hawthorne, Calif. that rents the historic Launch Complex 39A from NASA, tested the engines of its Falcon 9 rocket there in preparation to deliver supplies and science experiments to the International Space Station (ISS) on February 18. This will be the company’s 10th cargo trip to the ISS under its contract with NASA, according to Space.com, and its first launch from 39A in Florida. “Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A,” SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk posted on Instagram Sunday, alongside a photo of the rocket. “This is the same launch pad used by the Saturn V rocket that first took people to the moon in 1969. We are honored to be allowed to use it,” Mr. Musk wrote. SpaceX signed a 20-year lease to take over the pad in 2014 and has spent the ensuing years fixing it up. NASA stopped using the launch pad in 2011, when its 30-year-old space shuttle program was shut down after Atlantis, one of five NASA space shuttles of that era, blasted off from 39A toward the ISS in the last-ever US shuttle mission. Throughout the decades-long shuttle program, NASA’s spacecraft – Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour – carried people into orbit, launched and maintained satellites, and made it possible for humans to build the space station. The 18-year-old international science laboratory orbits 240 miles above Earth. Infographic Space Race, The Sequel: Who is exploring the cosmos today? And starting Saturday, SpaceX will use the site to launch cargo in the Dragon capsule aboard its Falcon 9 rocket. The company hopes to use the Florida launch pad to send humans to the ISS in about a year. “That is a big deal. It’s absolutely symbolic we are launching from there,” former NASA launch director Bob Sieck told the Orlando Sentinel on February 8. Since shutting down its space shuttle program, NASA has relied on the Russian space fleet and, increasingly, on the private space industry to step in to fill the void in space exploration and to make it more affordable. In addition to SpaceX, NASA has contracted with Orbital ATK, an aerospace and defense contractor based in Dulles, Va., and with Colorado-based aerospace company Sierra Nevada Corporation, to deliver cargo to the ISS for years to come. The agency also is relying on SpaceX and Boeing to start delivering astronauts to space as soon as possible, though both companies are facing technical delays. SpaceX, following a rocket explosion in September, has pushed back human flight to the ISS from this year to 2018. Boeing has, too. Though the delays are necessary to ensure astronaut safety, they put pressure on NASA because of the high cost of sending astronauts to the space station. The agency pays $82 million to the Russian space agency for each seat it reserves aboard Russia’s Soyuz rocket, the only one capable of ferrying people to space for now. According to recent estimates by NASA, seats aboard SpaceX and Boeing rockets could cost a comparatively cheap $58 million each. "Given the delays in initiating a US capacity to transport crew to the ISS, NASA has extended its contract with the Russian Space Agency for astronaut transportation through 2018 at an additional cost of $490 million,” wrote NASA's Office of Inspector General in a September audit. “If the Commercial Crew Program experiences additional delays, NASA may need to buy additional seats from Russia to ensure a continued US presence on the ISS.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

X Civil war looms in corporate America over Trump tax plan All agreed on cutting corporation tax but importers and exporters diverge on border tax Tue, Feb 14, 2017, 16:46 Donald Trump’s plans to impose an import tax has divided corporate America         Rick Woldenberg views US economic policy through an unconventional lens: a multicoloured toy microscope that retails for just $20 (€18.90). Copyrighted in the US but manufactured in China, My First Microscope is one of hundreds of toys sold by Learning Resources, his Chicago company, which he uses to measure the effect of Washington on his business. Alongside chief executives from Wall Street, the rust belt and Silicon Valley, Mr Woldenberg has spent years pleading for Washington to overhaul an uncompetitive tax code that charges US companies the highest rates of any developed nation. “It is a crushing load,” he says adding that profits from his microscopes are taxed at above 40 per cent. After November’s election Republicans said their party’s control of both the White House and Congress had created the best chance to revamp the tax code in a generation. President Donald Trump has put slashing the 35 per cent corporate tax rate at the heart of his mission to boost the economy and create jobs. Expectations of success powered a post-election stock market rally. Devastating Yet for Mr Woldenberg the hope has turned to horror. Republicans are still promising the most sweeping changes since the Reagan reforms of 1986. But the only firm proposal on the table – from the House of Representatives – threatens to devastate his 150-person business because it includes a 20 per cent tax on imports. “This plan is not good for me if it kills me,” he says. “You know John Maynard Keynes said in the long run we’re all dead. I just don’t want to be dead now.” US importers have serious grounds to fear being hurt. Yet there are potential winners also, because the flip side of the import levy is a tax exemption for exports leaving the US. That stark difference has triggered a corporate civil war between big importers and exporters, a conflict playing out via fierce lobbying in Congress. ADVERTISEMENT Tax reform is one of Mr Trump’s best chances of making good on his election promise to improve the lives of financially strapped blue-collar voters. But the early skirmishes underline just how hard it will be for him to deliver his “tax revolution”. They have shattered Republican unity, left politicians skittish about their party’s plan and given the Trump administration reason to keep it at arm’s length. The broad tax blueprint does have “America first” credentials: it aims to stop US businesses fleeing overseas and seeks to eliminate advantages the current system gives to foreign companies selling into the US or competing with American rivals abroad. It would also cut the business tax rate from 35 per cent to 20 per cent. Threat to jobs But its most potent weapon is the import duty. Coupled with a tax exemption for exports leaving the US, it was conceived to boost the global competitiveness of American-made products and services. The problem for Mr Woldenberg is that his goods come from China – 98 per cent of the products he sells in the US are imported. US factories could not produce them with the same low costs and specialised skills, he says. So he would have no choice but to pay the import levy. He estimates it would send his tax bill soaring to 165 per cent of earnings. “To preserve cash flow I [would have to] raise my prices by a third, expect volume to go down by 40 per cent, and fire one out of five people,” he says. “I don’t want to do any of those things.” Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Nike, Gap and dozens of other groups that rely on imports last month began a lobbying campaign to kill the Republican plan. Dubbing it a “consumer tax”, they say they would have to increase prices on foreign goods, cut jobs or lose money. Stephen Sadove, former chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, the luxury department store, and a coalition member, said it was fanciful to think an import tax could reverse decades of outsourcing. “This is an existential threat to the retailers,” he told CNBC this month. The consumer companies are squaring off against their industrial peers. Big exporters such as Dow Chemical, General Electric, Boeing, Caterpillar and Pfizerhave formed the American Made coalition to champion the House plan. They argue that it would end the perverse practice of having lighter taxes on imports than American goods and foster job creation. The clash between the marquee names of corporate America has delayed the drafting of legislation in the House. In January Paul Ryan, the top Republican lawmaker, said he wanted tax reform introduced by August. A week later Mr Trump hinted at a longer timeline, saying: “I think before the end of the year I would like to say yes.” Adjusting borders Until the morning after election night, few people had paid attention to the ambitious House plan, published in June 2016. It was driven by a rising anger in both parties about the number of US companies moving factories overseas or using “ inversion” deals to shift their headquarters to low-tax jurisdictions. The plan was designed to stem that tide, a major election issue, and stimulate US corporate investment, raising productivity and people’s earnings. The headline proposal was the cut in business tax. However the plan would also replace income tax with a cashflow alternative allowing companies to write off capital investment on day one rather than gradually over a period of years - a very generous provision. In addition, it would end America’s unpopular practice of taxing global profits, replacing it with a system of taxing only companies’ US earnings. That provides the basis for the measures, known as “border adjustments”, that exclude export revenues from the tax base while taxing imports. ADVERTISEMENT “Regardless of where it is produced and regardless of who produces it, our international tax plan centres on a simple question: if it is consumed in the US it will be taxed at an equal rate,” says Kevin Brady, who created the plan as chairman of the House ways and means committee. “It eliminates every tax incentive for a US company to move jobs, manufacturing or their headquarters overseas.” Border adjustments would provide roughly $1.1 trillion of revenue to help fund any rate cut, says the Tax Foundation. But the think-tank estimates the whole plan would lift federal debt by $2.4 trillion over a decade. Its effect on global trade, investment and supply chains would be profound, say tax experts. Michael Devereux, director of the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation, believes the plan could be the biggest shake-up of cross-border taxation since the 1920s. Worry for Ireland Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands would have particular reason to worry, he says. They are low-tax countries that have encouraged US companies to shift profits or head offices to their shores. Under the House proposal the incentive to do that disappears. Instead, it is the US that would start operating “in a way akin to a tax haven”, according to an Oxford paper Mr Devereux co-authored in January. Countries watching their tax bases drift to the US would feel the pressure to adopt the same system, triggering a race to the bottom. Alternatively, they could challenge the US at the World Trade Organisation, arguing that the import tax is discriminatory. Mr Brady says he is just bringing the US into line with 100-plus countries that already levy VAT on imports but not exports. Trade lawyers in Brussels and Geneva are said to be preparing the groundwork for a case that could be the biggest in WTO history. “For there to be a WTO violation you don’t have to prove that there is both import discrimination and an export subsidy, one will do. In this case I believe there will be both,” says Jim Bacchus, a former congressman and member of the WTO’s top appellate body. The first companies to wake up to the significance of the import tax were retailers, which source everything from avocados to T-shirts overseas. Koch Industries, a petrol-to-paper towels conglomerate owned by the billionaire Republican donors Charles and David Koch, warned in December that the plan would “distort” the market. David French, the top lobbyist at the National Retail Federation, says: “Some retailers have looked at the numbers and consider it a threat to their viability. We are talking about effective tax rates that easily take up 100 per cent of their profits and in some cases come close to 200 per cent or 300 per cent. ” Disadvantage Advocates of the House plan say the importers need not worry. Border adjustments, they argue, would not distort trade because the dollar should appreciate immediately to offset the effect, with a stronger US currency boosting the buying power of importers and making US exports more expensive overseas. Critics dismiss that as an unreliable prediction from academics. For US exporters, the ability to export tax-free would also give them the option of dropping prices. But their support for the plan is grounded in the proposed 20 per cent corporate tax rate. Equally popular is ending the tax levied on foreign affiliates’ earnings when they are repatriated, which has left an estimated $1.2 trillion stranded in offshore cash piles. David Lewis, vice-president of global taxes at the US drugmaker Eli Lilly, says the current system puts his company at a disadvantage to British and Swiss rivals. “They can take their earnings from outside the US and spend a full dollar in the US on investment, intellectual property, whatever it might be. Whereas if we want to take a dollar from outside the US and redeploy it in the US we’re only getting 65 cents [after paying 35 per cent tax],” he says. “It’s about levelling the playing field.” ADVERTISEMENT The next step for tax legislation is the Senate, where the corporate upset has already made some Republicans nervous. David Perdue, a Georgia senator and a former chief executive at the retailer Dollar General, describes the border adjustment tax as “regressive”, adding: “It hammers low-income and middle-income consumers.” Politically expensive If tax reforms built around the import levy are to survive, Mr Trump will have to embrace them. The White House says the president will offer his “outline” for tax reform within the next three weeks. Ultimately, he will have to pick a side in the corporate civil war but so far his administration has sent out mixed signals. Peter Navarro, the head of the White House National Trade Council, told the Financial Times last month that border adjustability “offers one possible option among several” for correcting anti-US bias in the global tax system. The status quo may be unacceptable but if an import tax that boosted voters’ incomes also increased household bills, it would be politically costly. James Lucier, managing director of Capital-Alpha, a policy research group, says a conventional US president would be unable to sell a proposal that could be attacked as a sales tax. “It will take a figure like Donald Trump to convince the pick-up driving, Walmart-shopping American that it’s the right thing to do,” he says. “The alternative is if Trump wanted to blow it up, one tweet would do it.” Mr Woldenberg says Mr Trump should not confuse being bold with being reckless. He calls the import tax proposal an exercise in “blind faith” in which his microscopes could become victims. “We are being asked to risk a lifetime of work to prevent other people’s abuses. That’s more unfair than the current situation. We would be much better off if Congress did nothing.” WINNERS AND LOSERS FROM THE TAX REFORM PLAN Rate cut Would slash the top federal corporate tax rate to 20 per cent from 35 per cent, the highest in the OECD club of rich countries. This is a change, in isolation, that all companies can welcome. Reagan’s 1986 reforms cut the rate from 46 per cent to 34 per cent. Border adjustment The most controversial aspect of the House Republicans plan. It would tax imports by denying companies the ability to deduct the cost of imported goods from their taxable profits – a big blow for US importers. It would also exempt export revenue from company tax bases, in effect handing a rebate to US exporters. End worldwide taxation The proposal would end the taxation of profits from the foreign affiliates of US companies and tax only US earnings. Companies would be charged a one-off 8.75 per cent rate on existing offshore cash. This is a big win for technology and pharmaceutical companies with large offshore cash piles. Full ‘expensing’ Would allow companies to write off capital investment in the year it was made rather than gradually over the life of purchased equipment and buildings. A boon for capex-intensive industries such as energy and transportation. End favourable treatment of debt Companies would not be allowed to deduct interest payments on loans from their taxable profits. The move would deliver a blow to private equity and real estate companies that depend on debt financing. Critics of the current system say it encourages risky, debt-laden capital structures. – Copyright The Financial Times Ltd       Topics: Trump presidency David Koch Donald Trump John Maynard Keynes Kevin Brady Paul Ryan Peter Navarro Best Buy Boeing Caterpillar Cnbc Dow Chemical Eli Lilly General Electric Learning Resources Nike Target WalMart Read More Flynn’s demise puts new focus on Trump’s ties to Russia Russia says Michael Flynn resignation a ‘matter for US’ Trump’s Mar-a-Lago meetings raise security questions British government rejects petition to halt Trump state visit Donald Trump’s travel ban: what happens next?

The airline had posted a net profit of Rs 238.39 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The company said it could remain profitable despite a softening of demand due to demonetisation and rising fuel prices. The airline reported operating revenue of Rs 1,642.4 crore as its seat load factor remained robust at 90.7 per cent, the highest in the industry. "Over all, the company is doing well on all operating parameters be it the load factor, on time performance or flight cancellation rate. For 21 months now, the load factor has been above 90 per cent. "Despite the controversy, the OTP has been highest in last six months and the cancellation rate is also the lowest. So airline has shaped up well," SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said. SpiceJet has reported its eighth successive profitable quarter despite headwinds, he said adding, "Our historic aircraft order signifies the end of the turnaround phase and marks the beginning of a growth story." Profits for the quarter were impacted by demonetisation and higher fuel prices. "Things are improving, I think the effect of demonetisation is reducing. But still there was impact of demonetisation on the international travel, especially. I think it will take another 2-3 months to come out of it," Singh added. The aircraft order would help build an even stronger and more profitable airline, he said, adding, "We will be relentless in reducing our costs and identifying new avenues for revenue generation." In the largest commercial aircraft deal for Boeing in the country, the Gurgaon-based SpiceJet had early this year announced it would purchase up to 205 aircraft from Boeing worth Rs 1.50 lakh crore. During the December quarter, SpiceJet carried 3.48 million passengers as against 2.85 million flown by the carrier a year ago. However, the fuel cost went up by 29 per cent to Rs 4,737 crore in Q3 FY17 as compared with Rs 3,666 crore in the December quarter of the previous fiscal. "With the the new aircraft order we will significantly bring down the operating cost. Because the new aircraft burns 20 per cent less fuel. We have also reduced the acquisition cost of the aircraft besides pre-negotiating the engineering contracts (for the new aircraft)," Singh said. Singh said that during the quarter, SpiceJet added some 20 per cent capacity, raising its fleet size to 49 planes from 41 in the December quarter of last fiscal. Through the course of this year, the airline would again find ways to increase profitability by re-engineering its routes and refocusing on the profitable routes by adding capacity where the profits can be high, he said. As part of this plan, SpiceJet plans to induct 7-8 leased single-aisle Boeing planes besides up to four Bombardier Q400 this year, he said. SpiceJet also aims to increase its ancillary revenue to 20 per cent this year from the current 17 per cent, according to Singh. By focusing hard on ancillary revenue which currently stands at 16-17 per cent. We want to push that to 20 per cent this year. SpiceJet operates 343 daily flights to 45 destinations - 39 domestic and six international - using a fleet of 32 Boeing 737NGs and 17 Bombardier Q-400s.

Singh said that during the quarter, SpiceJet added some 20 per cent capacity, raising its fleet size to 49 planes from 41 in the December quarter of last fiscal. Through the course of this year, the airline would again find ways to increase profitability by re-engineering its routes and refocusing on the profitable routes by adding capacity where the profits can be high, he said. As part of this plan, SpiceJet plans to induct 7-8 leased single-aisle Boeing planes besides up to four Bombardier Q400 this year, he said. SpiceJet also aims to increase its ancillary revenue to 20 per cent this year from the current 17 per cent, according to Singh. By focusing hard on ancillary revenue which currently stands at 16-17 per cent. We want to push that to 20 per cent this year.

The airline had posted a net profit of Rs 238.39 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The company said it could remain profitable despite a softening of demand due to demonetisation and rising fuel prices. The airline reported operating revenue of Rs 1,642.4 crore as its seat load factor remained robust at 90.7 per cent, the highest in the industry. "Over all, the company is doing well on all operating parameters be it the load factor, on time performance or flight cancellation rate. For 21 months now, the load factor has been above 90 per cent. "Despite the controversy, the OTP has been highest in last six months and the cancellation rate is also the lowest. So airline has shaped up well," SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said. SpiceJet has reported its eighth successive profitable quarter despite headwinds, he said adding, "Our historic aircraft order signifies the end of the turnaround phase and marks the beginning of a growth story." Profits for the quarter were impacted by demonetisation and higher fuel prices. "Things are improving, I think the effect of demonetisation is reducing. But still there was impact of demonetisation on the international travel, especially. I think it will take another 2-3 months to come out of it," Singh added. The aircraft order would help build an even stronger and more profitable airline, he said, adding, "We will be relentless in reducing our costs and identifying new avenues for revenue generation." In the largest commercial aircraft deal for Boeing in the country, the Gurgaon-based SpiceJet had early this year announced it would purchase up to 205 aircraft from Boeing worth Rs 1.50 lakh crore. During the December quarter, SpiceJet carried 3.48 million passengers as against 2.85 million flown by the carrier a year ago. However, the fuel cost went up by 29 per cent to Rs 4,737 crore in Q3 FY17 as compared with Rs 3,666 crore in the December quarter of the previous fiscal.

Derby Winter Ale Festival 2017 is under way - everything you... 2 Retired Rolls-Royce worker sent girl, 14, sex video on... 1 'Derby County training at Chaddesden Park - now that's what... 1 Comments (0) After reporting its worst losses in its 111-year history Rolls-Royce will be looking to Derby to help it get out of the mire. Three new engines, which have been designed and developed in Derby will be at the heart of the company's future success - the Trent 1000 TEN, the Trent XWB-97 and the Trent 7000. All of these engines are at different stages of development. These are the new products that Rolls-Royce will be bringing to market over the next few years. But there is also a fourth engine - an engine that is already in service - that is important to the long-term future of Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace site in Derby - the Trent XWB. IN OTHER NEWS: Rail firm in Derbyshire to create FIFTY jobs Derby is the main production hub for the XWB. The firm has already ploughed tens of millions into the site to help it produce these engines. Now, production of the XWB is set to ramp up further - and the hope is that further investment could be forthcoming for Derby to help it meet demand. Rolls-Royce has already said that it will be putting more money into Derby - but this will be to modernise the Sinfin site, getting rid of aging buildings which have served their purpose and creating a new "aerospace campus". And although chief executive Warren East has stripped a number of middle-management roles at Derby, he has previously stressed that production staff jobs will not be touched. In its full-year results, in terms of the outlook for the civil aerospace division, Rolls-Royce predicts "modest growth" in revenue and profit in 2017. In the long-term, it is predicting "positive market trends", which can only be good news for the Derby site. It said: "While recent political and economic developments have added some uncertainty to near-term utilisation, we continue to expect that strong wide-body airframe demand - driven by the need for newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft - should provide resilience to manufacturing schedules over the next few years. MORE NEWS: Rolls-Royce boss says 'We're making progress' despite £4.6bn loss "The roll-out of new engines, including the Trent XWB for the highly successful Airbus A350 family, will significantly grow out market share and the installed base of new engines that will deliver strong aftermarket revenues for decades to come." The engines that could propel Rolls-Royce to future success Trent 1000 TEN This engine is a more powerful version of the Trent 1000, which currently powers the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The Trent 1000 TEN (which stands for Thrust, Efficient and New technology) draws on technology that has been developed for other Rolls-Royce engines, including the Trent XWB and the Advance, which is currently in development. The engine had its first successful run on a Boeing 747 "flying test bed" aircraft in early 2016 - and in December it completed its first flight over the skies of Seattle, Washington. The success of the Trent 1000 TEN is important to Rolls-Royce as it faces competition from rival General Electric to supply engines for the Boeing 787. It can produce 78,000lb of thrust compared to a standard Trent 1000 engine, which can generate 72,000lb. It is also lighter as some of its parts are made from carbon composite material, making it more fuel-efficient. MORE NEWS: A dark day for Rolls-Royce: this is what's going on Trent XWB-97 The Trent XWB-97 is the latest version of the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB - and is the exclusive powerplant for the longer range Airbus A350-1000 aircraft. The Trent XWB-97's increased 97,000lb thrust is achieved through a combination of new high-temperature turbine technology, a larger engine core and advanced fan aerodynamics, allowing Airbus to increase the A350-1000 payload range and maximum take-off weight. Towards the end of last year, the first Airbus A350-1000, powered by two Trent XWB-97 engines, successfully completed its first test flight. The engine is due to enter service this year. Trent 7000 The Trent 7000 is the seventh member of the Trent family of engines. It will exclusively power the Airbus A330neo aircraft. It brings together the best of the technology used in other engines that are being produced and developed by Rolls-Royce - including the Trent 1000-TEN and the Trent XWB. It succeeds one of Rolls-Royce's most successful engines ever - the Trent 700, which was first introduced in 1995. The new engine will offer improved fuel efficiency of 11%. The Trent 7000 ran for the first time on a test bed at the firm's civil aerospace division at Sinfin in November, 2015. It is due to enter service by the end of this year.

پارسی العربية اردو کوردی Türkçe English Mehrnews English Thu 16 February 2017 × Economy Home All News Iran World Politics Economy Culture Technology Sports Photo Cartoon Video Opinion Sukhoi fixes SSJ100 bugs for Iran News ID: 3905981 - Mon 13 February 2017 - 13:44 Economy TEHRAN, Feb. 13 (MNA) – An official of Iran's Aviation Companies Association, while pointing to Sukhoi’ correspondence with Iran, said the Russian firm has resolved technical issues of Sukhoi Superjet 100 (SSJ100) and received the aircraft's airworthiness certificate. Maghsoud Asadi-Samani said in view of willingness of some private Iranian airlines for signing contracts with Sukhoi Company, the Russian side, in a letter to Iran's Aviation Companies Association, has announced that technical issues with empennage of SSJ100 passenger plane have been addressed. The manufacturing company of SSJ100 has obtained a certificate from the Continuing Airworthiness Management Organization (CAMO) as well as that its flight capabilities have been approved by State Civil Aviation Authority of Russia (SCAA). He further noted that Sukhoi Company was seeking OFAC a license from Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for presence in Iran’s aviation industry in a bid to launch cooperation with eager Iranian airlines. Asadi-Samani went on to underlined that emphasized that arrival of SSJ100 in Iran’s market was subject to receiving necessary permits from Civil Aviation Organization of Islamic Republic of Iran (CAO.IRI) as well as specific license of OFAC. He stated that despite Donald Trump’s harsh stances against Iran, jet purchase contracts with Airbus and Boeing were being implemented uninterruptedly hence the possibility for Sukhoi to receive OFAC licenses. The official recalled that SSJ100 remained as an option for Iranian airliners adding “two private firms are after hiring and not purchasing the aircraft since it needs to demonstrates its capabilities in Iran’s climate during its tenancy. Asadi-Samani asserted that airlines of Iran therefore preferred to lease SSJ100 before finalizing decision on its purchase. On December 23, 2016, Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency demanded to check all SSJ 100 aircraft, after cracks had been found in the lugs of the stabilizer upper and lower bracket attachment bands. The issue was discovered during a routine inspection of IrAero aircraft. Sukhoi Civil Aircraft company (SCAC) reported the completion of checking the entire Sukhoi Superjet 100 aircraft fleet for cracks in the stabilizer attachment bands and promised that the replacement of the units on such aircraft will be completed before the end of January. In general, after analyzing the total SSJ 100 fleet check results SCAC concluded that the defect in stabilizer attachment bands is not systematic. The Sukhoi Superjet 100 is a modern fly-by-wire twin-engine regional jet with up to 108 (all economy) passenger seats. With development initiated in 2000, the airliner was designed and spearheaded by Sukhoi, a division of the Russian civil aerospace company (UAC), in co-operation with several foreign partners. The total accumulated flying hours of all SSJ 100 in five years equals to 171 702 flight hours or 117,769 flight cycles. The average time of flight was 1 hour 28 minutes, which is a good result on regional routes, for which it was created. In addition, it can operate a maximum of six flights per day in all Iranian airports given the diverse geographic conditions. Now, despite the fact that SCAC has made correspondence with Iran stating that the technical issues have been resolved, the possibility exists that desire of Iranian airlines to cooperate with the Russian company will not be as strong as it was earlier.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 2  +  eight  =  Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter When President Donald Trump tweets negatively about a company, the company's stock price can quickly drop. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) shareholders know this all too well, as the BA stock price dropped by 1.5% after President Trump tweeted on Dec. 6, 2016, that the company's costs were out of control. And these volatile price swings are why it's so important for investors to own Trump-proof stocks in 2017. Money Morning Director of Tech and Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson expects this to be a continuing trend throughout the Trump presidency. "The truth is, it's likely we can look forward to this kind of 'volatility' from here on out," Robinson said on Dec. 15. But Robinson has one stock that provides high-growth, low-stress protection from President Trump's tweets. And there's a lot to like about this stock: Over the last 12 months, this stock has climbed 43%. In comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 23.73%. This company pays its shareholders a dividend of $0.62 per share, which is a yield of 1.56%. The stock price has a one-year price target of $181.86, which is a potential profit of over 13% from where it's trading today. This stock has an average rating of "Buy," according to FactSet. "I can't imagine any mere 140 characters are going to ding it," Robinson said. But he also said it's only a matter of time before Wall Street and everyone else starts to notice this stock. Fortunately for Money Morning readers, you'll be getting ahead of the crowd on owning this top Trump-proof stock. Here's everything you need to know about the stock Robinson said will provide "stress-free upside potential." Own One of the Top Trump-Proof Stocks Now Join the conversation.

Parrikar, in his inaugural address, invited aerospace firms to make their products in India, which had opened up the defence sector for foreign direct investment, partnerships, collaborations and joint ventures. "We have an ecosystem for defence manufacturing, with ease of doing business for global firms, a liberalised investment policy and norms to set up production units, joint ventures and research facilities across the country," he said as he inaugurated the 11th edition of the five-day biennial expo here. Asked if new US President Donald Trump's 'America First' may have any affect on the 'Make in India' and stop US firms from participating in the programme, Parrikar said it was not his concern. "You should have put this question to Boeing, they are there at the exhibition... Boeing, Lockheed Martin, etc. "What I will say is what I want... I want you to Make in India. If someone wants to shift production to some other place, it is his choice. I am not concerned," Parrikar said at a press conference on the sidelines of "Aero India 2017". This edition of Aero India, for the first time, combined the defence and civil aviation segments into a holistic event with the co-involvement of the Defence and Civil Aviation Ministries in the event. Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajpathi Raju was also present at the inaugural event. Raju, speaking at the occasion, highlighted that India was the fastest growing aviation sector in passenger terms in the world and held tremendous potential to graduate from the present position of being ninth in the world to being the third largest by 2022. Among the highlights on the opening day was handing over of the Indigenous Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&C) christened 'Netra' to the Indian Air Force, making India the fourth nation to have developed the technology on its own, after US, Russia and Israel. Parrikar also unveiled the full scale mock-up of Indian Multi-Role Helicopter (IMRH) at Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) Pavilion. A colourful flypast showcased India's increasing capability in manufacturing aircraft, with first ever public display of Light Utility Helicopter LUH. The Light Combat Helicopter (LCH) meanwhile left the spectators enthralled, with its manoeuvres, taking a steep rise, and even flying backwards. India is one of the few countries to have developed a combat helicopter. The air Show witnessed a fly past by the Make in India formation consisting of HTT-40, Hawk-i, Dornier-228, Su-30MKI and the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft. This was followed by the fighters tearing through the skies displaying a host of aerobatic manoeuvres - the Su 30 MKIA followed by Sweden's SAAB Gripen, Tejas LCA, the American F-16 Falcon and the French Rafale. The Yakovlev aerobatic team, the Skycats, the Surya Kiran Aerobatics Team and the Sarang helicopter display team also presented a scintillating performance. --IANS ao/vd/dg (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

According to Bloomberg   subcontractor Harris forced another delay in the delivery of the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites until later this month, and the Air Force is rather hacked off. Major General Roger Teague, the Air Force’s chief of space programs said that the cock up will mean that the $528 million satellite 34 months late. Lockheed has a contract to build the first 10 of the satellites designed to provide a more accurate version of the Global Positioning System.  Now the Air Force is wondering if it should award the contract for the rest of the system to Boeing and Northrop Grumman. Teague said that the incident was avoidable and raised significant concerns with Lockheed Martin subcontractor management/oversight and Harris programme management. Ceramic capacitors which take higher-voltage power from the satellite’s power system and reduce it to a voltage required for a particular subsystem have been a headache for the project. Last year, the Air Force and contractors discovered that Harris hadn’t conducted tests on the components, including how long they would operate without failing, that should have been completed in 2010. Harris spent June to October of last year doing follow-up testing on the wrong parts instead of samples of the suspect capacitors installed on the first three satellites. Harris “immediately notified Lockheed and the government” after a post-test inspection, Teague said in his message. “The capacitors met all mission qualification requirements,” he said, so “we are confident the capacitors are mission-ready”. But Teague said in an interview that Harris was required to perform not only a test to show that the part met design specifications but a separate one to assess the component’s reliability and whether it met a requirement to last 15 years. That second test wasn’t accomplished because “they used the wrong test item,” he said. The Air Force has decided to accept the first satellite even if its capacitors may be flawed because removing them could delay the delivery until October and cost about $70 million, The Air Force must pay $100 million to replace the suspect capacitors on the second and third satellites. That’s because the satellites are being developed under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, which require the Pentagon to pay for cost increases, the service said.

BENGALURU:  Foreign aircraft manufacturers offering to make combat jets in India will have to win approval from their governments, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said, in a measure aimed at ensuring projects are not affected due to policy flip-flops. These comments come at a time when US firm Lockheed Martin has said the new administration under President Donald Trump may want to take a "fresh look" at its proposal to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India. The former US government led by Barack Obama had supported the plan. There are concerns that a veto on making the F-16 in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for US firms such as Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. Mr Parrikar's comments suggest the minister is keen US firms get a clear go-ahead from Trump, who has criticized companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and then sold their products back to the United States, before starting projects in India to avoid any hurdles down the road.   Indian Air Force Sarang helicopter flies during the inauguration of Aero India show. "If someone wants to shift their plant to India, or set up a new one, it is not an issue," Mr Parrikar told a news conference on the sidelines of Asia's biggest air show in Bengaluru aimed at showcasing Indian aerospace capabilities. He said India needs 800-1,000 helicopters and 300-400 combat planes. "But if these original equipment makers are proposing something (local production), they will have to get their government's approval. That is my requirement." The main condition for the contract to supply hundreds of fighter planes to India's air force is that it has to be made in India, in collaboration with a local partner, he added. Sweden's SAAB, which is offering to build in India with a local partner, demonstrated its Gripen jet at the air show, while Lockheed showed its F-16 plane. Lockheed has been talking to Trump's teams and the US Congress for several months on its proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman told Reuters in Washington last week. Lockheed's plan is to build the F-16 to equip the Indian Air Force, and not ship them back home. India under Prime Minister Narendra has embarked on a massive drive to build locally and end the country's status as one of the world's biggest arms importers. Analysts expect the country to spend $250 billion on defence modernization over the next decade. © Thomson Reuters 2017 Trending Gadgets: Read Google CEO Pichai's Reply to 7-Year-Old Girl's Job Application Sports: Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag to Attend India's Maiden Sports Lit Fest Offbeat: Viral: IIT-Roorkee Students Dancing To Ed Sheeran Is All Kinds Of Awesome Related India Revives Project To Build Passenger Plane At Home Mike Pence's Mission In Europe: Clarify Trump's Foreign Policy Vision Kashmiris Helping Terrorists Are 'Anti-Nationals', Says Army Chief On Valentine's Day, PM Narendra Modi Decides To Help Married Officers Work At One Place Army Major Dies In Encounter In Kashmir's Handwara; 3 Terrorists Gunned Down Share this story on ALSO READJailed Sasikala Wins, Proxy E Palaniswami To Take Oath This Evening Defence Minister Manohar ParrikarF-16 jetsUS firm Lockheed Martinpresident donald trumpPrime Minister NarendraIndian air forceGripen jetUS Congress ................................

A United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas 5 rocket successfully launched with military payload AFSPC-5 from Cape Canaveral Wednesday. Paul BrinkmannContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel If you hear sonic booms in Central Florida this week, it could be the military’s secret, robotic, X-37B space plane coming in for a landing at Kennedy Space Center. NASASpaceflight.com reported the possible landing by the unmanned, experimental space plane, citing notices about clearing the air space around the center. However, SpaceFlightNow.com later on Tuesday posted a statement from the Air Force that no imminent landing of the craft was planned. The space plane has spent two years in orbit in a program run by Boeing. It launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in 2015 on top of a ULA Atlas V rocket . Prior landings of the space plane happened at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, which remains available as a landing site. The last time a space plane, or shuttle, landed at KSC was the shuttle Atlantis in July 2011. SpaceX launch from 39A to be historic first » Besides the landing, the Space Coast is now focused on its next big launch, also a historic first at KSC: SpaceX has targeted Saturday morning as its next possible launch window, from Launch Complex 39A, which hosted the Apollo 11 mission and hasn’t been used since the last shuttle launch in 2011. The mission will likely be closely watched, as space enthusiasts and historians anticipate a return to the pad that has seen some famous flights in space travel history.

Speaking specifically about the US firms offering aircraft for the single-engine fighter sought by the Indian Air Force (IAF), he said: "I do not think they would have made the offers if they didn't have clearances to give us what we need. That is their problem even if there are issues although I've not heard of any. And, so far as India is concerned, we are very clear about buying from a strategic partner. We don't want to just buy the aircraft." He was answering a specific question about US President Donald Trump being critical of American firms setting up manufacturing units outside of the US. The Lockheed Martin, which makes the F-16 and Boeing, which makes the F/A 18 Super Hornet have both offered to move their units to India. "I think any further questions on this matter needs to be asked to the companies," Parrikar said. LCA-Navy has full support Further, notwithstanding the Indian Navy's rejection of the LCA-Navy, Parrikar allayed fears of the project being shut down. "The Navy is thoroughly supporting the project. In fact, the second line of the LCA production, which has been approved at a cost of Rs 1,359 crore will have Navy's contribution too." The Navy will be contributing 25% of the cost, while the IAF will be contributing another 25% and HAL will put in the other 50%, as TOI had reported earlier. Presently HAL can make eight aircraft a year and this line, once functional will be able to make eight more per year. However, this line will become the third line for LCA with HAL already having converted its old Kiran hangar to expedite production given the demand. The clearance for the line Parrikar spoke about got the clearance of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) only last week. "It is wrong to say the Navy does not support the LCA ...You are being misinformed by an internal lobby," he said. Conceding that the fifth-generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) India is developing with Russia has some unresolved issues, Parrikar said: "A small team has been created to deal with these issues (pertaining to manufacturing, how the exports will be done, other approvals and so on) and we are confident of resolving them."

"We want Air India to survive," Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said at the CNN Asia Business Forum in Bangalore on Monday. "We don't mind where it is, who runs it, as long as it serves the Indian people and our Indian skies." The state-owned airline has been plagued by inefficiency and enormous losses for years. It received a $4.5 billion bailout from the government in 2012. "I can't commit the taxpayers' money for eternity to keep it going," Raju said. "Whether it's owned by government, owned by [someone else], we'd like it to survive." Related: Boeing snags $11 billion order from India's SpiceJet Air travel in India is growing at a furious rate. The country is forecast to overtake the U.K. as the world's third largest aviation market within the next decade. The airline business in India is also highly competitive. Air India is up against private domestic carriers and Middle Eastern airlines like Etihad and Emirates that have aggressively expanded into the country in recent years. "Left to itself, Air India is likely to get grounded," Raju added. "Something has to be done about it, the sooner the better." But he didn't provide any details or timetable for tackling Air India's difficulties. This isn't the first time the privatization of the airline has been suggested. Raju's predecessor, Ajit Singh, hinted at it in 2013, but the idea was slammed by opposition parties. One of those opposition parties, the BJP, is now in government. The question is whether it would have the political will to push through such a challenging privatization.

Home Market US, world’s biggest debt market, faces huge Trump test US, world’s biggest debt market, faces huge Trump test President Donald Trump is a man obsessed by imports, and untroubled by exports. By: Bloomberg | Published: February 14, 2017 2:40 PM Much more rarely has he talked about selling those homegrown offerings — be they Ford Explorers or Boeing 747s — to the rest of the world. (Reuters) President Donald Trump is a man obsessed by imports, and untroubled by exports. Since he first hit the campaign trail, Trump has been squarely focused on boosting domestic production by limiting cheap imports from places like China and Mexico and replacing them with homegrown offerings. Much more rarely has he talked about selling those homegrown offerings — be they Ford Explorers or Boeing 747s — to the rest of the world. It’s a curious state of affairs, like encouraging people to cook by banning restaurants. Disconcertingly, Trump’s brand of import substitution is now playing out in the world’s biggest debt market. Debt is, without a doubt, the U.S.’s biggest export. The U.S. Treasury market is not just worth trillions ($13.9 trillion, to be exact), but also represents the “risk-free” rate against which other financial assets are judged, if not fully pegged. To overstate its importance is difficult: It is huge, big-league — one of the few markets to which Trump’s brand of hyperbole might actually apply. And yet U.S. Treasuries have been finding far fewer foreign buyers in recent months — a trend that has so far been offset by higher domestic demand. U.S. investors have been buying longer-term government debt at a record pace since June, while recent data shows Japanese buyers, the biggest owners of U.S. Treasuries, have reduced their holdings for two consecutive months. Demand for U.S. Treasuries has moved “from global to local,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch rates strategists Carol Zhang and Shyam Rajan wrote in a note to clients last week, calling the shift “the biggest macro theme” playing out in markets. Watch This Also: That might be music to the ears of market mercantilists, but it comes at a cost. Adversaries of import substitution have long argued that the strategy boosts short-term growth at the expense of longer-term health. It flies in the face of comparative advantage — a central tenet of classical economic theory — and precludes economies from enjoying all of the benefits that come with specialization, including lower prices. A similar dynamic applies to the transformation of the U.S. Treasury market. While a pickup in domestic demand can initially help offset selling by foreign investors — such as the People’s Bank of China attempting to stabilize the yuan or Saudi Arabia reducing reserves to deal with lower oil prices — it may well leave the market more fragile over the longer term. U.S. pension funds, banks and insurance companies can opt to “Buy American” with Treasuries, but there are limits and there are risks. Those risks became painfully clear during the eurozone debt crisis, when troubled European Union members used central bank liquidity facilities to buy their own debt after foreign buyers went on strike. The move helped them weather the worst of the crisis, but it also became a pressure point as investors fretted over a “feedback loop” of codependency and negative sentiment between banks and bonds. That feedback loop idea has most recently been revived by Paul Schmelzing, a doctoral candidate at Harvard and a visiting researcher at the Bank of England, who has warned that a sharp sell-off in bonds could be worsened as investors are forced to offload their holdings as they lose value. Certainly, American investors are buying U.S. Treasuries at a tricky time; rumors of the death of the 30-year bull run in bonds have been much exaggerated, but they are gaining steam. The fact that investors have been buying longer-maturity bonds exposes them to significant duration risk, meaning they’re more exposed to changes in interest rates at a time when the Federal Reserve is expected to raise. Perhaps more relevant to Trump’s ambitions are the self-apparent limits that a domestically funded budget will put on his growth plans. The president wants to boost fiscal stimulus while cutting taxes — a plan that will only work as long as the U.S. is able to issue and sell its debt. Few think that foreigners will stop purchasing U.S. debt altogether, but the loss of a significant pool of players will by definition place a cap on the market.

Aero India is considered the largest airshow in Asia and will span over four days from 14 Feb to 18 Feb. Over 540 companies from aerospace and defence sector will be joining the Air Show. The companies that will join the air show include Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Airbus among others. The Air Show will see defence officials from Government of India in addition to other high ranking officials from 30 nations around the world. The air show in Aero India 2017 is not the only event as the four day event listing includes a Global CEOs conclave on Aerospace and Defence manufacturing opportunities in Andhra Pradesh under ‘Make in India’. One of the major goals of this edition is to promote ‘Make in India’ initiative for defence manufacturing. Defence Ministry will start the conclave with the welcome address along with address by P Ashok Gajapathi Raju, the Minister for Civil Aviation and Manohar Parrikar, Minister of Defence. One thing to note is that participating in this event is not an easy affair for foreign companies, as they to have to shell out anywhere from Rs 42,000 to Rs 54,000 per square meter of space with Indian companies shelling anywhere from Rs 32,603 to Rs 41,918 for the same amount of space. This is not limited to the use of space but extends to private terraces for the companies with better view of the airfield and sky as reported by Hindustan Times. The event is critical for countries as well as defence contractors as the top government officials and dignitaries are always on a lookout for better partnerships and deals for military or even civil aviation equipment for their country. According to the small amount of details, Rafale, Gripen, F-16 and other home-made light combat aircrafts will hog the skylines as always. Defence ministry has expected that the crowd can reach more than two lakh when looking only at business visitors that are attending the airshow.

The idea of creating a commercial military aviation exhibition in India dates back to the early 1990s, when private businesses were admitted into the military industry. Many private companies were willing and able to engage in military research and production. In 1992, a decision was made to hold an exhibition at the Yelahanka airbase outside Bengaluru, which is India's high-tech capital, similar to Silicon Valley in the United States. The first exhibition, originally called Avia IndiA, took place at Yelahanka in 1993 with the support of the Indian Air Force. It was a significant event for India's aviation industry, and it was decided to hold this exhibition at Yelahanka once in every two years. The next exhibition was scheduled for 1995, but was later canceled for security reasons and due to a lack of proper training. In 1996, Yelahanka hosted the first exhibition officially named Aero India, which set the format for all subsequent exhibitions in Bengaluru. The first foreign participants came to the exhibition in 1996, with Russia and the United States presenting static and flying exhibits. Since then, the air show has gained popularity not only in India, but all over the world. Thousands of tourists witnessed the air show in Bengaluru, which made it popular among non-specialists as well. The exhibition held in 1998 already had all the trappings and features of a major international air show. It was attended by over 170 companies from 17 countries, including Boeing, Allied Signal, Bell Textron, Airbus Industries, Aerospatiale, Dassault and British Aerospace. Russia and France had the largest foreign presence. The next exhibition, which was held only in 2001, was attended by 150 companies from 18 countries. Other 37 countries sent representative delegations. The air show was attended by 49 Russian companies. The Russian Su-30MKI multipurpose fighter was the key attraction of the show. The Russian MiG Corporation for the first time presented the carrier-based fighter MiG-29K, which participated in demonstration flights. Russia's state arms exporter Rosoboronexport signed a contract with India's Defense Ministry to supply the Indian Navy with five Ka-31 helicopters. Since then, the international aerospace exhibition Aero India has been held regularly every two years, in odd-number years. It usually takes place in mid-February when the weather is fair in southern India. The Aero India air show is constantly expanding to include more participants and visitors every year. In 2003, foreign participants had 174 stands, while in 2005, they had 236. The number of participating Indian companies also grew from 74 in 2003 to 136 in 2005. In 2007, Aero India was attended by over 400 companies, including major manufacturers and suppliers of military and civilian aircraft and aerospace equipment from 15 countries. The Russian delegation included about 40 companies. The exhibition featured about 100 aircraft models, including the Russian MiG-35 and MiG-29 OVT, the Be-200 amphibious aircraft, the Mi-17 helicopter and the Sukhoi Superjet 100 planes. The air show that year was marred by one of the Sarang aerobatic team helicopters of the Indian Air Force crashing just before the opening of the exhibition. Its crew was practicing a maneuver called The Scissors, but miscalculated the altitude and hit the ground. The test pilot died and the wing commander was seriously injured. About 100 civilian and military aircraft and around 600 companies participated in Aero India 2009. The highlight of the Russian presentations was the MiG-35, which demonstrated miracles of aerobatics in the air. In addition, Indian citizens were offered the opportunity to take a flight in the Russian fighter. Rosoboronexport also presented the capabilities of the Be-200 aircraft to the Indian military. © AFP 2016/ Manjunath KIRAN China’s Air Warfare Wing to Debut at 11th Edition of Aero India 2017 In 2011, 675 companies from 29 countries brought their latest aerospace designs to the show. The area of the show has grown by 70 percent to a total of 75,000 square meters (over 800,000 square feet), up from 44,000 square meters in 2009. The number of exhibitors has also increased by 16 percent. The exhibition was attended by more than 250,000 visitors. At Aero India 2011, Russia presented over 271 military products, including airplanes, helicopters, air defense systems, aircraft engines and radars. A total of 35 Russian companies took part in the exhibition, including Rosoboronexport, Sukhoi R&D Bureau, MiG, Ilyushin Aviation Complex, Almaz-Antey, Irkut Corporation, Russian Helicopters and Kamov. The Superjet 100 passenger airliner did a demo flight in Bengaluru. Aero India 2013 was attended by 570 companies (274 foreign and 296 Indian) from 29 countries. The grounds expanded to over 108,000 square meters. The most striking moment at Aero India 2013 was the return of civil aviation to the show. This time, almost 55 percent of the aircraft presented at the show were civil airliners. The Russian exposition covered an area of 857 square meters with 37 show participants, 18 of which represented military equipment. Aero India 2013 witnessed the Russkiye Vityazi (Russian Knights) aerobatic team's debut at the Aero India air show. A total of 644 companies (326 foreign and 318 Indian) took part in Aero India 2015 from 33 countries and 46 foreign delegations. Thirty Russian organizations presented military products. Along with the exhibition, one of the leading workshops in the aerospace industry always takes place before the air show in Bengaluru. It is conducted by the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) of India's Ministry of Defense in conjunction with the Aeronautical Society of India. The eleventh international aerospace exhibition Aero India 2017 will be held on February 14 – 18. Never miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...

Read More. @tracyalloway Feb 13, 2017 5:00 PM EST a | A By Tracy Alloway President Donald Trump is a man obsessed by imports, and untroubled by exports. Since he first hit the campaign trail, Trump has been squarely focused on boosting domestic production by limiting cheap imports from places like China and Mexico and replacing them with homegrown offerings. Much more rarely has he talked about selling those homegrown offerings -- be they Ford Explorers or Boeing 747s -- to the rest of the world. It’s a curious state of affairs, like encouraging people to cook by banning restaurants. Disconcertingly, Trump’s brand of import substitution is now playing out in the world’s biggest debt market. Debt is, without a doubt, the U.S.’s biggest export. The U.S. Treasury market is not just worth trillions ($13.9 trillion, to be exact), but also represents the “risk-free” rate against which other financial assets are judged, if not fully pegged. To overstate its importance is difficult: It is huge, big-league -- one of the few markets to which Trump’s brand of hyperbole might actually apply. And yet U.S. Treasuries have been finding far fewer foreign buyers in recent months -- a trend that has so far been offset by higher domestic demand. U.S. investors have been buying longer-term government debt at a record pace since June, while recent data shows Japanese buyers, the biggest owners of U.S. Treasuries, have reduced their holdings for two consecutive months. Demand for U.S. Treasuries has moved “from global to local,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch rates strategists Carol Zhang and Shyam Rajan wrote in a note to clients last week, calling the shift “the biggest macro theme” playing out in markets. That might be music to the ears of market mercantilists, but it comes at a cost. Adversaries of import substitution have long argued that the strategy boosts short-term growth at the expense of longer-term health. It flies in the face of comparative advantage -- a central tenet of classical economic theory -- and precludes economies from enjoying all of the benefits that come with specialization, including lower prices. A similar dynamic applies to the transformation of the U.S. Treasury market. While a pickup in domestic demand can initially help offset selling by foreign investors -- such as the People’s Bank of China attempting to stabilize the yuan or Saudi Arabia reducing reserves to deal with lower oil prices -- it may well leave the market more fragile over the longer term. U.S. pension funds, banks and insurance companies can opt to “Buy American” with Treasuries, but there are limits and there are risks. Those risks became painfully clear during the eurozone debt crisis, when troubled European Union members used central bank liquidity facilities to buy their own debt after foreign buyers went on strike. The move helped them weather the worst of the crisis, but it also became a pressure point as investors fretted over a “feedback loop” of codependency and negative sentiment between banks and bonds. That feedback loop idea has most recently been revived by Paul Schmelzing, a doctoral candidate at Harvard and a visiting researcher at the Bank of England, who has warned that a sharp sell-off in bonds could be worsened as investors are forced to offload their holdings as they lose value. Certainly, American investors are buying U.S. Treasuries at a tricky time; rumors of the death of the 30-year bull run in bonds have been much exaggerated, but they are gaining steam. The fact that investors have been buying longer-maturity bonds exposes them to significant duration risk, meaning they’re more exposed to changes in interest rates at a time when the Federal Reserve is expected to raise. Perhaps more relevant to Trump’s ambitions are the self-apparent limits that a domestically funded budget will put on his growth plans. The president wants to boost fiscal stimulus while cutting taxes -- a plan that will only work as long as the U.S. is able to issue and sell its debt. Few think that foreigners will stop purchasing U.S. debt altogether, but the loss of a significant pool of players will by definition place a cap on the market. Sad.

Bush. "Public-private partnerships are the future of space exploration," Dava Newman, a former NASA deputy administrator who resigned before Trump took office, told CNBC on Tuesday. "I call it the new NASA." In total, 22 companies — all American — have won contracts with the agency across a diverse range of sectors, from in-space manufacturing to engine development. Boeing and Elon Musk's SpaceX will be delivering NASA astronauts to international space stations, while Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada and SpaceX will transport NASA cargo to space stations, said Newman, who is now chair of the Apollo Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. NASA is a part of the U.S. government but remains independent while still receiving federal funds — a structure originally conceived by McKinsey & Co. In the 1950s, the management consultancy suggested the idea of a separate government office dedicated to space research. NASA | Getty Images In this handout provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), SpaceXs Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft lift off from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for their eighth official Commercial Resupply (CRS) mission on April 8, 2016 in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Other countries have also fixed their sights on the private sector. Last year, the Indian Space Research Organisation invited firms to build a full spacecraft as Prime Minister Narendra Modi looks to open up the country's satellite manufacturing industry, according to local news. One specific goal of NASA's public-private partnerships is putting humans on Mars by the 2030s, a journey that's already underway. A robotic rover that's been exploring Mars since 2012 has helped confirm evidence that water once flowed on the red planet, suggesting the existence of streams and lakes billions of years ago. NASA intends to launch another rover in July 2020. President Barack Obama made no apologies for curbing the agency's exploration ambitions, and it's not yet clear how NASA will be impacted under Trump, who has said little on space exploration. Some strategists believe the real estate billionaire will be keen to push property development on the moon, a scenario that Newman believes will spark excitement "in the next decade." — Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook. show chapters NASA taps private sector to fund Mars exploration    Tuesday, 14 Feb 2017 | 7:02 AM ET | 00:35 Correction: This story was revised to correct that the commercial space exploration program began under President George W.

Korea missile was posted on Facebook by Mar-a-Lago guests. Sean Gallagher - Feb 13, 2017 10:45 pm UTC Enlarge Screengrab via YouTube reader comments 440 Share this story This weekend, as news of a ballistic missile launch by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) reached President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, President Trump got on his phone, and Abe consulted with staff. This didn't happen behind closed doors, however; it took place as members of Trump's Mar-A-Lago Club watched on in the resort's dining room. One club member even posed for photos with Trump's aide-de-camp—the Air Force major carrying the president's "nuclear football"—and posted pics of the scrum around Trump's table on Facebook. Trump is comfortable conducting business over a meal. Last month, Trump approved a raid by US Navy SEALs in Yemen on an Al Qaeda compound not after a briefing in the White House situation room but rather over dinner with senior officials. These and other details of how the new president and his administration operate suggest that despite hitting Hillary Clinton hard for her security foibles, the Trump White House is not big on operational security (opsec). President Trump may not be making phone calls on his old, vulnerable Android device, but he keeps it close at hand. He regularly posts to Twitter from his Samsung phone based on his Twitter metadata. And we know he's using an unsecured Android device because the secure one he's been issued wouldn’t even allow Twitter to be installed. That mobile device is a highly modified Android-based phone from the Defense Information Systems Agency's DOD Mobile Classified Capability (DMCC) program. Trump was given a phone issued to President Barack Obama to replace his "Obamaberry"—a prototype from the DMCC's Top Secret-level product development. Unlike the Secret-classified device already being issued more widely by DISA—a customized Samsung phone—the presidential droid is apparently based on the Boeing Black, according to Defense One's Patrick Tucker. Only a few of the phones were issued by DISA. President Obama got one, and NSA/ US Cyber Command chief Admiral Michael Rogers got one as well. But the presidential Black connects exclusively to a secured, dedicated virtual network for voice and data calls, and it runs a very limited number of applications—all of them communication-focused. It can't even make direct outgoing calls; all calls would be routed through the White House Communications Agency's virtual switchboard. When President Obama made the first post to the @POTUS account in May of 2015, the New York Times reported that he borrowed a staff member's iPhone. So in order to post his Twitter missives, Trump has to either have someone else do it for him or carry his unsecured Android device with him—which he apparently does constantly based on his Twitter metadata. It's not even clear that Trump carries anything but his own Android device when he's at his Mar-A-Lago home. Enlarge / In this photo taken by Mar-A-Lago Club member Richard DeAgazio (which he posted to Facebook), President Trump is on the phone discussing the North Korean missile launch on Saturday, February 11. Most senior executives, including the president, typically have secure compartmented information facilities (SCIFs) installed in their residences. President Obama traveled with a portable SCIF—a tent designed for taking secure calls. Such setups include white noise generators and Faraday-cage walls that contain electromagnetic radiation from communications devices. It’s not known if Trump has one of these tents set up in his Mar-A-Lago home. But he took the call about the North Korean ballistic missile launch on an open terrace, surrounded by club members. While that's a sort of white noise generator on its own, this setup is not exactly the kind the White House security team would prefer. It would have been the job of the White House's chief information security officer to try to get President Trump to comply with proper operational security practices. But Cory Louie, who was appointed to that position by President Obama in 2015, was apparently pushed out earlier this month. The overall federal CISO, Greg Touhill, resigned in January. Since they were both Obama appointees, the exits are not out of the ordinary—but no one has been selected to fill their positions. Additionally, there's been no announced candidate for the role of federal chief information officer—a job Trump may choose not to continue. Aside from the standard information security concerns, however, there are other major worries about the Trump administration's security profile. Former NSA analyst and Observer columnist John Schindler reported recently that a Pentagon official said, "Since January 20, we’ve assumed that the Kremlin has ears inside the [White House Situation Room]." Schindler suggested that intelligence officials may be holding back sensitive information from the White House because of concerns that the White House—and National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in particular—have perhaps too much of a cozy relationship with the Russian government. And if that's the case, then taking a sensitive call on an open terrace surrounded by the public may be the least of the Trump administration's opsec concerns.

The Governors' Wind & Solar Energy Coalition is seeking increased federal funding to modernize local power grids and boost clean energy research, according to a letter submitted to the White House Monday. The group is also calling for legislation to promote offshore wind farms and efforts to streamline the permitting process for wind and solar projects. The message is the latest indication that Trump's criticism of renewable energy puts him at odds with much of corporate America and members of his own party. Since he was elected, Republican governors in Ohio, Illinois and Michigan signed legislation backing wind and solar. Last month, more than 600 U.S. companies issued a statement urging Trump not to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, saying it will generate trillions of dollars in investments. PHARMACEUTICALS Lawmakers are questioning price of drug Marathon Pharmaceuticals' pricing of a drug to treat genetic muscle deterioration in about 15,000 Americans, mostly boys, is raising concerns in Congress where lawmakers repeatedly have challenged drug companies. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., complained on Monday that Marathon Pharmaceuticals plans to charge $89,000 a year for a drug that is widely available abroad for about $1,000 a year. The two lawmakers said they believe Marathon is abusing a program that grants companies seven years of market exclusivity to encourage research into new treatments for rare diseases. They said the program was not intended to provide companies lucrative exclusivity rights for drugs that have been available for decades. "We urge you to significantly lower your price for this drug before it goes on the market next month," the lawmakers wrote. RETAIL Sears, Kmart drop some Trump products Sears and Kmart have evicted "a very small number" of Trump-branded items from their online stores, but won't specify how many and emphasize that hundreds of products are still available through their third-party online marketplaces. It's another sign of how companies are trying to tread a careful line, after President Donald Trump rebuked Nordstrom publicly on his Twitter account for deciding to stop selling his daughter Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories line. A social media campaign called "Grab Your Wallet" has urged a boycott of stores that stock Ivanka Trump or Donald Trump products, which also include Amazon and Dillard's. AVIATION Boeing workers rally ahead of union vote Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers gathered Monday to hear from union leaders why they should vote to organize in a state where union membership is the lowest in the country. Workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for an hour rallied at a hotel just a mile from Boeing's North Charleston operation where, on Wednesday, nearly 3,000 workers are set to vote on whether to form a union and be represented by the Machinists. Organizers, community leaders and members of other unions voiced messages of support to the few hundred workers gathered in a large conference room. Boeing employs a total of about 8,000 workers in North Charleston, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner. Communication Verizon returns to the unlimited data game Verizon, a longtime holdout, has joined other carriers in offering an unlimited data plan. AT&T only lets customers sign up for unlimited plans when they also subscribe to DirecTV, which AT&T owns. But its prices are similar to Verizon's for a family; Verizon is cheaper for an individual.As recently as January, the company's CFO said unlimited plans were "not something we feel the need to do" even though rivals had made inroads against Verizon by offering them. It has been trying to push longtime customers off its old unlimited plans, which it killed in 2012, with rate hikes.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Disappointment: Trump rumored to be preparing to resurrect the Ex-Im Bank posted at 9:21 am on February 13, 2017 by Jazz Shaw Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES I probably should have held on to a bit more of my innate cynicism following the swearing-in of the 45th president. Coming from a business background as he does, plenty of conservatives were rightly nervous about some of the potential big government tendencies which Donald Trump might exhibit upon taking office. If the latest rumors are true, some of those fears may be coming to fruition in the next few weeks. After a long and ultimately successful battle by conservatives, the Export-Import Bank was essentially placed on life support last year. The institution still exists, but lacking a sufficient number of members to achieve a quorum it has been powerless to do much of anything of late. All that may be about to change. The word on the hill is that Donald Trump has been listening to some voices among the Democrats and has been “convinced” that the bank should resume operations. (Government Executive) Long criticized by Republicans as an agency dispensing “corporate welfare,” the Export-Import Bank on Thursday got some good news after two senators reported that President Trump is abandoning his campaign-trail position that the bank must die. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., announced that Trump “agreed with her on the need to get the Export-Import Bank up and running and said he will soon nominate someone to serve on the Export-Import Bank Board.” The five-member board has been below quorum for a year because former Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., had blocked consideration of all of President Obama’s nominees to the bank. You may recall that on the campaign trail Donald Trump stated unequivocally that he was an opponent of the bank’s continued operation. And that wasn’t just a campaign promise made to win votes. As recently as December he was still saying that the banks days were probably numbered. So why the change now? As you might have been able to guess, Boeing likely played a large part in the decision. Current reports indicate that Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp was whispering in Trump’s ear but he was also in talks with executives from Boeing. As we’ve long known, the airline giant is one of the largest beneficiaries of the bank’s peculiar form of corporate welfare. Coming from a big business background and being used to making deals of this magnitude, we probably shouldn’t be terribly surprised if Boeing found someone able to speak a common language with the president and convince him that the art of the deal should go their way this time. While perhaps not the end of the world this is still seriously disappointing. But at the same time, let’s be honest here. Nobody in conservative circles was 100% convinced that a run for the presidency was suddenly going to take one of the most successful capitalists in the country and completely convert him to the frequently difficult doctrine of fiscal conservatism. As I’ve said ever since he won the nomination, if Trump were to take office we would be getting a significantly better deal than anything we could’ve expected from Hillary Clinton. But at the same time, there were going to be disappointments. The most we can do now is try to cheer on the president when he brings some victories across the finish line and hope that Congress will rein him in when he wanders astray in this fashion. In this case it wouldn’t take much. We managed to block Obama’s nominees to the Ex-Im board and the same could be done to Trump. It would be politically embarrassing, but the White House is no stranger to that feeling at this point.

On Sunday, SpaceX, an aerospace company based in Hawthorne, Calif. that rents the historic Launch Complex 39A from NASA, tested the engines of its Falcon 9 rocket there in preparation to deliver supplies and science experiments to the International Space Station (ISS) on February 18. This will be the company’s 10th cargo trip to the ISS under its contract with NASA, according to Space.com, and its first launch from 39A in Florida. “Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A,” SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk posted on Instagram Sunday, alongside a photo of the rocket. “This is the same launch pad used by the Saturn V rocket that first took people to the moon in 1969. We are honored to be allowed to use it,” Mr. Musk wrote. SpaceX signed a 20-year lease to take over the pad in 2014 and has spent the ensuing years fixing it up. NASA stopped using the launch pad in 2011, when its 30-year-old space shuttle program was shut down after Atlantis, one of five NASA space shuttles of that era, blasted off from 39A toward the ISS in the last-ever US shuttle mission. Throughout the decades-long shuttle program, NASA’s spacecraft – Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour – carried people into orbit, launched and maintained satellites, and made it possible for humans to build the space station. The 18-year-old international science laboratory orbits 240 miles above Earth. Infographic Space Race, The Sequel: Who is exploring the cosmos today? And starting Saturday, SpaceX will use the site to launch cargo in the Dragon capsule aboard its Falcon 9 rocket. The company hopes to use the Florida launch pad to send humans to the ISS in about a year. “That is a big deal. It’s absolutely symbolic we are launching from there,” former NASA launch director Bob Sieck told the Orlando Sentinel on February 8. Since shutting down its space shuttle program, NASA has relied on the Russian space fleet and, increasingly, on the private space industry to step in to fill the void in space exploration and to make it more affordable. In addition to SpaceX, NASA has contracted with Orbital ATK, an aerospace and defense contractor based in Dulles, Va., and with Colorado-based aerospace company Sierra Nevada Corporation, to deliver cargo to the ISS for years to come. The agency also is relying on SpaceX and Boeing to start delivering astronauts to space as soon as possible, though both companies are facing technical delays. SpaceX, following a rocket explosion in September, has pushed back human flight to the ISS from this year to 2018. Boeing has, too. Though the delays are necessary to ensure astronaut safety, they put pressure on NASA because of the high cost of sending astronauts to the space station. The agency pays $82 million to the Russian space agency for each seat it reserves aboard Russia’s Soyuz rocket, the only one capable of ferrying people to space for now. According to recent estimates by NASA, seats aboard SpaceX and Boeing rockets could cost a comparatively cheap $58 million each. "Given the delays in initiating a US capacity to transport crew to the ISS, NASA has extended its contract with the Russian Space Agency for astronaut transportation through 2018 at an additional cost of $490 million,” wrote NASA's Office of Inspector General in a September audit. “If the Commercial Crew Program experiences additional delays, NASA may need to buy additional seats from Russia to ensure a continued US presence on the ISS.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

In fact, it’s been there for the past 28 years. The Kenya Airways plane, a Boeing 707-315B has been collecting rust in Ethiopia but for a justifiable reason. This is a photo of the plane. Image: John Kamau/Twitter According to a report on the Aviation Safety net database platform, the plane is damaged beyond repair hence it’s irredeemable. What really happened? Almost three decades ago, the plane was forced to return to Addis Ababa shortly after take-off because its landing gear failed to retract. The brakes of the plane then malfunctioned after touchdown causing the Boeing to skid past the wet runway. The plane had a total of 66 passengers at the time but fortunately, no one was injured. I can guess what lives in there right now. Meanwhile, would you return Kes. 1 million if found lost? This Ethiopian Airline cabin crew did! 0 I like this post 4 Shares SHARE TWEET EMAIL Comments Related Stories These Lovely Photos Of Ex-President Mahama Chilling In Kenya Will Give You Vacation Goals Surprise!!!
