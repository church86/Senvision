PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French Iran says plane deliveries still pending talks Sun Oct 16, 2016 7:3PM Home Iran Economy Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi says Iran Air is negotiating with Airbus and Boeing to resolve the technical issues that are hindering the delivery of planes purchased from the two global aviation giants. Iran says technical issues are to blame for the delay in receiving the airplanes it has purchased from global aviation giants Airbus and Boeing.  Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Abbas Araqchi said what was previously obstructing the delivery of the planes were the related authorizations by the US Treasury Department which were issued last month.  “The delivery of the planes now depends on the finalization of negotiations between Iran Air from one side and Airbus and Boeing from another,” Araqchi told Iran’s ISNA news agency. He emphasized that negotiations on plane purchases are complicated and comprise many technical and legal issues.  The official added that Iran Air hopes to receive the first planes it has purchased in the near future.  On 21 September, Airbus said it had obtained an initial license from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for the early delivery of 17 A320 or A330 jets to Iran. This will be part of a deal worth above $10 billion that was signed in January for the delivery of above 100 planes to the Islamic Republic.  The announcement by Airbus was immediately followed by a similar move by Boeing which said OFAC had given the authorization for the company to proceed with a deal it had signed with Iran in June to sell 80 planes to the country.  The company is also expected to lease 29 other planes to the Islamic Republic under the same deal which is estimated to be worth $25 billion.  Officials in Tehran have already announced that Iran needs to purchase between 400 and 500 commercial airliners over the next decade to rejuvenate its ageing aviation fleet.  The country’s current aviation fleet is comprised of around 140 planes with an average age of around 20 years, with many in desperate need of replacement.

Matein Khalid Market View Filed on October 16, 2016 | Last updated on October 16, 2016 at 09.11 pm Share More > Vote he Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and tighten liquidity in the bank aircraft finance market. (AFP) China's 25 year lows in economic growth and Brexit have all hit cross border tourism Commercial aerospace is no longer the valuation darling of Wall Street - with good reason. Oil prices have risen 65 per cent from their February lows. The Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and tighten liquidity in the bank aircraft finance market. The surge in King Dollar has dampened passenger air traffic growth. The AirAsia crash has hit budget travel in Southeast Asia. Civil wars in the Arab world, Russian military interventions in Syria and Ukraine, the Turkish coup attempt, China's 25 year lows in economic growth and Brexit have all hit cross border tourism. The IMF has slashed global growth forecasts to 2.5 per cent from 3.2 per cent. Airlines have begun to defer orders for wide bodied planes. The aerospace sector has been derated on Wall Street as storm clouds darken its macroeconomic and earnings growth outlook. Honeywell's recent 10 per cent share plunge is a dark omen. Boeing at $133 is overvalued if the commercial aircraft cycle has peaked, as I expect it has. Boeing Commercial Aircraft (BCA) faces its first cyclical downturn since the 2008-09 global recession. CEO Dennis Muilenburg warned the Street to expect "flattish" revenues in both commercial and defense in 2017. This means soft 777 orders will reduce the production run rate while 787 Dreamliner deliveries have been flat in the past year. Aggressive pricing on the 737 MAX will not help operating margins though I expect free cash flow growth per share can rise by at least 10 per cent in the next five years. The latest lewd Trump videos mean Hilary Clinton wins the White House on November 8. This means no aggressive ramp up in Pentagon military business or boost to Boeing's military aircraft businesses (e.g. F-15's, Apache helicopters, F-18's, Starlifter transport planes etc), almost 48 per cent of total revenue. Near term production pressures do not negate the strength of Boeing's 5700 order backlog, the scale of US/Europe replacement demand and the emerging market air travel growth potential. While US fiscal pressures will hit specific programmes, such as the C-17 closure, Boeing is one of the world's top military hardware vendors at a time when Washington confronts Russia in the Middle East and China in the Pacific Basin. I expect Boeing shares to trade in a 120-150 range in the next twelve months. Raytheon (RTN) is the world's preeminent supplier of air defence system (the Patriot missiles that confronted Saddam's Sands in the first Gulf War), air to air missiles, radars, sensors and communications equipment to the Pentagon, Nato and Uncle Sam allied air forces all over the world. After some botched acquisitions in the late 1990s, Raytheon has almost doubled its operating margins to 13 per cent in the past decade and has spent a staggering $5 billion in share buybacks since 2012. Raytheon shares were a fabulous winner on Wall Street, up 26 per cent in 2016. Apart from Lockheed, no other company in the world can match Raytheon's technology based global missiles sales momentum. However, after a stellar 2016, I would book profits in Raytheon at $140 a share. Honeywell blamed a weak aerospace cycle when it guided down its estimates to $6.60, the reason its shares tanked last Friday to $105 a share. The firm now trades at a valuation discount to its peers at 15 times earnings, I expect downside on the preannouncement and the industrial conglomerate's project execution woes. Honeywell's $15 billion aerospace business is a classic barometer of demands since it produces everything from cockpit "nose to tail" instruments to landing gear. I would stay short Honeywell for a $98 target. The resignation of Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf was inevitable after the sordid cross selling scandal has devastated the shares of the Californian megabank, once the most valuable bank on the planet. While optically attractive after their fall from 56 to 45, I am afraid to buy the shares because, unlike J.P. Morgan's London Whale or Goldman's Abacus scandal, the victims here are not institutions but millions of Mom and Pop all-American voters in an election year. Litigation risk will be a sword of Damocles on Wells Fargo shares. Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Markets What next for aerospace and defence shares?

About us Membership Contact us Mon November 14, 2016 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia Araqchi says aircraft deliveries dependent on talks with Airbus, Boeing Politics October 16, 2016 TEHRAN – Abbas Araqchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, said on Sunday that new aircraft deliveries to Iran depends on the ongoing talks between Iran Air and two airplane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing. The negotiations are underway and Iran has not reached an agreement with the two aircraft manufacturers, Araqchi said.  Following the implementation of the last year’s nuclear accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), between Iran and six world powers, Airbus and Boeing received permission, less than a month ago, from the U.S. government to sell aircraft to Iran. European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on September 21, followed by Boeing’s announcement later in the day. Describing the aircraft deals as detailed and complex, Araqchi said the Islamic Republic expects to receive the airplanes in the near future. The senior diplomat also said the United States must not allow any new nuclear sanctions or the old ones under new names to be imposed on Iran. “If Congress tries to impose new nuclear sanctions against Iran, the U.S. president is obligated under the JCPOA to veto the new sanctions,” he explained.  Republican lawmakers have been pushing to kill the nuclear deal.  Following Boeing’s announcement that it was concluding a major deal to sell Iran commercial aircraft, Congress introduced at least seven bills aimed at killing the deal. Three of the bills would prohibit the Treasury Department from issuing export licenses for the aircraft. However, the U.S. President Barack Obama has on numerous occasions threatened to veto any attempt by Congress to undermine the nuclear deal with Iran, saying that the historic accord was the best available option to prevent another war in the Middle East.

REUTERS/Jumana El Heloueh Reuters/Jumana El Heloueh Sunday, Oct 16, 2016 Abu Dhabi: Strata Manufacturing is expected to cross the Dh400 million mark in revenue for the second time in as many years, on the back of new orders from Boeing and Airbus, Badr Al Olama, chief executive officer of the Al Ain-based aeronautical manufacturer, told Gulf News in an interview. The company was awarded two Airbus contracts valued at more than $1 billion (Dh3.67 billion) and a multi-year contract with Boeing to manufacture vertical fins for the 787 at Farnborough air show in July. “Last year we had a revenue of Dh400 million and this year it would definitely be higher. We are aiming to reach Dh1 billion revenue by 2020. There is going to be significant growth in the coming years with the number of work packages we’ve been getting from both Boeing and Airbus,” he said. By contrast, revenue in 2011 was Dh61 million. Advertisement “The new contracts will bring in new capabilities to the company apart from increasing the revenue. The speed of work will go up exponentially — from taking 2-3 days for manufacturing a specific product to completing a significant large structure product every business day. This is something extremely challenging and rewarding at the same time for Strata.” During the year, Strata delivered over 433 shipsets, consisting of more than 7,511 parts — representing a 29 per cent growth in the total number of parts manufactured in 2014. With the government gearing up to host the Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit in Abu Dhabi next year, the presence of Strata with big orders from Boeing and Airbus is expected to boost the manufacturing sector that is contributing 14 per cent of the UAE’s GDP. Al Olama said the company has aspired from day one to become one of the top three global manufacturers for Boeing and Airbus. The new contracts signed at Farnborough will get them one step closer to that vision. “With respect to people, there will be a lot of development and up-skilling and training so that these individuals that we have in this facility today are going to be of at a level that you would expect to see in places like Toulouse or Seattle where Airbus or Boeing are located.” Al Olama said Strata values the relationship with Boeing and Airbus, and the company is delivering parts on time while meeting quality standards. The company is now considering opening new manufacturing new facilities in North Africa and the US as their two main customers are located nearby. No timeline has been given for the new factories. Al Olama says Strata also has plans to tie up with other aircraft manufacturers across the globe to serve the growing demands of the aviation industry. “Strata needs to build its value proposition further to become the supplier of choice for the aircraft manufacturers, therefore when the right time comes for Strata to expand geographically, we will be looking for future customers that are keen to work with us.” The company is looking at China, Canada, Brazil and Russia in particular. “China has its own platform with respect to a commercial aircraft, Brazil has Embraer, Canada has an important player with Bombardier and Russia has a joint venture with Italy on the Superjet. There are multiple platforms that are interesting and are promising for the global [aviation] industry.” The firm expects huge demand for low-cost carriers in the coming years, with the growth of the middle class population across the globe, especially in India and China. “There is a huge growth of low-cost carriers and the backlog is still there. As Airbus and Boeing fulfil the backlog there are more orders that are coming up. As long as people are travelling we are going to continue building parts.” Strata Manufacturing was established in 2010 and is wholly owned by Mubadala Development Company. The Al Ain-based company recently embarked on an expansion project to increase their shop floor area to 31,500 square metres, adding 10,000 square metre of usable production space.

And other tales of science fiction, emerging as science fact. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 15, 2016 at 10:13AM NASA's path to Mars -- and Boeing's -- looks anything but straightforward compared to SpaceX's. Image source: NASA. SpaceX wants to go to Mars -- by now, that's common knowledge. But did you know that Boeing (NYSE:BA) wants to go to Mars, too? And that it plans to get there before SpaceX? It's true. And now, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has thrown down the gauntlet before SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, declaring: "I'm convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket." High hopes Boeing's CEO made this declaration while speaking at The Atlantic's "What's Next?" tech conference in Chicago last week, and it came as a bit of a surprise -- mathematically speaking. You see, whereas SpaceX plans to send humans to Mars on its own, Boeing's intention is to provide the technology NASA needs to put U.S. astronauts on the Red Planet. Accordingly, Boeing's plan depends entirely on when NASA itself intends to go to Mars -- and last we heard, that wasn't likely to happen before 2033 (with arrival scheduled for 2034). Compare this to Elon Musk's plan for Mars: Earlier this year, at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Musk promised to put an unmanned Dragon 2 spaceship on Mars by 2018 -- then follow that up with a manned mission to Mars departing in 2024, and landing in 2025. 2034 minus 2025 equals SpaceX beating Boeing to Mars by nine years. And the first shall be last? Now, Boeing has been doing this "space thing" a whole lot longer than SpaceX has. It has an established reputation in the field, beginning with the Apollo missions and stretching to present day. At last report, Boeing and its United Launch Alliance partner Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) jointly hold the record for most consecutive rocket launches without mishap: 111 missions and counting. (In contrast, the last rocket SpaceX tried to send into orbit blew up before it was even ready to launch!) All of that said, SpaceX insists its rockets will be flying again soon, and perhaps as early as November. Unless Boeing and NASA move their timetable significantly forward, SpaceX could once again be on track to beat them. "He said, she said"... but they both say this Where does this leave us? SpaceX says it will get to Mars first; Boeing begs to differ. The truth remains to be seen. But here's one thing both companies agree on: Mars aside, there are some pretty exciting prospects for aerospace right here on Earth. You see, while Muilenburg's Mars proclamation got all of the headlines last week, what really caught my interest was his mention of other initiatives Boeing is working on. These range from efforts to promote space tourism to the development of "hypersonic aircraft" flying around Earth at speeds much faster than the norm today. Muilenburg touted the prospect of "supersonic, hypersonic travel, the ability to connect anywhere in the world in a couple hours," through vehicles similar to Boeing's WaveRider hypersonic vehicle (which has been clocked at Mach 5.1). Boeing's ULA partner, Lockheed Martin, meanwhile, is developing a "Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle" that it says could one day fly passengers from New York to Los Angeles in 12 minutes, at speeds up to Mach 20. This idea jibes with something Elon Musk mentioned as a potential new field of business for SpaceX: point-to-point transport of passengers and cargo via spacecraft. NYC to London -- in 10 minutes flat After listing the businesses SpaceX is already using in order to raise capital for its Mars mission, Musk observed that, in theory at least, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets could be used not only to loft satellites into space (and keep them there), but, now that SpaceX has mastered the process for launching and also landing rockets safely, to transport passengers from Earth... back to Earth. Mused Musk: "Maybe there is some market for really fast transport of stuff around the world, provided we can land somewhere where noise is not a super big deal," such as on a drone ship stationed several miles off the coast. After all, a rocket that accelerates to Mach 23 to put a satellite in orbit can just as easily use that speed to traverse the globe in minutes -- and land somewhere other than where it started from. "We could transport cargo to anywhere on Earth in 45 minutes at the longest," said Musk. "If we had a floating platform off the coast of, say, New York ... you could go from New York to Tokyo in 25 minutes, or cross the Atlantic in 10 minutes." Musk's discussion of point-to-point rocket travel in September sounded a lot like what Muilenburg mentioned in October. Different emphases and different vehicles, to be sure -- but the point is the same: Sure, we'll get to Mars eventually. Meantime, if SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed keep going the way they're heading, then the idea of booking an hours-long international airline flight could soon seem as silly as boarding an ocean liner to cross the Atlantic. Hypersonic travel is coming to Earth. And Boeing, Lockheed, and SpaceX are the companies bringing it. Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

According to her LinkedIn profile, she is “responsible for securing legislative and financial support for key Boeing priorities,” and that she “manages engagements on behalf of the Boeing Company with the United States Congress.” The Navy’s FA/18F Super Hornets are built in St. Louis, and the construction of up to 16 more in the coming years has been a target of intense lobbying by its builders and the St. Louis region’s congressional delegation. From 2003-2007, Smith was director of floor operations for Blunt when he was House majority whip, where she was responsible for “all vote counts and grow-the-vote strategies to achieve a desired legislative outcome,” her LinkedIn biography says. Smith joined Boeing in 2013 and has given Blunt $3,000 during this campaign, out of $6,300 total in donations, according to the most recent FEC reports.

Yankee Analysts Home Earnings Finance Global Markets About Us Privacy Policy Actual Versus Consensus: Sell-side Take on Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) By William Abels - October 15, 2016 SHARE Facebook Twitter For the most recent quarter, 7 analysts weighing in on Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) had predicted that the company would report earnings per share of $-0.88 for the period ending on 2016-06-30.  On 2016-07-27, the firm reported actual earnings of $-0.44 for fiscal Q2 representing an EPS surprise amount in per share dollar terms of $0.44.  Just prior to the release, analyst’s estimates had a standard deviation of 0.1.  Looking ahead to the next fiscal quarter, Wall Street analysts are expecting earnings per share of 2.62 for the period closing on 2016-09-30. This is the Zacks Consensus estimate calculated as the arithmetic average of all the individual analyst EPS estimates according to their own proprietary methodology (BNRI Accounting).  Investors are expecting that Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) will issue their earnings release on or around 2016-10-26. In comparing the results to the same quarter a year ago, the firm posted earnings of $2.52 for the period which endend on 2015-09-30. Analyst Sentiment Leading up to the next earnings announcements investors should pay close attention to the analysts sentiment on the stock and which direction they are revising their estimates.  Over the past 6 months 2 sell-side analysts have lowered their long term earnings per share estimates on the stock.  During that same period 3 analysts have increased their earnings expectations for the firm.  So what does this mean?  Typically if a large percentage of analysts lower their revisions, the company is more likely to disappoint the Street.  If a large number of brokerage firms increase estimates prior to earnings, the company is more likely to impress with their numbers. Looking ahead to long term projections, Zacks has calculated a long term mean estimate of 12.2.  This is the best estimate for both revenue and earnings over the next three to five years.  Three months ago this number stood at 12.56. Analyst Price Targets Now turning to where analysts believe Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares are headed.  According to the 11 analysts covering the shares, the consensus price target stands at $151.727.  The standard deviation of all estimates is $22.365.  The most aggressive analyst on the name has a price target of $183.  The analyst with the most bearish outlook on the stock has a target price of $103.  The latest analyst revision was recorded on 2016-10-11. Each of the 11 covering analysts have also provided a Buy, Sell or Hold recommendation on the stock.  As of 2016-10-14, 8 have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, 1 have a Buy rating, 5 have a Hold rating and 1 have a Sell or Strong Sell.  Taking a look back three months ago to compare sentiment, at that time 8 had a Strong Buy, 1 had a Buy, 6 had a Hold and 1 had a sell rating.  Zacks breaks all of the recommendations down into a integer based number in order to get an average recommendation rating on the stock.  The scale is on a 1 to 5 basis where 1 represents a Strong Buy and 5 a Strong Sell.  Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) has a mean recommendation of 2.09.  In looking at the historical ratings numbers we can see that the stock had a mean rating of 2.11 one month ago, 2.11 two months ago and 2.15 three months ago.    William Abels LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Latest Netflix Up More Than 3% October 5, 2016 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Closes Fast-Casual Prototypes as Part of “Strategic...

(And Why It Matters) A wave of Dreamliner orders this quarter could provide a nice boost to Boeing's profit margin next year. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 15, 2016 at 9:35AM When Boeing (NYSE:BA) began delivering its 787 Dreamliner in late 2011, it set the program accounting quantity -- an estimate of foreseeable sales over the next decade -- at 1,100 units. Two years later, it raised this estimate to 1,300 units, providing a modest boost to its profitability. Boeing may be close to raising the Dreamliner program accounting quantity again. Let's take a look at what that means, when it could happen, and why it matters for investors. Program accounting 101 When a new aircraft type is introduced, the first few models produced tend to be extremely costly. Indeed, Boeing spent an average of about $400 million to build the first 40 or so Dreamliners, according to the Seattle Times. That's several times the average selling price. Boeing incurred huge losses on the first 40 or so Dreamliners it built. Image source: Boeing. However, costs decline significantly over time. It's fairly typical for costs to fall by about 15% every time the number of units produced doubles. In other words, the 200th plane off the line costs 15% less to build than the 100th plane, while the 400th plane built is 15% cheaper than the 200th. Program accounting allows Boeing to smooth out the profitability of new aircraft programs. It looks up to 10 years ahead and estimates the program's total profitability over that time period. The estimated profit is essentially spread evenly over each plane produced. Thus, Boeing can report steady earnings rather than rack up huge losses on early production models followed by profits later on. Program accounting has been stretched to its limit for the 787. Cash costs related to Dreamliner production over the past decade have exceeded revenue by more than $30 billion. However, Boeing hasn't reported losses on the Dreamliner program, because it expects to offset the cash losses it has incurred thus far with large profits over the next six years or so. Not surprisingly, this has stirred up quite a bit of controversy. Will Boeing raise the 787 program accounting quantity again? For the past three years, Boeing's program accounting quantity for the 787 has been 1,300 units. This covers about six more years of production. That's much less than the 10-year forecast horizon Boeing used when it originally set the accounting block at 1,100 units. Theoretically, this means that Boeing could extend the 787 accounting block. (As noted above, it did this once in late 2013, increasing the accounting quantity to 1,300 units.) To extend the accounting block, Boeing must be able to estimate the revenue and costs associated with those additional airplanes. This doesn't mean Boeing needs to have sold all of those planes. For example, Boeing had fewer than 1,000 Dreamliner orders when it extended the block from 1,100 to 1,300. However, Boeing has faced significant pricing pressure and a slowdown in orders for the 787 recently. That makes it harder to estimate the profitability of planes it will be delivering in the mid-2020s. A flurry of 787 orders to end 2016? Between the beginning of 2014 and the end of last month, Boeing booked just 131 net orders for the 787 family: 41 in 2014, 71 in 2015, and 19 through the first nine months of 2016. That gave it a total of 1,161 Dreamliner orders as of the end of last quarter. However, Boeing could add significantly to that total in the last few months of 2016. Last week, it announced that Qatar Airways had ordered 30 787-9s. This week, Boeing added another order for 12 787-9s from China Southern Airlines. Additionally, China's Donghai Airlines committed to buy five 787-9s earlier this year, but that order is still waiting to be finalized. Saudia also recently announced plans to buy 13 787s, although it isn't clear whether those are already included in Boeing's order book. Boeing has captured dozens of Dreamliner orders in the past month. Image source: Boeing. The big prize is a potential order from Emirates. By year-end, the Middle Eastern airline giant is expected to decide between the 787 and Airbus' A350 for an order of roughly 70 jets. Finally, Pakistan International Airlines appears to be on the verge of ordering eight Dreamliners. If the Emirates deal comes to fruition and these other orders are finalized, Boeing would end the year with nearly 1,300 total orders for the 787. Additionally, racking up more than 100 orders in a few months would give Boeing a lot more clarity about the Dreamliner's future profitability. As a result, it could cause Boeing to extend the 787 Dreamliner accounting block again. So what? Extending the program accounting block would have zero impact on Boeing's cash flow, which is arguably the most important metric for any business. Nevertheless, most investors pay close attention to accounting earnings as well as cash flow -- and a block extension would have a big impact on Boeing's earnings. For now, Boeing is reporting very slim profits on each Dreamliner it delivers, because the projected cash profits of future deliveries in the 1,300 unit accounting block are barely enough to offset the losses sustained thus far. By contrast, since aircraft production costs decline continuously, any units added to the accounting block would be highly profitable sales. Those profits would be spread across all the remaining deliveries in the 787 accounting block. As a result, extending the accounting block would immediately increase the amount of profit Boeing reports for each 787 delivery. 787 accounting block extensions are thus a crucial aspect of Boeing's plans to boost profitability at its commercial airplanes division. The sooner Boeing can meet the requirements needed to extend the 787 accounting block, the sooner it will be able to report the strong profit growth it has promised to shareholders.

The Boeing 747's landing gear on both wings failed and passengers were warned "not to rock the plane" when getting off as it could have overturned.  The 293 passengers on board were asked to leave the holiday jet destined for Chicago "very slowly" in case it toppled over on the runway following the mid-air emergency.  The frightening incident, caused when a landing gear lever got stuck in the "up" position, closed the Heathrow runway for one hour until the aircraft was secured and towed away.  The plane - which also had 17 crew members onboard - travelled the entire length of the runway before eventually coming to a full stop at the end because of the lack of braking power which was HALVED as a result of losing the main landing gear.

A formal report has blamed a mechanical error "that caused incorrect rigging of the landing gear lever system after the landing gear control module had been replaced."  The British Airways Boeing 747-400, registration G-CIVX, was performing flight BA-295 from London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare. Newflare The plane had 293 passengers onboard Newflare Passengers were told not to rock the plane as they left It was about 160nm south of Keflavik (Iceland) when the crew decided to return to London's Heathrow Airport due to a technical problem, reports the Aviation Herald.  Whilst approaching Heathrow, the pilots reported an unsafe gear indication for both main gear and only the nose and body wheels descended.  Twenty minutes later, the Boeing landed safely on only the nose and body wheels after the pilot circled to dump fuel.  "Passengers reported the crew advised they were returning to London due to a technical problem. About 20 minutes prior to landing the crew announced that the landing gear did not fully extend with only three of five sets of gear having lowered. After the aircraft was towed to the apron, passengers were told to disembark very slowly....otherwise the aircraft would tip over and settle on its tail," said the official report Getty The British Airways plane's landing gear on both wings failed .This is a file picture   The Air Accidents Investigation report said: "The jammed landing gear lever was attributed to a rig pin not being inserted in the landing gear system during maintenance, which led to additional and unnecessary shims being used to rig the landing gear lever."  It also indentified the contributing factors of "the distraction of the engineer when he saw the quadrant move and he took his break, deficiencies in the operator’s task card system, the omission of the need to fit the rig pin in the operator’s TR for this task and an inadequate handover between the night shift and the day shift."  The emergency happened on January 30th 2016 but details have only just been revealed. The Boeing was making its first flight since maintenance on January 24th. A British Airways spokesman said: "The aircraft landed safely with its nose and body landing gear functioning correctly. "Our highly trained pilots practise a range of landings during their regular training. "We have introduced additional engineering procedure checks and training to ensure this issue does not happen again.

Only three of the five sets of wheels descended when a landing gear lever got stuck in the 'up' position during the emergency landing in January, a report revealed.  Scroll down for video   Terrified passengers on a British Airways Boeing 747 were forced to return to Heathrow when the landing gear on both wings failed  The runway at Heathrow was closed for an hour until the aircraft was secured and towed away.  The plane travelled the entire length of the runway before eventually coming to a full stop due to a lack of braking power, which was halved as a result of losing the main landing gear. Passengers then had to endure a nine hour delay before a replacement Boeing was brought in for their journey to the States. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Is Sir Brad about to be dethroned? Unless Olympic hero... A warplane graveyard: 50 German Focke-Wulfs that disappeared... Share this article Share A formal report has blamed a mechanical error 'that caused incorrect rigging of the landing gear lever system after the landing gear control module had been replaced.' The BA 295 flight had been making its way from London Heathrow to the Chicago O'Hare International Airport.  The plane turned around just south of Iceland after around two hours, due to a technical problem. This picture (file) shows what was missing when the BA flight returned to London Heathrow during the flight Whilst approaching Heathrow, the pilots reported an unsafe gear indication for both main gear and only the nose and body wheels descended. Twenty minutes later, the Boeing landed safely on only the nose and body wheels after the pilot circled to dump fuel. There were more than 300 people on board the flight - including 293 passengers and 14 crews members. Passengers described the experience as 'very scary' and praised the pilot who managed to smoothly land the Boeing 747. Only three of the five sets of landing gear descended because the crew couldn't move it to the up or down position  Muriel Gray tweeted: 'The hugest kisses and hugs to the British Airways pilot who just landed the plane my husband was on when the landing gear failed. 'Husband says BA pilot typically understated despite telling passengers how close a call that just was.' Passenger Kevin Lang told MailOnline: 'It was a dramatic and stressful episode. It all started about two or three hours into the flight when we were just south of Iceland. 'The pilot came on and said there was a technical fault and we had to go back to London. He then said they would have to jettison fuel and all the passengers would see this but was reassuring us not be alarmed.  This picture shows the landing gear that failed after the flight took off for Chicago, forcing it to return to Heathrow The Air Accidents Investigation report said: 'Passengers reported the crew advised they were returning to London due to a technical problem.  'About 20 minutes prior to landing the crew announced that the landing gear did not fully extend with only three of five sets of gear having lowered.  'After the aircraft was towed to the apron, passengers were told to disembark very slowly, aft cabin first, otherwise the aircraft would tip over and settle on its tail,' said the official report. It continued: 'The jammed landing gear lever was attributed to a rig pin not being inserted in the landing gear system during maintenance, which led to additional and unnecessary shims being used to rig the landing gear lever.' The report also said 'the distraction of the engineer' and an 'inadequate handover between the night shift and the day shift' contributed to the incident.  The emergency happened on January 30 but details have only just been revealed. The Boeing plane had made its first flight since maintenance work on January 24.  There were more than 300 people on board the flight - including 293 passengers and 14 crews members (file photo)   Share or comment on this article e-mail 656 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

The Boeing 747's landing gear on both wings failed and passengers were warned "not to rock the plane" when getting off as it could have overturned.  The 293 passengers on board were asked to leave the holiday jet destined for Chicago "very slowly" in case it toppled over on the runway following the mid-air emergency.  The frightening incident, caused when a landing gear lever got stuck in the "up" position, closed the Heathrow runway for one hour until the aircraft was secured and towed away.  The plane - which also had 17 crew members onboard - travelled the entire length of the runway before eventually coming to a full stop at the end because of the lack of braking power which was HALVED as a result of losing the main landing gear. Read More Mysterious polio-like bug that has left hundreds of children paralysed now hits UK - and it has no cure Newflare The jet can be seen approaching the runway Newflare The landing gear on both the jet's wings failed Passengers then had to endure a nine-hour delay before a replacement Boeing was brought in for their journey to the States.  Only three of the five sets of landing gear descended because the crew couldn't moved it to the up or down position. A formal report has blamed a mechanical error "that caused incorrect rigging of the landing gear lever system after the landing gear control module had been replaced."  The British Airways Boeing 747-400, registration G-CIVX, was performing flight BA-295 from London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare. Newflare The plane had 293 passengers onboard Newflare Passengers were told not to rock the plane as they left It was about 160nm south of Keflavik (Iceland) when the crew decided to return to London's Heathrow Airport due to a technical problem, reports the Aviation Herald.  Whilst approaching Heathrow, the pilots reported an unsafe gear indication for both main gear and only the nose and body wheels descended.  Twenty minutes later, the Boeing landed safely on only the nose and body wheels after the pilot circled to dump fuel.  "Passengers reported the crew advised they were returning to London due to a technical problem. About 20 minutes prior to landing the crew announced that the landing gear did not fully extend with only three of five sets of gear having lowered. After the aircraft was towed to the apron, passengers were told to disembark very slowly....otherwise the aircraft would tip over and settle on its tail," said the official report Getty The British Airways plane's landing gear on both wings failed .This is a file picture   The Air Accidents Investigation report said: "The jammed landing gear lever was attributed to a rig pin not being inserted in the landing gear system during maintenance, which led to additional and unnecessary shims being used to rig the landing gear lever."  It also indentified the contributing factors of "the distraction of the engineer when he saw the quadrant move and he took his break, deficiencies in the operator’s task card system, the omission of the need to fit the rig pin in the operator’s TR for this task and an inadequate handover between the night shift and the day shift."  The emergency happened on January 30th 2016 but details have only just been revealed. The Boeing was making its first flight since maintenance on January 24th. A British Airways spokesman said: "The aircraft landed safely with its nose and body landing gear functioning correctly. "Our highly trained pilots practise a range of landings during their regular training. "We have introduced additional engineering procedure checks and training to ensure this issue does not happen again.

Many of Boeing's commercial planes are built in Everett and Renton. (Ted S. Warren/Associated Press files) By Jake Thomas, Columbian staff writer Published: October 14, 2016, 6:52 PM A   A Just a few months from the start of the 2017 legislative session, a Boeing official says the aerospace giant still has an important story to tell in Washington. Bill McSherry, vice president of government operations for Boeing Co., told The Columbian’s Editorial Board on Friday that Boeing remains the state’s largest taxpayer, largest private employer and the largest payer of tuition through a company program that paid $32 million in 2015 to send its workers to college. “You know, I think we have not always been the most vocal tellers of our story,” said McSherry. He was accompanied by Kelly Maloney, president and CEO of the trade association Aerospace Futures Alliance of Washington, on a trip through Clark County to meet with business groups and others. A big part of that story has involved tax incentives. In 2003, and again in 2013, the Legislature approved tax incentives that helped sway the company to keep jobs in Washington. McSherry said those tax incentives have worked, with the number of workers employed by Boeing in Washington rising from 53,000 to 75,000 since 2003. The latest aircraft produced by the company, the 777X, is produced in Washington as a condition of the $8.7 billion in tax breaks given to Boeing in 2013. “That sounds like a really good decision that has paid off really well,” McSherry said of the tax incentives. But the deal has drawn criticism. After getting the tax breaks, Boeing opened a new factory in South Carolina, where the company’s workforce isn’t unionized like Washington’s. The company’s workforce in Washington has also fallen from the roughly 83,000 employees it had in 2013. Earlier this year, the Legislature considered and nixed a proposal to tie Chicago-based Boeing’s tax breaks to its number of employees in Washington. The topic could resurface in the coming months as lawmakers grapple with a state Supreme Court decision requiring the Legislature to fully fund basic education. When McSherry was asked if he could understand why some people might be upset with the company’s decision to set up in South Carolina, he responded that the situation wasn’t handled “the best.” McSherry stressed that about half of Boeing’s workforce is located in Washington, including about 250 employees in Clark County who commute to nearby facilities, including a plant in Gresham, Ore. He said that Boeing faces significant challenges in coming years including intense competition from foreign competitors who have heavy government support. He also expects challenges in replacing retiring workers. While Washington offers a skilled and productive workforce, he said it’s still not a “low-cost state.” “If you look at how Washington stacks up against competitor states, even with the aerospace tax incentives, we are not a low-cost state,” he said. “The aerospace tax incentive puts Washington in the game from a cost perspective, but they do not make Washington a low-cost state.” During the interview, Maloney said there are 1,400 aerospace companies in the state. She said they often get phone calls or emails from state governments offering incentives to move. “The worst thing we can do is harm what we’ve already done,” McSherry said.   Jake Thomas Columbian  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

"Boeing has been a longtime and trusted partner as we've built our fleet and business," said President and Chief Executive Officer William J. Flynn, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings. "We look forward to continuing to work with Boeing to provide operational excellence and support for our customers." Through its freighter conversion program, Boeing transitions passenger airplanes into freighters, extending the economic life of the airplane. "We look forward to supporting Atlas with our Boeing Converted Freighters as they expand their freighter operations," said Rick Anderson, vice president of sales and marketing, Boeing Commercial Aviation Services. "With more than 40 years of experience in passenger-to-freighter conversions, Boeing has a deep understanding of the needs of the air cargo industry. Our freighter conversion program not only provides customers with world-class Boeing platforms, we also offer global support and the assurance of a Boeing-backed program." Boeing's current market outlook forecasts a need for 400 widebody conversions over the next two decades, with strong demand for 767 freighter conversions due to a rise in e-commerce.  See other recent news regarding: Atlas Air, Boeing, BCF, Cargo, Freight, New York Subscribe to our Latest Travel News Daily Email Free of Charge by simply entering your email address to the right.

After dragging its heels initially, state-run Air India has finally coaxed American plane maker Boeing to pay compensation for lower fuel efficiency than promised in B787 Dreamliner aircraft. The aviation behemoth has agreed to pay $45 million for additional fuel burn to the airline. But industry sources said the compensation would not be given upfront in cash. Instead, credit memo of this amount would be issued to the airline, which would be settled against future payment made by Air India towards aircraft purchase. The airline has nine wide-body aircraft, six B787s and three B777s, on order which it hopes to get by March 2018. A proposal to order five more wide-body airplanes is under consideration. While Boeing did not respond to email queries sent by Financial Chronicle sent October 1, an Air India spokesperson refused to speak on the issue citing confidentiality clause. Sources, however, said, “There was initial disagreement between the two parties over compensation amount but later negotiations were held for about $45 million to which they agreed.” Location: India, Delhi, New Delhi MOST POPULAR 1 Five decades and 200 films later, Jackie Chan 'finally' wins Oscar 2 'Hoi Kiw (Chalo Chalo)' is a copied song, claims Khasi artist's family! 3 After Trump win, expert eats bug as promised 4 Aamir Khan had to 'rebel' to become an actor! 5 Sex robots will crack jokes for realistic experience more Columnist Rajiv Bhatia Asia’s natural allies?

Plus, Qatar's Boeing spree. 15 Oct 2016 15:47 GMT Business & Economy, Science & Technology, South Korea With Samsung's formal recall of the Galaxy Note 7 amidst news of the mobile phone model spontaneously catching fire and injuring some users, flight bans due to the same and third quarter profits slashed, can the popular consumer brand recover from one of the worst spots in its history? We do expect at Brand Finance a significant hit to Samsung's brand strength and brand value in the short term. Robert Haigh, director of marketing, Brand Finance As rival Apple enjoys a 10-month stock high, Samsung also has billions of its share price being knocked off to contend with and a reputation crisis to manage.  In Seoul, Samsung's home, consumers are in two minds. Some believe it is the urge to produce at an unrelenting rate which has caused Samsung's current predicament. Others believe this is only a bump in the road for the conglomerate, and handled the right way, could soon be a thing of the past. With its revenues equivalent to a fifth of the South Korean economy, this could easily be the case.  But has the company done enough to minimise reputation damage and has there been enough transparency about the faulty phone model to encourage consumers to trust in Samsung once again? Some analysts question the lack of publicity in that regard. "In terms of a public engagement point of view, there are certainly lessons that Samsung can learn," says Robert Haigh, director of marketing at Brand Finance, a brand valuation consultancy based in London. "The idea that they've 'hidden' this is perhaps an overstatement, but certainly the idea that they haven't communicated enough is a fair criticism. They probably will suffer somewhat in terms of consumer trust as a result of that." There is also the question of new customers and whether Samsung will be able to grow its market share, considering consumer brand loyalties to other brands in combination with this recent blunder.  "There will be a very significant problem with market share in the short-term," continues Haigh, "but the truth is in western mature markets, there is already a very high saturation of smartphones, so there is limited scope for the attraction of new customers". Also on this episode of Counting the Cost:  Africa's largest mobile phone market: The mobile phone industry has contributed over $4.5bn to Nigeria's economy in the first quarter of this year alone. All this growth has, however, led to a different set of problems, including network congestion and quality of service. Fines and sanctions on operators have left the country in a flurry of network improvement tasks. We speak with Bassim Haidar, CEO of the Channel IT Group, which has been bringing infrastructure, technologies and services to emerging markets since the early 1990s, about the evolution of the challenges facing the mobile industry. Qatar Airways Boeing shopping spree: Last week, Qatar Airways spent $18.6bn on up to 100 new planes. This comes as part of the airlines' continuous expansion which has seen the fleet increase from four to 188 planes in the last two decades alone. The airlines also flies to 150 destinations and has made an estimated $9.8bn in revenue last year in due course. It is also the world's third-largest air cargo operator.  Akbar Al Baker, CEO of Qatar Airways, spoke to us after the Boeing announcement about the Open Skies agreement, the Airbus delayed delivery debacle and the new cap on aviation emissions.  Sweet taxes: The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries this week to impose taxes on sugary drinks as a means to combat the increasingly alarming obesity crisis. However, with giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsi making backhanded moves to protect themselves, such as millions of dollars of donations to health organisations, the route to a healthier diet is a lot more complicated than previously thought.  Source: Al Jazeera Tell us what you think Related Report: Samsung endangered workers health in S Korea Court documents show the electronics giant kept information on chemicals from workers for fear of exposing trade secrets Human Rights, Labour, South Korea, Asia Pacific On board the Boeing 787 Dreamliner CTC gives you an idea of what flying on the new carbon-composite, more environmentally-friendly plane will be like.

(AP) — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. The Orbital ATK Antares rocket lifts off from the the NASA Wallops Island flight facility in Wallops Island, Va., Monday, Oct. 17, 2016. The rocket is carrying supplies to the International Space Station. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. WATCH: An Orbital ATK rocket was launched from NASA’s Wallops Island Flight Facility at 7:45 p.m. Monday. See the full launch in the video above. WAVY App Users: Click here to watch. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as “magnificent” and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. “It’s been a very difficult two years, and I can’t imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can’t imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight,” Bolden told the launch control crowd. “But you know, we made it and that’s what’s all important.” Lift off! @OrbitalATK's #Antares rocket launches to deliver science & supplies to @Space_Station. Keep watching: https://t.co/KX5g7zfYQe pic.twitter.com/OIbREmBJg1 — NASA (@NASA) October 17, 2016 Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. PHOTOS: NASA releases new images of Antares launch explosion This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company’s rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA’s other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month’s rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Photos: Anteres rocket launches from Wallops NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day.

Martin passed away, after a long illness, at Central Washington Hospital, on July 20, 2016, at age 93. He was born June 11, 1923, in Kansas City, MO, to Charles Peyton Martin II and Anna Lee Hogan Martin. When he was very young, his family moved to Nebraska, where he graduated from North High School in Omaha, in 1941. Before going into military service, Charles worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at Langley Field, VA, as a model maker. During this time, he took flying lessons, which led to his joining the Army Air Corps and serving as a B-25 pilot throughout the Pacific during World War II. In 1947, he married Mildred Louise Cooper, daughter of Van Buren Cooper and Amanda DeBord Cooper of Douglas, GA. In March 2016, Charles and Mildred celebrated their 69th wedding anniversary. Upon his return to the United States after the war, he earned degrees in Mechanical, Aeronautical, and Nuclear Engineering. He was a graduate of the University of Kentucky and the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology. He worked at The Boeing Company almost 30 years, applying his aptitude for analysis, long range planning, and marketing. One of his most successful assignments happened during the race to the moon, 1967-1969. During this time, he moved his family to Washington, DC, where he headed a group of Boeing scientists and engineers engaged in the Apollo program. Boeing’s group was responsible for the Technical Integration and Evaluation of each Apollo flight, making sure all possible problems had been identified and solved prior to launch. His love of aeronautics continued throughout his life. During the 1970s and 1980s, he built Free Flight Model airplanes and in 1982, he was a member of the Model Airplane Team at the World Championship Contest in Burgos, Spain. This American team came home with the first place trophy. Charlie always loved to fly and enjoyed owning and flying a Cessna 206 for several years. It is interesting to note that Charlie died on the 47th anniversary of man’s first landing on the moon on July 20, 1969. Charles is survived by his wife, Mildred Louise; his sons: Charles Keith (Carol Anway) Martin and Eric Philip (Denise) Martin; his grandsons: Philip Joshua Martin and Matthew Robert Martin of Spokane, WA; and granddaughter, Lilian Amanda Anway Martin of North Bend, WA.

It's designed to shoot a laser beam, which then heats up the drone until it explodes or crashes.  And the only ammunition it needs is energy, meaning that as long as it has power, it can fire.  According to Boeing's Jim Leary, it's one of the neatest parts of the system.  "Having a penny per shot system to take down these cheap drones being proliferated is really he most economical way for the US military to defend itself", he said.  other similar systems have been deployed already by the military, but Col. Dorrian wouldn't go into specifics.  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily! Your notification has been saved. There was a problem saving your notification.

Liftoff is scheduled for 8:03 p.m. Sunday. The mission seeks to put the state-owned launch pad back into business. It's been idle since the 2014 rocket explosion that caused about US$15 million in damage. The Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority owns and operates the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on an island that NASA uses to launch small research rockets. Most of those launches are suborbital, and they've continued. Orbital and SpaceX are the two private companies that NASA has hired to keep the space station stocked. As Orbital returns to the repaired launch pad, some industry observers are still waiting to see if the private company model will succeed in the long run. “Unless Congress is willing to spend a lot more money on NASA, this is what we have to work with,” said Marco Caceras, senior analyst and director of space studies at the think tank Teal Group. SpaceX and Boeing are supposed to start ferrying astronauts to the space station in the next year or two. In the meantime, the United States is relying on Russia to get astronauts there. NASA began investing in private companies for space station missions after President George W. Bush announced the space shuttle would retire (the last flight was in 2011). The agency needed to refocus its efforts on bigger missions, such as sending humans to Mars, so it turned to private industry. The agency spent nearly US$800 million to help SpaceX and Orbital develop launch systems, less than half of each project's cost. Now it is paying the two companies billions to ship cargo to the space station. Since 2012, Space X and Orbital have shipped food, equipment and scientific experiments on 12 successful missions. Two have failed. Orbital lost its rocket and NASA cargo shortly after liftoff from Wallops on Oct. 28, 2014. A liquid oxygen turbo pump caught fire in a decades-old Russian engine, according to a NASA investigation. Since then, Orbital has fulfilled its contract by launching from Cape Canaveral using another company's rocket. “Orbital ATK has conducted two resupply missions using our Cygnus spacecraft aboard an Atlas V (rocket) in December 2015 and March 2016 in order to continue to support NASA space station operations while we worked to put Antares back into service,” said Orbital spokeswoman Trina Helquist.

Speaking to reporters at the Young FICCI Ladies Organisation (YLFO) SpiceJet's chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said, "We are going to finalise the deal in a month or so." The low-cost carrier would also buy five aircrafts from Boeing and lease three aircraft from Bombardier this financial year to increase daily flights and enter into newer international destinations. "We have significant financial resources to fund the purchase of the aircrafts as we have been profitable for the past few quarters and also have significant ability to use the (credit) limits from banks," added Singh.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ HYDERABAD: Ending months of speculation, the Indian budget carrier SpiceJet on Friday said it would close the deal for over 100 aircraft valued at around $12 billion (over Rs 80,000 crore) by next month. Global aircraft manufacturers Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co are in a fierce competition to garner this blockbuster order in the world's third-fastest growing aviation market with aggressive discounts and negotiations. SpiceJet's chairman and managing director Ajay Singh told reporters in Hyderabad that the low-cost carrier would also buy five aircrafts from Boeing and lease three aircraft from Bombardier this fiscal to increase daily flights and enter into newer international destinations. Singh, who spoke to journalists on the sidelines of Young FICCI Ladies Organisation (YLFO) said, "We are going to finalise (the deal) in a month or so," while refusing to indicate who they are closing the deal with. The SpiceJet chief said the budget air carrier has "significant financial resources to fund the purchase of the aircrafts as we have been profitable for the past few quarters and also have significant ability to use the (credit) limits from banks." Finding no need for capital raising, Singh said SpiceJet currently has "zero bank debt and there are limits which are unutilised. We can use a variety of funding mechanisms and we don't think we need to raise any fresh capital at this time." SpiceJet plans to tap two to three international destinations in the four to five hour haul from the current presence in six countries including Dubai, Bangkok, Colombo and Maldives.

Home Industry Companies With Rafale fighter jets deal in bag, IAF eyes F-16s, Saab jets under Narendra Modi’s Make in India drive With Rafale fighter jets deal in bag, IAF eyes F-16s, Saab jets under Narendra Modi’s Make in India drive After concluding a 7.8-billion-euro deal with France’s Dassault Aviation for 36 Rafale fighter jets, the Indian Air Force is looking for the next round of combat aircraft acquisition. By: Huma Siddiqui | New Delhi | Updated: October 15, 2016 6:54 AM France’s Dassault Aviation for 36 Rafale fighter jets, the Indian Air Force is looking for the next round of combat aircraft acquisition (Reuters Image) After concluding a 7.8-billion-euro deal with France’s Dassault Aviation for 36 Rafale fighter jets, the Indian Air Force is looking for the next round of combat aircraft acquisition. The Gripen fighter plane manufactured by Sweden’s Saab and American giant Lockheed Martin’s F-16 are seen to be top contenders for grabbing the lucrative IAF contracts and both firms are open to setting up production lines in India under the Modi government’s Make in India drive, official said. US firms Boeing and Lockheed have made several presentations to the Indian defence ministry where they discussed manufacturing top-line aircraft with high-end technology in India as well as technology transfer and licensing parameters. Lockheed, sources said, has offered to move its lone production line of the latest version of fighter aircraft F 16-Block 70 to India from Texas to meet Indian and global requirements, but with a rider that the IAF has to choose the world’s largest-sold fighter aircraft for its fleet. From India’s perspective, besides the 36 Rafale fighter planes from Dassault, there is an urgent requirement for almost 100-plus aircraft. “The number of squadrons has gone down to 32 from the required 45. In 2007, IAF was looking for 126 medium multirole combat aircraft, with a follow-on order, bringing the number to 200. There is still a need for another 100 aircraft with a follow on for another 50 machines to meet the requirements,” said a senior IAF officer. As far as the IAF is concerned, the F-16, which is presently being operated by the Pakistan Air Force, would be unsuitable from operational, strategic, and technological angles. The F-16 is a 40-year-old airframe, and all the upgrades that are possible are already done. There is no room for any more growth. A 40-year-old design does have its limitations that cannot be overlooked. Industry sources, however, have pointed out that if the competition is between Lockheed and the Swedish firm, then probably the US giant will have a tough time getting a local partner. “The company does not have a strong partner to work with here locally. However, its partnership with Tata is not exclusive as it is also partnering with Boeing,” said a source. “The offer we have given to the Indian government is unmatched and from our side unprecedented,” Randall L Howard, F16 business development head at Lockheed had said here. He said the company wants to make F 16-Block 70 “for India, from India and export to the world”. But some analysts have added a cautionary note. Air marshal M Matheswaran (retd), former deputy chief, integrated defence staff, said: “The F-16 has outlived its time. By proposing this Lockheed Martin is aiming to convert the winding up of the F-16 production line into a cash cow for another three decades.” Meanwhile, Saab has offered to provide India’s state-run Aeronautical Development Agency assistance with the light combat aircraft Mk II, which is being developed for the Indian Navy.

The airline strongly advises travellers not to bring the devices to the airport with them, says an airline spokeswoman. "They cannot be accepted for travel and there is no storage facility available for them at our check in areas," the spokeswoman said on Stuff. Spark has notified customers of the first reported case of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 exploding in New Zealand. The Air New Zealand ban takes effect the same time as the US ban. The United States Department of Transportation issued a total ban on passengers and flight crews bringing the phones on airline flights into and out of the United States. "Air New Zealand apologises to customers for any inconvenience, however, this is an FAA and US DOT safety requirement." The Civil Aviation Authority this week told airlines they had to ensure passengers turn off any Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices when travelling, but fell short of an outright ban. This smartphone began smoking inside a Southwest Airlines plane on October 5, 2016. Photo: Supplied. The US order, which went into effect at 5am today New Zealand time, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones worldwide, citing a battery manufacturing error, and discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. In New Zealand, Samsung Galaxy Note 7 buyers will be given $100 compensation – on top of a cash or credit refund – to compensate them for the "stress" and inconvenience of having to return the smartphones. New Zealand Post has told consumers not to post or courier Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones back to retailers because of the safety risk. Instead it is telling buyers to return the smartphones to retailers in person. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognise that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.  No more flying for the Note 7.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The road to Mars is getting closer every day. Even with Elon Musk’s grand dreams of colonizing the Red Planet, his vision is much more difficult that you think. It requires a lot of planning, much of which I’m sure Mr. Musk has thought about. But even if he doesn’t begin to think about it, NASA is and it is enlisting other companies to help develop the tools necessary for this dream to be a reality. During the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnership (or NextSTEP) Board Agency Announcement, NASA announced it has selected six companies to begin the research and development for concepts, tools and ideas that will be integral to reaching Mars and beyond. Some of these concepts improve the already in place components of space exploration, but their ultimate goal is to turn these concepts into useful space habitat exercises that can be regularly accomplished, and not just live in our imaginations. The six companies chosen are Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, Nanorocks, Bigelow Aerospace and Boeing. The different concepts the companies are working on range from designing logistic modules for shuttle resupply missions to creating unmanned cargo spacecrafts. Some of their ideas even involve building long-duration habitats that will be constructed in space. Boeing is building a modular habitat system that it plans to send up to space in 2024. Some of these ideas are pretty wild, but probably the right out-of-the-box thinking that will get us to Mars sooner rather than later. Just contemplating about reaching Mars is crazy, but it’s also insanely cool that this might become a reality in our lifetime. We’ll keep our eyes on these companies to see if their efforts yield fruitful tools for our eventual trip to Mars.

Reporting by Daniel O'Donnell. Some airlines are taking extra steps to prevent a disaster in case a passenger's device powered by a lithium ion battery catches fire during flight. At least three US airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a mobile phone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. The issue has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier in October. CRUSHADER/REDDIT Customers have reported Samsung Galaxy Note 7s bursting into flames. Aviation authorities around the world have taken steps to warn passengers not to use or charge the devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage. READ MORE: * Air NZ bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from all flights * Samsung suspends Galaxy Note 7 production  * First known New Zealand case of Samsung Note 7 catching fire   KIM HONG-JI/REUTERS Samsung has suspended Note 7 production.     Air New Zealand banned the devices from their flights at the weekend, as did US airlines. One of the first airlines to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment. Ad Feedback The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops that can sometimes overheat and catch fire. The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 1760 degrees Celsius. The sell for US$1800 (NZ$2540) each but airlines are likely to have negotiated a bulk discount. Virgin America has installed fire-containment bags on all its planes, said spokeswoman Jennifer Thomas. The airline, which is based in Burlingame, California, has about 60 jets. Delta Air Lines noted on Thursday on a call with investors that it too would be adding such bags. The Atlanta-based airline has more than 900 planes, all of which will eventually get the bags, depending on production speeds and the ability to train flight attendants and pilots. The first priority will be the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, according to spokesman Morgan Durrant. Those jets will have two bags each by the end of the year. In 2017, Delta plans to start adding the bags to its domestic fleet, including planes flown by its regional airline partners. "This has been on the to-do list but has been accelerated by recent events,'' Durrant said. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines don't have any immediate plans for fire containment bags but all said their crews are trained on how to fight such high-energy fires. Additionally, aircraft have been fitted with fire extinguishers in the cabin as well as other fire detection and suppression systems in cargo holds for decades. In Australia, Qantas has previously considered fire containment bags, but decided its current crew training and procedures are sufficient to deal with fire emergencies.  - AAP Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next News story: South Island tour operators not worried about TripAdvisor policy changes Travel Homepage Comments travel headlines Post-quake travel plans Sheer luxury on Laucala Destinations off the tourist trail Kashmir lake in crisis Stork strike damages plane Jilted woman travels with foam cutout Southern skifield numbers rise Youngest person to hit every country?

It plans to launch routes from Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong to various destinations in countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia, and then routes between Guangzhou and Americas and Oceania. Domestically, it will expand its network between Guangzhou, the provincial capital, and air hubs in Shanghai, Kunming and Xi'an, while exploring markets in Shantou, Zhuhai and Zhanjiang in Guangdong. Guangdong province stands as one of the most dynamic regions economically in the country and the new branch is also meant to serve the country's "Belt and Road" strategy, said Liu Shaoyong, chairman of China Eastern. With the Guangdong branch, China Eastern's capacity for the Guangdong market will increase faster than before and hopefully faster than the market average, said Dong Bo, chief marketing officer of China Eastern. China Eastern will be entitled to apply for more new routes in the Guangdong market, said Zhai Zhigang, general manager of the Guangdong branch. China Eastern's Guangdong branch will fly mainly Boeing aircraft, expanding its fleet by five to eight planes annually to have 60 planes in Guangdong by 2020. Currently, the company runs daily 120 flights from six cities in Guangdong to 59 domestic cities and three overseas destinations, carrying more than 10 million passengers annually. Listed in New York, Hong Kong and Shanghai, with its headquarters in Shanghai, China Eastern carries more than 100 million passengers a year, which ranks it the seventh among all airline firms globally. It runs a fleet of 580 planes.

Health insurance costs jump 6 percent By Jim Gallagher St. Louis Post-Dispatch Jim Gallagher Oct 17, 2016 (…) The Associated Press  In this June 14, 2011, file photo, bottles of prescription drugs: Lipitor, TriCor, Plavix, Singulair, Lexapro and Avapro are displayed at Medco Health Solutions Inc., in Willingboro, N.J. U.S. spending on prescription drugs rose 8.5 percent last year, slightly less than in 2014, driven mainly by growing use of ultra-expensive new drugs and price hikes on other medicines. A report from data firm IMS Health estimates patients, insurers, government programs and other payers spent a combined $309.5 billion last year on prescription medicines. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) Here comes the gouge, again. Next month brings open enrollment for company health plans. The cost of covering you and your family will go up 5.5 percent to 6 percent, according to surveys from Mercer and the National Business Group on Health. A 5.5 percent increase would be more than five times general inflation. It is more than twice the rise in hourly earnings. But don’t expect your employer to pay the full 5.5 percent or 6 percent. Employers will see their own costs rise just 4 percent, according to Mercer, the big benefits consulting firm. Bosses will make up the difference by shifting more of the cost of illness to you, the worker. Employees will see higher premiums, higher deductibles, co-pays. Those trends have been underway for years. There’s also an effort to nudge workers toward cheaper medical providers. A few employers will simply boot higher-cost hospitals and doctors out of their networks. Premiums will take a bigger bite out of your paycheck. Expect to pay 5 percent more, according to the National Business Group on Health. Health insurance costs have been rising faster than inflation and wages for 19 years. So, the squeeze on employees and employers this year is just more of the same. There is no “huge shift” in benefits for employees this year, says Alan Loretta, who heads the health care practice at Mercer in St. Louis. There will be exceptions. Some smaller St. Louis employers are being shocked with cost increases of over 20 percent, while others are seeing increases “near zero,” says Chris Johnson, manager of consulting services at J.W. Terrill, an insurance broker in Chesterfield. The typical cost of covering a family this year is $18,142, with workers on average paying $5,277, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Since 2011, the year after the Affordable Care Act passed, average family premiums have increased 20 percent. They rose 31 percent from 2006 to 2011 and 63 percent from 2001 to 2006. Employers are pushing workers to use health care more efficiently. More are offering “telemedicine,” in which employees can visit a doctor via computer video for advice and prescriptions. Such no-touch visits — for things such as allergies or migraines — often run $40 to $45, much cheaper than a typical $125 office visit, says Loretta. Nine out of 10 employers now offer telemedicine, up from seven in 10 last year, says the National Business Group on Health. More companies are adding online cost estimators. These let participants see in advance what they might pay for a procedure out of pocket, and point them toward cheaper providers. For instance, UnitedHealth’s cost estimator shows that a trip to an urgent care clinic averages $90 in St. Louis. But costs in mid-St. Louis County range from $67 at SSM Health Express to $210 at American Current Care. There is a continued drive toward high-deductible health plans. These hold down premiums for workers and employers. But a sick employee must pay more before insurance kicks in, and out-of-pocket maximums are also higher than with other plans. The plans include tax-sheltered health savings accounts funded by employees, and sometimes employers. Workers can use the money to cover deductibles and other medical expenses, and they can take unused money into retirement to help pay medical costs. By government rule, deductibles must be at least $1,300 for self-only coverage and $2,600 for family. The average deductible actually being offered this year is $4,343, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Out-of-pocket maximums can’t be more than $6,550 for self-only coverage and $13,100 for a family. Companies have spent recent years adding surcharges for covering spouses, hoping that they’ll find alternatives to the company plan. Some are booting spouses off their health plans completely if they can get coverage from their own employers. Some companies are dropping coverage for domestic partners, noting that gay marriage is legal. Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Who's hired? Check our People in Business Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Surcharges for spouses seem to be leveling off, according to the National Business Group on Health, with one-third of companies imposing them. Some employers are controlling costs by kicking high-price providers out of their network. “You’re beginning to see a lot of employers look at that,” Johnson says. In St. Louis, narrowing the network generally means excluding BJC HealthCare, the region’s biggest hospital network. Booting BJC normally saves 6.5 to 7.5 percent on health plan costs, Johnson says. Boeing last year began offering employees a lower-cost option that includes only the Mercy hospital system. Health insurance prices have been “wildly erratic” for middle-market companies with 100 to 500 employees, Johnson says. Some firms with 100 to 200 workers are seeing 20 to 30 percent increases in premiums; others are seeing an increase “near zero.” Such firms usually buy insurance to cover their workers. Larger companies typically pay medical bills themselves, using insurance companies to bargain with providers and handle claims. Prices at midsize firms are based partly on the age and health of their workforce. But prices also can be based partly on the insurer’s overall experience with similar employers. The Affordable Care Act provided some temporary help for companies that guessed wrong about the size of medical claims in the act’s early years, but those subsidies are phasing out and companies are changing their prices to adjust. “It’s not time to panic. It’s time to very carefully look at things. We’re going through a market reset,” Johnson says. November also brings open enrollment for people who buy their own coverage through the government-run insurance marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act. The number of insurers in the St. Louis area will fall from four to two, Anthem Blue Cross and Cigna. Sharp premium increases are expected. The phase-in of the Affordable Care Act raised concern that employers would cancel their own employee coverage and force workers to buy their own on the new health insurance exchanges begun in 2014. That effect has been small so far. As of this year, 56 percent of employers offered health coverage, down from 60 percent in 2011.

SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP San Francisco Autonomous Drone Company Starts Delivering Blood in Rwanda Starting today, Zipline's drones will deliver up to 150 bags of blood daily to health centers in western Rwanda. By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. @WillYakowicz Staff writer, Inc.@WillYakowicz WRITE A COMMENT Zipline's team has launched its blood delivery drone service in Rwanda. CREDIT: Zipline Advertisement In the U.S., drone delivery is still in the research and development phase. But in Rwanda, starting today, American-made drones will deliver blood to patients in need. Zipline, an autonomous robotics company based in San Francisco, has partnered with the Rwandan government to make up to 150 deliveries each day to 21 different transfusion clinics in the western half of the country. During a ceremony in the Muhanga District in Rwanda on Friday morning (Thursday night in the states), Rwandan president Paul Kagame launched the first drone to mark the beginning of the nation's drone delivery service. Rwanda's drone delivery service will focus on blood at first but will soon expand to vaccines, medical supplies, and other medicines through a partnership between UPS and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Zipline's aircraft will expand its delivery route to the eastern half of the country by 2017. Over the next three years, Zipline CEO and co-founder Keller Rinaudo says, the startup and the Rwandan government can save thousands of lives, and he hopes Zipline can eventually provide medical supplies to all of the 11 million Rwandan citizens in need. In Rwanda, many patients die each year because blood and medical supplies cannot get to medical centers in rural areas because of poor infrastructure and impassable roads. Most "last-mile" deliveries are done by motorbike, but in emergency situations the motorbikes cannot make deliveries fast enough. During the country's rainy season, the roads connecting cities to remote villages can wash out and prevent ground transportation entirely. But the drones, which reach a top speed of 140 kilometers per hour (about 87 mph), can fly in rain and heavy wind and can deliver the blood before it spoils. The drones can make a delivery 75 kilometers away (about 47 miles) within 30 minutes. "The inability to deliver life-saving medicines to the people who need them the most causes millions of preventable deaths each year around the world," says Rinaudo. "Zipline will help solve that problem once and for all. We've built an instant delivery system for the world, allowing medicine to be delivered on-demand and at low-cost, anywhere." This is how Zipline's drone delivery system works: When a patient needs a blood transfusion, a doctor, nurse, or health center technician will send Zipline a text message and a drone from its fleet of 15 aircraft will airdrop the needed supplies in half an hour. The drone will send a message to the health center when it is two minutes away and the package, equipped with a parachute, will fall safely to the ground. The craft will then return to the launch site all by itself. Zipline, which was founded by Keller Rinaudo, Will Hetzler, and Keenan Wyrobek in 2011 in California, has raised $18 million in funding from investors including Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The company is composed of aerospace employees from NASA, SpaceX, and Boeing. The private-public partnership between the Silicon Valley company and Rwanda was padded by a $1.1 million grant from the UPS Foundation. The UPS Foundation grant will help Zipline expand its offerings to vaccines and other supplies. (UPS delivered Zipline's infrastructure, the launch pad, and the fleet of 15 drones to Rwanda.) Thanks to regulatory hurdles, Zipline is not currently operating medical supply deliveries in the U.S. The Federal Aviation Administration currently does not allow autonomous drones. The FAA's rules require a pilot on the ground to keep the aircraft in line of sight at all times. Once approved by the U.S. government, Zipline hopes to bring the same model to the U.S. by next year and plans to serve Native American reservations in Maryland, Nevada, and Washington State.

October 16, 2016 12:24 AM WASHINGTON (AP) — Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Advertisement – Content Continues Below Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their phone service provider or retail store. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

To help make the transition, NASA is allowing private companies to add their own modules to the International Space Station and two industry leaders are preparing to launch their own habitats into orbit. NASA is moving from the development stage to the demonstration stage as it tests technology for a manned Mars mission and that means moving out of the International Space Station, NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden told FastCompany. “We’re going to get out of ISS as quickly as we can. Whether it gets filled in by the private sector or not, NASA’s vision is we’re trying to move out.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nwbLls-PCs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The space agency didn’t reach this decision over night. In 2014, NASA asked their private space partners to develop new ideas for the ISS and they received a ton of innovative ideas. In response to the flood of inquiries, NASA decided to allow private companies to attach their own modules to the ISS in preparation for the launch of commercial space stations and the development of an economy in orbit. There’s no word yet on whether the crew of the private modules will be civilian contractors or NASA astronauts, but two companies are already planning the next phase of expansion. Bigelow Aerospace is building inflatable modules to attach to the ISS with plans to eventually build an entire expandable station that promises to be much more roomy than anything built with rigid modules. (Image by Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images) In 2006 and 2007, Bigelow launched two inflatable habitats into orbit, and this year, the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module was attached to the ISS where it continues to be monitored by NASA astronauts. In 2020, Bigelow plans to launch two huge independent B330 inflatable space stations into orbit aboard United Launch Alliance rockets, Bigelow founder and CEO Robert Bigelow told Space.com. “This constitutes a stand-alone space station. It needs no other support, no other modules, no other kinds of facilities.” Launch Ready! Waiting for Sunday, Oct. 16 at 8:03 p.m. for lift off. #OA5 #Antares pic.twitter.com/v6UWJopaNu — NASA Wallops (@NASA_Wallops) October 14, 2016 Meanwhile, Axiom Space is planning to launch a more traditional rigid module to the ISS in 2020 and rent out space to private customers and foreign governments, chief engineer Mike Baine told Space.com. “There’s a lot of interest by other governments looking to get into the space arena. [Some will likely be] anchor customers.” Eventually, when NASA ditches the ISS in 2024 and watches it burn up in Earth’s atmosphere, the Axiom module will detach and hook up with another recently launched Axiom module to form an independent space station. NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden, along with several private space travel companies, hopes the commercial stations will help jumpstart a new economy in orbit above Earth, he wrote in a blog post. “A vibrant user community will be key to ensuring the economic viability of future space stations.” (Image by NASA/Getty Images) As part of that economy, the ULA, a Boeing and Lockheed Martin partnership, is building their own version of a reusable rocket, called a space truck, to carry cargo into low Earth orbit. Instead of reusing the first stage of the rocket, like SpaceX does, the ULA wants to reuse the second state, the part that normally carries the cargo to its final destination. The ULA envisions a fleet of space trucks and thousands of employees working in orbit above the Earth. Also competing for a spot in the developing cislunar economy in low Earth orbit is Deep Space Industries, which is developing a prospecting spacecraft capable of mining water, in the form of ice, that can be used as fuel. Using water-based fuel obtained from passing space rocks would be much cheaper than hauling it up out of Earth’s gravity well and could allow the developing economy to flourish. What do you think of the new economy developing above Earth?

U.S., Canada ban Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from airliners by Joan Lowy, The Associated Press Posted Oct 14, 2016 9:43 pm EST Last Updated Oct 15, 2016 at 2:32 pm EST National World Passengers and flight crews are banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under emergency orders issued Friday by both Transport Canada and the U.S. Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The orders, which were effective immediately in Canada and at noon EDT Saturday in the U.S., say the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the U.S. ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the United States. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Transport Canada and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

(WPVI) AP JOAN LOWY Saturday, October 15, 2016 Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which went into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. The department initially said that passengers attempting to board planes with the phones might face fines, but later clarified that such passengers will simply not be allowed on planes. Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a "catastrophic incident," the department said. Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month.

WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW (Information from the DOT): If passengers attempt to travel by air with their Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices, the phones may be confiscated and passengers may face fines. Passengers who attempt to evade the ban by packing their phone in checked luggage are increasing the risk of a catastrophic incident. Anyone violating the ban may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Passengers currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone. Samsung has provided guidance for customers about refund and replacement options, as well as how to contact wireless carriers, at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/. Samsung is also answering customers' questions at 1-844-365-6197. If an airline representative observes that a passenger is in possession of a Samsung Note7 device prior to boarding an aircraft, the air carrier must deny boarding to the passenger unless and until the passenger divests themselves and their carry-on and checked baggage of the Samsung Galaxy Note7 device. Passengers absolutely should not pack the phones in their checked luggage. If a flight crew member identifies that a passenger is in possession of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 device while the aircraft is in flight, the crew member must instruct the passenger to power off the device, not use or charge the device while aboard the aircraft, protect the device from accidental activation, including disabling any features that may turn on the device, such as alarm clocks, and keep the device on their person and not in the overhead compartment, seat back pocket, nor in any carry-on baggage, for the duration of the flight.

U.S., Canada ban Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from airliners by Joan Lowy, The Associated Press Posted Oct 15, 2016 11:28 am EST Last Updated Oct 15, 2016 at 12:00 pm EST National In this Tuesday, Oct. 11, 2016 photo, Samsung Electronics Galaxy Note 7 smartphones are displayed at its shop in Seoul, South Korea. Samsung Electronics said Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016, it has expanded its recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in the U.S. to include all replacement devices the company offered as a presumed safe alternative after the original Note 7s were found prone to catch fire. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) WASHINGTON – Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under emergency orders issued Friday by both Transport Canada and the U.S. Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The orders, which are effective immediately in Canada and at noon EDT Saturday in the U.S., say the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the U.S. ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the United States. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Transport Canada and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

Monday 14 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 07:29 / GMT - 03:59 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories World Sat Oct 15, 2016 4:38 Russian S300, S400 Air-Defense Systems Ready to Confront Possible US Attacks in Syria Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- The Russian Defense Ministry warned against any military attack on its forces deployed in Syria, adding that the country's most advanced air-defense systems are ready to give a crushing response to any possible assault by the US. "Russia will use its S300 and S400 anti-aircraft systems to target any attack on its naval base in Tartus and its airbase in Humeimim," the ministry said, adding, "The S300 and S400 air-defense missile shields can easily intercept and target any advanced model of stealth planes too." The S-300 system can be used to defend against aircraft and cruise missiles. Meantime, it can intercept ballistic missiles. As tensions between Washington and Moscow flare, the Russian military is warning the United States that it had the ability to target stealth aircraft such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit that might be operating over Syria with the Almaz-Antey S-400 (NATO: SA-21 Growler) and the recently arrived S-300V4 (NATO: SA-23 Gladiator) air and missile defense systems. However, Western defense officials and analysts are skeptical and note that both the F-22 and the F-35 were specifically designed to counter those Russian-developed weapons, the National Interest reported. "Russian S-300, S-400 air defense systems deployed in Syria's Humeimim and Tartus have combat ranges that may surprise any unidentified airborne targets,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told the Russian state media outlet Sputnik.  “Operators of Russian air defense systems won't have time to identify the origin of airstrikes, and the response will be immediate. Any illusions about ‘invisible’ jets will inevitably be crushed by disappointing reality.” However, while Moscow makes bold claims about the counter-stealth capabilities of their S-400 and S-300V4 air defense systems, the fact remains that even if Russian low-frequency search and acquisitions radars can detect and track tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft such as the F-22 or F-35, fire control radars operating in C, X and Ku bands cannot paint low observable (LO) jets except at very close ranges. Stealth is not—and never has been—invisibility, but it does offer greatly delayed detection so that a fighter or bomber can engage a target and leave before the enemy has time to react. Tactical fighter-sized stealth aircraft must be optimized to defeat higher-frequency bands such the C, X and Ku bands—that’s just a simple matter of physics. There is a ‘step change’ in an LO aircraft’s signature once the frequency wavelength exceeds a certain threshold and causes a resonant effect. Typically, that resonance occurs when a feature on an aircraft—such as a tail-fin or similar— is less than eight times the size of a particular frequency wavelength. Fighter-sized stealth aircraft that do not have the size or weight allowances for two feet or more of radar absorbent material coatings on every surface are forced to make trades as to which frequency bands they are optimized for. That means that radars operating at a lower frequency band such as parts of the S or L band are able to detect and track certain stealth aircraft. But ultimately, to counter lower frequency radars, a larger flying-wing stealth aircraft design like the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit or the B-21 Raider—which lacks many of the features that cause a resonance effect—is a necessity. But at the UHF and VHF band wavelengths, designers are not trying to make the aircraft invisible—rather engineers hope to create a radar cross-section that will blend in with the background noise that is inherent to low-frequency radars. Low frequency radars can be used to cue fire control radars however. Additionally, some US adversaries have started to make an effort to develop targeting radars that operate at lower frequencies. However, those lower frequency fire-control radars exist only in theory—and are a long way off from being fielded.  “Stealth is ‘delayed detection’ and that delay is getting shorter. SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) radars are shifting their frequencies into lower frequency bands where U.S. stealth is less effective,” said Mark Gammon, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F and EA-18G program manager for advanced capabilities, had told me some time ago. “Early warning radars are in the VHF spectrum where stealth has limited if any capability. These radars are networked into the SAM radars giving the SAM radars cued search.” But low-frequency radars do not themselves provide a “weapons quality” track that is needed to guide a missile onto a target. There are various techniques that have been proposed to use low frequency radars for such purposes, but none of those are likely to prove viable. US Air Force Col. Michael Pietrucha had described one possible approach to me to accomplish such a feat in an article I wrote for Aviation Week & Space Technology a few years ago. However, U.S. Air Force officials were dismissive of the technique. “Just because something is technically possible doesn't make it tactically feasible,” one Air Force official with extensive stealth aircraft experience explained. Meanwhile, operational Raptor pilots tell me “it would be really classified to discuss specific SAM counter tactics,” however, the F-22 is more than capable of defeating any of the current Russian surface-to-air missile systems that are currently or projected to be fielded. Hopefully, we will not have to find out the how effective the Raptor truly is during a shooting war over Syria—since conflicts can rapidly escalate out of control, as history loves to teach us over and over again . Despite the theoretical bases put forward by the National Interest report, the Russian air defense unit deployed in Humeimim and Tartus have managed to identify several radar evading aircraft of the US army from a long range in practice. Last week, a US spy plane was spotted flying off the coasts of Syria near the Russian base in Tartus while another one was picked up by radars as it was conducting reconnaissance operations over the Russian fleet near Crimea in the black sea, western websites said. The western websites that monitor military movements across the globe reported that a US spy plane of RC135W with tail number 62-4138 left Souda Bai Airbase in the Greek Crete Island and launched reconnaissance operation over the Russian navy fleet Southwest of Crimea's coast. The website added that another US P-8A spy plane with tail number 169958 also left Sigonella Airbase in Sicily on a reconnaissance mission over the Russian warships and base in Eastern Mediterranean Sea and Southern Cyprus. The US plane's spy operation near Syria's waters lasted for around half an hour before it moved towards Lebanon. Also last month, a US P-8A Poseidon spy plane was spotted again flying off the coast of Lebanon and Syria, near Tartus. The US Navy reconnaissance plane was spotted at the time flying a few kilometers away from Russia’s Humeimim airbase in Syria. The P-8A Poseidon aircraft flew close to Syria’s Mediterranean coast where Russia’s naval task force operates. It was the fourth time that a US spy plane was spotted near the Russian base in Humeimim. Humeimim military airport, Southeast of the city of Lattakia, is Russia’s strategic center of operations against the ISIL and other terrorist groups. According to reports, the P-8A Poseidon aircraft, designed and built for anti-submarine warfare and intelligence gathering, took off from the Mediterranean island of Sigonella in Sicily. The aircraft, with tail number 168761 then flew over Syria’s coast for one and a half hours in close proximity to the Russian airbase and logistics facility located at Tartus port, South of Lattakia. Observers believe that the US spy planes have recently increased their flights over Syria to gather intelligence on the Syrian army and the Russian forces' moves in the region. According to reports, on August 30, September 2 and September 17, the P-8A Poseidon spy plane was also spotted flying toward the vicinity of the Russian airbase.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Battle for Mosul Day 27: Iraqi Forces Win Back Ancient City of Nimrud Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- After seizing control of Dhahiat al-Assad and Menyan in the weekend, the Syrian army and popular forces continued their advances against the terrorist groups in New Aleppo, Jamiat al-Mostaqbal, Menyan and al-Hamdaniyeh regions.

The order is part of the Commercial Crew Program, which was started by NASA six years ago as a way of making sure the United States continues to have human access to space. NASA ordered a first mission from SpaceX back in November of 2015, and it ordered two from Boeing — the other company involved in the CCP — in May and December of 2015. NASA initially embarked on this program because the Space Shuttle program was scheduled to end in 2011. This left the agency with no primary space vehicle, and NASA has since had to rely on Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, to launch astronauts to the space station.

The order, which went into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. The department initially said that passengers attempting to board planes with the phones might face fines, but later clarified that such passengers will simply not be allowed on planes. Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a "catastrophic incident," the department said. Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW (Information from the DOT): If passengers attempt to travel by air with their Samsung Galaxy Note7 devices, the phones may be confiscated and passengers may face fines. Passengers who attempt to evade the ban by packing their phone in checked luggage are increasing the risk of a catastrophic incident. Anyone violating the ban may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Passengers currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone. Samsung has provided guidance for customers about refund and replacement options, as well as how to contact wireless carriers, at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/. Samsung is also answering customers' questions at 1-844-365-6197. If an airline representative observes that a passenger is in possession of a Samsung Note7 device prior to boarding an aircraft, the air carrier must deny boarding to the passenger unless and until the passenger divests themselves and their carry-on and checked baggage of the Samsung Galaxy Note7 device. Passengers absolutely should not pack the phones in their checked luggage. If a flight crew member identifies that a passenger is in possession of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 device while the aircraft is in flight, the crew member must instruct the passenger to power off the device, not use or charge the device while aboard the aircraft, protect the device from accidental activation, including disabling any features that may turn on the device, such as alarm clocks, and keep the device on their person and not in the overhead compartment, seat back pocket, nor in any carry-on baggage, for the duration of the flight.

Read more Air NZ bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from all flights Last updated 22:55, October 15 2016 SIMON MAUDE / FAIRFAX NZ Samsung Galaxy Note7's have been banned from flights into the United States. Air New Zealand has issued a total ban on fire-prone Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on all of its flights from 5am on Sunday morning. A spokeswoman said the airline strongly advised travellers not to bring these devices to the airport with them.   "They cannot be accepted for travel and there is no storage facility available for them at our check in areas," the spokeswoman said. GEORGE FREY / GETTY IMAGES Spark have notified customers of the first reported case of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 exploding in New Zealand. It came after the United States Department of Transportation issued a total ban on passengers and flight crews bringing the phones on airline flights into and out of the United States. READ MORE: * NZ Post tells Samsung Note 7 owners not to put them in the mail * US Samsung Note 7 recall expanded to replacement phones in US * Samsung Galaxy Note 7 pulled from sale, users told to turn off "Air New Zealand apologises to customers for any inconvenience, however, this is an FAA and US DOT safety requirement." BRIAN GREEN/REUTERS This fire-prone smartphone began smoking inside a Southwest Airlines plane on October 5, 2016. The Civil Aviation Authority this week told airlines they had to ensure passengers turn off any Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices when travelling, but fell short of an outright ban. The US order, which goes into effect at 5am on Sunday morning New Zealand time, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones worldwide, citing a battery manufacturing error, and discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. Ad Feedback In New Zealand, Samsung Galaxy Note 7 buyers will be given $100 compensation – on top of a cash or credit refund – to compensate them for the "stress" and inconvenience of having to return the smartphones. New Zealand Post has told consumers not to post or courier Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones back to retailers because of the safety risk. Instead it is telling buyers to return the smartphones to retailers in person. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order issued yesterday, which goes into effect today at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the US One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their phone service provider or retail store. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three US airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Tags  PTI Passengers Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Department of Transportation United States Consumer Product Safety Commission Buy, Hold, Sell ?

Home Industry Tech Washington: Govt bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from airliners Washington: Govt bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from airliners The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. By: Associated Press | Washington | Published: October 15, 2016 7:43 AM Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. (Reuters) Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. The department initially said that passengers attempting to board planes with the phones might face fines, but later clarified that such passengers will simply not be allowed on planes. Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a ”catastrophic incident,” the department said. Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday WASHINGTON - Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under an emergency order issued Friday by the Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The order, which goes into effect on Saturday at noon EDT, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo.

Passengers who try to evade the ban by packing the phone in their checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Packing the phones in checked luggage increases the risk of a "catastrophic incident," the department said. Passengers who are currently traveling with Samsung Galaxy Note7 phones should contact Samsung or their wireless carrier immediately to obtain information about how to return their phones and arrange for a refund or a replacement phone, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. advertisement | advertise on newsday "We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner.

Raytheon An artist’s rendering of Raytheon’s micro-satellite, which would aid ground troops. web only Raytheon in Tucson developing tiny satellites to help troops on ground By David Wichner Arizona Daily Star David Wichner Oct 15, 2016 (…) Raytheon A technician at Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson works with a small-satellite prototype. Raytheon An artist’s rendering of Raytheon’s micro-satellite, which would aid ground troops. For more than a decade, Raytheon Missile Systems has been making missile interceptors that destroy their targets in space. Now, the Tucson-based company is adapting those capabilities to develop small, disposable military satellites that give ground troops on-demand views of their locations. Raytheon has modified some of its manufacturing lines in Tucson to produce relatively inexpensive satellites for a program called Space Enabled Effects for Military Engagements, or SeeMe. The program, managed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, aims to give ground forces the ability to get high-resolution satellite images of the battlefield via their smartphones or other hand-held devices, within 90 minutes. In contrast to military spy satellites as big as a bus that cost $1 billion or more, Raytheon’s “nano satellites” weigh about 50 pounds, are roughly the size of a 5-gallon paint bucket and have an expected base price tag of less than $500,000. The SeeMe constellation was designed to use some two dozen satellites, each lasting 60 to 90 days in very low-Earth orbit before falling out of orbit and burning up. DARPA’s request for SeeMe designs caught the attention of the folks at Raytheon’s sprawling missile plant at Tucson International Airport, which was looking for new markets. “We determined we could easily translate our capabilities and technologies into the emerging small-space market,” said Randall Gricious, business-development lead for Raytheon’s small-satellite business. It turns out that small satellites are very similar to missiles — they have similar subsystems including power, propulsion, guidance, avionics, communications and sensors, Gricious said. In Tucson, Raytheon Missile Systems already builds two “kill vehicles” for ballistic missile interceptors designed to destroy enemy missiles in space — one for the Ground-based Missile Defense system and another for the Standard Missile-3, part of the mainly ship-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system. In 2015, the company completed a $9.2 million expansion of its Space Systems Operations factory at its airport plant. Funding interrupted Whether the new effort translates into actual business is still uncertain. Raytheon won a $1.5 million SeeMe design contract in 2012, and two other companies were awarded similar contracts in 2012 and 2013. DARPA’s SeeMe program lost funding a couple of years ago, but it is being kept alive by Raytheon and other contractors with some DARPA support. Despite the loss of future funding and launch delays, Raytheon still hopes its SeeMe satellite prototype will be flown into space sometime next year. The company already has adapted some missile technologies to space vehicles. In 2009, it modified a high-resolution synthetic aperture radar from a tactical missile to both the Indian Chandraayn-1 and NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter missions that detected ice on the moon, Gricious noted. The interest in small military satellites comes as the commercial market for small satellites is booming. Spaceworks Enterprises, an Atlanta-based space engineering company, predicts that launches of satellites in the 1-50 kilogram class (up to about 110 pounds) will double to more than 400 annually by 2022. The global small-satellite market is estimated to be worth $2.2 billion this year and is projected to grow to $5.3 billion by 2021, with a compound annual growth rate of more than 19 percent, according to the research firm MarketsandMarkets. Backlog of launches One major factor that could cut into those forecasts is the limited availability of launch services. Much of the growth in small-satellite deployment is being driven by small, modular satellites known as CubeSats, which were developed by scientists at California Polytechnic University and Stanford University in 1999. Launches of CubeSats — which are assembled in roughly 4-inch cubic units — and similar small satellites accelerated in the mid-2000s and peaked in 2014, but last year launches dropped due to limited launch capacity and launch failures. A couple of dozen companies are working to bring new small-sat launch vehicles to market including launch-industry giants like Orbital ATK and startups like Vector Space Systems, which announced last week it would build its headquarters and rocket production facilities in Tucson. Several launch failures from late 2014 through 2015 contributed to the growing backlog of small-satellite launches, Spaceworks said. Failures of launch provider SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket last year and again on Sept. 1 has put launches of many small satellites — including Raytheon’s SeeMe prototype — on hold while SpaceX investigates. Raytheon’s Gricious said the company’s SeeMe satellite is scheduled to ride into space aboard a Falcon 9 along with the primary payload — an Asian communications satellite — and 86 other small satellites. The launch has been pushed back several times for various reasons, including the Falcon 9 failures, Gricious said. “Our best guess for launch is first quarter 2017,” he said, adding that the prototype recently completed final testing. The other two companies that were awarded SeeMe design contracts, California-based Millennium Space Systems and NovaWurks, a Northrop Grumman tech spinoff, are also awaiting prototype launches, though Millennium tested its craft in a high-altitude balloon flight in late 2013. DARPA program manager Jeremy Palmer said though the government program formally ended in 2014, the agency has been monitoring the progress of Raytheon’s satellite closely and the prototype will be stored until a launch vehicle is available. Flying commercial A space-policy analyst said the Pentagon has been looking to increase satellite-level intelligence capacity because existing military satellites — including huge surveillance satellites built by defense giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin — can’t handle demand. A system like SeeMe would put satellite data into the hands of troops on the ground, but the Pentagon planners have their eyes on the fast-evolving commercial small-sat industry, said Brian Weeden, technical adviser to the Secure World Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit promoting sustainable use of space. “My guess is all this commercial activity, which is starting to solve some of these problems, may have played a role in why this program didn’t get the funding,” he said. Indeed, during comments at a conference on small satellites last year, the commander of the Air Force Space Command said the military will move slowly and look to the commercial sector for help with its small-sat programs. “When the commercial sector starts investing money and starts proving capabilities, just like in the launch business, we’re going to walk into that with eyes wide open and figure out how to take advantage of those capabilities,” Gen. John E. Hyten said in a keynote speech at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics/Utah State University Small Satellite Conference.

Back To Top[*] Japan's defense contractors get to grips with foreign military buyers Oct. 16, 2016 - 03:20PM JST Until recently, public meetings between Japanese defense contractors and uniformed foreign military delegations would have stirred controversy in Japan, but last week’s aerospace show in Tokyo saw plenty. With the nation stepping back from decades of state pacifism amid concern over China’s growing power and a deepening North Korean threat, Japanese defense companies are finally shedding their reluctance to sell arms abroad. At the ShinMaywa Industries booth, Indonesian air force officials quizzed the company about its amphibious plane. In another corner of the Japan Aerospace 2016 show, Saudi Arabian military officers pored over military transport and patrol aircraft brochures handed out by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. “The Indonesians are very interested in our plane,” said a ShinMaywa salesmen, as one of his colleague went through US-2’s specifications with the six-man Indonesian delegation. He asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The US-2 is one of the home-built military platforms that the Japanese government has identified as a candidate for foreign sales after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in April 2014 lifted a ban on overseas arms sales. The exhibition in Tokyo, which was last held four years ago in Nagoya, is the first major aerospace show since Abe came to power. The show drew some 800 companies as well as representatives from numerous of international militaries. “We were visited by other foreign uniformed representatives apart from the Saudi military,” a salesman for Kawasaki said, also asking not to be identified. “The exhibition is still mostly civilian, but it has more of a military feel than four years ago.” By ending seven decades of military industrial isolation, Abe is hoping to widen arms production to lower costs through greater economies of scale and share the expense of developing new weapons with other nations. India began discussing a possible purchase of ShinMaywa’s US-2 soon after restrictions on arms shipments were eased, although no agreement has yet been concluded. Indonesian interest could provide an earlier opportunity to sell the plane abroad, but Jakarta is so far keeping its cards close to its chest. “We are looking around at all the stalls,” said an Indonesian general in the delegation, who declined to give his name. Japanese companies have been reluctant to highlight their arms businesses, wary of reputational damage to their other commercial businesses. Japan’s population remains sensitive to any perceived reversion to the militarism that many still blame for wrecking the country during World War Two. Kawasaki, which is better know for making motorbikes, had models of a heavy lift military transport, the C-2, and a sub-hunting patrol plane, the P-1, both of which it makes for Japanese military. Japan’s government believes both those could compete for overseas sales. “The foreign military delegations were mostly interested in the C-2, and they most wanted to know the price,” said the Kawasaki salesman. Fuji Heavy Industries, better known for its Subaru cars, also builds military helicopters. At the aerospace show it showed of a full-sized model of a planned new transport helicopter, dubbed the UH-X, and an experimental unmanned surveillance jet. Both have been ordered by the Japanese military. “We haven’t wanted our defense work to damage our Subaru brand. But things are changing since the change to export rules,” said a Fuji Heavy official at the booth. “The foreign military delegations came by here too,” he added, also asking not to be identified. Other companies that avoid advertising their defense work include ball-bearing maker Minebea Co, which also makes 9mm pistols, and air conditioner company Daikin Industries, which has a sideline in rifle grenades. Komatsu Ltd builds military-green armored vehicles in addition to its yellow excavators and dump trucks. After decades insulated from the competitive pressures that have forced Western firms to group together into a handful of big makers, Japan’s defense sector remains fractured, with work spread among hundreds of companies. Military sales even at major defense contractors rarely amounts to more than a few percent of overall revenue. Even at the largest contractor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), military sales amount to only a tenth of revenue. Most of its booth at the aerospace show was devoted to civilian products, including space launch vehicles, models of Boeing aircraft it help builds, and a mock up of the interior of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, which represents Japan’s bid to establish itself as a regional jet maker. MHI’s defense business was confined to two small models on a small display stand at the side of the exhibition. One was a marine patrol helicopter; the other, an experimental stealth prototype that could evolve it a $40 billion project to build a new fleet of frontline fighters for Japan, and perhaps even overseas airforces. “Foreign military representatives visited our booth,” said the MHI official in charge of the display. “I think that is the first time that has happened at a show,” he added.

The event, which takes place on the eve of the anniversary of her death, will mark the start of a fundraising campaign to build a new wing dedicated to the Irish-American actress whose entire collection of memorabilia has been donated to the museum by her grandson Conor Fitzsimons. The lifetime achievement Oscar Maureen was presented with in 2014 is among the items in the collection which will go on display in Foynes, as will her many other awards and accolades. The collection also includes never-before-seen personal items and her collection of Meissen China. Also among the items on display will be costumes and accessories from many of her films, as well as the style and dresses the Irish beauty wore to major Hollywood events and broadcasts. Some of these will be worn for the first time in years during the gala event on October 23 when models from the Holman Lee agency will showcase them on the catwalk. Rarely seen footage of the actress will merge with clips from her best known films to provide a backdrop to the fashion show.  Maureen O’Hara played a central role in the establishment of the flying boat museum, becoming the museum’s patron and officially opening it in 1989. But her connection with Foynes went back much further than that; her husband, the aviator Charles Blair flew in and out of Foynes during the flying boat era from 1939-1945. Some 30 years later, Maureen joined him in Foynes when he landed in his own Sandringham Flying Boat in 1976. When, in 1988, the idea of a museum for Foynes was first proposed, Ms O’Hara - who by then had a residence in Glengariff, Co Cork - was suggested as a potential supporter of the project. Founder and manager of the museum Margaret O’Shaughnessy was the woman tasked with contacting the Hollywood star. She recalled: “I was given her telephone number in Glengariff so I called her, I was terrified. But I needn’t have been. She was wonderful and fully supported the idea and promised to do all she could to promote it. “Each summer she would join us in Foynes for the Irish Coffee Festival which coincided with her birthday, so she would also celebrate her birthday in Foynes.  We had a special celebration at the Dunraven Arms Hotel in Adare for her 80th birthday.  All her family flew in for it. “And in 1991 we hosted the European premiere of her last major movie, Only the Lonely, with John Candy, Ally Sheedy, Milo O’Shea and Anthony Quinn, here in Limerick at her insistence,” she added. “When Maureen died last year I was invited by the family to attend her funeral in Washington DC, which I did. Now the family have decided to donate almost all of her memorabilia to the museum and we are honoured to house it in a new wing of the museum which is currently being designed,” Margaret concluded. The gala event on October 23, entitled A Celebration of the Life of Maureen O’Hara Blair, will mark the start of the campaign to raise funds for the construction of the new wing. A number of Maureen O’Hara themed prizes will be raffled on the night, including a return flight for two to either Boston or New York courtesy of Aer Lingus, and a weekend in the suite the Hollywood star stayed in in Ashford Castle, Cong, Co Mayo during the filming of the Quiet Man.
