Booked at the end of 2016, the announcement includes 100 new 737 MAX 8s, SpiceJet's current order for 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs which were previously attributed to an unidentified customer on Boeing's Orders & Deliveries website, as well as purchase rights for 50 additional airplanes. "The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began, with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort," said Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, SpiceJet. "With the next generation of 737 and the 737 MAX we are sure that we can be competitive and grow profitably." SpiceJet, all-Boeing jet operator, placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation (NG) 737s and currently operates 32 737 NGs in its fleet. "We are honoured to build upon more than a decade of partnership with SpiceJet with their commitment of up to 205 airplanes," said Ray Conner, vice chairman, The Boeing Company. "The economics of the 737 MAXs will allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectivity within India and beyond, and offer their customers a superior passenger experience." The 737 MAX incorporates the latest technology CFM International LEAP-1B engines, Advanced Technology winglets and other improvements to deliver the highest efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market. The new airplane will deliver 20 percent lower fuel use than the first Next-Generation 737s and the lowest operating costs in its class – 8 percent per seat less than its nearest competitor. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | SpiceJet | 737 MAX | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Jannah Burj Al Sarab launches exclusive IDEX room package Over 860 hotels under construction in MEA Air France launches B787 flights to Cairo German flight from Oman makes emergency landing in Kuwait Sheraton Amman Al Nabil honours partners, SPG Pro Members Ajman tourism receives top recognition Exclusive 'His' and 'Her' packages at Saray Spa Marriott Al Forsan, Abu Dhabi appoints executive team Tawasy Group ventures into fine dining segment Qatar Airways to launch Las Vegas flights Emirates to launch daily flights to Croatia Alison Nelson’s Chocolate Bar opens in Bahrain Nikki Beach Resort & Spa Dubai sees good year ahead Turkish Airlines plans flights to Ukrainian city Global Jet Centre launches new website KHC announces Flynas’ $8.6bn deal with Airbus Mosaid Travel selects Sabre to personalise travel offerings Jumeirah Zabeel Saray offers Super Brunch AccorHotels Egypt join charitable initiative Middle East passenger traffic up 12pc in November Tickets launched for Bride shows in Dubai, Abu Dhabi Iran Air takes delivery of its first Airbus A321 Airbus achieves record 688 aircraft deliveries Shop Qatar takes festivities to Doha Corniche Dubai RTA in deal with Uber to deploy 14,000 cars Ritz-Carlton Dubai unveils new activities Seafood Market to celebrate 24 years of success Kite Festival on Anantara Sir Bani Yas Island on Feb 3 Qatar Airways Holidays offers great packages New Belgium visa centre opens in Abu Dhabi Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Cooper from recollections of the passengers and crew of a Northwest Airlines jet he hijacked between Portland and Seattle on Thanksgiving...   (AP-Photo, file) (Newser) – Could legendary hijacker DB Cooper have been a Boeing employee? A group of amateur scientists says it has found information that could link Cooper with the aerospace industry in Washington state in the early 1970s, KING-5 reports. The man who became known as DB Cooper famously hijacked a Northwest Orient passenger jet on Thanksgiving eve in 1971 only to vanish forever, presumably having parachuted off the plane with $200,000 given to him by the FBI when the plane briefly touched down in Seattle. Cooper left behind a clip-on tie, and the group, Citizen Sleuths, which was put together by the Seattle FBI, has been analyzing particles found on that tie. Among those particles: rare earth elements, which, the lead researcher says, are "used in very narrow fields, for very specific things." In 1971, one of the few places they were being used was Boeing, as part of the Super Sonic Transport plane it was developing at the time. That has led researchers to wonder whether Cooper was a Boeing employee or contractor, possibly "an engineer or a manager in one of the plants" who would have worn a tie to work. The team is now asking for help from members of the public, like people who may have worked in the aerospace industry around that time. Researchers are publishing a running list of particles found on the tie, and are asking anyone with knowledge to weigh in on what the materials could have been used for.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   4% Hilarious 75% Intriguing 2% Depressing 10% Brilliant 1% Scary 9% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 29 comments Next on Newser: Parents Building a Neighborhood Just for Autistic Adults Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 29 comments Ricky Dean Jenson 11 hours, 41 minutes ago D.B.

PHOTO: AFP NEW DELHI,: A major acquisition by Indian budget airline SpiceJet this week underscored the vast potential of the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, but experts say woefully inadequate infrastructure and high operating costs could threaten the industry’s rapid expansion. India’s burgeoning middle classes are taking to the skies in ever greater numbers, with passenger growth of 20 percent in 2015 according to industry body IATA – nearly double China’s 11-percent increase over the same period. Low-cost airlines are rushing to expand their fleets to take advantage of that growth, encouraged by a fall in fuel prices that last year pushed several private operators into profit for the first time. SpiceJet, India’s fourth biggest airline with a 13-percent market share, said on Friday it was buying up to 205 Boeing planes worth $22 billion to fuel a major expansion of its domestic operations. Experts say the country’s aviation sector holds vast untapped potential, with just 100 million of India’s 1.2 billion people taking to the skies last year. But they warn that India’s rickety infrastructure could hold back future growth, with just 90 of the country’s more than 460 airports currently operational. Air India ranked third-worst airline in the world “Consistent 20-percent-plus growth per se is not a cause for celebration if the institutional framework is weak,” said Kapil Kaul, South Asia head of industry advisory and research firm CAPA. “This only increases safety and security risks. And skill shortages are also emerging. An urgent fix is required.” CAPA has warned that India could face a capacity crisis unless it builds 50 new airports over the next decade. To avoid that, the government is trying to revive some of the hundreds of disused regional airports — among them a number of “ghost airports” that were built by the government but never used. That is because most airlines opt to increase flights to popular locations rather than adding new routes, analysts say. KPMG and industry body FICCI recently named 44 such airports that could quickly be brought into use in a research report. In 2015 the government announced a plan to “take flying to the masses” by making air travel affordable for millions more Indians, reviving struggling airports and connecting rural areas. The policy aims to slash airfares to 2,500 rupees ($37) per hour of flying on many regional routes through a slew of tax incentives and subsidies. The first round of bids for these subsidised regional routes are due to start this week, with winners getting a three-year exclusive on flying rights. Auctions for routes will be conducted twice a year. ‘Costliest and toughest’  High operating costs represent the second major threat to the industry. High fuel import taxes mean that about 50 percent of an Indian airline’s costs go towards fuel, while a scarcity of pilots has pushed up salaries to global levels. “Most of the large cost heads in Indian aviation like fuel, leases, maintenance, airport charges and interest rates are some of the highest in the world,” said Amber Dubey, India head of aerospace and defence at global consultancy KPMG. “There are shortages of commanders and bringing in expat pilots is costly and time-consuming. Overall, the Indian market is one of the costliest and toughest to operate in.” Indian teen stripped, has head shaved on train for stealing bag India’s airlines are banking on higher passenger numbers to help distribute those high fixed costs as an emerging middle class increasingly opts for the plane over the train. Among them is electrician Shankar Singh, who took his first flight last May at the age of 31. Singh, who earns 15,000 rupees ($220) a month, has now flown nearly 10 times to different cities to stores run by his employer, an Indian clothing retailer. He plans to take his wife and three-year-old son on their first flight to visit her family in Kolkata in eastern India early this year – replacing a 24-hour train ride with a two-and-a-half hour journey. “I really want them to experience it,” he said, a smile lighting up his face. KPMG’s Dubey said India remained “one of the most under-penetrated countries in the world.” “With passenger traffic growing at over 20 percent for nearly two years despite severe infrastructure challenges, India is the place to be,” he told AFP.

It's been more than a decade since a handful of ambitious entrepreneurs saw their plans to provide global telecommunications service through massive satellite constellations blow up, doomed by runaway costs. Now, a new generation of satellite entrepreneurs is headed back to the launch pad. Backed by billions of dollars from deep-pocketed investors, they plan to blanket the earth in the next few years with perhaps thousands of miniature satellites beaming cheap, ubiquitous broadband service. What's different? Launching one of these smaller satellites can cost a fraction of the price for a larger, school-bus-sized satellite. These new satellites will largely be mass-produced. And consumers now demand high-speed internet connectivity pretty much everywhere, on airplanes, cruise ships and in the remotest village in Africa. Companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb and Boeing have all recently proposed networks of satellites in low-Earth orbit to provide high-speed broadband access around the globe. Even Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has aspirations to bring internet to poorly connected areas — a plan that was derailed in September after a satellite set to beam high-speed service to areas including sub-Saharan Africa was destroyed in the explosion of a SpaceX rocket on a Florida launch pad. If this latest wave of satellite networks gets off the ground, it could pose a challenge to a $224.6 billion industry currently dominated by telecom and cable companies with their miles of fiber optic and copper wires. “That's going to shake up how these operators are controlling different regions, and it's going to allow the consumer a little more of an option,” said Taylor Palmer, industry analyst at market research firm IBISWorld. In mid-December, the Arlington, Va.-based OneWeb said it secured $1.2 billion of funded capital in a round led by Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group Corp., which contributed $1 billion of the total. The money will fund construction of a Florida satellite manufacturing plant, which is set to start production in 2018. SoftBank is just one addition to OneWeb's list of big-name investors, which includes Qualcomm Inc., Airbus Group, the Coca-Cola Co. and Richard Branson's Virgin Group. “One of the main challenges is raising financing from investors, so this proves they are able to continue doing that and they're still attracting money from these big, established companies,” said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at market research firm Forecast International. “That's going to be really vital.” Satellite-provided broadband service is still tiny. It generated revenues of $1.9 billion in 2015, according to a June report from the Tauri Group that was commissioned by the Satellite Industry Association trade group. That compares with $97.8 billion for satellite television. But interest in satellite broadband is growing as consumers expect high-speed service in places that aren't always well-served by fiber or cable. Last month, Southwest Airlines said it planned to equip its entire fleet of more than 700 planes with WiFi. “There's a competitive advantage for those that have that service available,” said Tom Stroup, president of the Satellite Industry Association. “Broadband has essentially become an expected fact of life.” Analysts say satellite constellations could have the biggest effect in remote areas. In 2014, almost half of the world's population lived in rural regions, which are largely unconnected to the internet, according to a report from ITU, a special agency of the United Nations that handles information and communication technologies. “Internet access is fundamental for understanding of culture, cultural differences, civic understanding and participation,” said Greg Wyler, founder and executive chairman of OneWeb. “It helps make the unconnected economically relevant to the developed world. When they're economically relevant, we pay a lot more attention to them.” The company has an ambitious timeline. It plans to launch the first 10 satellites into low-Earth orbit in early 2018 to test their capabilities. More launches will follow, with its broadband access beginning as early as 2019. By 2022, OneWeb says it will connect every unconnected school to the internet. Eventually, OneWeb plans a 700-satellite constellation. OneWeb's satellite manufacturing facility in Exploration Park, Fla., is key to these plans. The company will mass produce its micro-satellites with automated assembly capabilities similar to those used in aircraft production facilities, eventually making three a day. OneWeb has said the satellites will weigh about 330 pounds. SpaceX, based outside Los Angeles, plans to eventually launch more than 4,000 satellites for its network. Each satellite would be about 13 feet long and 6 feet wide, with 19-foot-long solar arrays. In 2015, the company received a $1 billion infusion from Google Inc. and Fidelity Investments and opened an office in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle, to focus on developing the small satellites. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the whole constellation could cost $10 billion to $15 billion.
