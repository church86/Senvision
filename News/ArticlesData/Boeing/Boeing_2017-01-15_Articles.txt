The Turkish Boeing 747 crashed just outside the Manas airport, south of the capital Bishkek, killing people in the residential area adjacent to the airport as well as those on the plane. Reports of the death toll yesterday ranged from 37 people according to emergency officials in the Central Asian nation, to 31 reported by the presidential press office which also said rescue teams had recovered parts of nine bodies. Fifteen people including six children have been hospitalized. Images from the scene showed the plane’s nose stuck inside a brick house and large chunks of debris scattered around. Several dozen private houses cluster just outside the metal fence separating the cottages from the runway. Manas has been considerably expanded since the United States began to operate a military installation at the Manas airport, using it primarily for its operations in Afghanistan. American troops vacated the base and handed it over to the Kyrgyz military in 2014. “I woke up because of a bright red light outside,” Baktygul Kurbatova, who was slightly injured, told local television. “I couldn’t understand what was happening. It turns out the ceiling and the walls were crashing on us. I was so scared but I managed to cover my son’s face with my hands so that debris would not fall on him.” More than a thousand rescue workers were at the scene by late morning in the residential area where 15 houses were destroyed, Deputy Prime Minister Mukhammetkaly Abulgaziyev said. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Kyrgyz Emergency Situations Minister Kubatbek Boronov told reporters that it was foggy at Manas when the plane came down but weather conditions were not critical. The plane’s flight recorders have not yet been found. The plane, which had departed from Hong Kong, belonged to Istanbul-based cargo company ACT Airlines. It said in an emailed statement that the cause was unknown. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu yesterday called his Kyrgyz counterpart, Erlan Abdildaev, to offer Turkey’s condolences, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.

Iran Air took delivery last week of the first of 100 jets it has ordered from Airbus (EADSF). The first of 80 aircraft from Boeing (BA) are scheduled to arrive in 2018. The badly needed jets will reconstitute Iran's decrepit commercial aircraft fleet, which has been languishing under decades of Western sanctions. Peter Roskam, a Republican member of the House, introduced a bill on Friday to initiate an investigation by the Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence into Iran Air and the nation's other airlines. If Iran Air or any other airline were to be found to support the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or foreign terrorist organizations, the airline would be added to the U.S. sanctions list and be prevented from receiving new aircraft or U.S.-made parts. That would effectively freeze the sale of jets from Boeing to Iran. The legislation would exert little control over the Airbus aircraft that are already delivered, but the airline would not be able to receive spare parts for those planes, or receive any maintenance outside of Iran. If Iran Air received maintenance or parts outside of Iran, that provider would be barred from doing business with the U.S. market. Mahan Air, Iran's second biggest carrier, is still on the sanctions list for aiding Iran's military and is barred from buying Western planes and parts. A new Airbus delivered to Iran Air. Iran drops plan to buy A380 superjumbo Iran Air was removed from the U.S. sanctions list in January 2016 as part of an agreement to convince Iran to restrain its nuclear program. It opened the path for multi-billion dollar sales by Boeing and Airbus. That prompted an outcry from some lawmakers like Roskam, who said the Obama administration offered no proof that Iran Air had stopped its support of the Iranian military or designated terrorist organizations. Roskam and other critics of the sales say Iran Air was removed from the sanctions list for political reasons to complete the six-nation diplomatic agreement The Treasury Department, in a November 23 letter to Roskam, defended the nuclear deal and said Iran Air was cleared from sanctions after a review "of its activity to ensure" sales would be "consistent with our national security and foreign policy goals." Boeing's Iran deal won't prevent production cut The new bill restarts an earlier effort by Roskam. He introduced a bill with a similar aim last year -- the House passed it, but the Senate didn't act. Now Republicans have control of Congress and President-elect Trump has been sharply critical of the nuclear agreement. Boeing, which has said it has proceeded cautiously into a deal with Iran Air, has said repeatedly that it will continue to take its cues from the U.S. government. The company declined to comment on the Roskam bill.

Cooper, who vanished in 1971 with $200,000 in stolen cash after hijacking a commercial airliner over Oregon. Citizen scientists in Seattle believe the man may have been a Boeing worker or contractor. FBI handout via Reuters | Caption Fullscreen Loading... Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen January 15, 2017 —Leave it to a group that calls itself the Citizen Sleuths to uncover a new lead in the 45-year hunt for D.B. Cooper. The three amateur scientists have found rare-Earth elements on the JCPenney tie the infamous skyjacker left behind when he jumped out of a commercial airplane on a blistering night in 1971, with $200,000 in unmarked bills, a parachute, and a raincoat. The sleuths say the elements could indicate Cooper was an engineer or manager in the aerospace industry. The FBI closed its investigation in July, calling it one of the longest and most exhaustive in the agency’s history. Perhaps the biggest break in the case came in 1980 when an 8-year-old boy, while searching for firewood, found a bundle of $20 bills from the hijacking along the Columbia River near Vancouver, Wash. While that find seemed to support the theory Cooper didn’t survive the jump into the freezing rain and pitch-black sky, this latest discovery could help unravel the mystery behind the true identity of the man who called himself Dan Cooper. "The fascination with Cooper has survived not because of the FBI investigation, but because he was able to do something that not only captured the public imagination, but also maintained a sense of mystery in the world," Geoffrey Gray, author of “Skyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper,” told the Associated Press. How safe is flying? Take the aviation safety quiz Whether the scientists add to Cooper’s lore, or diminish the mystery, they say the clip-on tie Cooper left on the Boeing 727 tell us a lot about him. The amateur scientists, which include a paleontologist from Seattle’s Burke Museum, found more than 1,000 particles on the tie when they had it examined under an electron microscope. Among them were the cerium, strontium sulfide, and pure titanium. Tom Kaye, the paleontologist and the lead researcher for the group, told CBS affiliate King5 on Friday that the chemicals were used in the aerospace industry in 1971. Boeing, said Mr. Kaye, was using these chemicals in its efforts to build a Super Sonic Transport Plane, which it was developing with government funding in the 1960s and 1970s. Boeing historically had a large factory in Everett, Wash., near Seattle. Kaye told King5 the discovery indicates Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines]. He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye said. The scientists are posting a running list of the particles they have found on Cooper’s tie, with the hope others will come forward with more knowledge about how these particles were used then or, perhaps, with the true identity of Cooper. On Nov. 24, 1971, the day before Thanksgiving, a man who called himself Dan Cooper (early wire-service reports misidentified him as “D.B. Cooper”) bought a $20 ticket at Portland International Airport for a Northwest Orient flight bound for Sea-Tac in Seattle. The man, who fellow passengers later described as slim, olive-skinned, and wearing a black suit and aviator sunglasses, coolly ordered a bourbon and soda and smoked a cigarette aboard the plane before he handed a stewardess a note that read in all capital letters: I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE. I WILL USE IT IF NECESSARY. I WANT YOU TO SIT NEXT TO ME. YOU ARE BEING HIJACKED." When the stewardess slipped the note, unread, into her pocket, the man said, "Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb." The plane landed as scheduled in Seattle, where the hijacker managed to get $200,000 and a parachute in ransom for the passengers. He then ordered the pilots to take off and head for Mexico.   En route somewhere over the woods of Washington and Oregon, a cockpit warning light showed the rear door of the plane had been opened. The pilots asked over the intercom, “Is everything OK back there?” “No!” the man yelled, and jumped. Since then, the biggest break in the case came in 1980 with the discovery of the unmarked bills. Other than that, a body was never found, leading to a slew of conspiracy theories, books, and songs. A Michigan author proposed Cooper was in fact a father of four, Richard Lepsy, who went missing from Grayling, Michigan in 1969. An Oklahoma woman also told the FBI about a late uncle who showed up to Thanksgiving dinner in Oregon in 1971 with serious injuries. The FBI couldn’t conclusively link guitar straps made by the uncle, L.D. Cooper, with evidence found on the clip-on tie. The History Channel also recently suggested a 72-year-old California man, Robert W. Rackstraw, may have been Cooper, although the Vietnam veteran’s former lawyer denied the documentary’s allegations.   "Americans like their criminals suave and sophisticated, and this guy fits the bill," Stephen Mihm, a folklore expert at the University of Georgia in Athens, told the Christian Science Monitor’s Patrik Jonsson, about Cooper. "There's something very debonaire about the nature of the hijacking, and it was extremely risky, too, and that combination … is probably more appealing than if he he looked like a Hell's Angel and killed several people along the way. He fits our ideal of a criminal mastermind." Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

The cargo plane crashed this morning, killing people in the residential area adjacent to the Manas airport as well as those on the plane. ASSOCIATED PRESS The tail of a crashed Turkish Boeing 747 cargo plane laid at a residential area outside Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan today. The cargo plane crashed this morning, killing people in the residential area adjacent to the Manas airport as well as those on the plane. BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan >> A Turkish cargo plane crashed today in a residential area just outside the main airport in Kyrgyzstan, destroying half of a village and killing at least 37 people in the plane and on the ground, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. The Boeing 747 crashed at 7:40 a.m. local time while approaching Manas airport, south of the capital, Bishkek, in this Central Asian nation. Footage from the scene showed the plane’s nose stuck inside a brick house and large chunks of debris scattered around. A dozen body bags were laid out in the yard of one home. A car parked nearby was mangled in the crash, and a refrigerator lay open. The bodies of 15 victims, including five children, all of them Kyrgyz citizens, had been identified by this evening, the Kyrgyz government said on its website. Another 15 people, including six children, were hospitalized in the disaster, according to the health ministry. Kyrgyz Emergency Situations Minister Kubatbek Boronov said 23 out of the 43 houses in the village had been destroyed. Several dozen homes were near the fence surrounding the runway. The plane, which had departed from Hong Kong, belonged to the Istanbul-based cargo company ACT Airlines, which said the dead included the plane’s four Turkish crew members: two pilots, a freight expert and a flight technician. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Emergency Situations Minister Boronov told reporters that it was foggy at Manas when the plane came down but weather conditions were not critical. One of the plane’s two flight recorders was recovered at the scene, according to the Kyrgyz prime minister’s office. “I woke up because of a bright red light outside,” resident Baktygul Kurbatova, who was slightly injured, told local television. “I couldn’t understand what was happening. It turns out the ceiling and the walls were crashing on us. I was so scared but I managed to cover my son’s face with my hands so debris would not fall on him.” The Manas airport has been considerably expanded since the United States began to operate a military installation there, using it primarily for its military operations in Afghanistan. The U.S. handed the base over to the Kyrgyz military in 2014. ACT Airlines said today that the crash wasn’t the result of “technical reasons or factors linked to the freight” on the plane. It did not specify the plane’s cargo. It said the plane’s records book had no record of any technical faults and said that the plane had not encountered any mishaps during its journey or as it proceeded to land at Bishkek. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev today to express his condolences and convey his sadness at the loss of lives in the disaster. Turkey’s transportation ministry also sent two experts from its accident investigation board to Bishkek to assist Kyrgyz authorities. Suzan Fraser contributed to this report from Ankara.

 Airbus rallies late to take sales crown from Boeing Benjamin Zhang Jan. 12, 2017, 4:32 PM 1,637 facebook linkedin twitter email print Airbus A350-1000 test flight.Airbus Airbus' and Boeing's fight for supremacy of the skies continue into 2016. The two titans of the aviation industry have been going head-to-head with one another every year for the past two decades. Both airplane makers posted solid numbers during the year, but Airbus rallied late to take the sales crown from Boeing with 731 net orders to Boeing's 668. The Toulouse, France-based company booked an incredible 321 net orders in the month of December to take the lead. "We delivered on our objectives in a challenging environment, proving our ramp-up readiness for the future," Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Brégier. "I salute all our teams on this outstanding achievement." As a result, Airbus boasts a backlog of 6,874 aircraft valued at more than $1 trillion. However, all was not lost for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The Seattle-based airplane maker delivered 748 planes to its customers during 2016 — 60 more than Airbus. In addition, Boeing still boasts a healthy backlog of 5,715 planes. Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.Boeing As expected the bulk of Airbus and Boeing's orders were for their respective workhorse A320-family and 737-Series narrow body jets. Twin-engine wide-body jets such as the Airbus A330, A350 along with the Boeing 777 and 787 remain popular. However, both manufacturers continue to struggle finding new buyers for its large jumbo jets. Even with low fuel prices, Airbus ended 2016 with zero net orders for the A380 superjumbo. On the other hand, Boeing's venerable 747 jumbo jet had a banner year with 17 net orders — the most in a decade for the program. Sadly, the 747's new orders are driven by demand for the plane's ability to carry cargo rather than passengers. Unfortunately, even with the 747's stellar year, its order backlog is down to just 28 planes.  SEE ALSO: You can now fly from the US to Europe for $70 — but one day it might be free NOW WATCH: Watch Air France's first Boeing 787 get assembled and painted in this amazing time-lapse Loading video...

David Hertz spotted the scrap Boeing 747  and paid $26,000 and used it to build this stunning house in the remote hills of Malibu, California. Hertz, from Los Angeles, was tasked by Francie Rehwald who wanted curves and feminine shapes for her dream house. This is the amazing home built in the Californian hills by architect David Hertz using a scrapped Boeing 747 jumbo jet Hertz was commissioned to build the house by Francie Rehwald who paid $26,000 for the former passenger jet The large wing sections from the Boeing 747 were carried into place by a Chinook helicopter - made by Boeing  Rehwald interviewed 12 architects before deciding on David Hertz Architects, and spent 15 years searching the globe for the perfect piece of land. All Hertz had to do was look to the skies for his inspiration - coming up with the idea when he was on an aeroplane.  Rehwald even had to get permission from 17 government agencies - including Homeland Security - to build the house, as from the sky it looks like a plane crash.

Share this article Share Rehwald had to secure permission from federal agencies for her home's design as it looks like a plane has crashed from the air As a result of the innovative design and location, the house has unbelievable views over the Malibu hills  The giant sections of wing were moved around the construction site using a mobile crane and eased into their resting places Inside, the house has incredibly high ceilings and wide open spaces - taking advantage of the remote location The retired Mercedes Benz dealer said: 'I wanted something that was feminine. 'You might not think wings are feminine, but once they were detached from the place they really come into their own. 'They have such subtle curves.' Hertz's brief was an economical, feminine house with a floating roof. He said: 'I was flying and looking out at the wing, thinking about what I could do to float a roof. 'Then it occurred to me, why try to build a wing when I can appropriate a wing?' Rehwald interviewed 12 architects before deciding upon Hertz and spent 15 years searching for the ideal spot for the house Rehwald said the aircraft was perfect for her new home as the curved wings were very feminine  The former passenger jet, pictured, cost Rehwald $26,000, although she would not reveal how much the Malibu house cost Rehwald - who refused to say exactly how much it cost to build, only hinting it was in the millions - added: 'No one had ever built anything like this before. 'There were a lot of surprises that brought the cost up, but it's just beautiful.' The mansion sits on 55 acres and is 1,000 feet above sea level. It used two Boeing wings and two tail fins, which were detached from the plane using the latest precision technology. The astonishing property sits on 55 acres of land and suitably for a former jet, it is now permanently 1,000 feet above sea level Officials were forced to close down five freeways to allow the heavy-duty Chinook to carry the wings across the road safely During the journey, the pilots were under orders to drop the wings if they were caught by the wind and risked the helicopter  They were then transported to the mansion via helicopter, after having to close five freeways to get them partway there. Hertz said: 'There was a lot of risk with the helicopter. 'It was clear when we were transporting the wings that if they started to turn or catch the wind, they would just drop them.' Rehwald added: 'Every day is a complete and utter joy and I feel so lucky.' In this bedroom, the wing section provides the ceiling while the owner can look over the Californian hills from their bed The house used the aircraft's two wings and sections from its tail to create the unusual house in the hills  The former Mercedes dealer spent 15 years looking for the perfect location to build their ideal home using the jet The floor-to-ceiling windows provide unbelievable views across the hills surrounding Malibu in California  The interior of the building looks very modern with curved staircases bringing you to the upper level  Francie Rehwald, pictured, left, inspects the work after one of the wing sections was put into place above her house  Share or comment on this article e-mail 155 shares Absolutely stunning.

Bean is far from the first time he’s used his virtual soapbox to promote a specific company. Trump has regularly singled out businesses for commendation and condemnation on Twitter, even before he became a candidate for president. Now that he’s the president-elect, his tweets have the power to move markets. ADVERTISEMENT Whether Trump will continue to single out companies in the White House remains to be seen, as ethics rules are supposed to bar federal officials from making direct endorsements. Here are the companies that Trump has singled out on Twitter since he began his presidential bid last year, not including his spats with media organizations. L.L. Bean Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 Trump weighed in this week after a rash of stories about his critics boycotting L.L. Bean, which makes outdoor apparel and gear, as well as the popular “Bean boot.” One of the members of the Bean family, Linda Bean, gave $60,000 to the Making American Great Again LLC, a PAC that supported Trump’s presidential bid. That donation has put Bean in hot water, as under federal law, the maximum donation that a PAC can take is $5,000, according to The Associated Press. Bean argues she only donated $25,000 and thought she was donating to a super PAC, which can take unlimited amounts of money. Making American Great Again LLC is reportedly seeking to change its registration to become a super PAC. Bean appeared on “Fox and Friends” to talk about her support of Trump despite the boycott about an hour before Trump’s tweet. Carrier/United Technologies Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order to be with the great workers of Carrier. They will sell many air conditioners!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2016 Trump’s deal with Carrier has become one of the biggest moments of his transition, and he spent the end of November singing the company’s praises on Twitter. His supporters lauded the administration for directly negotiating to keep jobs at a Carrier furnace plant, owned by the parent company United Technologies, in Indiana. Critics charge that Trump is exaggerating the number of jobs his deal saved, noting that hundreds of others are still slated for outsourcing. Rexnord Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 Days after he announced the Carrier deal in early December, Trump challenged the industrial company Rexnord for its decision to ship jobs overseas. Rexnord workers are represented Steelworkers Local 1999 Union, the same union that represents the workers at Carrier’s Indiana plant. So when the 1999 head criticized Trump for inflating the number of jobs saved in the Carrier deal, Trump took time to needle another company under the union’s umbrella. Boeing/Lockheed Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Trump has taken on the aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin several times since Election Day. He did so again during his Wednesday news conference when he said that Lockheed is behind schedule and over budget on the F-35 program. That remark prompted its stock shares to plunge. Ford/Fiat Chrysler Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford & Fiat C!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 In a rare incident of Twitter praise, Trump applauded both automakers this month for deciding to make further investments in American plants instead of outsourcing. Ford’s CEO told CNN that the move is a “vote of confidence” in Trump’s new direction. But Fiat Chrysler told ThinkProgress in a statement the move had been announced a year ago and had nothing to do with Trump. General Motors General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Trump set his sights on yet another car company this month, this time to warn against shipping Mexican-made cars into America. A General Motors spokesperson told PolitiFact it sells about 15 percent of Mexican-made hatchbacks in America, with the rest manufactured in the U.S. And statements from the company since the tweet show that it doesn’t expect to change its business plans based on Trump’s tweets and threats for import tariffs. Toyota Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 Trump slapped at Toyota in January for building a new plant in Mexico. The plans had been announced in 2015, before Trump even declared his presidential bid, and had coincided with additional investments in four American car plants. Apple Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 During the presidential campaign Trump blasted Apple for refusing to help the FBI crack into iPhone of a suspect in the December 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif. The issue went to rest months later when the FBI disclosed that it had found a way into the phone with help from an outside source. Amazon If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 Trump has locked horns with fellow business billionaire Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who bought The Washington Post in 2013. The feud likely has to do with Trump’s complaint that the Post doesn’t cover him fairly. But Trump has suggested that Bezos is using the Post as pressure to keep his tax burden down and avoid an anti-trust violation at Amazon. Macy's Thx to all the people who called to say they are cutting their @Macys credit card as a protest against illegal immigrants pouring into US— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2015 Good news, disloyal @Macys stock is in a total free fall. Don't shop there for Christmas! https://t.co/wpDDCWcLFD pic.twitter.com/vT3uGjiZ9B— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2015 The clothing giant had a falling out with Trump over his campaign, cutting its ties to Trump’s clothing brand in July, weeks after he jumped into the presidential race making controversial comments about Mexican immigrants. Trump responded with near-monthly tweets blasting the company and calling for a boycott through the rest of 2015. Amer-I-Can Join @AmerIcan32, founded by Hall of Fame legend @JimBrownNFL32 on 1/19/2017 in Washington, D.C.https://t.co/14DGDrIlcl pic.twitter.com/XwSmQVFuoM— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 Trump boosted the Amer-I-Can nonprofit founded by former football star Jim Brown in a December tweet two weeks after Brown traveled to New York with a group to meet with the future president.  After the meeting, Brown and his allies told reporters that Trump committed to merge the Amer-I-Can program with the Trump administration’s efforts to keep kids from gang violence. Koch Industries While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil), word is they have chosen little Marco RubioMarco RubioTrump faces pressure to keep sanctions from GOP Sanders: I will vote no on Tillerson Rubio's Tillerson vote is why people don't trust politicians MORE, the lightweight from Florida— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016 Many of Trump’s critiques of businesses are based in political differences. That was the case when Trump sent this February 2015 tweet blasting the company owned by the GOP mega donors Charles and David Koch. The impetus for the tweet was the decision by Marc Short, a top political operative from the Koch-connected Freedom Partners, to go to work for Marco Rubio in the GOP primary. Short joined the Trump campaign after the primary and was just named the assistant to the president and director of legislative affairs. T-Mobile .@JohnLegere @TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2015 Trump has regularly targeted T-Mobile on Twitter during his career, but only once while he was running for office. When T-Mobile CEO John Legere criticized Trump for a November 2015 tweet chiding a UFC fighter for her surprise loss, Trump shot back to blast T-Mobile and later retweeted a follower complaining about the cell-phone company's "pathetic" service." Twitter, Google and Facebook Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2016 The social media giants drew Trump’s ire in late October of 2016 hours after a story posted on Breitbart News, the outlet once led by future White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, alleging that news about the FBI’s investigation into Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonClinton: 'This is not who we are' Trump signs three more executive actions Two crowds on the National Mall with two very different messages MORE’s email was not prominently featured.

Its main base is Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, Istanbul. The airline's European hub is based at Liege Airport in Belgium.

In February 2008, a 21 percent equity stake was acquired by Manara Investments Ltd. Manara is an investment vehicle sponsored by four leading Saudi business groups. New partners and existing shareholders expect ACT Airlines to become a leading regional and international player.

A man walks near an Airbus A330-200F freighter aircraft on display at the Singapore Airshow REUTERS/Tim Chong 16 January 2017 By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is set to post an 8 percent rise in deliveries for 2016, beating expectations, after a sprint to the finish line that narrowed the gap with arch-rival Boeing, according to industry experts and records of aircraft movements. The European planemaker was forced to accelerate deliveries sharply in December to meet its target after production problems earlier in the year. It delivered over 100 jets last month, a Reuters analysis of flight-tracking data supplied by FlightRadar24, unofficial airport data and plane-watcher reports suggests, lifting its 2016 tally well above 680 including 60 of the delayed A320neo. One industry expert estimated the total as high as 688, well above the company's informal target of more than 670. Advertisement Airbus remains in second place behind Boeing, but its growth contrasts with a 2 percent drop in 2016 deliveries reported by its U.S. nemesis last week, to 748 planes. The higher-than-expected Airbus performance, up from 635 in 2015, is the latest evidence thatplanemakers are racing to whittle down big order backlogs and hoard cash as they face a potentially worsening slowdown in orders that began in 2015. Boeing temporarily eased output last year to make way for a new model but, like Airbus, plans to increase production of its best-selling aircraft. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Europe's largest aerospace company clawed back losses to end up 0.2 percent in a weaker Paris market. The European planemaker is keeping operational data tightly under wraps ahead of its annual news conference on Wednesday. Airbus's December deliveries would set a monthly record for the company, beating the previous peak by more than a quarter. The gap between Christmas and New Year, traditionally a groggy period for European industry, saw a record burst of activity at Airbus plants in France and Germany and included one of its busiest ever days with eight jets flying away on Dec. 29. "I was amazed," said a veteran of such operations. Aiming to stay ahead of Boeing in the race for new orders, rather than deliveries where it lags, Airbus may book for December at least part of a recent order for 100 jets from Iran and tie up loose ends including completing a deal for 72 jets with India's GoAir. It may announce a $6.4 billion order for 60 jets from Saudi carrier flynas, two sources said. Airbus needs to announce at least 259 orders for December to beat Boeing's 2016 total of 668. With outspoken sales chief John Leahy expected to retire in the second half of this year, Airbus is looking to end 2016 with a flourish, though analysts say prices could suffer due to weakening global economies. CASH GENERATION Airbus delivered at least 70 A320-family narrow-body jets in December, according to the sources and data, also a record. These included at least 17 of the new A320neo, whose ramp-up had been disrupted by delays in receiving new fuel-saving engines from Pratt & Whitney. That brought 2016 deliveries of narrow-body jets - the most cash-generating models - to over 540. It also delivered more than 140 wide-bodies. Airbus expected to deliver more than 670 aircraft in 2016, unofficially revised up from 650 in October. It is accelerating deliveries of the existing A320 to keep cash pouring in from airlines while it adopts a more conservative timeframe for the switchover to the A320neo. Narrow-body deliveries generate cash for other developments and are increasingly vital as demand for larger wide-body aircraft suffers from a looming capacity glut. Experts say the delays in A320neo deliveries have masked some pressure on demand for those models too, caused by low oil prices that can make earlier versions just as attractive. On its other main profit-driver, Airbus delivered over 62 long-haul A330s in 2016, according to the estimates. But it was forced to step up customer financing to maintain that pace as major customer Turkey faced turmoil after a failed coup and as European states withheld export credits in a row over Airbus payments to sales agents. Airbus itself provided the financing for all seven new Turkish Airlines A330s in 2016, industry sources say. Despite separate delays due to shortages of cabin equipment, Airbus unexpectedly hit a target for at least 50 deliveries of the newer A350 after 16 in December, sources said last week. That includes one or two jets paid for but not yet in operation. The rush to get planes away extended to the mammoth A380 as Airbus delivered seven in December, including three in two days to dominant customer Emirates. That brought the annual total to 28, up one from the previous year and enough to keep Europe's troubled superjumbo project at breakeven in 2016. However, it plans to cut A380 output from next year after demand sagged for the world's largest four-engined jets. The programme took another blow in late December when Dubai-based Emirates, under pressure from the impact of low oil prices on Gulf economies, delayed some 2017 deliveries. That could put the iconic double-decker plane back into loss in 2017, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.

A man walks near an Airbus A330-200F freighter aircraft on display at the Singapore Airshow REUTERS/Tim Chong 16 January 2017 By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is set to post an 8 percent rise in deliveries for 2016, beating expectations, after a sprint to the finish line that narrowed the gap with arch-rival Boeing, according to industry experts and records of aircraft movements. The European planemaker was forced to accelerate deliveries sharply in December to meet its target after production problems earlier in the year. It delivered over 100 jets last month, a Reuters analysis of flight-tracking data supplied by FlightRadar24, unofficial airport data and plane-watcher reports suggests, lifting its 2016 tally well above 680 including 60 of the delayed A320neo. One industry expert estimated the total as high as 688, well above the company's informal target of more than 670. Advertisement Airbus remains in second place behind Boeing, but its growth contrasts with a 2 percent drop in 2016 deliveries reported by its U.S. nemesis last week, to 748 planes. The higher-than-expected Airbus performance, up from 635 in 2015, is the latest evidence thatplanemakers are racing to whittle down big order backlogs and hoard cash as they face a potentially worsening slowdown in orders that began in 2015. Boeing temporarily eased output last year to make way for a new model but, like Airbus, plans to increase production of its best-selling aircraft. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Europe's largest aerospace company clawed back losses to end up 0.2 percent in a weaker Paris market. The European planemaker is keeping operational data tightly under wraps ahead of its annual news conference on Wednesday. Airbus's December deliveries would set a monthly record for the company, beating the previous peak by more than a quarter. The gap between Christmas and New Year, traditionally a groggy period for European industry, saw a record burst of activity at Airbus plants in France and Germany and included one of its busiest ever days with eight jets flying away on Dec. 29. "I was amazed," said a veteran of such operations. Aiming to stay ahead of Boeing in the race for new orders, rather than deliveries where it lags, Airbus may book for December at least part of a recent order for 100 jets from Iran and tie up loose ends including completing a deal for 72 jets with India's GoAir. It may announce a $6.4 billion order for 60 jets from Saudi carrier flynas, two sources said. Airbus needs to announce at least 259 orders for December to beat Boeing's 2016 total of 668. With outspoken sales chief John Leahy expected to retire in the second half of this year, Airbus is looking to end 2016 with a flourish, though analysts say prices could suffer due to weakening global economies. CASH GENERATION Airbus delivered at least 70 A320-family narrow-body jets in December, according to the sources and data, also a record. These included at least 17 of the new A320neo, whose ramp-up had been disrupted by delays in receiving new fuel-saving engines from Pratt & Whitney. That brought 2016 deliveries of narrow-body jets - the most cash-generating models - to over 540. It also delivered more than 140 wide-bodies. Airbus expected to deliver more than 670 aircraft in 2016, unofficially revised up from 650 in October. It is accelerating deliveries of the existing A320 to keep cash pouring in from airlines while it adopts a more conservative timeframe for the switchover to the A320neo. Narrow-body deliveries generate cash for other developments and are increasingly vital as demand for larger wide-body aircraft suffers from a looming capacity glut. Experts say the delays in A320neo deliveries have masked some pressure on demand for those models too, caused by low oil prices that can make earlier versions just as attractive. On its other main profit-driver, Airbus delivered over 62 long-haul A330s in 2016, according to the estimates. But it was forced to step up customer financing to maintain that pace as major customer Turkey faced turmoil after a failed coup and as European states withheld export credits in a row over Airbus payments to sales agents. Airbus itself provided the financing for all seven new Turkish Airlines A330s in 2016, industry sources say. Despite separate delays due to shortages of cabin equipment, Airbus unexpectedly hit a target for at least 50 deliveries of the newer A350 after 16 in December, sources said last week. That includes one or two jets paid for but not yet in operation. The rush to get planes away extended to the mammoth A380 as Airbus delivered seven in December, including three in two days to dominant customer Emirates. That brought the annual total to 28, up one from the previous year and enough to keep Europe's troubled superjumbo project at breakeven in 2016. However, it plans to cut A380 output from next year after demand sagged for the world's largest four-engined jets. The programme took another blow in late December when Dubai-based Emirates, under pressure from the impact of low oil prices on Gulf economies, delayed some 2017 deliveries. That could put the iconic double-decker plane back into loss in 2017, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.

The Boeing 747 freighter jumbo jet slammed into a residential neighbourhood – killing many people on the ground – near the country’s main airport in the capital Bishkek. Flight TK6491 attempted to land on Monday morning, with a temperature of minus 11 degrees Celsius outside and the airport immersed in thick fog. Hong Kong’s Cathay Dragon plans HK$20b aircraft replacement programme The country’s deputy prime minister said preliminary tests suggested pilot error caused the accident, but said terrorism could not be ruled out. “Now we cannot say who is guilty of the accident. According to preliminary estimates of experts, it was pilot error,” Mukhammetkaly Abulgaziyev said, according to local news agency 24.kg. “Everything will be known after the investigation,” he said, adding that he could not rule out whether the plane had been overloaded. At least four pilots – reportedly all Turkish nationals – were on board and died in the crash. The rest of those killed were on the ground when the plane crashed. The crew had flown to the airport before and was familiar with the weather conditions, officials said. Prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation, citing possible safety violations. The country’s health minister Talantbek Batyraliev told local media that in total 32 people had died including 12 minors, and several more were in hospital. Bishkek, Kirguistán.- Cae jumbo 747 de MyCargo cuando iba a aterrizar. @capiurtecho pic.twitter.com/wMBWONUzuA — Conrado Aviación (@Conradoaviacion) January 16, 2017 The aircraft was operated by ACT Airlines, also known as myCargo Airlines, on behalf of Turkish Airlines. In 2011, the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group bought a 49 per cent stake in the cargo operator. The flight took off from Hong Kong for Bishkek at 3.12am on Monday and crashed at 7.31am local time. It had been scheduled to continue to Istanbul. Parts of the plane were strewn across a radius of 1km, with many houses damaged or demolished. On Monday evening, officials were hunting for the aircraft’s “black box” flight data and voice recorders. A Kyrgyz news agency reported that a local resident had written on Facebook that the plane’s impact had “blown away” many structures. “Many homes simply burned,” she wrote. “People were sleeping and didn’t have any idea.” The plane’s manufacturer Boeing said it was standing by to help investigators, and extended “its deepest condolences to the families of those who perished.” In a statement on Monday, ACT Airlines said the cause of the accident was “unknown at this time” and that they would provide further details as they became available.

In one image, the plane’s smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car’s roof was completely ripped off in another. ACT Airlines, which operated the plane, confirmed the news of the crash on their website. “The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available,” the statement said. The crash The plane crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the airport, according to Kyrgyzstan’s state-run Kabar Agency. Poor visibility was likely a factor, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of Emergency Situations, told Kabar. At least eight people — including children — were hospitalized, Kabar reported. Fifteen homes were destroyed, according to Sharipova. It’s not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 — including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline’s website. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan’s capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. Condolences “Boeing extends its deepest condolences to the families of those who perished in the Turkish Airlines cargo Flight TK6491 accident near Manas Airport Kyrgyzstan, operated by ACT Airlines, as well as its wishes for the recovery of those injured,” Boeing said in an emailed statement. “A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities.” The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines — the country’s national carrier — under their flight number. Turkish Airlines expressed their condolences to ACT in a tweet. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company’s website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747’s enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard.

Cooper a Boeing worker? Ben Rosen Christian Science MonitorJanuary 15, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Leave it to a group that calls itself the Citizen Sleuths to uncover a new lead in the 45-year hunt for D.B. Cooper. The three amateur scientists have found rare-Earth elements on the JCPenney tie the infamous skyjacker left behind when he jumped out of a commercial airplane on a blistering night in 1971, with $200,000 in unmarked bills, a parachute, and a raincoat. The sleuths say the elements could indicate Cooper was an engineer or manager in the aerospace industry. Source: FBIMore The FBI closed its investigation in July, calling it one of the longest and most exhaustive in the agency’s history. Perhaps the biggest break in the case came in 1980 when an 8-year-old boy, while searching for firewood, found a bundle of $20 bills from the hijacking along the Columbia River near Vancouver, Wash. Recommended: How safe is flying? Take the aviation safety quiz While that find seemed to support the theory Cooper didn’t survive the jump into the freezing rain and pitch-black sky, this latest discovery could help unravel the mystery behind the true identity of the man who called himself Dan Cooper. "The fascination with Cooper has survived not because of the FBI investigation, but because he was able to do something that not only captured the public imagination, but also maintained a sense of mystery in the world," Geoffrey Gray, author of “Skyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper,” told the Associated Press. Whether the scientists add to Cooper’s lore, or diminish the mystery, they say the clip-on tie Cooper left on the Boeing 727 tell us a lot about him. The amateur scientists, which include a paleontologist from Seattle’s Burke Museum, found more than 1,000 particles on the tie when they had it examined under an electron microscope. Among them were the elements cerium, strontium sulfide, and pure titanium. Tom Kaye, the paleontologist and the lead researcher for the group, told CBS affiliate King5 on Friday that the elements were used in the aerospace industry in 1971. Boeing, said Mr. Kaye, was using these elements in its efforts to build a Super Sonic Transport Plane, which it was developing with government funding in the 1960s and 1970s. Boeing historically had a large factory in Everett, Wash., near Seattle. Kaye told King5 the discovery indicates Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines]. He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye said. The scientists are posting a running list of the particles they have found on Cooper’s tie, with the hope others will come forward with more knowledge about how these particles were used then or, perhaps, with the true identity of Cooper. On Nov. 24, 1971, the day before Thanksgiving, a man who called himself Dan Cooper (early wire-service reports misidentified him as “D.B. Cooper”) bought a $20 ticket at Portland International Airport for a Northwest Orient flight bound for Sea-Tac in Seattle. The man, who fellow passengers later described as slim, olive-skinned, and wearing a black suit and aviator sunglasses, coolly ordered a bourbon and soda and smoked a cigarette aboard the plane before he handed a stewardess a note that read in all capital letters: I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE. I WILL USE IT IF NECESSARY. I WANT YOU TO SIT NEXT TO ME. YOU ARE BEING HIJACKED." When the stewardess slipped the note, unread, into her pocket, the man said, "Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb." The plane landed as scheduled in Seattle, where the hijacker managed to get $200,000 and a parachute in ransom for the passengers. He then ordered the pilots to take off and head for Mexico.   En route somewhere over the woods of Washington and Oregon, a cockpit warning light showed the rear door of the plane had been opened. The pilots asked over the intercom, “Is everything OK back there?” “No!” the man yelled, and jumped. Since then, the biggest break in the case came in 1980 with the discovery of the unmarked bills. Other than that, a body was never found, leading to a slew of conspiracy theories, books, and songs. A Michigan author proposed Cooper was in fact a father of four, Richard Lepsy, who went missing from Grayling, Michigan in 1969. An Oklahoma woman also told the FBI about a late uncle who showed up to Thanksgiving dinner in Oregon in 1971 with serious injuries. The FBI couldn’t conclusively link guitar straps made by the uncle, L.D. Cooper, with evidence found on the clip-on tie. The History Channel also recently suggested a 72-year-old California man, Robert W. Rackstraw, may have been Cooper, although the Vietnam veteran’s former lawyer denied the documentary’s allegations.   "Americans like their criminals suave and sophisticated, and this guy fits the bill," Stephen Mihm, a folklore expert at the University of Georgia in Athens, told the Christian Science Monitor’s Patrik Jonsson, about Cooper. "There's something very debonaire about the nature of the hijacking, and it was extremely risky, too, and that combination … is probably more appealing than if he he looked like a Hell's Angel and killed several people along the way. He fits our ideal of a criminal mastermind." This report contains material from the Associated Press.  Related stories How safe is flying? Take the aviation safety quiz D.B.

Airbus's John Leahy reports on the plane-makers performance Credit: AFP He is in a good mood, having just delivered his presentation at the company’s annual sales results, where his patter and charts aimed to show how his employer is besting Boeing. Leahy’s address had moments of levity, but there is no doubt that the plane game is a serious business. It is estimated to be worth approaching $6 trillion over the next two decades, with between 33,000 and 39,000 new airliners needed. The presentation, which was webcast live around the world, included Leahy’s now regular “welcome to our friends in Seattle who have stayed up very late to watch this”. As he revealed annual order numbers, it is unlikely there were any champagne corks being popped by viewers in Washington State. Airbus reported last week it had taken 731 orders worth $104.9bn in 2016, slightly ahead of Boeing’s 668 orders worth $94bn. (These are list prices: manufacturers offer hefty discounts to secure sales.) Airbus reported on its annual performance from its architecturally striking Leadership University in Toulouse  However, they were not enthusiastically knocking back the bubbly in Toulouse either. For many, a better measure of performance than orders is delivery numbers. It is only when manufacturers hand over the planes to airlines that they get paid, and on this basis Boeing has the edge. It delivered 748 aircraft last year, against Airbus’s 688, though that was a new record for the European company which is aggressively ramping up production and aims to be churning out 60 a month of its best-selling A320 family of small airliners by 2019. Still, Leahy was chipper as he explained his biggest problem: “I don’t have anything to sell until 2021,” he says, referring to demand outstripping Airbus’s ability to produce aircraft. “We are essentially sold out.” Leahy, who set a goal in 1994 of Airbus taking 50pc of the market, at that time dominated by Boeing, and took only five years to achieve this target, is even resorting to convincing customers to buy larger aircraft, rather than have a smaller, less profitable, jet take up a valuable slot on Airbus’s production lines. Boeing's biggest seller is it's 737 family of jets Zafar Khan, an analyst at Societe Generale, recognises Leahy’s comparison of Coke and Pepsi. “Boeing is Coke, the established player, while Airbus is Pepsi, the new kid on the block, which had something to prove,” Khan says. The market is now split pretty much 50:50. But while Airbus might be selling more aircraft, more of its orders are made up of smaller single-aisle jets, while Boeing has the upper hand in the more expensive wide-body twin-aisle airliners. This point is something that Leahy will argue, and he is backed up on this by Khan. “Boeing might be delivering more of its 787 airliners but that’s only because it launched it a couple of years before Airbus launched its rival, the A350,” the analyst says. Boeing pipped Airbus to launch its 787 ahead of its rival's A350, Both were the first of a new generation of airliners The recent weakness of sterling and the euro against the dollar, the currency in which the aerospace industry operates, means that Airbus might be able to price its jets more aggressively. However, Sandy Morris, an analyst at Jefferies, says the signs are the European plane-maker has not done this, an indication of its strength. What might seem more worrying for both companies is the decline in orders from the boom times seen a few years ago. In 2014, Airbus booked a staggering 1,456 orders, and Boeing 1,432. This is about twice the level seen in 2016. In fact, last year saw the weakest sales in six years. On the face of it, such a sharp drop would appear to be a big concern, but with such massive backlogs (Airbus has almost 7,000 jets on order, Boeing almost 6,000), even without landing another sale, at current production rates both businesses have about a decade’s work in hand. The manufacturers have proudly stated that they are maintaining a book to bill ratio of 1:1, that is, for each plane they sell they deliver one, meaning they maintain their hefty backlogs. But the ratio looks likely to go below this level in the coming years. Boeing's 777 assembly plant in Washington State “With that inevitable volatility, it will look unhealthy if the book to bill does not go below one,” Morris says. “But when you have got backlogs that are bigger than you can shake a stick at, then that figure doesn’t really matter so much.” Morris says he admires the restraint both Airbus and Boeing have shown in not pushing delivery rates up even higher, but keeping them under control represents a “massive de-risking of the businesses”. “It’s got to be a difficult thing to tell customers, ‘Sorry, we’re sold out for a few years’,” Morris says. But he agrees that if problems emerge at higher production rates – both companies have seen manufacturing issues with their flagship jets, the A350 for Airbus and Boeing’s 787 – then trying to iron out issues at these high production rates could be costly and damaging.     Both Airbus and Boeing are ramping up production rates but still have huge order backlogs Credit:  Bloomberg  Orders are not the key figure in the aircraft industry anyway, says Khan, especially with discounts of as much as 50pc being offered. “Delivery and getting paid for aircraft is the more important measure,” he says. And this is where the real difficulty comes, Khan believes. “Making those aircraft profitably is the challenge, and manufacturers should be focusing on their margin. The tragedy for the industry is that even with such great demand, they enter into such fierce price competition,” he says. “They can afford to be more disciplined on pricing.” The real miracle of Airbus and Boeing is that they have managed to dominate in an industry that is “hellishly difficult”, Morris says: “Making these highly complex aircraft is hard. It’s incredible each company is turning out almost 700 a year and wants to increase production.” The immense complexity of modern aircraft means it is hard to speed up production rates Credit: Alamy Howard Wheeldon, an independent aerospace analyst, takes a longer-term view of the rivalry between Airbus and Boeing.  “It doesn’t matter who is winning,” he says. “What matters is that they are both successful and making money with new entrants such as China and Russia trying to get into the airliner business. “Airbus and Boeing can push into design and new technology that will keep them ahead of upcoming rivals. By the time China has got where Airbus and Boeing are now with technology, [the Western companies] will have long moved on to more advanced designs.” With air traffic expected to double over the next 15 years, according to the airline industry body IATA, the market can only get bigger for the aircraft manufacturers, and such intense rivalry is good for airlines and ultimately their passengers, Wheeldon says. “With both in a strong place the customers, and therefore passengers, are winners,” he says.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Budget 2017: Why a post-Budget fall won't mean achhe din are over for markets. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh has given a fresh lease of life to his airline. Since 2015, when he took over an almost-grounded carrier, he has improved its operations, increased its market share, repaid or reworked almost all of its dues and debt, pushed it to consistent profits and made it India's best performing airline stock. It was an opportune time for the next phase of expansion and SpiceJet Friday announced an order for 100 Boeing 737 Max planes with an option for 50 more that may include widebodied aircraft used for long-haul overseas flights. It has also renegotiated its existing 55-plane order with Boeing. Smart, aggressive negotiations have been a cornerstone of Singh's turnaround strategy for SpiceJet and the latest deal was no different. In an interview with ET, Singh explained how he managed to work out significant incentives on maintenance contracts for the planes and got early delivery slots for an aircraft that would have otherwise been delivered only after 2022. He also gave an insight into the airline's planned international expansion, profitable growth as well as its ongoing court case with previous owner Kalanithi Maran. He said he has no intention to exit the airline as of now. Edited excerpts: Q) This seems to be a great aircraft purchase deal, not just in volumes but also the terms on which it has been cracked. Broadly, there are now 205 planes on order, of which 155 are firm orders (including previous ones). What has not been reported, is that in those 155, we have the flexibility to choose between Max 8s or Max 9s or Max 10s. There are also 50 purchase rights, which include options for wide-bodied aircraft. The thought there was to look for low-cost, long-haul international operations. We can get these rights at any time during the period of the contract which is from now to 2024. Q) So would you, at a later date, look at opting for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes? Yes absolutely. But it's very preliminary right now. We think there are airlines --such as (Singapore Airlines' subsidiary and Dreamliner operator) Scoot for which the low-cost, long-haul model has done well. We are doing pretty well with the current model, but who's to say what happens a few years down the line? We will explore and see whether there are margins to be made in that business. The Max gives us a larger range than our current aircraft. The current 737 NG (next generation) planes have a range of four hours. Max planes give us a range of five hours. It opens up several destinations that were tough to do with NGs. Q) Which are those destinations? Several. Istanbul could be one. Greece could be another. We feel that in Southeast Asia, there are several destinations that will open up for us. We have more options on our existing sectors too, for example, Delhi-Bangkok can be done with an NG, but with restrictions. Q) It took you a year to crack this deal. What incentives has SpiceJet wrested out of it? You have renegotiated the terms on existing orders as well. I took over the company two years ago. I started the process of aircraft-purchase just a year ago. I had no particular time frame in mind. We were waiting for the right commercial transaction to happen and all the pieces to align properly. That includes the reworked maintenance arrangements that are part of this contract. That was in fact one of the most important pieces of this negotiation. Going forward, there will be a significant reduction in our maintenance costs. Q) Given the popularity of the Boeing 737 Max, how did you manage to get such early delivery slots? That too was part of the negotiations of course. For the most part, both manufacturers we spoke to -- Boeing and Airbus -- told us that delivery slots are only available from 2022. So, of course, this was part of the negotiation. And you will see that one of the key features of the deal is that a large number of aircraft are coming in at 2018, 2019 and 2020. Q) So, Boeing brought SpiceJet ahead of several customers in terms of delivery slots. Yes, of course. So, essentially, we have got aggressive pricing (we of course got a hefty discount), we have got an aggressive maintenance deal, and we have got early delivery slots. So, we managed to get everything that we started out with. Q) What would your fleet size be in the next few years? Will some of the existing aircraft be replaced? That's difficult to say, also because of confidentiality pacts with Boeing. Since our deliveries start from only 2018, in 2017 we could be leasing some more Boeing 737 NGs. As new versions of aircraft come into the market, the older ones become cheaper to lease. There are more and more NGscoming on offer as the launch date for the Max comes closer. Q) What financing options are you looking at for funding the purchase? You can either go for sale and leaseback or opt for loans from an Exim bank. The first few would be sale and leaseback deals as they are easier to do. And we have several offers. Going further, we will take a call, depending on what is cheaper for us at that point in time. Our objective is that whatever we go in for should reduce the cost of financing. Fortunately, we are in a pretty conducive financial environment, where interest rates are low across the world. And this is an immediately 'finance-able' aircraft. So, it will help us reduce financing cost too. Our other objective when we started in 2015 was that we should bring down the average cost of leasing at SpiceJet because that was pretty high. And we have brought it down significantly -- about 20% -- and think we can push it down even further. Q) You and your peers -- GoAir and IndiGo -- are placing mammoth plane orders. Where would you fly these aircraft with such limited airport infrastructure in the country? Infrastructure is of course a problem. Mumbai airport is completely choked. Delhi has capacity on the airside, so you can park the aircraft, but terminal capacity is a challenge. This is a bit of a chicken and egg situation. The same thing happened when telecom was growing. People asked "Where is the spectrum? How are you going to do it?" Obviously, we have to find solutions to the problems. There are 400 airports in the country. We use just 80 of them, that too pretty sub-optimally. There are 30-odd airports, which are just sitting there with not a single flight operating. But, obviously, we will have to find solutions. You can't allow the fastest-growing aviation market in the world to get choked because of lack of infrastructure and airport space. Since everybody is aware of the problem, I am sure solutions will be found. When push comes to shove, solutions come up. Q) You have brought the airline back to profitability. But with the constant pressure on yields, looming problems of overcapacity and a macroeconomic jolt from demonetisation, what do the subsequent quarters look like? There was an impact of demonetisation in the Oct-Dec quarter, especially in November, even though things have got back to near-normal now. On yields, our hope is that airlines will be sensible and push for higher yields and lower costs. Our yields are probably the highest in the industry at this time. So our objective is to increase margins and we hope others do the same. Also, the market is growing. Inherent demand is there. Many people are shifting from trains to planes. With growth happening in the economy, dented as it might be due to demonetisation, there is an impetus. Inherently we dont need to dilute fares. Q) The government is pushing for regional connectivity. Some regional airlines have started flying but are cash-strapped. Would you look at a tie-up or acquisition in that space? I don't see any reason for doing that because we already have the largest regional play in the country. And, for me to expand, is quite easy. I can just take another 5, 10 or 15 aircraft -- whatever it takes--and expand that play. Why should I enter into a tie-up with a regional airline or buy a regional airline with its problems, liabilities and poor contracts for the most part? Why regional airlines are suffering is because their fleet size is so small. They don't get great contracts. They get lousy pricing for the aircraft and they don't get the good deals on maintenance either. It becomes really expensive on a unit-cost basis to operate those airlines. Therefore, they have trouble as soon as external costs rise. Q) The contours of the SpiceJet deal (your takeover) has changed over the past two years. There was a Rs 1,200-crore investment and a blue-chip investor spoken about but neither happened. And then, there was a court case with the Marans. Where do things stand now? We had (during the stake buy) in fact spoken to an investor. There was an offer. But by the time they did their due diligence, SpiceJet's stock price had doubled from their offer price. The company started to do better than we expected, pretty early on. So, we really didn't need the funds. And we haven't needed any funds. Today we are zero-debt. There was practically no investment made to take over SpiceJet. It just the debt. But it was a lot of debt. We took over Rs 2,200 crore. And, we have pretty much paid back all of it. Kalanithi Maran (SpiceJet's previous owner) had put in some money before I came into the scene and he also spent that money before my entry. Also, before I came, he had got shareholder approvals to issue warrants to himself. They had applied to Sebi and BSE for issue of those warrants and neither had given permission. When we did the deal, they gave us the warrants asking us to issue them. We said "fine, we will issue them provided Sebi and BSE agree". They again declined. Now the question is, what happens to the money they put in and for that they have gone to an arbitrator. The contract didn't provide for that but the question is when they are paid the Rs 208-odd crore. It can be either settled through arbitration or negotiation. Q) So, we don't see the current owner of SpiceJet (Singh) exiting any time soon? Not at all. The first exit was painful enough. I don't want to exit at this time.

(AP) BY Jason Silverstein NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Sunday, January 15, 2017, 11:30 AM A band of amateur scientists may have found a breakthrough in the infamous D.B. Cooper plane hijacking case — thanks to a clip-on tie. A tie belonging to the mystery man who took over a Boeing passenger plane in 1971 — then jumped out on a parachute, never to be seen again — may indicate that he worked in the aerospace industry, and maybe even for Boeing. A team of researchers, known as Citizen Sleuths, analyzed the JC Penney tie with an electron microscope and found particles of cerium, strontium sulfide and pure titanium. Those elements would have been rarely seen outside of certain environments — such an aerospace plant. FBI closes D.B. Cooper case due to lack of 'credible leads' The group said Boeing used those elements in the 1960s and ‘70s while developing its Super Sonic Transport plane in Washington State. Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or contractor who wore that tie to his job. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure,” Citizen Sleuths lead researcher Tom Kaye told King5 on Friday. “He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye said.

(Andy Rogers/AP) The FBI closed the Cooper case last year without solving it, and said it found no credible leads. Years before that, though, the bureau gave Citizen Sleuths unprecedented access to analyze evidence from the case. The team is still investigating the Cooper case, and has posted its forensic analysis of the tie online and asked for the public’s help with information. The man known as D.B. Cooper boarded a Boeing flight from Portland, Ore., to Seattle on Nov. 24, 1971. After calmly telling a flight attendant he had a bomb in a briefcase, Cooper extorted $200,000 in ransom money from the FBI and parachuted from the plane — and seemingly into thin air. After 45 years of investigation, the FBI found no trace of Cooper or even an idea of his identity. This remains the only unsolved passenger plane hijacking. Witnesses on the plane recalled that Cooper seemed familiar with the local terrain as the plane circled the Puget Sound for two hours while the FBI scrambled to fulfill his demands.

FBI handout via Reuters | Caption Fullscreen Loading... Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen January 15, 2017 —Leave it to a group that calls itself the Citizen Sleuths to uncover a new lead in the 45-year hunt for D.B. Cooper. The three amateur scientists have found rare-Earth elements on the JCPenney tie the infamous skyjacker left behind when he jumped out of a commercial airplane on a blistering night in 1971, with $200,000 in unmarked bills, a parachute, and a raincoat. The sleuths say the elements could indicate Cooper was an engineer or manager in the aerospace industry. The FBI closed its investigation in July, calling it one of the longest and most exhaustive in the agency’s history. Perhaps the biggest break in the case came in 1980 when an 8-year-old boy, while searching for firewood, found a bundle of $20 bills from the hijacking along the Columbia River near Vancouver, Wash. While that find seemed to support the theory Cooper didn’t survive the jump into the freezing rain and pitch-black sky, this latest discovery could help unravel the mystery behind the true identity of the man who called himself Dan Cooper. "The fascination with Cooper has survived not because of the FBI investigation, but because he was able to do something that not only captured the public imagination, but also maintained a sense of mystery in the world," Geoffrey Gray, author of “Skyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper,” told the Associated Press. How safe is flying? Take the aviation safety quiz Whether the scientists add to Cooper’s lore, or diminish the mystery, they say the clip-on tie Cooper left on the Boeing 727 tell us a lot about him. The amateur scientists, which include a paleontologist from Seattle’s Burke Museum, found more than 1,000 particles on the tie when they had it examined under an electron microscope. Among them were the cerium, strontium sulfide, and pure titanium. Tom Kaye, the paleontologist and the lead researcher for the group, told CBS affiliate King5 on Friday that the chemicals were used in the aerospace industry in 1971. Boeing, said Mr. Kaye, was using these chemicals in its efforts to build a Super Sonic Transport Plane, which it was developing with government funding in the 1960s and 1970s. Boeing historically had a large factory in Everett, Wash., near Seattle. Kaye told King5 the discovery indicates Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines]. He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye said. The scientists are posting a running list of the particles they have found on Cooper’s tie, with the hope others will come forward with more knowledge about how these particles were used then or, perhaps, with the true identity of Cooper. On Nov. 24, 1971, the day before Thanksgiving, a man who called himself Dan Cooper (early wire-service reports misidentified him as “D.B. Cooper”) bought a $20 ticket at Portland International Airport for a Northwest Orient flight bound for Sea-Tac in Seattle. The man, who fellow passengers later described as slim, olive-skinned, and wearing a black suit and aviator sunglasses, coolly ordered a bourbon and soda and smoked a cigarette aboard the plane before he handed a stewardess a note that read in all capital letters: I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE. I WILL USE IT IF NECESSARY. I WANT YOU TO SIT NEXT TO ME. YOU ARE BEING HIJACKED." When the stewardess slipped the note, unread, into her pocket, the man said, "Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb." The plane landed as scheduled in Seattle, where the hijacker managed to get $200,000 and a parachute in ransom for the passengers. He then ordered the pilots to take off and head for Mexico.   En route somewhere over the woods of Washington and Oregon, a cockpit warning light showed the rear door of the plane had been opened. The pilots asked over the intercom, “Is everything OK back there?” “No!” the man yelled, and jumped. Since then, the biggest break in the case came in 1980 with the discovery of the unmarked bills. Other than that, a body was never found, leading to a slew of conspiracy theories, books, and songs. A Michigan author proposed Cooper was in fact a father of four, Richard Lepsy, who went missing from Grayling, Michigan in 1969. An Oklahoma woman also told the FBI about a late uncle who showed up to Thanksgiving dinner in Oregon in 1971 with serious injuries. The FBI couldn’t conclusively link guitar straps made by the uncle, L.D. Cooper, with evidence found on the clip-on tie. The History Channel also recently suggested a 72-year-old California man, Robert W. Rackstraw, may have been Cooper, although the Vietnam veteran’s former lawyer denied the documentary’s allegations.   "Americans like their criminals suave and sophisticated, and this guy fits the bill," Stephen Mihm, a folklore expert at the University of Georgia in Athens, told the Christian Science Monitor’s Patrik Jonsson, about Cooper. "There's something very debonaire about the nature of the hijacking, and it was extremely risky, too, and that combination … is probably more appealing than if he he looked like a Hell's Angel and killed several people along the way. He fits our ideal of a criminal mastermind." Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Jan 16, 2017 - Page 14　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Indian airlines soar, but experts are cynical AFP, NEW DELHI A SpiceJet Boeing 737-800 aircraft taxies on the tarmac after landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai on Nov. 26, 2012. Photo: Reuters A major acquisition by Indian budget airline SpiceJet this week underscored the vast potential of the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, but experts say woefully inadequate infrastructure and high operating costs could threaten the industry’s rapid expansion. India’s burgeoning middle classes are taking to the skies in ever greater numbers, with passenger growth of 20 percent in 2015 according to International Air Transport Association (IATA) — nearly double China’s 11 percent increase over the same period. Low-cost airlines are rushing to expand their fleets to take advantage of that growth, encouraged by a fall in fuel prices that last year pushed several private operators into profit for the first time. SpiceJet, India’s fourth-biggest airline with a 13 percent market share, on Friday said it was buying up to 205 Boeing planes worth US$22 billion to fuel a major expansion of its domestic operations. Experts said the country’s aviation sector holds vast untapped potential, with just 100 million of India’s 1.2 billion people taking to the skies last year. However, they warn that India’s rickety infrastructure could hold back future growth, with just 90 of the country’s more than 460 airports currently operational. “Consistent 20 percent-plus growth per se is not a cause for celebration if the institutional framework is weak,” said Kapil Kaul, South Asia head of industry advisory and research firm CAPA. “This only increases safety and security risks. And skill shortages are also emerging. An urgent fix is required.” CAPA has warned that India could face a capacity crisis unless it builds 50 new airports over the next decade. To avoid that, the government is trying to revive some of the hundreds of disused regional airports — among them a number of “ghost airports” that were built by the government, but never used. That is because most airlines opt to increase flights to popular locations rather than adding new routes, analysts said. KPMG and industry body FICCI recently named 44 such airports that could quickly be brought into use in a research report. In 2015 the government announced a plan to “take flying to the masses” by making air travel affordable for millions more Indians, reviving struggling airports and connecting rural areas. The policy aims to slash airfares to 2,500 rupees (US$36.70) per hour of flying on many regional routes through a slew of tax incentives and subsidies. The first round of bids for these subsidized regional routes are due to start this week, with winners getting a three-year exclusive on flying rights. Auctions for routes will be conducted twice a year. High operating costs represent the second major threat to the industry. High fuel import taxes mean that about 50 percent of an Indian airline’s costs go toward fuel, while a scarcity of pilots has pushed up salaries to global levels. “Most of the large cost heads in Indian aviation like fuel, leases, maintenance, airport charges and interest rates are some of the highest in the world,” said Amber Dubey, India head of aerospace and defense at global consultancy KPMG. “There are shortages of commanders and bringing in expat pilots is costly and time-consuming... Overall, the Indian market is one of the costliest and toughest to operate in,” Dubey said. India’s airlines are banking on higher passenger numbers to help distribute those high fixed costs as an emerging middle class increasingly opts for the plane over the train. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2463 times.

Cooper' parachuted from a plane he hijacked in 1971 with $200,000 He was never seen again, and the case remains unsolved 45 years later  By Anna Hopkins For Dailymail.com Published: 22:29 EST, 14 January 2017 | Updated: 08:54 EST, 15 January 2017 e-mail 2.9k shares 155 View comments New evidence uncovered by scientists examining D.B. Cooper's necktie has led to a shocking new twist in the recently closed, unsolved case. A team of vigilante scientists, the self-titled Citizen Sleuths, devote their time to exclusively researching the mysterious hijacking, in which Cooper parachuted from a plane with $200,000 and was never seen again. After examining the JC Penney tie left behind by Cooper, the Sleuths discovered a number of rare elements on its surface, which indicate that Cooper may have worked as an engineer for Boeing before the historic hijacking. Cooper left his tie on the plane before parachuting out the back of the aircraft After examining the JC Penney tie left behind by Cooper, the Sleuths discovered a number of rare elements on its surface Using an electron microscope, the scientists were able to pull more than 100,000 particles from the tie, which contained traces of 'rare earth elements'.  'They're used in very narrow fields, for very specific things,' said Tom Kaye, associate researcher for the group told King 5 News. Such elements included Cerium, Strontium Sulfide, and pure titanium. They were used at the time of Cooper's hijacking by Boeing in the production of their Super Sonic Transport Plane. Such elements included Cerium, Strontium Sulfide, and pure titanium. They were used at the time of Cooper's hijacking by Boeing in the production of their supersonic Transport Plane Boeing was cultivating high-tech equipment, like radar screens, in the 1960s and 1970s which utilized the elements found on Cooper's discarded tie.   'The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these (manufacturing machines),' Kaye said.  'He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants.'  It has been 45 years since DB Cooper hijacked a plane and then parachuted into the woods somewhere around the border of Oregon and Washington with $200,000, which would be worth more than $1 million today Kaye and his team are appealing for members of the public with experience in aerospace engineering during that time period to help them investigate further.  It has been 45 years since DB Cooper hijacked a plane and then parachuted into the woods somewhere around the border of Oregon and Washington with $200,000, which would be worth more than $1 million today.  The FBI announced in July of 2016 that  they would no longer be investigating the case, as they had exhausted all leads. However, they finished their official statement on a hopeful note: 'Although the FBI will no longer actively investigate this case, should specific physical evidence emerge - related specifically to the parachutes or the money taken by the hijacker - individuals with those materials are asked to contact their local FBI field office.' The facts of the case are that on November 24, 1971, a man identifying himself as Dan Cooper bought a ticket at Portland International Airport in Oregon and boarded a Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 to Seattle, Washington.  Cooper was later described by passengers and the crew as being in his mid-forties and just under 6 feet tall, wearing a dark suit and black necktie with loafers and a raincoat.  Once the plane took off, he ordered a bourbon and lit a cigarette before casually handing flight attendant Florence Schaffner a note. On November 24, 1971, a man identifying himself as Dan Cooper bought a ticket at Portland International Airport in Oregon and boarded a Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 to Seattle, Washington Schaffner later told the FBI that she did not look at the note until Cooper whispered to her: 'Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb.'  He then told her his demands.  Cooper asked for $200,000, four parachutes and a fuel truck to be waiting on the runway when the flight landed in Seattle. Schaffner conveyed his demands to the cockpit and the plane then circled the area for two hours so police and the FBI could gather Cooper's money and parachutes. Authorities later found this parachute bag believed to be the one Cooper deployed  The FBI previously recovered partial DNA evidence from items including one parachute When the plane landed, an employee of Northwest brought Cooper 10,000 unmarked 20-dollar bills and four parachutes in a knapsack, at which point the 36 passengers and Schaffner were allowed off the plane. While that aircraft was refueling Cooper told the crew that they were to fly to Reno at an altitude of no more than 10,000 feet and a the slowest possible speed that would still keep the plane airborne. The plane took off again at 7:40pm, two hours after landing, and Cooper ordered the members of the crew who were still on board to gather in the cockpit with the door close.  A helicopter takes off from search headquarters to scour the area hijacker Dan Cooper might have parachuted into two days before, on Oct. 28, 1976 in Woodland, Washington Three planes followed behind, but a little over 20 minutes after the plane left Seattle a red light alerted the crew that the back hatch had been opened on the plane and Cooper was gone. Once the plane landed in Reno the FBI dusted for fingerprints and collected the parachute and tie that Cooper left behind. They then began to speak with all those who had seen the man to get an idea of what he looked like. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Who killed Suzanne and Susan? $1million reward offered for...

Share this article Share Both Schaffner and flight attendant Tina Mucklow, who had stayed on the plane when it took off from Seattle again with Cooper, had nothing but nice things to say about the criminal. 'He seemed rather nice. He was never cruel or nasty. He was thoughtful and calm all the time,' said Mucklow. It was almost nine years before there was a break in the case, which came in February 1980 when eight-year-old Brian Abrams found some of the money that had been given to Cooper. Eight-year-old Brian Abrams found some of the money that had been given to Cooper in 1980 While on vacation with his family in Washington the young boy discovered three bundles of cash while searching for firewood to build a campfire. It was unclear how the money got there, and since that time the other 9,710 other bills and parachutes have never been found. A number of conspiracy theories of the potential identity of the mysterious 'DB Cooper' have cropped up over the last four decades. D.B. COOPER: THE CONSPIRACIES According to Richardson, the true identity of DB Cooper may be Richard Lepsy, who went missing from Grayling, Michigan Ross Richardson, a Michigan author, put forward a theory linking the mystery of DB Cooper to an obscure missing person case involving a married father of four who vanished two years before the skyjacking and was never heard from again. According to Richardson, the true identity of DB Cooper may be Richard Lepsy, who went missing from Grayling, Michigan, in October 1969, leaving behind his wife and four children. The night news of the hijacking broke, Lisa Lepsy, Richard's daughter, recalled that when DB Cooper's composite sketch was shown on TV, everyone in her family looked at each other and exclaimed, 'That's dad!' 'We were stunned because the resemblance was unbelievable, and my brothers and I were all sure that was our dad,' she told WZZM. There were other similarities between Cooper and Lepsy. Richardson noted that the black tie that was left behind by the hijacker was the same black tie that was part of Lepsy's uniform at the store in Grayling. He also said, citing the FBI, that the suspect was wearing loafers during the hijacking; Lepsy's favorite pair of shoes were loafers.  Richard Lepsy, however, is only the latest in a long list of names that have been floated over the years in connection to the DB Cooper mystery. Richard Lepsy, however, is only the latest in a long list of names that have been floated over the years in connection to the DB Cooper mystery A filmmaker and his team of 40 experts sued the FBI in September of 2016 in an attempt to prove that a loose cannon ex-army helicopter pilot is in fact legendary hijacker DB Cooper. Thomas Colbert believes 'Cooper' is actually Robert Henry Rackstraw, a 72-year-old Vietnam vet living in San Diego. If he wins, Colbert his team of 40 sleuths - who include former FBI agents, criminologists, journalists and attorneys - may finally have what they need to prove their suspicions are correct. The most far-fetched theory to the series' finale was that Draper would become DB Cooper  Television junkies were quick to spew conspiracy theories about the ending of the beloved show Mad Men, which finished its final season in 2015. Many viewers were racked by how the series could end, which features a dashing adman named Don Draper who reinvented himself as a new man after the Korean War. The most far-fetched theory to the series' end was that Draper would become DB Cooper, hijacking the infamous plane and jetting off into a dark night never to be seen again.  In response to the theories, the show's creater Matthew Weiner said point-blank to CNN that the Cooper conspiracy was not feasible.  In 2011, an Oregon woman claimed her uncle was the elusive plane bandit, saying she had been told by the FBI that her evidence is enough for them to close the file on the case. In 2011, an Oregon woman, Marla Cooper, claimed her uncle was the elusive plane bandit Burdened by guilt over her knowledge surrounding the case, Marla Cooper claimed she had a 40-year-old family secret protecting her uncle, a man named Lynn Doyle Cooper. Marla Cooper said she was eight years old when her uncle, whom she called LD Cooper, came to her home, badly injured, for Thanksgiving in 1971 - the day after the infamous incident. He claimed his injuries were the result of a car crash. Later, she said, her parents came to believe that L.D. Cooper was the hijacker. Mrs Cooper never saw her uncle again after that day and was told he died in 1999. It was the FBI's most promising lead for the mystery of who was behind the hijacking.  WHO ARE THE CITIZEN SLEUTHS? The three scientists making up the Citizen Sleuths team work independently and with law enforcement to dive deep into the conspiracy of the DB Cooper hijack case.  The team is made up of principal investigator Tom Kaye, who is an associate researcher at Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle, Washington.  He works with Carol Abraczinskas,  Scientific/Biological Illustrator at the University of Michigan, and Alan Stone, President of Aston Metallurgical Services Co., Inc. in Wheeling, Illinois.   The team has operated for the last three years without any government funding in an attempt to finally solve one of the most mysterious cases in the country's history. To this day, it remains the only unsolved US hijacking case. Tom Kaye is an associate researcher at Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture in Seattle, Washington Kaye and his team used an electron microscope to analyze particles too small to be seen by the naked eye. This technology is not new, however, it has been modernized with the ability to find the source of the particles. In March of 2009 and August 2011, the team was given access to the FBI's archive to examine the physical evidence of the case.  The researchers list a number of conclusions from their thorough analysis of Cooper's tie: Alan Stone is the President of Aston Metallurgical Services Co., Inc. in Wheeling, Illinois '1) The tie reasonably belonged to Cooper: A probability analysis was never done to estimate the likelihood of the black tie found on the plane belonging to Cooper. This probablility analysis shows that it is reasonable to assume that the tie belonged to the hijacker. This is a crucial first step since all the particles found on the tie tell a story, for that to be Cooper's story, there needed to be some critical review of the likelihood that the tie belonged to Cooper.  Carol Abraczinskas, Scientific/Biological Illustrator at the University of Michigan 2) Titanium metal was rare and exotic narrowing the field of possible D.B. Cooper suspects: The titanium particles on the tie was the most dramatic finding in this research. Most other metals would have to be written off as contamination or too common to be of any use. The additional finding that the titanium was not alloyed, allowed further restrictions on where Cooper could have acquired these unusual flecks. Cooper worked at or had access to a plant that used titanium and this fact alone reduces the number of potential suspects from millions down to hundreds. 3) A tie would have been worn by managers or engineers in metalworking plants: The spiral aluminum chips are only made using metalworking machinery. Since they were found on a tie, that suggests he was either an engineer or manager who went out on the shop floor. Only managers and engineers wore ties in metalworking plants at that time. 4) Chemical plants used pure titanium and other corrosion resistant metals: Pure titanium and 5000 series aluminum found on the tie have high anti-corrosive properties. In 1971 the most common place these two metals were found together would be chemical plants or the metal fabrication facility that built the components for the plant. Secondarily would be the companies who recovered scrap metal from these types of factories. This research shows that any new search for D.B. Cooper should begin in these areas.'   Read more: Titanium Particles from Cooper's Tie New evidence: Was DB Cooper a Boeing employee? | KING5.com 'Mad Men' creator: No, Don isn't D.B.

Booked at the end of 2016, the announcement includes 100 new 737 MAX 8s, SpiceJet's current order for 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs which were previously attributed to an unidentified customer on Boeing's Orders & Deliveries website, as well as purchase rights for 50 additional airplanes. "The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began, with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort," said Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, SpiceJet. "With the next generation of 737 and the 737 MAX we are sure that we can be competitive and grow profitably." SpiceJet, all-Boeing jet operator, placed its first order with Boeing in 2005 for Next-Generation (NG) 737s and currently operates 32 737 NGs in its fleet. "We are honoured to build upon more than a decade of partnership with SpiceJet with their commitment of up to 205 airplanes," said Ray Conner, vice chairman, The Boeing Company. "The economics of the 737 MAXs will allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectivity within India and beyond, and offer their customers a superior passenger experience." The 737 MAX incorporates the latest technology CFM International LEAP-1B engines, Advanced Technology winglets and other improvements to deliver the highest efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market. The new airplane will deliver 20 percent lower fuel use than the first Next-Generation 737s and the lowest operating costs in its class – 8 percent per seat less than its nearest competitor. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | SpiceJet | 737 MAX | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Dubai Airports celebrates Chinese New Year Indulge in romance at Al Bustan Palace, A Ritz-Carlton Hotel Emirates recognises top employees Bahrain set to launch sightseeing bus tours Royal Jordanian to boost presence in 14 cities Miral to create 1,000 new tourism jobs in Abu Dhabi Egyptian group Abu Soma plans Red Sea resort HLG Contracting wins Dubai mixed-use tower deal Desert Adventures Tourism eyes German-speaking tourist markets Boeing Q4 revenues down 1pc to $23.3bn Farhat Tours celebrates successful 10 years Fun-filled shopping experience awaits Bahrain's mall visitors Farhat International promotes two team members Kempinski Palm Jumeirah to host Kempinski Avenues 2017 Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel scoops 20 awards at Horeca Ascott appoints new director of sales in Muscat 'Google Search' top choice for travel inspiration Autumn Fair opens in Bahrain Connections Events gets top recognition at Eventex Awards Enjoy a romantic getaway at Al Wadi Desert, Ras Al Khaimah Mövenpick Hotels accelerates expansion plans Abu Dhabi records 4.4m tourists in 2016 New Muscat airport terminal to open by 2017 end RJ booth at Madrid tourism fair attracts large visitor numbers Abu Dhabi airport traffic tops 24.5m in 2016 Oman Air opens new grooming centre Stratajet partners with Mr and Mrs Smith Turkish Airlines, PIA expand code share deal Etihad expands B787 network in the Levant, Far East Spain Tourism launches new website for GCC customers Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

(Swiss), the national airline of Switzerland. Through the agreement, Swiss will integrate Jeppesen Crew Tracking into their operations to optimize crew planning and recover from disruptions to planned crew schedules. “Using Jeppesen Crew Tracking services enables us to manage daily operations in an efficient way, through the ability to quickly resolve the myriad operational issues that can result in changes to scheduled crew rosters,” said Daniel Silvestri, head of Operations Planning, Swiss. “This service from Jeppesen will support early detection of potential crew schedule issues and provides multiple recovery options, with associated costs directly calculated and displayed. This will allow us to make the most informed decisions to repair crew schedules in real time.” Jeppesen Crew Tracking is a component of a family of crew management solutions that optimize operations and increase efficiency for airlines. The data analytics-driven tool employs modeling and simulation to reveal insights that lead to better decision-making and actions. This provides airlines with the ability to detect, resolve, and follow-up on changes to originally published crew plans. The system supports an on-demand approach to issues management, with an alert monitor feature that warns of problems that need to be addressed. To complement the Crew Tracking solution, Swiss will also enhance its crew management capabilities through the use of the crew communication tool Jeppesen Crew Access. This allows crew to easily check-in/check-out and view relevant roster and itinerary elements. “We are pleased to team with Swiss to enhance their day-of flight operations related to crew management and optimization services,” said Peter Andersson, vice president, Jeppesen Crew Management. “Our Crew Tracking solution will provide Swiss with disruption management services, monitoring factors such as short connections, compliance with regulations and union agreements, missing check-ins, invalid visas, and more, to keep Swiss flights operating as scheduled on a global scale.” PR Newswire http://www.prnewswire.com More about PR Newswire PR Newswire is the leading global provider of marketing and communications solutions that let you optimize and distribute multimedia content to actively engage all key audiences, across all traditional, digital, social and mobile channels, anywhere in the world.

In pursuit of its goal to power every flight at Sea-Tac with sustainable aviation biofuel, Sea-Tac is among the first airports in North America to work with aviation, energy and research partners to systematically evaluate all aspects to developing a commercial-scale program from scratch. “Unlike the biofuel itself, fuel blending and delivery infrastructure cannot grow on trees,” said Port of Seattle Commissioner John Creighton. “We needed this comprehensive analysis to confirm that we can offer commercial airlines feasible and sustainable delivery options while reducing our environmental footprint and being a good neighbor to surrounding communities.” Sustainable aviation biofuel reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 50 to 80 percent compared to fossil fuel. This is because a biofuel feedstock, or source material, absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) during its growth cycle (e.g. photosynthesis). Using biofuel also reduces sulfur emissions, soot and particulates. The study evaluated more than 30 sites around Washington State that could potentially support the receipt, blending, storage, and delivery infrastructure required to supply Sea-Tac Airport with up to 50 million gallons per year of sustainable alternative aviation fuel (also referred to as aviation biofuel). Potential sites were evaluated both for the ability to accommodate near-term (12-18 months) supplies of five million gallons per year and long-term (2-10 years) supplies of more than 50 million gallons per year. In pursuing an integrated aviation biofuels supply chain, sites were selected based on the capacity to accommodate delivery of unblended biofuel by pipe, rail, barge, and/or truck, and were evaluated based on land use, zoning, and environmental considerations. The most-feasible sites were determined based on the construction costs of the needed infrastructure, environmental constraints, permitting and planning, and other contingences to help determine an overall score and final recommendation. - A small biofuel receiving and blending facility at the Sea-Tac Airport Fuel Farm is the most cost-effective solution in the short term; - The Anacortes-area refineries are the most cost-effective options for large volumes of aviation biofuel over the long term due to their access to marine, rail, truck, and the Olympic Pipeline; and - The Phillips 66/Olympic Pipeline Company sites in Renton also showed potential to accommodate receipt and blending facilities for moderate-to-large biofuel volumes over the long term. “We’re using all of the Port’s expertise and partnering with Washington State’s greatest institutions to pursue this vision of making travel more sustainable,” said Port of Seattle CEO Ted Fick. “While we increase our operations, we work relentlessly to reduce emissions, lower our waste and limit our environmental impact.” “Commercial aviation is committed to reducing the industry’s carbon footprint, and biofuels are key to achieving that goal,” said Ellie Wood, regional director of environmental strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We’re encouraged that this study shows the viability of making a biofuel blend available to every flight at Sea-Tac Airport. As part of our global strategy to develop and commercialize biofuel, we’re proud to support our hometown partners and keep the Pacific Northwest in the forefront of these innovative efforts.” “This study represents a critical milestone toward powering our planes with a sustainable aviation biofuel made right here at home,” said Joe Sprague, Alaska Airlines’ senior vice president of communications and external relations. “After recently flying the first commercial flight with new biofuel made from forest residuals from the Pacific Northwest, Alaska Airlines is eager to see how biofuel flights can become a daily reality at our hometown hub at Sea-Tac.” An aviation biofuel production plant was not considered in this feasibility study. However, once a long-term aviation biofuel source is identified, it will be an important next step to determine its relative proximity to the sites considered in the study. The closer the source of the aviation biofuel to a biofuel blending and integration facility, the lower the costs associated with the fuel.

In February last year, the airline said it would use the NBN’s Sky Muster satellites to offer free Wi-Fi for onboard passengers through a partnership with US satellite company, ViaSat. Qantas began initial trials of the service on a Boeing 747 and will now commence testing on Boeing 737S and A330 Airbuses. The builder of the NBN, nbn, today released a test agreement detailing the terms of the trial for Qantas to assess the “functionality and performance” of the “aeronautical mobile satellite service” and to provide periodic feedback over nine months to nbn, to help inform the final mobility product. According to the proof-of-concept agreement, the service is a Layer 3 virtual private networking (VPN) service on the nbn network delivered over satellite, with nbn managing the connection between the air-network interface (ANI) and it’s mobility network interface (M-NNI). Following the initial announcement in February 2016, Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said in a statement, “You won’t be limited to checking your email or Facebook – it’s going to be about watching the football live, streaming your favourite TV show or movie, catching up on the latest YouTube videos, or shopping online.” “As a premium carrier, delivering value for money to our customers is extremely important to us. That’s why we’ll be offering access to Wi-Fi for free, on top of all the other things that are included when you fly Qantas,” he said. Since April 2015, NBN has offered satellite services to end users following the launch of its first Sky Muster Satellite later in October 2015. The company then launched its second satellite the following year in October 2016. However, the company tackled software upgrade issues as its Sky Muster II entered orbit, resulting in an outage that affected regional areas serviced by the satellite.

The aircraft was owned and operated by Istanbul-based ACT Airlines and was on final approach at Manas in Bishkek when it crashed, destroying several houses. Its registration was TC-MCL, a 747F that first flew in January 2003 and was originally operated by Singapore Airlines Cargo. The flight, TK 6491, was operating from Hong Kong to Bishkek and on to Istanbul. ACT Airlines operates on behalf of Saudia Cargo and under the MyCargo brand. Manas airport was closed after the crash, but resumed operations at 1:30pm local time. ACT Airlines´ fleet includes eight 747Fs. Its last C-check was performed Nov. 6, 2015. In a statement, ACT Airlines said the Kyrgyzstan and Turkish governments had begun an investigation. Russia’s Interstate Aviation Committee was also reported to have sent representatives to Bishkek to support the investigation. Boeing said its “technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities”. ACT Airlines named the four crew members who were killed as pilot Ibrahim Gürcan Diranci, co-pilot Kazim Ondul, loadmaster Melih Aslan and flight technician Ihsan Koca. There were differing accounts on the number of people who died on the ground, but at least 30 were killed and more injured. ACT said there was no clear information about what caused the crash. “The flight with cargo from Hong Kong to Bishkek and Istanbul went airborne as planned, after all the checks were carried out, and was approaching Bishkek Airport without encountering any setback or problems during the flight,” the company stated. “The crew rested for 69 hours in Hong Kong and checked out for the flight to complete the six-hour flight from Hong Kong to Bishkek. The airplane took off with 85,618kg of general cargo loaded safely. There are no faults recorded in the technical log book of the aircraft.” Polina Montag-Girmes montag.girmes@gmail.com KarenWalker Karen.walker@penton.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Flyadeal, which is set to start services in mid-2017, is aiming to operate a fleet of up to 50 narrow body jets by 2020 and Saleh al-Jasser, director general of state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, said last year Flyadeal would operate leased Airbus or Boeing jets. Airbus's Middle East Managing Director Fouad Attar told Reuters Flyadeal would operate six of his planes. He was speaking on the sidelines of a news conference in Riyadh announcing an 80 aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia's only operating low-cost airline, flynas. An Airbus spokesman later confirmed to Reuters by phone the aircraft type and leasing arrangements for Flyadeal. The current model A320s are being leased through an undisclosed leasor and delivery starts in the second half of the year, the spokesman said, adding that no further deals had been done with Flyadeal beyond the six aircraft. Saudi Arabian Airlines did not immediately respond an to emailed request for comment. An Airbus A320neo, the latest version of the jet, was displayed at Flyadeal's launch in April 2016. The Airbus spokesman also confirmed Saudi start-up SaudiGulf Airlines, which recently started operations, has taken delivery of the four current model A320s it ordered.

The plane slammed into the village of Dacha-Suu on the outskirts of the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, killed 37 people, and destroyed at least 15 houses, Kyrgyzstan’s emergency situations ministry said. Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev drew the conclusion that “crew error” had led to the crash citing preliminary information, Kyrgyzstan’s state-run news agency, Kabar, said. Poor visibility due to thick mist has been cited as a possible factor in the crash. Abulgaziev said other planes landed safely at Manas airport before the crash. Pictures of the immediate aftermath of the accident showed a portion of the village badly damaged. In one image, the plane’s smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car’s roof was completely ripped off in another. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree declaring Tuesday a day of mourning. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan’s capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. It crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the Manas airport, according to Kyrgyzstan’s state-run Kabar Agency. It’s not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 — including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline’s website. The precise breakdown of how many villagers and crew members were killed has not yet been released. One of the plane’s black boxes was found at the scene and it will be examined by experts from Moscow, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of emergency situations, told Kabar. The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines — the country’s national carrier — under its flight number. The flight’s ultimate destination was Istanbul, Turkey, Abulgaziev said, according to Turkey’s Anadolu news agency.. ACT Airlines, which operated the plane, confirmed the news of the crash on its website. “The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available,” the statement said. “Boeing extends its deepest condolences to the families of those who perished in the Turkish Airlines cargo Flight TK6491 accident near Manas Airport Kyrgyzstan, operated by ACT Airlines, as well as its wishes for the recovery of those injured,” Boeing said in an emailed statement. “A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities.” Turkish Airlines expressed its condolences to ACT in a tweet. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company’s website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747’s enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard.

Cooper hijacking case Posted 7:58 am, January 16, 2017, by CBS4 Web Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Google Pinterest The FBI closed the case last year, but that hasn’t stopped amateur investigators from finding new clues in the infamous D.B. Cooper case. The case has remained a mystery since Nov. 24, 1971, when a man hijacked a Boeing 727, obtained $200,000 in ransom money and then parachuted to safety. Despite an extensive manhunt and decades-long FBI investigation, the identity of the hijacker has never been determined. The case has spawned countless theories. In 2007, the FBI opened the case to the public, sharing files and evidence. A scientific team analyzed particles from the clip-on tie Cooper left behind. A powerful electron microscope found cerium, strontium sulfide and pure titanium on the tie, according to KING-TV. Tom Kaye, lead researcher for a group called “Citizen Sleuths,” said the elements discovered on the tie were rarely used in 1971. However, they were being used in the aerospace industry in the 1960s and 1970s, when Boeing was developing a supersonic transport plane. Kaye and his colleagues theorize that Cooper may have been a Boeing employee or contractor. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these (manufacturing machines). He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye told KING-TV. Kaye and his colleagues are appealing for help from the public on what the materials may have been used for. They’re hoping “old-timers” from the aerospace industry in the Pacific Northwest could be particularly useful. Find more information about Citizen Sleuths and their investigation at their website.

Post the state government policy and the Vibrant Gujarat Summit, MSMEs are eyeing a larger pie in aerospace and defence sectors through component supply to the likes of Airbus, Boeing and Rolls Royce, among others. MSMEs are upbeat especially in the wake of memorandums of understanding signed during the summit that would lead to further opportunities in the aerospace and defence component manufacturing. For instance, several companies based of Gujarat, especially Saurashtra region who already supply precision components to aircraft manufacturers as well as defence and space agencies including ISRO are anticipating a rise in business by anywhere between 25 per cent and 40 per cent in the next 2-4 years. "With the likes of Airbus and Boeing signing MoUs in Gujarat, there is now an increased scope for precision component suppliers like us. We anticipate double-digit growth in business opportunities since the foreign OEMs are already familiar with India-based component manufacturers, even MSMEs," said Ashok Surelia, managing director of Surelia Wire-Cut Pvt Ltd. The defence and aerospace sectors have seen at least over Rs 10,000 crore worth of MoUs being signed during VGGS. Among these, Reliance Defence and Deepak Fertilizer signed MoUs worth Rs 2,500 crore and Rs 3,000 crore for manufacturing set-ups in the state. On the other hand, Rajkot-based Jaivel Aerospace signed a MoU with Boeing for setting up a defence specific training centre under the Skill India program. "Amidst growing opportunities in the defence and aerospace sector, there will be need for trained manpower as well in future. The MoU has been signed keeping this requirement in mind," said Praveen Koti, head-business development of Jaivel Aerospace Ltd. The component manufacturers are also upbeat over union minister of defence Manohar Parrikar hinting at a possibility of government company setting up a unit in Gujarat that could also bring business for the former. While stating that around 20 companies have been granted licenses in defence manufacturing units in Gujarat, Parrikar also said that the minister would later visit the state to discuss possibilities of a defence PSU's foray.

MUST WATCH Cargo plane crashes into village 00:50 Story highlights Tuesday declared a day of mourning in Kyrgyzstan One of the plane's black boxes has been found (CNN)Bad weather and possible 'crew error' appeared to be an early focus of an inquiry into what caused a Boeing 747 freighter to crash Monday in a village near Kyrgyzstan's capital. The jumbo Turkish freighter slammed into the village of Dacha-Suu on the outskirts of Bishkek, killing 37 people and destroying at least 15 houses, Kyrgyzstan's emergency situations ministry said. Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev blamed the crash on "crew error," but offered no details about the claim. The deputy prime minister said on Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar news agency that the government had reviewed preliminary information from the accident. Air accident investigations typically take months. A thick mist caused poor visibility at the time of the crash and was being cited as a possible contributor to Monday's crash. Abulgaziev said other planes landed safely at Manas airport before the crash.

Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos: Cargo plane crash in Kyrgyzstan village Rescuers carry the body of a victim at the crash site on January 16.

In one image, the plane's smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car's roof was completely ripped off in another. The tail of a crashed Boeing 747 cargo plane lies in a residential area outside Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree declaring Tuesday a day of mourning. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan's capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. It crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the Manas airport, according to Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar Agency. It's not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 -- including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline's website. The precise breakdown of how many villagers and crew members were killed has not yet been released. One of the plane's black boxes was found at the scene and it will be examined by experts from Moscow, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of emergency situations, told Kabar. The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines -- the country's national carrier -- under its flight number. The flight's ultimate destination was Istanbul, Turkey, Abulgaziev said, according to Turkey's Anadolu news agency.. Poor visibility was likely a factor. ACT Airlines confirmed the news of the crash on its website. "The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available," the statement said. Boeing also extended its condolences in an emailed statement, as did Turkish Airlines in a tweet. "A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities," the Boeing statement said. A Kyrgyz firefighter inspects the plane crash site. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company's website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747's enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The wreckage of a Turkish cargo plane is seen after it crashed in a village outside Bishkek. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard. CNN's Jon Ostrower reported from New York, while Joshua Berlinger wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Joe Sterling reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Emma Burrows in Moscow, Donie O'Sullivan in New York, Zahra Ullah in Hong Kong and Hande Atay and Merieme Arif in Atlanta contributed to this report.

MUST WATCH Cargo plane crashes into village 00:50 Story highlights Tuesday declared a day of mourning in Kyrgyzstan One of the plane's black boxes has been found (CNN)Bad weather and possible 'crew error' appeared to be an early focus of an inquiry into what caused a Boeing 747 freighter to crash Monday in a village near Kyrgyzstan's capital. The jumbo Turkish freighter slammed into the village of Dacha-Suu on the outskirts of Bishkek, killing 37 people and destroying at least 15 houses, Kyrgyzstan's emergency situations ministry said. Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev blamed the crash on "crew error," but offered no details about the claim. The deputy prime minister said on Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar news agency that the government had reviewed preliminary information from the accident. Air accident investigations typically take months. A thick mist caused poor visibility at the time of the crash and was being cited as a possible contributor to Monday's crash. Abulgaziev said other planes landed safely at Manas airport before the crash.

In one image, the plane's smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car's roof was completely ripped off in another. The tail of a crashed Boeing 747 cargo plane lies in a residential area outside Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree declaring Tuesday a day of mourning. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan's capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. It crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the Manas airport, according to Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar Agency. It's not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 -- including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline's website. The precise breakdown of how many villagers and crew members were killed has not yet been released. One of the plane's black boxes was found at the scene and it will be examined by experts from Moscow, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of emergency situations, told Kabar. The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines -- the country's national carrier -- under its flight number. The flight's ultimate destination was Istanbul, Turkey, Abulgaziev said, according to Turkey's Anadolu news agency.. Poor visibility was likely a factor. ACT Airlines confirmed the news of the crash on its website. "The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available," the statement said. Boeing also extended its condolences in an emailed statement, as did Turkish Airlines in a tweet. "A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities," the Boeing statement said. A Kyrgyz firefighter inspects the plane crash site. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company's website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747's enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The wreckage of a Turkish cargo plane is seen after it crashed in a village outside Bishkek. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard.

The order includes 100 of Boeing’s 737 Max single-aisle jets and renegotiated terms for 55 previously ordered aircraft, SpiceJet said in a statement Friday. The airline also has options to purchase another 50 Boeing aircraft, including the 777 and 787 Dreamliner wide-bodies. The commitment, which was included in Boeing’s 2016 order tally, comes as the Chicago-based plane maker races to catch Airbus in narrow-body sales, the largest source of profit for the companies. The deal for the Max, which competes with Airbus’s A320neo workhorse, also helps Boeing widen its footprint in the fast-growing South Asian market. Most of SpiceJet’s low-cost rivals fly the European company’s aircraft. “India is an important market both Airbus and Boeing can’t ignore,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. The SpiceJet order gives Boeing “a lifeline. There’s a lot more to grow in India than other parts of Asia.” Rapidly expanding Indian carriers will need 1,850 new planes valued at $265 billion in 20 years, according to a Boeing forecast. Single-aisle planes will make up the bulk of the new deliveries. The Asia-Pacific region, which is eclipsing North America as the world’s largest aircraft market, will need 15,130 new aircraft valued at $2.3 trillion in the next 20 years, as economic growth boosts middle-class travel, according to Boeing. That represents 38 percent of the global requirement. Friday’s deal adds to the 348 jetliner sales garnered by the U.S. planemaker in India. SpiceJet, which is based in Gurgaon near New Delhi, and AirIndia Express are the only budget carriers to use Boeing aircraft in the country. SpiceJet shares climbed 2.5 percent to 65.50 rupees in Mumbai. Boeing rose less than 1 percent to $159.02 at 9:55 a.m. in New York. The airline placed firm orders for 100 737 Max 8 aircraft, with a cumulative list price of $11 billion, before the discounts that are customary for large customers. Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 6 that the carrier was close to signing a deal for at least 92 planes valued at $10.1 billion and that the total could rise based on negotiations for discounts and service contracts. “We spent a considerable amount of time negotiating and finalizing the commercial terms, including maintenance of the aircraft,” Chairman Ajay Singh said in an interview. “It was important for us to get all the commercial terms right.” Deliveries will begin in July 2018 and continue through 2024. The carrier and Boeing also discussed a proposed stretch of the largest Max, Singh told reporters. The so-called 10X, Boeing’s response to Airbus’s fast-selling A321neo, would be available in 2020 and seat as many as 230 travelers. The order signals a resurgence for SpiceJet after it almost collapsed more than two years ago. The expansion also sets up sharpened competition against IndiGo, operated by   InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., which has about 400 Airbus aircraft awaiting delivery. IndiGo dominates the world’s fastest-growing major aviation market, with a 42 percent share. SpiceJet has 13 percent. A representative for Airbus declined to comment. The world’s two biggest plane makers are vying to serve a crucial market with an emerging middle-class that is flying for the first time and where passenger traffic is growing at twice the pace of nearest rival China. While the growth is prompting India airlines to order planes, they also have to contend with airport infrastructure that hasn’t kept pace. Limited landing and parking slots extend the time circling above airports such as Mumbai during peak hours, wasting fuel.

Michael Spooneybarger/Reuters/File | Caption Fullscreen Loading... J Walker Glascock January 15, 2017 —Following a Friday meeting with President-elect Donald Trump, Lockheed chief executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters that the aerospace giant is close to a contract which would lower the cost of the F-35 fighter jet and create 1,800 jobs at the company's facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The meeting, which took place at Trump Tower in Manhattan, was the latest in a string of conversations between Ms. Hewson and Mr. Trump over the cost of the top-of-the-line fighter jet. Trump initially expressed his displeasure with the enormous cost of the high-tech fighter jet via Twitter. Several weeks later he was joined by Ms. Hewson and Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday to discuss contracts and military spending. “We’re trying to get costs down, costs,” Trump told reporters after the meeting at his resort. “Primarily the F-35. That program is very, very expensive.” The F-35 deal, which was previously estimated in at $400 billion over 15 years for 2,443 planes, is easily the military’s largest weapons project.  What do you know about US women in war? A quiz. Even before Mr. Trump took to Twitter, the price of the F-35 had been decreasing with each order produced. Back in November, days prior to the election, the Pentagon announced a 3.7 percent price cut on the average cost per plane over those produced in the previous batch. The new contract, valued at $6.1 billion for the following 57 fighter jets, represented an overall 58 percent decrease from the cost of the planes on the original 2011 order, according to AviationPros. Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program executive officer, said the contract represents a "fair and reasonable deal" for the government, as well as the international partnership involved and the industry as a whole. "We will continue to negotiate in good faith with industry to keep the F-35 affordable and provide the best possible value for our customers," Bogdan said in a statement. But Mr. Trump used his online presence to continue drawing attention to the F-35 deal, even asking Lockheed’s competitor, Boeing, for a price quote on their most-similar model, the older F/A-18 Super Hornet.  According to authorities, the aircraft are not exactly comparable, as the F-35 is a stealth fighter while the F/A-18 is not. But Mr. Trump’s message seemed to resonate with Hewson. “I had a very good conversation with President-elect Trump this afternoon and assured him that I’ve heard his message loud and clear about reducing the cost of the F-35,” she said the following Friday, as reported by The New York Times. “I gave him my personal commitment to drive the cost down aggressively.” "It's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget," Trump said in a press conference in New York on Wednesday. "I don't like that.... We're going to do some big things on the F-35 program and perhaps the F-18 program. We're going to get those costs way down." Following that press conference, Lockheed Martin share prices fell over 1 percent. Two days later Hewson was in Manhattan meeting with Mr. Trump. “I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price,”  Hewson said from the lobby of Trump Tower following their meeting, as reported by Reuters.

Sign-Up × Hewson also said the deal included an additional 1,800 jobs at the company's location in Fort Worth, Texas, although she added no further details as to what exactly those positions will entail. According to estimates by Lockheed Martin, the company’s program currently accounts for 38,900 jobs in Texas and contributes an overall $3.4 billion to the state economically, according to the company's website dedicated to the F-35 Lightning II. Lockheed Martin share prices had gone up about one percent following Friday’s announcement in which Hewson also said she would add “thousands and thousands of jobs” across the company’s 45-state supply chain.

Cooper from recollections of the passengers and crew of a Northwest Airlines jet he hijacked between Portland and Seattle on Thanksgiving eve in 1971. The FBI says it's no longer actively investigating the unsolved mystery of D.B. Cooper. The bureau announced it's "exhaustively reviewed all credible leads" during its 45-year investigation. (AP-Photo, file) Related Coverage FBI No Longer Investigating D.B. Cooper Skyjacking Case SEATTLE (AP) — Amateur scientists chosen by the Seattle FBI to search for clues in the mystery of the skyjacker known as D.B. Cooper may have found new evidence. KING-TV reports a team has been analyzing particles taken from a clip-on tie left by Cooper after he hijacked a passenger jet in 1971 and then vanished out the back wearing a parachute and pack with $200,000. An electron microscope located over 100,000 particles including Cerium, Strontium Sulfide and pure titanium. Lead researcher Tom Kaye says the elements could have been found in the manufacturing of Boeing’s high-tech Super Sonic Transport plane. Kaye wonders if Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor who wore a tie to work and said the public’s help is needed to discern whether that’s possible. The FBI closed the case last year. ___ Information from: KING-TV, http://www.king5.com/ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Amateur sleuths make breakthrough after FBI quits 45-year investigation Published time: 15 Jan, 2017 18:34Edited time: 15 Jan, 2017 18:35 Get short URL Artist sketches released by the FBI of a man calling himself D.B. Cooper © Reuters The tale of the world’s most notorious skyjacker, DB Cooper, has fascinated the world and frustrated law enforcement for decades but now, after 45 years, a group of scientists may finally have found the evidence needed to crack the case. On November 24, 1971, a man calling himself Dan Cooper hijacked a Northwest Orient Boeing 727 plane claiming to have a bomb in his briefcase. He demanded a refuelling truck for the plane to be waiting in Seattle airport, four parachutes and $200,000 (roughly $12.5 million in modern currency, adjusted for inflation). After refueling the plane and taking to the skies once more, the man - who was later dubbed DB Cooper - parachuted from the plane in a business suit with his ransom money and was never seen again. Some of the bank notes from the ransom money were discovered in 1980 but, despite interviewing all identified witnesses in the case and following up on a vast number of tips, the FBI gave up after 45 years of investigation, saying it had “exhaustively reviewed all credible leads" and opted to reallocate resources elsewhere. READ MORE: #Afriqiyah hostage crisis: Hijackers surrender in Malta, all 118 on board released (PHOTOS) Now a new breakthrough comes one year after the FBI’s decision to close the case as a group of scientists called Citizen Sleuths have discovered tens of thousands of particles of rare earth minerals including Cerium, Strontium, Sulfide and titanium using a powerful electron microscope, on the tie the notorious skyjacker left behind on the plane. The unique combination of particles has led the team to believe that the mystery man might have been an employee or contractor working at Boeing, who were developing a supersonic transport plane in the 1960s and 1970s that was equipped with onboard television and radar screens that were unique for that time. The manufacture of these screens required such rare earth elements, which allowed the team to narrow their focus. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these (manufacturing machines). He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” lead researcher Tom Kaye told King 5. The team of amateur sleuths were given unprecedented access to the FBI’s crime vault, the first time civilians have been allowed to do so in the bureau’s history. Before long, they had stumbled on this new discovery - which could soon prove to be the critical moment in cracking the case. As they are a civilian team, Kaye’s group are only focusing on the evidence rather than chasing suspects, but they have encouraged the public to join in solving the mystery of the world’s only unsolved skyjacking case by visiting their website and reviewing all of their findings so far.

Cooper may have worked for Boeing Published January 15, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print   A team of scientists selected by federal officials in Seattle have come across new evidence in the mystery of D.B. Cooper. The Citizen Sleuths have been analyzing particles found on the clip-on-tie that Cooper left behind after he hijacked a Northwest Orient airplane in November 1971. Tom Kaye, the lead researcher of the group, told King 5 on Friday that a powerful microscope used in their investigation has found more than 100,000 particles on the JCPenny tie. He added that the group has been trying to identify where some of the particles, including Cerium, Strontium, Sulfide and titanium, may have come from. More on this... FBI no longer actively investigating D.B. Cooper case DNA Test Fails to Solve D.B. Cooper Mystery One place where the different elements were being used was at Boeing for their high-tech Super Sonic Transport plane, which was being developed in the 1960s and 1970s. Kaye says the evidence could point to Cooper being a contractor or an employee for Boeing where he would’ve had to worn a tie. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these (manufacturing machines). He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye told King 5. Kaye added that he’s looking for help from the public in identifying where some of the particles found on the tie could’ve come from. The public can reach the researchers on the Citizen Sleuths website. The FBI announced in July that it was no longer actively investigating the case, saying that it had “exhaustively reviewed all credible leads" during its 45-year investigation and has redirected those resources to other priorities. The FBI has investigated since a man calling himself Dan Cooper hijacked a Boeing 727 over the Northwest on Nov. 24, 1971. He later jumped out the back of the plane wearing a business suit and a parachute after receiving $200,000 in ransom money. No sign of Cooper has emerged, though bundles of his cash, matched by serial numbers, were found in 1980. The FBI says it has conducted searches, collected all available evidence and interviewed all identified witnesses. It says it's chased an immense number of tips but none have resulted in identifying the hijacker. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Click for more from King 5.

Cooper from recollections of the passengers and crew of a Northwest Airlines jet he hijacked between Portland and Seattle on Thanksgiving...   (AP-Photo, file) (Newser) – Could legendary hijacker DB Cooper have been a Boeing employee? A group of amateur scientists says it has found information that could link Cooper with the aerospace industry in Washington state in the early 1970s, KING-5 reports. The man who became known as DB Cooper famously hijacked a Northwest Orient passenger jet on Thanksgiving eve in 1971 only to vanish forever, presumably having parachuted off the plane with $200,000 given to him by the FBI when the plane briefly touched down in Seattle. Cooper left behind a clip-on tie, and the group, Citizen Sleuths, which was put together by the Seattle FBI, has been analyzing particles found on that tie. Among those particles: rare earth elements, which, the lead researcher says, are "used in very narrow fields, for very specific things." In 1971, one of the few places they were being used was Boeing, as part of the Super Sonic Transport plane it was developing at the time. That has led researchers to wonder whether Cooper was a Boeing employee or contractor, possibly "an engineer or a manager in one of the plants" who would have worn a tie to work. The team is now asking for help from members of the public, like people who may have worked in the aerospace industry around that time. Researchers are publishing a running list of particles found on the tie, and are asking anyone with knowledge to weigh in on what the materials could have been used for.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   4% Hilarious 75% Intriguing 2% Depressing 10% Brilliant 1% Scary 9% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 34 comments Next on Newser: Parents Building a Neighborhood Just for Autistic Adults Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 34 comments Raj that!

See Offers Nation & World Posted January 16 increase font size Amateur scientists pursue clues in D.B. Cooper skyjacking case The sleuths say particles on Cooper's clip-on tie suggest he was a manager or engineer in aerospace. By Amy B WangThe Washington Post Share Comment Read Article It was “one of the longest and most exhaustive investigations” in FBI history – and to this day remains the only unsolved skyjacking in the United States. In 1971, a well-dressed passenger hijacked a Northwest Orient flight, demanded $200,000 and later escaped by parachuting out of the back of the plane with the ransom money. But who exactly was “D.B. Cooper,” the mysterious man who managed to pull off the heist and disappear without a trace? More than four decades later, three amateur scientists think they may have found evidence that would narrow down Cooper’s identity to that of an aerospace engineer or a manager. The scientists, working for a group called Citizen Sleuths, said they have been analyzing particles found on a clip-on necktie that Cooper left on his seat – 18E – before jumping out of the plane. To the naked eye, the piece of fabric was a nondescript black tie from J.C. Penney. But to the modern-day scientists, the tie was an “incredibly fortunate” piece of evidence in the investigation. “A tie is one of the only articles of clothing that isn’t washed on a regular basis,” reads a section on the Citizen Sleuths website devoted solely to the tie. “It picks up dirt and grime just like any other piece of clothing, but that accumulation never truly gets ‘reset’ in the washing machine. Each of those particles comes from something and somewhere and can tell a story if the proper instruments like electron microscopes are used.” Using a powerful electron microscope, the scientists say, they have identified more than 100,000 particles of “rare earth elements” on the tie, including Cerium, Strontium sulfide and pure titanium, according to the Associated Press. Of those, titanium was the most notable. “Titanium was a rare metal in 1971 and this makes it extremely unlikely it is a post-event contamination,” Citizen Sleuths notes on its site, which lays out in painstaking detail all of the findings from the case. “Its presence constrains Cooper to a limited number of managers or engineers in the titanium field that would wear ties to work.” At the time, they noted, the element was used extensively by the military in aircraft and helicopters. Scientists think he may have worked at Boeing, which at the time happened to be developing a Super Sonic Transport plane that used those elements, Tom Kaye, a lead researcher with Citizen Sleuths, told King 5 News. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these ‘manufacturing machines'” Kaye told the news station. “He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants.” The group is asking anyone from the public with information to contact researchers through the Citizen Sleuths website. “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say, ‘Oh my gosh, I know what that means having those particles on the tie,”’ Kaye told the news station. The mystery began on Nov. 24, 1971, when a nondescript man going by the name of Dan Cooper purchased a one-way ticket from Portland, Ore., to Seattle directly from the Northwest Orient Airlines counter on the day of the flight. He used cash to pay for his ticket, then boarded the plane. Authorities later described him as someone in his mid-40s, dressed as an “executive” in a suit, a white shirt and what probably is the now-infamous black tie. The agency’s official summary of how the hijacking unfolded reads like the plot of a Hollywood thriller from another era: “He ordered a drink – bourbon and soda – while the flight was waiting to take off. A short time after 3 p.m., he handed the stewardess a note indicating that he had a bomb in his briefcase and wanted her to sit with him. “The stunned stewardess did as she was told. Opening a cheap attaché case, Cooper showed her a glimpse of a mass of wires and red colored sticks and demanded that she write down what he told her. Soon, she was walking a new note to the captain of the plane that demanded four parachutes and $200,000 in $20 bills. “When the flight landed in Seattle, the hijacker exchanged the flight’s 36 passengers for the money and parachutes. Cooper kept several crew members, and the plane took off again, ordered to set a course for Mexico City. “Somewhere between Seattle and Reno, a little after 8 p.m., the hijacker did the incredible: He jumped out of the back of the plane with a parachute and the ransom money. The pilots landed safely, but Cooper had disappeared into the night and his ultimate fate remains a mystery to this day.” The FBI pursued hundreds of leads. No body or parachute was ever found, but in 1980, a boy digging near the Columbia River found three bundles of $20 bills whose serial numbers matched the money Cooper had demanded. The Cooper case baffled the FBI for 45 years, and in July, the agency announced it would no longer actively pursue the “NORJAK investigation,” or Northwest hijacking. “Every time the FBI assesses additional tips for the NORJAK case, investigative resources and manpower are diverted from programs that more urgently need attention,” the FBI said. Soon after the FBI dropped the case, Geoffrey Gray, the author of “Skyjack,” announced that he would make available hundreds of FBI files related to the Cooper case on True Ink, an online magazine Gray founded. By opening everything up to the public, Gray said he hoped to use people’s enduring curiosity about the case to crowdsource, once and for all, Cooper’s identity. “We’re trying to solve one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of our time,” he wrote on True Ink, “and we need your help.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

George W. Bush, 2005, $42.3 million; 2001, $30 million. Bill Clinton, 1997, $29 million; 1993, $25 million to $30 million. George H.W. Bush, 1989, $30 million. Ronald Reagan, 1985, $20 million; 1981, $16.3 million. Jimmy Carter, 1977, $3.5 million. Richard Nixon, 1973, $4 million. (Source: Congressional Research Service) NEW YORK – Donald Trump is trying to keep the names of the people and companies donating millions of dollars to his inauguration festivities this week a secret – a break from his Republican and Democratic predecessors in the White House. At least the last three presidents, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, all disclosed names of donors before they were sworn into office. A federal law passed when Bush was in office required presidents to reveal names of contributors, but only 90 days following the inauguration. Some names have been leaked out or have been released by the donors themselves. Chevron gave $500,000 and will sponsor additional events and Boeing pledged $1 million, according to the companies. AT&T and JPMorgan Chase also donated, according to the companies. Other corporate donors include those who donated to Obama’s inauguration or had declined to contribute to the Republican National Convention last summer, including UPS, Bank of America and Deloitte, according to The New York Times. “It is all about access and influence,” said Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the nonpartisan public advocacy group Public Citizen. “Donations come in very large amounts and from those who almost always want something from the new administration.” Occidental Petroleum, one of Clinton’s donors, for example, reached a settlement with the Energy Department in a price-fixing case after Clinton took office. AT&T, one of Obama’s donors, lobbied for regulatory approval of a merger with rival T-Mobile. Trump’s decision doesn’t surprise those who have watched him hire or appoint donors and lobbyists as well as advocate for secrecy. He failed to release the names of so-called bundlers who raised thousands of dollars for him from friends, acquaintances and associates. He failed to release his tax returns, a common practice for presidential nominees for four decades. Some of his nominees to be Cabinet secretaries have delayed providing background materials before their confirmation hearings. And in recent days, he has threatened to investigate how journalists received classified information. John Wonderlich, executive director for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for more openness in government, called Trump one of the most secretive candidates in modern history. “This trend is continuing through the pre-presidency and likely the presidency,” he said. Trump is expected to raise more than $90 million – a record amount – from people and corporations to pay for days of activities, including receptions, balls and the parade surrounding the 58th inauguration celebration. Taxpayers will spend millions more on the official swearing-in ceremony, security, construction and cleanup. His inaugural committee, like those of previous presidents, is offering special events and housing that includes access to Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence and their families in exchange for at least six-figure donations. For $100,000, donors will receive two tickets for dinner and a policy discussion with select Cabinet appointees. For $250,000, there’s two tickets to a lunch with women of the first family. For $1 million, there’s four tickets to a lunch featuring Cabinet appointees and congressional leaders and four tickets to a dinner with Pence and his wife, Karen. Trump tapped his longtime friend, Tom Barrack, a California a private equity real estate investor, to head his inaugural committee. Members include wealthy donors or Republican loyalists, including Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets; casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam; and Wisconsin businesswoman Diane Hendricks. They are likely to have made donations themselves and solicited donations from others. Messages left for other large companies that had donated to past inaugurations including Citigroup, Microsoft and UBS, were not returned. Others, including Wells Fargo, said they were not contributing. A spokesman for the committee did not return a request for comment. But a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly said that Trump’s team did consider whether to release the names of donors, but determined that disclosing the names early would produce multiple headlines instead of just one when they are required to be released by law. The government places no limits on contributions though Trump’s committee said it would not accept any money from registered lobbyists. Previous presidents have put some limits on the people who could donate and how much they could donate. For at least 24 years, presidents have disclosed inaugural donors but they varied on what additional information they provided In 1993, Clinton disclosed many names before the swearing-in, though the public didn’t learn how much they contributed for three years. Four years later, Clinton pledged disclosure by March 31. In 2001 and 2005, Bush disclosed before his inaugurations the names of his donors, their home cities and the amounts they gave. In 2009, Obama disclosed names, employers and states of residence for donors, along with the amounts of contribution. Four years later, he only released the names with no further identifying information. The Center for Responsive Politics has long advocated for Congress to pass a law requiring more timely disclosure as well as limits on the types of donors and the size of their donations. “Congress says contributions to candidates should be limited,” said Bob Biersack, a senior fellow for the group. “Those same principles should apply inaugurals.” —- ESTIMATES OF HOW MUCH MONEY PRESIDENTS RAISED FOR INAUGURATIONS Barack Obama, 2009, $53 million; 2012, $44 million.

Cooper case Scientists may have new evidence in D.B. Cooper casevideo_7791137_0.mov Clip-On Tie May Have Led to Breakthrough in D.B. Cooper Mystery (Veuer) By AMY B. WANG THE WASHINGTON POST It was “one of the longest and most exhaustive investigations” in FBI history — and to this day remains the only unsolved skyjacking in the United States. In 1971, a well-dressed passenger hijacked a Northwest Orient flight, demanded $200,000 and later escaped by parachuting out of the back of the plane with the ransom money. But who exactly was “D.B. Cooper,” the mysterious man who managed to pull off the heist and disappear without a trace? More than four decades later, three amateur scientists think they may have found evidence that would narrow down Cooper’s identity to that of an aerospace engineer or a manager. The scientists, working for a group called Citizen Sleuths, said they have been analyzing particles found on a clip-on necktie that Cooper left on his seat - 18E - before jumping out of the plane. To the naked eye, the piece of fabric was a nondescript black tie from J.C. Penney. But to the modern-day scientists, the tie was an “incredibly fortunate” piece of evidence in the investigation. “A tie is one of the only articles of clothing that isn’t washed on a regular basis,” reads a section on the Citizen Sleuths website devoted solely to the tie. “It picks up dirt and grime just like any other piece of clothing, but that accumulation never truly gets ‘reset’ in the washing machine. Each of those particles comes from something and somewhere and can tell a story if the proper instruments like electron microscopes are used.” Using a powerful electron microscope, the scientists say, they have identified more than 100,000 particles of “rare earth elements” on the tie, including Cerium, Strontium sulfide and pure titanium, according to the Associated Press. Of those, titanium was the most notable. “Titanium was a rare metal in 1971 and this makes it extremely unlikely it is a post-event contamination,” Citizen Sleuths notes on its site, which lays out in painstaking detail all of the findings from the case. “Its presence constrains Cooper to a limited number of managers or engineers in the titanium field that would wear ties to work.” At the time, they noted, the element was used extensively by the military in aircraft and helicopters. Scientists think he may have worked at Boeing, which at the time happened to be developing a Super Sonic Transport plane that used those elements, Tom Kaye, a lead researcher with Citizen Sleuths, told King 5 News. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines],” Kaye told the news station. “He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants.” He added that the group was asking anyone from the public with information to contact researchers through the Citizen Sleuths website. “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say, ‘Oh my gosh, I know what that means having those particles on the tie,’ ” Kaye told the news station. The mystery began on Nov. 24, 1971, when a nondescript man going by the name of Dan Cooper purchased a one-way ticket from Portland, Ore., to Seattle directly from the Northwest Orient Airlines counter on the day of the flight. He used cash to pay for his ticket, then boarded the plane. Authorities later described him as someone in his mid-40s, dressed as an “executive” in a suit, a white shirt and what probably is the now-infamous black tie. The agency’s official summary of how the hijacking unfolded reads like the plot of a Hollywood thriller from another era: “He ordered a drink - bourbon and soda - while the flight was waiting to take off. A short time after 3:00 p.m., he handed the stewardess a note indicating that he had a bomb in his briefcase and wanted her to sit with him. “The stunned stewardess did as she was told. Opening a cheap attaché case, Cooper showed her a glimpse of a mass of wires and red colored sticks and demanded that she write down what he told her. Soon, she was walking a new note to the captain of the plane that demanded four parachutes and $200,000 in twenty-dollar bills. “When the flight landed in Seattle, the hijacker exchanged the flight’s 36 passengers for the money and parachutes. Cooper kept several crew members, and the plane took off again, ordered to set a course for Mexico City. “Somewhere between Seattle and Reno, a little after 8:00 p.m., the hijacker did the incredible: He jumped out of the back of the plane with a parachute and the ransom money. The pilots landed safely, but Cooper had disappeared into the night and his ultimate fate remains a mystery to this day.” The FBI pursued hundreds of leads. No body or parachute was ever found, but in 1980, a boy digging near the Columbia River found three bundles of $20 bills whose serial numbers matched the money Cooper had demanded. The Cooper case baffled the FBI for 45 years, and in July, the agency announced it would no longer actively pursue the “NORJAK investigation,” or Northwest hijacking. Over the decades, hundreds of tips had poured in, but none that could help prove culpability beyond reasonable doubt, the agency said. “Every time the FBI assesses additional tips for the NORJAK case, investigative resources and manpower are diverted from programs that more urgently need attention,” the FBI said in a statement. Soon after the FBI dropped the case, Geoffrey Gray, the author of “Skyjack,” announced that he would make available hundreds of FBI files related to the Cooper case on True Ink, an online magazine Gray founded. By opening everything up to the public, Gray said he hoped to use people’s enduring curiosity about the case to crowdsource, once and for all, Cooper’s identity. “We’re trying to solve one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of our time,” he wrote on True Ink, “and we need your help.” Suspect in deadly Istanbul...Last man to walk on the...   Submit a News Tip Most Popular State, county officials question demands laid in Raiders’ proposed lease Las Vegas Paving snaps up property at Lake Las Vegas Mega Millions ticket purchased at Primm Valley Lotto wins first jackpot of 2017 for $188M Developer Steve Wynn to start work on Paradise Park before end of ‘17 Las Vegas still craves popular retail and restaurant brands Columnists Features Wayne Allyn Root COMMENTARY: In his first week, Donald Trump runs circles around his political opponents   Charles Krauthammer COMMENTARY: The foreign policy section ofDonald Trump’s inaugural addres has received far less attention than so revolutionary a declaration deserved.   Steve Sebelius Property tax cap fix brings another tax debate to Carson City   Inside Gaming Las Vegas Sands attracts millennials with social games and amenities   More Columnists NFL Team Bar Directory Here is the Review-Journal's 2016 directory of NFL team bars in the Las Vegas area.   Electric Daisy Carnival The world’s largest dance music event   Hockey in Vegas A look at NHL expansion news in the Silver State.   Neon Rebirth The post-recession American Dream in Las Vegas   More Features   CALENDAR SUN 29 MON 30 TUE 31 WED 1 THU 2 FRI 3 SAT 4 A All Week   Loading...

Within weeks of the election, Trump had already claimed a victory. Through a mix of inducements and intimidation, he prevailed on the heating and cooling firm Carrier to keep some of its operations in Indiana, “saving” around 1,000 US jobs. Touring the Carrier plant subsequently, he warned other US firms that he would impose stiff tariffs on them if they moved plants overseas and shipped products back home. His Twitter account has produced a stream of commentary in the same vein. He has taken credit for Ford’s decision keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky rather than move it to Mexico. He has threatened General Motors with import tariffs if it continues to import Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico instead of making them in the US. Trump has also hounded defense contractors for cost overruns, berating aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin on separate occasions for producing planes that are too expensive. His policy style represents a sharp break from that of his predecessors. It is highly personalized and temperamental. It relies on threats and bullying. It is prone to boasting, exaggeration, and lies about actual successes. It is a type of public spectacle staged on Twitter. And it is deeply corrosive of democratic norms. Economists tend to advocate an arm’s-length relationship between government and business. Public officials are supposed to insulate themselves from private firms, lest they should be corrupted and engage in favoritism. This is a prized principle in the US, but one that is more often breached than observed. An obvious example is the undeniable influence over US government policy exercised by finance moguls during the last three decades. Yet close business-government interactions also lie behind many of America’s successes. The history of US economic development is one of pragmatic partnerships and collaboration between the public and private sectors, rather than arm’s-length relationships and rigid rules. As historically minded economists and policy analysts such as Michael Lind, Stephen Cohen and Brad DeLong have reminded us, the US is heir to a Hamiltonian tradition in which the federal government provides investment, infrastructure, finance and other support that private enterprise needs. US technological innovation owes as much to specific government programs, such as loan assistance or government purchases, as it does to American entrepreneurs’ and inventors’ ingenuity. As Harvard Business School Professor Josh Lerner notes, some of the most dynamic technology companies in the US, including Apple and Intel, received financial support from the government before going public. Electric carmaker Tesla was a beneficiary of the same public loan guarantee program as Solyndra, the solar cell company that went bust in 2011 in a spectacular public collapse. As the Solyndra example illustrates, many public initiatives fail. However, the ultimate test is whether the social return on the portfolio as a whole is positive, taking successes together with the flops. Such broad evaluations tend to be rare, but one analysis found that US programs to boost energy efficiency had produced positive net benefits. Interestingly, the bulk of the benefits were attributable to three relatively modest projects. Sociologists Fred Block and Matthew Keller have provided perhaps the best analysis of the US “developmental state,” a reality they say the reigning market-fundamentalist ideology has obscured. Block and Keller describe how a “decentralized network of publicly funded laboratories” and an “alphabet soup” of financing initiatives, such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, work with private firms and help them commercialize their products. They and their colleagues have documented the extensive role of both federal and state governments in supporting the collaborative networks on which innovation rests, whether in biotech, green technologies or nanotech. Such industrial policies, based on close collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors, have been the hallmark of East Asian economic policymaking. It is difficult to imagine China’s transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse — and the attendant success of its export-oriented model — without the Chinese government’s helping and guiding hand. It is ironic that the same people who extol Chinese gains from globalization are often alarmed that a US administration may copy the Chinese approach and explicitly endorse industrial policies. Unlike China, the US purports to be a democracy. And industrial policy in a democracy requires transparency, accountability and institutionalization. The relationship between the government and private firms has to be calibrated carefully. Government agencies need to be close enough to private enterprises to elicit the requisite information about technological and market realities on the ground. For example, what are the fundamental reasons for the loss of manufacturing jobs in, say, automobile production, and how can the government help, if at all? However, they cannot get so close to private firms that they end up in companies’ pockets, or at the other extreme, simply order them around. That is where industrial policy à la Trump fails to pass the test. On one hand, his appointments to key economic positions indicate he has little intention of severing government ties to Wall Street and big finance. On the other hand, his policymaking-by-tweet suggests he does not have much interest in building the institutionalized dialogue, with all the required safeguards, that sound industrial policy requires. This means we can expect the Trump administration’s industrial policy to vacillate between cronyism and bullying. That may benefit some, but it will do little good for the overwhelming majority of American workers or the economy as a whole. • Dani Rodrik is professor of international political economy at Harvard University’s John F.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint NEW YORK - Donald Trump is trying to keep the names of the people and companies donating millions of dollars to his inauguration festivities this week a secret — a break from his Republican and Democratic predecessors in the White House. At least the past three presidents, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, all disclosed names of donors before they were sworn into office. A federal law passed when Bush was in office required presidents to reveal names of contributors, but only 90 days following the inauguration. Some names have been leaked out or have been released by the donors themselves. Chevron gave $500,000 and will sponsor additional events and Boeing pledged $1 million, according to the companies. AT&T and JPMorgan Chase also donated, according to the companies. Other corporate donors include those who donated to Obama’s inauguration or had declined to contribute to the Republican National Convention last summer, including UPS, Bank of America and Deloitte, according to the New York Times. “It is all about access and influence,” said Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the nonpartisan public advocacy group Public Citizen. “Donations come in very large amounts and from those who almost always want something from the new administration.” Occidental Petroleum, one of Clinton’s donors, for example, reached a settlement with the Energy Department in a price-fixing case after Clinton took office. AT&T, one of Obama’s donors, lobbied for regulatory approval of a merger with rival T-Mobile. The making of an inauguration Estimates of how much money presidents have raised for inaugurations: Barack Obama: 2009, $53 million; 2012, $44 million. George W. Bush: 2005, $42.3 million; 2001, $30 million. Bill Clinton: 1997, $29 million; 1993, $25 million to $30 million. George H.W. Bush: 1989, $30 million. Ronald Reagan: 1985, $20 million; 1981, $16.3 million. Jimmy Carter: 1977, $3.5 million. Richard Nixon: 1973, $4 million. Source: Congressional Research Service Trump’s decision doesn’t surprise those who have watched him hire or appoint donors and lobbyists as well as advocate for secrecy. He did not release the names of so-called bundlers who raised thousands of dollars for him from friends, acquaintances and associates. He did not release his tax returns, a common practice for presidential nominees for four decades. Some of his nominees to be Cabinet secretaries have delayed providing background materials before their confirmation hearings. And in recent days, he has threatened to investigate how journalists received classified information. John Wonderlich, executive director for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for more openness in government, called Trump one of the most secretive candidates in modern history. “This trend is continuing through the pre-presidency and likely the presidency,” he said. Trump is expected to raise more than $90 million — a record amount — from people and corporations to pay for days of activities, including receptions, balls and the parade surrounding the 58th inauguration celebration. Taxpayers will spend millions more on the official swearing-in ceremony, security, construction and cleanup. His inaugural committee, like those of previous presidents, is offering special events and housing that includes access to Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence and their families in exchange for at least six-figure donations. For $100,000, donors will receive two tickets for dinner and a policy discussion with select Cabinet appointees. For $250,000, there’s two tickets to a lunch with women of the first family. For $1 million, there’s four tickets to a lunch featuring Cabinet appointees and congressional leaders and four tickets to a dinner with Pence and his wife, Karen. Trump tapped his longtime friend, Tom Barrack, a California a private equity real estate investor, to head his inaugural committee. Members include wealthy donors or Republican loyalists, including Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets; casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam; and Wisconsin businesswoman Diane Hendricks. They are likely to have made donations themselves and solicited donations from others. Messages left for other large companies that had donated to past inaugurations including Citigroup, Microsoft and UBS, were not returned. Others, including Wells Fargo, said they were not contributing. A spokesman for the committee did not return a request for comment. But a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly said that Trump’s team did consider whether to release the names of donors, but determined that disclosing the names early would produce multiple headlines instead of just one when they are required to be released by law. The government places no limits on contributions though Trump’s committee said it would not accept any money from registered lobbyists. Previous presidents have put some limits on the people who could donate and how much they could donate. For at least 24 years, presidents have disclosed inaugural donors but they varied on what additional information they provided In 1993, Clinton disclosed many names before the swearing-in, though the public didn’t learn how much they contributed for three years. Four years later, Clinton pledged disclosure by March 31. In 2001 and 2005, Bush disclosed before his inaugurations the names of his donors, their home cities and the amounts they gave. In 2009, Obama disclosed names, employers and states of residence for donors, along with the amounts of contribution. Four years later, he only released the names with no further identifying information. The Center for Responsive Politics has long advocated for Congress to pass a law requiring more timely disclosure as well as limits on the types of donors and the size of their donations. “Congress says contributions to candidates should be limited,” said Bob Biersack, a senior fellow for the group. “Those same principles should apply inaugurals.”   View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

The cargo plane crashed Monday morning, killing people in the residential area adjacent to the Manas airport as well as those on the plane. (AP) KUWAIT CITY, Jan 16, (Agencies): His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah Monday sent a cable of condolences to Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev over the victims of a plane crash in Kyrgyzstan capital, Bishkek, which left dozens of passengers dead or injured. In the cable, His Highness the Amir prayed that Allah the Almighty bless the souls of the victims, and wished swift recovery of the wounded. Two cables of similar sentiments were sent to the Kyrgyz president by His Highness the Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and His Highness the Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Al- Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah. The Turkish cargo plane crashed Monday in a residential area just outside the main airport in Kyrgyzstan, destroying half of a village and killing at least 37 people in the plane and on the ground, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. The Boeing 747 crashed at 7:40 am local time while approaching Manas airport, south of the capital, Bishkek, in this Central Asian nation. Footage from the scene showed the plane’s nose stuck inside a brick house and large chunks of debris scattered around. A dozen body bags were laid out in the yard of one home. A car parked nearby was mangled in the crash, and a refrigerator lay open. The bodies of 15 victims, including five children, all of them Kyrgyz citizens, had been identified by Monday evening, the Kyrgyz government said on its website. Another 15 people, including six children, were hospitalized in the disaster, according to the health ministry. Kyrgyz Emergency Situations Minister Kubatbek Boronov said 23 out of the 43 houses in the village had been destroyed. Several dozen homes were near the fence surrounding the runway. The plane, which had departed from Hong Kong, belonged to the Istanbulbased cargo company ACT Airlines, which said the dead included the plane’s four Turkish crew members: two pilots, a freight expert and a flight technician. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Boronov told reporters that it was foggy at Manas when the plane came down but weather conditions were not critical. One of the plane’s two flight recorders was recovered at the scene, according to the Kyrgyz prime minister’s office. “I woke up because of a bright red light outside,” resident Baktygul Kurbatova, who was slightly injured, told local television. “I couldn’t understand what was happening. It turns out the ceiling and the walls were crashing on us. I was so scared but I managed to cover my son’s face with my hands so debris would not fall on him.” The Manas airport has been considerably expanded since the United States began to operate a military installation there, using it primarily for its military operations in Afghanistan. The US handed the base over to the Kyrgyz military in 2014. ACT Airlines said on Monday that the crash wasn’t the result of “technical reasons or factors linked to the freight” on the plane. It did not specify the plane’s cargo. It said the plane’s records book had no record of any technical faults and said that the plane had not encountered any mishaps during its journey or as it proceeded to land at Bishkek. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev on Monday to express his condolences and convey his sadness at the loss of lives in the disaster. Turkey’s transportation ministry also sent two experts from its accident investigation board to Bishkek to assist Kyrgyz authorities. “According to preliminary information, the plane crashed due to a pilot error,” Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev said at a briefing broadcast on state television. Crushed cars, shattered homes and huge chunks of burnt debris littered the village, which was hit by the plane at around 7:30 am (0130 GMT), as many residents were still at home in bed. “Our grandson said something was burning,” Tajikan, a Dacha Suu resident who identified herself only by her first name, told AFP. “We heard a roar and (what felt) like an earthquake. Many people were sleeping, everything around was burning. One of the parts of the aircraft fell on our neighbour’s house. She and her whole family died,” the pensioner said. Zumriyat Rezakhanova, another resident of Dacha Suu, said the plane fell “right on the homes” where residents were sleeping. “My sister’s home is badly damaged. Luckily she and her family survived,” Rezakhanova told AFP. The flight was travelling from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Kyrgyzstan’s capital Bishkek. One of the plane’s black boxes was recovered from the crash site, the government said a statement without specifying how long it would take to decipher it. International aviation experts and representatives of the company who flew the plane, ACT Airlines, will arrive at the crash site Tuesday, Abulgaziev said at a late briefing, adding that search operation will resume in the morning in areas where the largest pieces of the plane fell. The Turkish cargo airline, said in a statement that its Boeing 747-400 was involved in the crash. ACT Airlines said it was “deeply saddened” by the crash and noted that “the cause of the accident is unknown.” Boeing, the plane’s manufacturer, meanwhile extended its “deepest condolences” over the crash and offered to assist Kyrgyz authorities with the investigation. Elmira Sheripova, a spokeswoman for the emergency services ministry, told AFP that 17 houses had been “completely destroyed” by the plane Share plane crash 2017-01-16 Arab Times Previous 2 Bangladeshis arrested with forged passports Next World’s eight richest as wealthy as half humanity: Oxfam Related Articles TRAGEDY DECIMATES FAMED RED ARMY CHOIR – Pilot error, technical failure most likely 25/12/2016 Malaysia air force plane crashes at air base 21/12/2016 Pakistan plane carrying 47 people crashes 07/12/2016 Body parts found after Indonesian plane missing 04/12/2016 Chapecoense returns home – Rain, sorrow accentuate memorial for the dead 04/12/2016 Army plane crash kills three Indian officers: official 30/11/2016 Check Also Plane crash kills dream of soccer team that defied odds – Chance for glory for would-be South American champs ‘Chapecoense’ ends SAO PAULO, Nov 29, (AFP): Traveling on the doomed airliner that crashed in Colombia overnight … Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

It has been plagued with delays, prompting Donald Trump to describe it as 'out of control' and demanding a price cut from Lockheed Martin. Now, a new Pentagon report has warned the jet still has hundreds of faults - and won't be ready to even begin full combat testing until 2019. Scroll down for video  The jets will first deploy as part of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 in early 2017, a Marine spokeswoman said. The Pentagon's director of testing recently warned it is 'not on a path toward success but instead on a path toward failing to deliver' the plane's full combat capabilities on time, according to Bloomberg. THE MAIN ISSUES  Fixing the 25mm cannon which vibrates excessively  Way it is targeted by the aircraft's 'virtual reality' helmet needs work Overheating, premature wear of components in the vertical tails and vulnerability to fire also an issue Aircraft's 'objectionable or unacceptable flying qualities' while crossing the sound barrier - for which there are currently no plans for a fix   The crucial 'Initial Operational Test and Evaluation' tests were scheduled for August. The deadline represents the latest in a series of pushed-back delivery milestones. 'The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program Office (JPO) acknowledged in 2016 that schedule pressure exists for completing System Development and Demonstration (SDD) and starting Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) by August 2017, the planned date in JPO's Integrated Master Schedule,' the report says. 'In an effort to stay on schedule, JPO plans to reduce or truncate planned developmental testing (DT) in an effort to minimize delays and close out SDD as soon as possible.  'However, even with this risky, schedule-driven approach, multiple problems and delays make it clear that the program will not be able to start IOT&E with full combat capability until late CY18 or early CY19, at the soonest.'   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Would you dare visit Jurassic ROBO-park?

Share this article Share 571 shares The Pentagon's Office of Operational Testing and Evaluation says only half of its long list of concerns will be addressed before the major performance milestone. 'The Services have designated 276 deficiencies in combat performance as “critical to correct” in Block 3F, but less than half of the critical deficiencies were addressed with attempted corrections in 3FR6' But addressing even that reduced list is appearing rushed, it says.  There are 'significant, well-documented deficiencies resulting in overall ineffective operational performance ... 'hundreds of which will not be adequately addressed with fixes and corrections verified with flight testing.'  Key among them are fixing the 25mm cannon which vibrates excessively and the way it is targeted by the aircraft's 'virtual reality' helmet.  TRUMP'S F-35 PRICE CUT   Lockheed Martin Corp is close to a deal to significantly lower the cost of its F-35 aircraft, Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson said on Friday after meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 'I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform, and we have to get it at the lowest possible price,' Hewson said to reporters in Trump Tower. Deal: Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said after meeting with Trump: 'I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform.' Hewson had previously assured Trump she would drive down the cost of the company's fighter jet, after he tweeted last month that he was asking rival aerospace company Boeing Co whether it could offer a cheaper alternative to the F-35, based on its existing F-18 Super Hornet. Trump has threatened and rebuked some of America's largest companies, creating a new business risk for those who have been or fear being targeted.   Improvements in the internal diagnostics software — the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) have also been slow to emerge. They lead a list including overheating, premature wear of componentsin the vertical tails and vulnerability to fire. The aircraft's 'objectionable or unacceptable flying qualities' while crossing the sound barrier as yet has no plans for a fix. 'The current schedule-driven program plans to close out testing in 2017 do not include enough time to fix these key deficiencies, nor time to verify corrections in flight test,' it adds.  'The program currently has 17 known and acknowledged failures to meet the contract specification requirements, all of which the program is reportedly planning to get relief from the SDD contract due to lack of time and funding.'  Despite it's incomplete state, a partially operational squadron of the Marine Corps' F-35B was deployed to Japan last week. The report did note some progress, such as the completion of important ship-integration tests and steps toward fixing a dangerous ejection seat. However, most of chief tester Michael Gilmore's report focuses on what still needs to be done.  Workers can be seen on the moving line and forward fuselage assembly areas for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter at Lockheed Martin Corp's factory located in Fort Worth, Texas In a previous memo obtained by the Project On Government Oversight, Michael Gilmore, Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, warns that the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office is simply cut short the plane's development phase in order to pretend that schedule and cost goals are being met.  'The purpose of this memorandum is to document my continuing concerns regarding progress in the -35 JSF program as you prepare to conduct the upcoming Defense Acquisition Board review,' the note says, according to War is boring. It calls for the entire programme to be restructured so enough testing can be completed.  'The primary concerns were that the program appeared to be prematurely ending System Development and Demonstration (SDD) and was not taking the necessary steps to be ready for which will be conducted using realistic combat missions fully consistent with our war plans and threat assessments.'   The Marines be the first force to deploy the Lockheed Martin jet aboard the USS Wasp (pictured) next year, and will deploy a second contingent soon after, aboard the USS Essex. Taking incompletely developed F-35s into combat will, Gilmore says, place pilots at 'significant risk.'  'If the program continues with plans to close out SDD prematurely, it will carry the high risk of failing and having to repeat the approximately $300-million operational test, and failing for many years to provide the full combat capability Block 3F has long been meant and claimed to provide. 'Finally, the combination of unfnished SDD work and the likely follow-on Operational test would significantly delay, and increase the cost of, achieving the important capabilities which are urgently needed to counter current and emerging threats. 'I therefore recommend very strongly that the program be restructured now and provided the additional resources it clearly requires to deliver its long-planned and sorely needed full Block 3F combat capability.' The Marines began moving 16 F-35Bs to Iwakuni Air Station in Japan earlier this month, it has been revealed. The Marines will be the first force to deploy the Lockheed Martin jet aboard the USS Wasp next year, and will deploy a second contingent soon after, aboard the USS Essex. HOW DOES IT COMPARE WITH ITS 1970S PREDECESSOR, THE F-16 JET?  F-35 Role:  Stealth multirole fighter First flight:  December 15, 2006 Unit cost (not including engine):  F-35A - $98million F-35B - $104million F-35C - $116million  Number built: 115 (as of November 2014)  Length: 15.67m Wingspan: 10.7m Height: 4.33m Max speed (F-35A): 1,930kph Armament:  One of the most highly-anticipated features of the F-35 armament is the Small Diameter Bomb II (SBD II).The bomb is able to guide towards its target using laser, imaging infrared or radar homing. It can hit moving or stationary targets in any weather, or at night, with unprecedented reliability and accuracy. The 'super weapon' is predicted to be the most versatile air-to-ground munition in the Pentagon's air combat inventory. The cost per SDB II is said to be around $250,000 and the US military plans on buying as many as 17,000 of them.  F-16 Role:  Multirole fighter  First flight: January 20, 1974 Unit cost: F-16A/B - $14.6million F-16C/D - $18.8million  Number built: 4,540+  Length: 15.06m Wingspan: 9.96m Height: 4.88m  Max speed (F-16C): 2,120kph Combat history:   The F-16 has served in the Air Forces of 26 nations, including the U.S., Israel, Egypt, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. During Operation Desert Storm, the 1991 assault on Iraq, F-16s flew over 13,000 operations, more than any other Coalition aircraft. The U.S. has employed the F-16 in operations over the Balkans, Afghanistan and Libya.   At its production peak in 1987, the F-16 team in Fort Worth was also making history, by producing 30 F-16s in just 30 days.  Thanks to frequent upgrades improving and incorporating new technologies into the cockpit, avionics, sensors and weapons, the aircraft has become more reliable over its 40 years.  The F-16 has served in the Air Forces of 26 nations, including the U.S., Israel, Egypt, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. 'We will learn from that, and see what capabilities we need to further develop,' said Marine Lt. Gen. Robert Walsh, the commanding general of the Marines' Combat Development Command, according toDefense One. 'A lot of it's going to be the school of hard knocks.' The jets will deploy as part of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 in early 2017, a Marine spokeswoman said.  At year's end, six of that squadron's planes will attach to the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit.  Last year researchers revealed the hugely delayed and over budget project has finally fired its first shots in the air. The F-35A Lightning II completed the first three airborne gunfire bursts from its internal Gun Airborne Unit (GAU)-22/A 25mm Gatling gun system during a California test flight on October 30th  Industry and U.S. defense officials say they are working hard to continue driving down the cost of the new warplanes to $85 million per plane by 2019, as well as the cost of operating them. Senator John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he welcomed the announcement but made clear he intended to keep a close eye on the hugely expensive program. With a price tag of $400 billion for 2,457 planes, the fifth-generation fighter could finally be battle ready later this year, a new report claims. 'The Senate Armed Services Committee will continue to exercise rigorous oversight of the Joint Strike Fighter program's long-delayed System Development and Demonstration phase as well as the start of the operational test and evaluation phase,' McCain said in a statement.  To become battle ready, at least a dozen individual F-35 must demonstrate their ability to drop bombs and shoot down other planes. Each jet must be upgraded to a specific software package, and plugged into the complex logistics cloud that manages maintenance. The F-35 project office had previously set an Aug. 1 target date.  The project has been plagued with delays.  The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter's record on cost, schedule and performance has been a scandal and a tragedy, Senator John McCain told senior Pentagon officials earlier this year. McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the aircraft's development schedule has stretched to 15 years, deliveries of the F-35 have been delayed, and costs have skyrocketed. 'It's been a scandal and the cost overruns have been disgraceful,' McCain said.   THE EJECTOR SEAT THAT COULD KILL  Pilots under 136 pounds aren't allowed to fly any F-35 variant. Pilots under 165 pounds have a 1-in-4 chance of death and 100 percent chance of serious neck injury upon ejecting, according to the testing office. 'The testing showed that the ejection seat rotates backwards after ejection.  This results in the pilot's neck becoming extended, as the head moves behind the shoulders in a 'chin up' position.  When the parachute inflates and begins to extract the pilot from the seat (with great force), a 'whiplash' action occurs.  The rotation of the seat and resulting extension of the neck are greater for lighter weight pilots,' the report states. Sophisticated: Footage from ground testing of the F-35A stealth jet at Edwards Air Force Base in California, shows the awesome firepower of the four-barrel Gatling gun embedded in the left wing It is designed to support operations, mission planning and to spot any maintenance issues with the vehicle. 'Program officials said that if ALIS is not fully functional, the F-35 could not be operated as frequently as intended,' the report said. 'But a DoD commissioned plan found that schedule slippage and functionality problems with ALIS could lead to $20-100 billion in additional costs.'   So far, the software has been so flawed that maintenance crews have had to resort labour-intensive alternatives.  According to National Interest, in one instance maintainers had to manually burn data onto CDs and to send the massive files across a civilian WiFi network. One major problem, the report said, is that the F-35 data produced goes through a single main operating unit which has no back up. 'The F-35 is still in development, and this is the time when technical challenges are expected,' Lt. Genernal Chris Bogdon told CNN. 'However, we believe the combined government and industry team will resolve current issues and future discoveries,' he said. Lead defense contractor for the plane, Lockheed Martin, insists development of the logistics software is on schedule. 'As ALIS development continues, our focus is on the warfighter and delivering the most effective, efficient fleet management system to sustain the F-35 over the next five decades of operations,' said Sharon Parsley, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin. 'The recommendations by the GAO are in line with the actions already underway in preparation for full-rate production and worldwide sustainment.' Read more: www.dote.osd.mil...

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses.

Now might be a good time for the trust's legion of small savers to consider their options James Moore @JimMooreJourno Monday 16 January 2017 15:28 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Katherine Garrett-Cox, the former boss of Alliance Trust REUTERS/Ruben Sprich Lots of small savers have money with Alliance Trust, which is Britain’s oldest investment trust. It’s fair to ask why.  Under the stewardship of former chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox, they were treated to rising costs and less than stellar performance.  It got to the stage at which an American activist hedge fund saw a chance to dive in and make a quick buck by shaking things up.  Read more Garrett-Cox exits Alliance Trust after long battle with hedge fund Alliance Trust board is partly to blame for its problems Total triumph for activists at Alliance as Forseke calls it quits Elliott Advisers was successful. Ms Garrett-Cox departed, so did Karin Forseke, who had chaired the Dundee-based company.  They had spent £3m on a failed campaign to see the Americans off, only to end up agreeing to a deal that saw two of the three non-executive directors their opponents wanted to get onto the board duly appointed. With the dust having settled after the appointments, and the departures, a new strategy was announced in December. It would see a group of outsiders brought in to look after Alliance's investments. The trust has just announced the names of eight lucky fund managers from the US, the UK and Canada, who have been selected by Willis Towers Watson to manage its £3.3bn of assets going forward. Jupiter Asset Management, River & Mercantile and Veritas in the UK along with four US-based managers and one Canadian will each pick 20 stocks apiece to make up Alliance's portfolio. They’re all described as best in class, but best in class doesn’t come cheap and so investors' costs will rise.  Their aim is to beat the MSCI All Country World Index by between 1 and 2 per cent a year. If that happens, it should cover those costs.  Trouble is, fund managers that actively manage portfolios struggle to beat funds that track stock market indices at the best of times, so it’s no gimme.  The trust is a “dividend hero”, according to the Association of Investment Companies, that has consistently increased its payouts to savers and investors.  Alliance says it plans to continue doing that, but of course that will depend on a majority of the aforementioned fund managers cutting the mustard.  Business picture of the day 33 show all Business picture of the day 1/33 Tesco to buy wholesaler Booker in £3.7bn deal to create 'UK's leading food business' - Friday January 27 Britain's biggest retailer announced that it was merging with Booker, the UK's top food wholesaler, in a £3.7bn deal.

But it has several weaknesses. For one, it’s blind in the infrared though several of its potential rivals have infrared-search-and-track sensors, effectively allowing them to scan for enemy warplanes’ heat signatures. The last U.S. fighter to have an IRST sensor built in during development was the F-14 Tomcat. The F/A-18 Super Hornet now has the option of carrying a centerline droptank with an IRST, which will make it expensive to actually drop in combat. The F-22 also lacks side-looking radars, which allow an aircraft to fire a missile that requires mid-course updates from the aircraft’s radar while continuing to provide tracking data after turning more than 90 degrees away from the path of the missile. Without such a radar, an aircraft would have to keep pointing toward an enemy plane — and getting closer to any missiles an enemy might fire. The reason for these shortcomings dates back to the Raptor’s origin. The F-22 had its beginnings in the Advanced Tactical Fighter program which began in 1981. The U.S. Air Force awarded General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas contracts for initial design work for an air-to-ground fighter that could fly at Mach 2.5 at high to medium altitudes, and carry standoff weapons to destroy tanks and other ground targets. Nothing came of that program initially because the F-16 Fighting Falcon, originally designed as an air-to-air fighter for daylight hours, came in the back door and was repurposed to fill the air-to-ground role. In late 1985, the U.S. Air Force made a number of changes to requirements as the program progressed, including a greater emphasis on stealth. It also changed the selection process so that, instead of four companies receiving approximately $100 million each, two would be awarded contracts of $700 million each to produce flying prototypes. One of the prototypes would be powered by Pratt & Whitney F119 engines and the other with General Electric F120 engines. At around the same time, the U.S. Air Force sent out letters to the competing companies to encourage teaming. The idea behind this was that the U.S. Air Force wanted as much talent as possible for such a large and expensive program. As a result, Boeing, Lockheed and General Dynamics formed one team, and Northrop and McDonnell Douglas formed another. Rockwell and Grumman did not team. On Oct. 31, 1986, the Air Force announced Lockheed and Northrop as winners of that stage of the Advanced Tactical Fighter program. The teaming agreement among Boeing, General Dynamics and Lockheed called for the winning company to be the team leader, so Lockheed took that role. The winning teams were given four years to produce their flying prototypes. Lockheed’s design at this stage had a large rotary weapon bay which pushed the engines and inlets outward, in turn producing an excessive amount of wave drag. This is exactly what happened to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter with its vertical lift fan making the aircraft too wide and draggy. The vertical lift fan is the original sin of the F-35 design. The Air Force initially required that eight missiles be carried internally within the F-22’s main weapon bay. That was reduced to six when both of the design teams concluded this could not be done effectively. Similarly, the requirement for thrust reversers was dropped when it was determined that the capability was not worth the price in performance. The F-22’s basic challenge was to integrate stealth, supercruise, highly integrated avionics and agility into an aircraft with a longer range than the one it was to replace, the F-15 Eagle. It was also to have twice the reliability of the F-15 and half the support requirements. Although in practice, the F-22’s mission availability has risen over the last few years to being close to that of the F-15, but its support requirement is over 50 percent higher. Both the Lockheed and Northrop designs had diamond-shaped wings with a long root chord joining the wing to the fuselage, providing a more distributed load path and more bulkheads carrying the bending loads. The large wings also provided more fuel volume. But in January 1989, the U.S. Air Force put a cap on the cost of the F-22’s avionics at $9 million per aircraft in production. At that time, Lockheed’s paper design had over $16 million of avionics in each aircraft. Thus, the IRST was dropped — as were a number of other systems, including the side-looking, cheek-mounted radars. The processing power of electronics and the acuity of optics have improved in the last decade so the cost of avionics relative to the cost of the airframe has fallen. Nevertheless, the reason why the F-22 doesn’t have an IRST dates from the avionics cost cap imposed in 1989. The U.S. Air Force didn’t prescribe which systems were to be dropped in order to meet the cap. The companies decided what would provide the best value for money. And 27 years later, the F-22’s main competition, the Russian Su-35 Flanker-E, has infrared-search-and-track and cheek-mounted radars.

The homeowner needed special permission to build it so pilots flying overhead didn't mistake the massive house for a crashed plane. Architect David Hertz bought the scrap Boeing 747 for just £21,600 and used it to build the stunning house in the remote hills of Malibu, California. He was hired for the job by homeowner Francie Rehwald, who wanted curves and feminine shapes for her dream house. Francie interviewed 12 architects before deciding on David Hertz Architects and spent 15 years searching the globe for the perfect piece of land. The master bedroom has views over California's hills (Photo: Caters News Agency) She had to get permission from 17 government agencies - including Homeland Security - to build the house, as from the sky it looks like a plane crash. The retired Mercedes Benz dealer said: "I wanted something that was feminine. "You might not think wings are feminine, but once they were detached from the place they really come into their own. "They have such subtle curves."

"Then it occurred to me, why try to build a wing when I can appropriate a wing?" Francie - who refused to say exactly how much it cost to build, only hinting it was in the millions - added: "No one had ever built anything like this before. "There were a lot of surprises that brought the cost up, but it's just beautiful."

It used two Boeing wings and two tail fins, which were detached from the plane using the latest precision technology. They were then transported to the mansion via helicopter, after having to close five freeways to get them partway there. Strong winds could easily have scuppered the operation to transport the plane wings by helicopter (Photo: Caters News Agency) David said: "There was a lot of risk with the helicopter. "It was clear when we were transporting the wings that if they started to turn or catch the wind, they would just drop them." Francie added: "Every day is a complete and utter joy and I feel so lucky."

Korean flag carriers set to introduce new aircraft South Korea's two largest commercial airlines plan to introduce new aircraft this year, market sources said Monday, providing a chance to fly in the latest and most advanced aircraft, as well as enhanced overall flight safety by replacing aged aircraft. Local industry leader Korean Air Lines Co. is set to introduce Boeing's latest B787-9 Dreamliner in March, along with the CS300 in June. The B787 is a midsize jet airliner with up to 290 seats, and will likely be operated on routes to and from Los Angeles, Paris and London. The CS300 is a small aircraft with about 130 seats, developed and built by Canadian manufacturer Bombardier Aerospace. It is expected to serve domestic routes and short-range international flights, the informed sources said. Asiana Airlines Co., too, plans to introduce a new aircraft as a way of providing new and improved flight experiences to its passengers. The airline will begin operating the new A350-900XWB from European manufacturer Airbus in April. The A350-900 is one of the largest passenger aircraft ever built with up to 440 seats. The new aircraft, in addition to offering new flight experiences, will likely improve the South Korean airlines' safety, as well as their profitability. According to company officials, the new B787 is significantly lighter than conventional aircraft, with nearly 50 percent of its body made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic, also making it up to 20 percent more efficient in terms of fuel mileage. The A350 is said to have up to 70 percent of its body and wings made of the advanced material. South Korean flag carriers have been continuously replacing their aged aircraft since all seven airlines, including five low-cost carriers, here pledged in May 2015 to keep the age of each and every aircraft at below 20 years. There currently is no limit on the age of an aircraft, according to officials from the transportation ministry. As of 2015, only 14 out of 264 aircraft operated by the seven South Korean airlines were aged 20 years or more. (Yonhap)   K-pop group Wonder Girls disbands afte...

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Amy B Wang By Amy B Wang January 16 Follow @amybwang Scientists explain how they use technology to search for clues in the mysterious disappearance of 1971 hijacker D.B. Cooper, in this 2009 video produced by the FBI. (FBI) It was “one of the longest and most exhaustive investigations” in FBI history — and to this day remains the only unsolved skyjacking in the United States. In 1971, a well-dressed passenger hijacked a Northwest Orient flight, demanded $200,000 and later escaped by parachuting out of the back of the plane with the ransom money. But who exactly was “D.B. Cooper,” the mysterious man who managed to pull off the heist and disappear without a trace? More than four decades later, three amateur scientists think they may have found evidence that would narrow down Cooper’s identity to that of an aerospace engineer or a manager. The scientists, working for a group called Citizen Sleuths, said they have been analyzing particles found on a clip-on necktie that Cooper left on his seat — 18E — before jumping out of the plane. To the naked eye, the piece of fabric was a nondescript black tie from J.C. Penney. But to the modern-day scientists, the tie was an “incredibly fortunate” piece of evidence in the investigation. “A tie is one of the only articles of clothing that isn’t washed on a regular basis,” reads a section on the Citizen Sleuths website devoted solely to the tie. “It picks up dirt and grime just like any other piece of clothing, but that accumulation never truly gets ‘reset’ in the washing machine. Each of those particles comes from something and somewhere and can tell a story if the proper instruments like electron microscopes are used.” [How the hunt for D.B. Cooper made an aging Vietnam veteran the target of TV sleuths] Using a powerful electron microscope, the scientists say they have identified more than 100,000 particles of “rare earth elements” on the tie, including Cerium, Strontium sulfide and pure titanium, according to the Associated Press. Of those, titanium was the most notable. “Titanium was a rare metal in 1971 and this makes it extremely unlikely it is a post-event contamination,” Citizen Sleuths notes on its site, which lays out in painstaking detail all of the findings from the case. “Its presence constrains Cooper to a limited number of managers or engineers in the titanium field that would wear ties to work.” At the time, they noted, the element was used extensively by the military in aircraft and helicopters. Scientists think he may have worked at Boeing, which at the time happened to be developing a Super Sonic Transport plane that used those elements, Tom Kaye, a lead researcher with Citizen Sleuths, told King 5 News. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines],” Kaye told the news station. “He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants.” He added that the group was asking anyone from the public with information to contact researchers through the Citizen Sleuths website. “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say, ‘Oh my gosh, I know what that means having those particles on the tie,’ ” Kaye told the news station. [The D.B. Cooper case has baffled the FBI for 45 years. Now it may never be solved.] The mystery began on Nov. 24, 1971, when a nondescript man going by the name of Dan Cooper purchased a one-way ticket from Portland, Ore., to Seattle directly from the Northwest Orient Airlines counter on the day of the flight. He used cash to pay for his ticket, then boarded the plane. Authorities later described him as someone in his mid-40s, dressed as an “executive” in a suit, a white shirt and what probably is the now-infamous black tie. The agency’s official summary of how the hijacking unfolded reads like the plot of a Hollywood thriller from another era: He ordered a drink — bourbon and soda — while the flight was waiting to take off. A short time after 3:00 p.m., he handed the stewardess a note indicating that he had a bomb in his briefcase and wanted her to sit with him. The stunned stewardess did as she was told. Opening a cheap attaché case, Cooper showed her a glimpse of a mass of wires and red colored sticks and demanded that she write down what he told her. Soon, she was walking a new note to the captain of the plane that demanded four parachutes and $200,000 in twenty-dollar bills. When the flight landed in Seattle, the hijacker exchanged the flight’s 36 passengers for the money and parachutes. Cooper kept several crew members, and the plane took off again, ordered to set a course for Mexico City. Somewhere between Seattle and Reno, a little after 8:00 p.m., the hijacker did the incredible: He jumped out of the back of the plane with a parachute and the ransom money. The pilots landed safely, but Cooper had disappeared into the night and his ultimate fate remains a mystery to this day. The FBI pursued hundreds of leads. No body or parachute was ever found, but in 1980, a boy digging near the Columbia River found three bundles of $20 bills whose serial numbers matched the money Cooper had demanded. [Online magazine to open up FBI files on the ‘D.B. Cooper’ skyjacking case] The Cooper case baffled the FBI for 45 years, and in July, the agency announced it would no longer actively pursue the “NORJAK investigation,” or Northwest hijacking. Over the decades, hundreds of tips had poured in, but none that could help prove culpability beyond reasonable doubt, the agency said. “Every time the FBI assesses additional tips for the NORJAK case, investigative resources and manpower are diverted from programs that more urgently need attention,” the FBI said in a statement. Soon after the FBI dropped the case, Geoffrey Gray, the author of “Skyjack,” announced that he would make available hundreds of FBI files related to the Cooper case on True Ink, an online magazine Gray founded. By opening everything up to the public, Gray said he hoped to use people’s enduring curiosity about the case to crowdsource, once and for all, Cooper’s identity. “We’re trying to solve one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of our time,” he wrote on True Ink, “and we need your help.” Read more: She was abducted from the hospital as a newborn. 18 years later, she met her birth parents.

News Business Business Comment Business leaders say they must do more to make poverty history, but Oxfam says actions speak louder than words More than 35 CEOs and other leaders have called for a more sustainable economic model, but talk is cheap and the Oxfam figure highlights the fact that inequality is growing and so is the instability that goes with it  James Moore @JimMooreJourno Monday 16 January 2017 10:43 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Business leaders say they need to do more to make poverty history, but actions speak louder than words Getty It’s Davos week, when the world’s wealthy gather in the Swiss resort for the World Economic Forum to do a bit of skiing, talk some shop, and generally congratulate each other on how well they’re doing.  In recent years they’ve also paid lip service to recognising the fact that billions of people aren’t doing so well as they are.  Read more The threat to the world economy that no one's talking about Partly that is because Oxfam, among others, does a good job of reminding them of that fact by regularly releasing reports showing the yawning and growing gulf between a few ultra wealthy individuals and the teaming masses of the world’s poor.  This year it highlighted the fact that just eight individuals collectively hold more wealth than half the world’s population.  Allies of those eight typically jump on Oxfam’s missives and say it’s focussing on the wrong thing. Better to concentrate on making the poor richer as opposed to thinking about ways to redistribute some of that vast wealth and thereby make the rich a bit less rich. The Thatcherite Institute of Economic Affairs predictably led that charge upon the release of Oxfam’s report.  But while making the poor better off is a good idea, and a noble goal to have, it doesn’t change the fact that such a yawning level of inequality is deeply problematic and relying on growth to pull people out of poverty isn't working as well as it might.  Oxfam, for example, points out that were growth evenly distributed in developing nations between 1990 and 2010, the number of people living in extreme poverty (defined as having to make do with less than $1.25 a day) would have been reduced by 200 million people. The ultra wealthy grab an unequal share of global growth, slowing efforts to alleviate poverty.  There are people outside of Oxfam who recognise that there is a problem with an economic system that allows this to happen.  Read more This year's World Economic Forum will focus on the threat of populism Delegates at Davos held a meeting about the dangers of 'killer robots' Davos gets a lot of attention but it has little relevance for most One of this year’s attempts to show that Davos cares came from one of them, the Business and Sustainable Development Commission, which was launched at the end of the last shindig to encourage businesses to take the lead in reducing poverty and encouraging sustainable development.  It includes some heavy hitters. Some 35 CEOs and civil society leaders, including the bosses of big firms such as fund manager Investec, Marmite maker Unilever, insurer Aviva, Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant,  Merck, the pharmaceutical group, publisher Pearson, and so on.  Its report is entitled Better Business, Better World and it is described as “a call to action to business leaders”. Were business to move to more sustainable models, focussing on the long term and playing a part in achieving the UN’s sustainable development goals, it says, businesses could unlock up to $12 trillion (£9.9 trillion) of economic opportunities and create 380 million jobs by 2030.  It also warns that a failure by businesses to pay more attention to the world in which they operate will result in malign consequences, fuelling environmental collapse, the continuing backlash against globalisation and some very bad politics (which we’ve already started to see).  Oxfam says that it is helpful that people like those on Commission, and some of those who have the top passes and invites to the best parties at Davos, are talking about things like this when they weren’t doing so a few years ago.  The trouble is pretty words and CEOs wearing tie dye shirts on dress down Fridays are all very well, but actions speak louder.

The CEOs of the firms mentioned continue to be awarded bigger and bigger pay packages despite little apparent link to economic performance. Aggressive tax planning is commonplace among multinationals, disadvantaging smaller firms and depriving governments of revenues. Small companies also suffer through bigger businesses' habit of dragging their feet over invoices. Long term thinking is the exception rather than the norm, with the focus overwhelming on quarterly or half yearly earnings. Fund managers rarely vote against bad boardroom behaviour. The destruction of the environment continues apace.  Governments, for their part, are reluctant to take hard decisions that might encourage better behaviour. When even relatively mild reforms are suggested, the business community’s lobbyists are quick to come forward with arguments against them. Witness Theresa May’s hasty backtracking on proposals to put workers on boards.  The Business and Sustainable Development Commission is right. There is a desperate need for a change in business thinking. You’d think that $12 trillion would tempt them. But there's little in the way of hard evidence to suggest a widespread recognition that the current model is failing.  More about: Davos World Economic Forum Oxfam Inequality income inequality Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

News London ‘Quiet’ Airbus is noisier than jet it replaced, claim Heathrow Airport protesters Kate Proctor Monday 16 January 2017 10:35 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard A passenger jet over west London as it arrives at Heathrow AFP/Getty Images Campaigners against a third runway at Heathrow believe residents in west London are suffering more noise from a new breed of aircraft that the Government promised would be quieter.   Residents claim there has been “insufferable” misery for thousands living close to the flight path since double-decker Airbus A380 planes began replacing Boeing 747s. The claim, disputed by the Department for Transport, is the latest row in which official promises about environmental standards have been challenged by campaigners against expansion at London’s premier airport.  Neil Spurrier, chair of Teddington Action Group, said: “Teddington was relatively unaffected by aircraft noise but now the area gets 17 hours per day of almost insufferable noise for about a third of the time, when the wind blows from the east.” The group’s claim comes after it analysed data from two Civil Aviation Authority noise monitors based on top of Strawberry Hill House in Twickenham and the National Physical Laboratory at Teddington over a four-month period.  The group said the measurements show that for every month, the A380 was noisier than the 747s and accused the Government of suppressing noise averages by inconsistently recording jets on either one or both monitors. However, the Government said the action group’s claims were incorrect. A DfT spokesman said: “There has been no double counting or attempt to falsify results on noise pollution at Heathrow. There are two noise monitors a mile apart and only some flights will be picked up by both as they detect flights over a certain volume for a minimum time.” The DfT admitted the A380 is louder on arrival than predecessor planes, but is quieter overall.

News Business Business News Gordon Ramsay among host of Michelin-starred chefs to cook with food waste at new restaurant UK households wasted 7.3 million tonnes of food last year - The popup aims to highlight the problem Richard Vines Monday 16 January 2017 09:48 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Gordon Ramsay, Tom Kerridge and Clare Smyth are among the Michelin-starred British chefs who will cook alongside their New York counterpart Dan Barber when he opens a popup restaurant converting food waste into £15 sharing dishes and £32 high tea.  Barber is also recruiting other big names from the UK and Europe. There's just one catch: Diners won't know in advance who is the guest chef on the day they book at the rooftop site at Selfridges department store in London. People wait months for a table at Blue Hill at Stone Barns, in upstate New York, where Barber serves a vegetable-led menu with ingredients from his farm. It was named best restaurant in America 2016. This will be his first venture in the UK. The Real Junk Food Project activists feeding schoolchildren food waste in Leeds Read more UK households wasting 7.3 million tonnes of food a year The popup, to be called wastED London, runs from 24 February to 2 April, serving menus designed to raise awareness of food waste. Expect quirky dishes with skin and bones and other ingredients you wouldn't normally expect. The original wasteED was a popup in New York two years ago. Multi-Michelin starred Alain Ducasse was among guest chefs—Barber is a hero in the culinary world—but the food was a world away from fine dining, featuring bits of meat, fruit, vegetables and fish you'd normally chuck away. While Ramsay is fiery, Barber is softly spoken and thoughtful. Smyth will open her own restaurant this year after leaving Ramsay's flagship, where she was custodian of his three Michelin stars since 2007. Kerridge is the only chef to hold two Michelin stars at a pub, the Hand & Flowers.

He cited the British bubble and squeak—made with leftovers such as cabbage and potato—as an inspiration. "It's all very exciting," Barber said in an interview at Blue Hill at Stone Barns. "To put together a menu in a different city is to be forced to learn about its history and its agricultural realities. And the food scene in London is very vibrant." It will be an a la carte menu for lunch and dinner. Expect some surprises: In New York, the menu featured kale ribs, bruised vegetables and fruits, fish heads and stale bread, according to Eater.com. Barber is also creating a "Not So Customary" afternoon tea. Details haven't been announced but it's a fair bet it won't be like the Ritz.  Expect tables to be hard to get. When French chef Pierre Koffmann came out of retirement to open on the roof of Selfridges in 2009, he sold out immediately. The run was extended three times. Tickets were also snapped up for Thomas Keller's French Laundry at Harrods in 2011 and for Rene Redzepi's Noma at Claridge's in 2012. Unusual menus are no hindrance. One of Redzepi's dishes featured live ants. “What we are doing is a new way of looking at farming—eating the entirety of the farm in the same way that we have nose-to-tail eating of the animal” Barber is a leader of the farm-to-table cooking movement, where chefs work with local producers and use the freshest organic ingredients in menus that promote sustainable agriculture and highlight individual farmers and fishermen. But he says such ideas don't go far enough in combating food waste.

"It's too passive," he says. "It allows you to dictate the menu by purchasing what you want from a farm. You end up treating it like a supermarket. I don't reject the term farm to table - I own a restaurant on a farm, so I'd better be careful - but it's too easy.  "I am in favor of expanding the definition of what is waste food.  We get to choose what's for dinner when really we need a pattern of eating that supports a landscape." Barber says he's optimistic, pointing to other recent food trends. "Increasingly, when you go to top restaurants around the world, the carrying card for those restaurants is not lobster, caviar, foie gras anymore," he says. "It is ingredients that speak to place, to an agricultural history that is part of the culture. "What we are doing is a new way of looking at farming—eating the entirety of the farm in the same way that we have nose-to-tail eating of the animal that you all in England exported to the rest of the world. What I like about London is the openness to these ideas. The culture around food waste is fantastic—way ahead of America's."

News World Turkish cargo plane crash: Dozens killed as aircraft crashes in Kyrgyzstan Rashid Razaq Monday 16 January 2017 09:37 BST Click to follow The Evening Standard Wreckage: the aftermath of the plane crash AP Dozens of people were killed today when a Turkish cargo plane crashed into a village while trying to land at Kyrgyzstan’s main international  airport. The Boeing 747 smashed into the settlement of Zhang-Zhang, flattening homes and leaving at least 37 dead, according to emergency services in the central Asian nation. At least 15 people, including six children, were taken to hospital following the disaster at 7.18am local time. More than a thousand rescuers were at the scene near Manas airport 15 miles north of capital Bishkek.  The scene after the crash in Kyrgyzstan (EPA) Images from the crash site showed the plane’s nose and tail stuck inside houses and huge chunks of debris scattered around rubble. Fires burned and smoke hung over the village.  At least 15 homes in the village — just outside a metal fence which separates it from the runway — were destroyed.  Resident Baktygul Kurbatova, who was slightly injured, told local TV: “I woke up because of a bright red light outside. "I couldn’t understand what was happening. It turns out the ceiling and the walls were crashing on us. The wreckage of the plane after the horrific crash (EPA) “I was so scared but I managed to cover my son’s face with my hands so that debris would not fall on him.”  Another witness told news agency AFP: “It killed entire families. There’s nothing left of the houses. Many people were sleeping.” Kyrgyz emergency situations minister Kubatbek Boronov said it was foggy when the plane came down and poor visibility may have been a factor. Flight TK6491 was set to stop at Manas en route from Hong Kong to Istanbul. Manas has been massively expanded since the US began to use it as a military base for operations in Afghanistan. American troops vacated it and handed it to the Kyrgyz military in 2014.  It was not clear how many people were on the plane, but it had seating for 10 people including two pilots.  The aircraft belonged to Istanbul-based ACT Airlines, which operates under the name MyCargo, but was being flown for Turkish Airlines.  Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called his Kyrgyz counterpart Erlan Abdildaev to offer condolences. An investigation will be launched. The flight recorders are yet to be found.

Author By Dani Rodrik International Political Economy Professor, Harvard University Up Next Europe’s new “Indispensable Nations” Jan 16, 2017 Published 08:17 January 16, 2017 Updated 08:17 January 16, 2017 Trump’s defective industrial policy By Dani Rodrik International Political Economy Professor, Harvard University Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + CAMBRIDGE – US President-elect Donald Trump has yet to take office, but his brand of flawed industrial policy has been on full display since his surprise win in November. Within weeks of the election, Trump had already claimed a victory. Through a mix of inducements and intimidation, he prevailed on the heating and cooling firm Carrier to keep some of its operations in Indiana, “saving” around 1,000 American jobs. Touring the Carrier plant subsequently, he warned other US firms that he would impose stiff tariffs on them if they moved plants overseas and shipped products back home. His Twitter account has produced a stream of commentary in the same vein. He has taken credit for Ford’s decision keep a Lincoln plant in Kentucky, rather than move it to Mexico. He has threatened General Motors with import tariffs if it continues to import Chevrolet Cruzes from Mexico instead of making them in the United States. Trump has also hounded defense contractors for cost overruns, berating the aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin on separate occasions for producing planes that are too expensive. Trump’s policy style represents a sharp break from that of his predecessors. It is highly personalized and temperamental. It relies on threats and bullying. It is prone to boasting, exaggeration, and lies about actual successes. It is a type of public spectacle, staged on Twitter. And it is deeply corrosive of democratic norms. Economists tend to advocate an arm’s-length relationship between government and business. Public officials are supposed to insulate themselves from private firms, lest they be corrupted and engage in favoritism. This is a prized principle in the US – but one that is more often breached than observed. An obvious example is the undeniable influence over US government policy exercised by finance moguls during the last three decades. Yet close business-government interactions also lie behind many of America’s successes. The history of US economic development is one of pragmatic partnerships and collaboration between the public and private sector, rather than arm’s-length relationships and rigid rules. As historically minded economists and policy analysts such as Michael Lind, Stephen Cohen, and Brad DeLong have reminded us, the US is heir to a Hamiltonian tradition in which the federal government provides the investment, infrastructure, finance, and other support that private enterprise needs. US technological innovation owes as much to specific government programs, such as loan assistance or government purchases as it does to American entrepreneurs’ and inventors’ ingenuity. As Harvard Business School professor Josh Lerner notes, some of the most dynamic technology companies in the US, including Apple and Intel, received financial support from the government before going public. The electric carmaker Tesla was a beneficiary of the same public loan guarantee program as Solyndra, the solar cell company that went bust in 2011 in a spectacular public collapse. As the Solyndra example illustrates, many public initiatives fail. But the ultimate test is whether the social return on the portfolio as a whole is positive, taking successes together with the flops. Such broad evaluations tend to be rare. But one analysis found that US programs to boost energy efficiency had produced positive net benefits. Interestingly, the bulk of the benefits were attributable to three relatively modest projects. Sociologists Fred Block and Matthew Keller have provided perhaps the best analysis of the US “developmental state” – a reality that they say the reigning market-fundamentalist ideology has obscured. Block and Keller describe how a “decentralized network of publicly funded laboratories” and an “alphabet soup” of financing initiatives, such as the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, work with private firms and help them commercialize their products. They and their colleagues have documented the extensive role of both federal and state governments in supporting the collaborative networks on which innovation rests – whether in biotech, green technologies, or nanotech. Such industrial policies, based on close collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors, have of course been the hallmark of East Asian economic policymaking. It is difficult to imagine China’s transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse – and the attendant success of its export-oriented model – without the Chinese government’s helping and guiding hand. It is ironic that the same people who extol Chinese gains from globalization are often alarmed that a US administration may copy the Chinese approach and explicitly endorse industrial policies. Unlike China, of course, the US purports to be a democracy. And industrial policy in a democracy requires transparency, accountability, and institutionalization. The relationship between the government and private firms has to be calibrated carefully. Government agencies need to be close enough to private enterprises to elicit the requisite information about the technological and market realities on the ground. For example, what are the fundamental reasons for the loss of manufacturing jobs in, say, automobile production, and how can the government help, if at all? But they cannot get so close to private firms that they end up in companies’ pocket, or, at the other extreme, simply order them around. And that is where industrial policy à la Trump fails to pass the test. On one hand, his appointments to key economic positions indicate he has little intention of severing government ties to Wall Street and big finance. On the other hand, his policymaking-by-tweet suggests he doesn’t have much interest in building the institutionalized dialogue, with all the required safeguards, that sound industrial policy requires. This means that we can expect the Trump administration’s industrial policy to vacillate between cronyism and bullying. That may benefit some; but it will do little good for the overwhelming majority of American workers or the economy as a whole. © Project Syndicate 1995–2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + Load next: Europe’s new “Indispensable Nations” Related News EU Affairs EU’s finance ministers freeze Basel talks on Trump administration wait By Irene Kostaki Column Total eyes EU hydrocarbon exports from Cyprus, Greece By Kostis Geropoulos Issue 1196 Issue 1196: Trump-Brexit vs. EU (Print Edition) By New Europe Exclusive Mettler: Europe’s efforts ignored in Davos By Kassandra COPYRIGHT 2016 NEW EUROPE.

PHOTO | AFP  In Summary India’s burgeoning middle classes are taking to the skies in ever greater numbers, with passenger growth of 20 percent in 2015 according to industry body IATA -- nearly double China’s 11-percent increase over the same period. Advertisement New Delhi. A major acquisition by Indian budget airline SpiceJet this week underscored the vast potential of the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, but experts say woefully inadequate infrastructure and high operating costs could threaten the industry’s rapid expansion. India’s burgeoning middle classes are taking to the skies in ever greater numbers, with passenger growth of 20 percent in 2015 according to industry body IATA -- nearly double China’s 11-percent increase over the same period. Low-cost airlines are rushing to expand their fleets to take advantage of that growth, encouraged by a fall in fuel prices that last year pushed several private operators into profit for the first time. SpiceJet, India’s fourth biggest airline with a 13-percent market share, said Friday it was buying up to 205 Boeing planes worth $22 billion to fuel a major expansion of its domestic operations. Experts say the country’s aviation sector holds vast untapped potential, with just 100 million of India’s 1.2 billion people taking to the skies last year. But they warn that India’s rickety infrastructure could hold back future growth, with just 90 of the country’s more than 460 airports currently operational. “Consistent 20-percent-plus growth per se is not a cause for celebration if the institutional framework is weak,” said Kapil Kaul, South Asia head of industry advisory and research firm CAPA. “This only increases safety and security risks. And skill shortages are also emerging. An urgent fix is required.” CAPA has warned that India could face a capacity crisis unless it builds 50 new airports over the next decade. To avoid that, the government is trying to revive some of the hundreds of disused regional airports -- among them a number of “ghost airports” that were built by the government but never used. That is because most airlines opt to increase flights to popular locations rather than adding new routes, analysts say. KPMG and industry body FICCI recently named 44 such airports that could quickly be brought into use in a research report. In 2015 the government announced a plan to “take flying to the masses” by making air travel affordable for millions more Indians, reviving struggling airports and connecting rural areas. The policy aims to slash airfares to 2,500 rupees ($37) per hour of flying on many regional routes through a slew of tax incentives and subsidies. The first round of bids for these subsidised regional routes are due to start this week, with winners getting a three-year exclusive on flying rights. Auctions for routes will be conducted twice a year. High operating costs represent the second major threat to the industry. High fuel import taxes mean that about 50 percent of an Indian airline’s costs go towards fuel, while a scarcity of pilots has pushed up salaries to global levels. “Most of the large cost heads in Indian aviation like fuel, leases, maintenance, airport charges and interest rates are some of the highest in the world,” said Amber Dubey, India head of aerospace and defence at global consultancy KPMG. “There are shortages of commanders and bringing in expat pilots is costly and time-consuming... Overall, the Indian market is one of the costliest and toughest to operate in.” India’s airlines are banking on higher passenger numbers to help distribute those high fixed costs as an emerging middle class increasingly opts for the plane over the train. Among them is electrician Shankar Singh, who took his first flight last May at the age of 31.

Korean flag carriers set to introduce new aircraft 2017/01/16 10:03 Tweet Facebook Share Google +1 Reduce Enlarge Print SEOUL, Jan. 16 (Yonhap) -- South Korea's two largest commercial airlines plan to introduce new aircraft this year, market sources said Monday, providing a chance to fly in the latest and most advanced aircraft, as well as enhanced overall flight safety by replacing aged aircraft. Local industry leader Korean Air Lines Co. is set to introduce Boeing's latest B787-9 Dreamliner in March, along with the CS300 in June. The B787 is a midsize jet airliner with up to 290 seats, and will likely be operated on routes to and from Los Angeles, Paris and London. The CS300 is a small aircraft with about 130 seats, developed and built by Canadian manufacturer Bombardier Aerospace. It is expected to serve domestic routes and short-range international flights, the informed sources said. Asiana Airlines Co., too, plans to introduce a new aircraft as a way of providing new and improved flight experiences to its passengers. The airline will begin operating the new A350-900XWB from European manufacturer Airbus in April. The A350-900 is one of the largest passenger aircraft ever built with up to 440 seats. The new aircraft, in addition to offering new flight experiences, will likely improve the South Korean airlines' safety, as well as their profitability. According to company officials, the new B787 is significantly lighter than conventional aircraft, with nearly 50 percent of its body made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic, also making it up to 20 percent more efficient in terms of fuel mileage. This file photo, taken on Dec. 25, 2016, shows Asiana Airlines officials celebrating the start of new flight services by the new Airbus A380 aircraft. (Yonhap) The A350 is said to have up to 70 percent of its body and wings made of the advanced material. South Korean flag carriers have been continuously replacing their aged aircraft since all seven airlines, including five low-cost carriers, here pledged in May 2015 to keep the age of each and every aircraft at below 20 years. There currently is no limit on the age of an aircraft, according to officials from the transportation ministry. As of 2015, only 14 out of 264 aircraft operated by the seven South Korean airlines were aged 20 years or more.

Cooper Mystery ((VO)) Clip-on-ties don’t just get you dressed in a pinch, they also now help solve crimes. ((VO)) Or at least one might in the infamous D.B. Cooper plane hijacking case. ((VO)) In 1971 a mysterious man claimed he had a bomb in a briefcase, hijacked a Boeing passenger plane- and parachuted from that plane after extorting $200,000 from the FBI. ((VO)) 45 years later- they have yet to find any clue that could lead them to the man in question. ((VO)) Until now. Amature scientists known as Citizen Sleuths analyzed a JC Penney tie that Cooper left behind and found traces of elements often seen in aerospace plants. ((VO)) Furthermore - according to the group - the elements found were used around that time specifically in Boeing plants - leading the group to believe that Cooper might have been a Boeing employee or contractor. ((VO)) The group has posted their analysis online and have asked the public to share any and all information.

Cooper Work for Boeing?! Posted 4:56 pm, January 15, 2017, by Kennedra McDonald, Updated at 04:57PM, January 15, 2017 Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Please enable Javascript to watch this video PORTLAND, Oregon -- After more than 45 years of annoying conspiracy theories, we may be one step closer to figuring out who the heck D.B. Cooper really is. Finally, right?! Back in 1971, a well-dressed man using the alias "Dan Cooper" hijacked a plane over Oregon, extorted $200,000 in cash, then parachuted out. Scientists now say new evidence from Coop's clip-on tie, that he left on the plane, suggests he may have worked for Boeing. The new team dubbed "Citizen Sleuths" claim a powerful microscope discovered rare particles only used at that time to build Boeing's high-tech Supersonic Transport plane. The sleuths say that clearly points to D.B. Cooper being a contractor or Boeing employee. The FBI closed the case back in July, but this could be a game changer. Heck, if you ask us, D.B. Cooper sure reminds us a lot of Don Draper from "Mad Men."

Baker Sunday, January 15, 2017 at 4:47 pm | י"ז טבת תשע"ז FILE – A F-35 jet arrives at its operational base at Hill Air Force Base, in northern Utah. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File) FORT WORTH, Texas (Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS) - Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson emerged from a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump Friday pledging to bring down the cost of the F-35 Lightning II and pledging to hire more than 1,800 additional workers at the Fort Worth plant. Trump has been in a dogfight with Lockheed Martin over the F-35 program, questioning its costs and capabilities. Last month he went on Twitter to say that the stealth fighter’s costs were “out of control” and he talked about replacing it with a comparable F-18 Hornet built by Boeing. “We had the opportunity to talk to him about the F-35 program and I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price,” Hewson said outside the Trump Tower in Manhattan. “So I’m glad I had the opportunity to tell him that we are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft and moreover it’s going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States,” Hewson said. Hewson went on to add that Lockheed will hire about 1,800 additional employees in Fort Worth where the F-35 is being built. Previously the company said it planned to hire 1,000 more employees as production ramped up. “In fact we are going to increase our jobs in Fort Worth by 1,800 jobs and when you think about the supply chain across 45 states in the U.S. it’s going to be thousands and thousands of jobs,” Hewson said. “And I also had the opportunity to give him some ideas on things we think we can do to continue to drive the cost down on the F-35 program, so it was a great meeting.” Lockheed Martin has been working to drive down the cost of the F-35 to about $85 million within the 2019–20 time frame. The plant employs 14,000 workers in Fort Worth with about 8,800 working on the F-35. Local plant officials declined to comment on what Hewson said Friday.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Sunday January, 29, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Burgeoning middle class sends Indian aviation sector soaring — but experts warn of turbulence ahead AFP  January 16, 2017, 12:01 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ NEW DELHI -- A major acquisition by Indian budget airline SpiceJet this week underscored the vast potential of the world's fastest-growing aviation market, but experts say woefully inadequate infrastructure and high operating costs could threaten the industry's rapid expansion. India's burgeoning middle classes are taking to the skies in ever greater numbers, with passenger growth of 20 percent in 2015 according to industry body IATA — nearly double China's 11-percent increase over the same period. Low-cost airlines are rushing to expand their fleets to take advantage of that growth, encouraged by a fall in fuel prices that last year pushed several private operators into profit for the first time. SpiceJet, India's fourth biggest airline with a 13-percent market share, said Friday it was buying up to 205 Boeing planes worth US$22 billion to fuel a major expansion of its domestic operations. Experts say the country's aviation sector holds vast untapped potential, with just 100 million of India's 1.2 billion people taking to the skies last year. But they warn that India's rickety infrastructure could hold back future growth, with just 90 of the country's more than 460 airports currently operational. "Consistent 20-percent-plus growth per se is not a cause for celebration if the institutional framework is weak," said Kapil Kaul, South Asia head of industry advisory and research firm CAPA. "This only increases safety and security risks. And skill shortages are also emerging. An urgent fix is required." CAPA has warned that India could face a capacity crisis unless it builds 50 new airports over the next decade. To avoid that, the government is trying to revive some of the hundreds of disused regional airports — among them a number of "ghost airports" that were built by the government but never used. That is because most airlines opt to increase flights to popular locations rather than adding new routes, analysts say. KPMG and industry body FICCI recently named 44 such airports that could quickly be brought into use in a research report. In 2015 the government announced a plan to "take flying to the masses" by making air travel affordable for millions more Indians, reviving struggling airports and connecting rural areas. The policy aims to slash airfares to 2,500 rupees (US$37) per hour of flying on many regional routes through a slew of tax incentives and subsidies. The first round of bids for these subsidized regional routes are due to start this week, with winners getting a three-year exclusive on flying rights. Auctions for routes will be conducted twice a year. 1|2|Next Page>> SHARE CLOSE Blogger Google+ Live Journal Plurk Stumble Upon   Tweet PREVIOUS ARTICLE Japan tourism on the rise NEXT ARTICLE Despite overseas acquisition spree, China's Wanda reports fall in revenue Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Delta Air reportedly will stop serving Taiwan in May 2 Asus unveils ZenFone with Daydream, Google Tango 3 Debate resurfaces in wake of assault 4 McDonald's sells China operations to consortium for US$2.08 billion 5 Japan's Takeda in US$5.2 billion deal for US cancer drugmaker 6 Hon Hai not to withdraw China investments 7 Taiwan sends coffee procurement delegations to Central America 8 Trump in Asia: Region poised for change as new era dawns 9 Trump's 'America First' could affect Taiwan's exports: MOEA 10 Delta Air to withdraw from Taiwan market Subscribe  |   Advertise  |   RSS Feed  |   About Us  |   Career  |   Contact Us Sitemap  |   Top Stories  |   Taiwan  |   China  |   Business  |   Asia  |   World  |   Sports  |   Life  |   Arts & Leisure  |   Health  |   Editorial  |   Commentary Travel  |   Movies  |   TV Listings  |   Classifieds  |   Bookstore  |   Getting Around  |   Weather  |   Guide Post  |   Student Post  |   Terms of Use  |   Sitemap   Copyright © 1999 – 2017 The China Post.

Cooper DB Cooper FBI This undated artist sketch shows the man known as D.B. Cooper from recollections of the passengers and crew of a Northwest Airlines jet he hijacked between Portland and Seattle on Thanksgiving eve in 1971. (AP file photo) Print Email Ray Kelly | rkelly@repub.com By Ray Kelly | rkelly@repub.com The Republican Follow on Twitter on January 15, 2017 at 10:55 AM, updated January 17, 2017 at 4:39 PM comments A group of scientists selected by federal officials in Seattle have come across new evidence that could help identify the mysterious hijacker known as D.B. Cooper. Citizen Sleuths has been analyzing particles found on the clip-on-tie that Cooper left behind after he hijacked a Northwest Orient airplane in 1971. He parachuted away with $200,000 ransom on a rainy night over the Pacific Northwest and has never been found. The group announced their findings on Travel Channel's "Expedition Unknown." Tom Kaye, lead researcher for the group, told KING-TV, Channel 5, in Seattle that a powerful microscope used in their investigation found more than 100,000 particles on the JCPenny tie. Those particles included Stronium, Cerium, Sulfide and Titanium. Those elements were used at the Boeing Co. during the development of its supersonic transport plane in the 1960s and 1970s. The evidence could point to Cooper being a contractor or employee at Boeing,  where he would have had to worn a tie and been exposed to those particles, Kaye said. Last summer, the FBI announced it was no longer actively investigating the case, saying that it had "exhaustively reviewed all credible leads" during its 45-year investigation and has redirected those resources to other priorities. On Nov. 24, 1971, a man who gave his name as Dan Cooper claimed shortly after takeoff in Portland, Ore., that he had a bomb, leading the flight crew of the Northwest Orient plane to land in Seattle. Passengers were exchanged for parachutes and ransom money. The flight then took off for Mexico with the suspect and flight crew on board. The hijacker parachuted from the plane after dark as it flew south, apparently over a rugged, wooded region.

Bullish investors, girded by his pro-business rhetoric, have pushed the Dow closer and closer to 20,000 points. But the Republican has also introduced a degree of uncertainty. Trump has made a habit of targeting specific companies on Twitter with little notice. His marks, such as Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), have seen shares plummet as a result.

Inauguration Day: On Friday, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Since his election, Trump has shown an uncanny ability to move markets. Bullish investors, girded by his pro-business rhetoric, have pushed the Dow closer and closer to 20,000 points. But the Republican has also introduced a degree of uncertainty. Trump has made a habit of targeting specific companies on Twitter with little notice. His marks, such as Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), have seen shares plummet as a result. Corporate America could be in for a bumpy ride over the next four years. Related: Lee Greenwood to perform at concert for Donald Trump's inauguration 2. Time for Davos: Business and political leaders from around the world will convene in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday to kick off the World Economic Forum. IMF director Christine Lagarde, Facebook (FB, Tech30) COO Sheryl Sandberg, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) founder Jack Ma will be among those in attendance. This year's theme is "Responsive and Responsible Leadership." 3. Wilbur Ross confirmation: The Senate will decide whether to confirm billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for Commerce secretary on Wednesday. Ross is known for buying up distressed and failing companies. He made a name for himself acquiring troubled assets in the steel and coal industry, but has focused more on banks since the 2008 financial crisis. The Senate's hearing for Tom Price, Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services department, is also on Wednesday. Price, an orthopedic surgeon, is an ardent critic of Obama's Affordable Care Act.

A smattering of earnings: Goldman Sachs (GS), Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) and American Express (AXP) are among companies reporting earnings this week. Investors will watch Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citi (C) to see if they match last week's solid reports by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). Bank stocks have been on a tear since the election, boosted by the expectation of fewer regulations and rising interest rates when Trump becomes president. Netflix is also likely to garner significant attention when it posts earnings Wednesday. Last quarter, the Wall Street darling announced it had added 3.6 million subscribers, shattering expectations. The company's stock gained 8% in 2016 and hit an all-time high at the beginning of January. Related: Jamie Dimon is hopeful about Donald Trump Related: Netflix at all-time high?

The Danish government announced a recommendation to buy the jets at a rough rate of $3 billion each in May, Defense News reported. The plane is made by Lockheed Martin, which beat out other offers for the Eurofighter Typhoon — a jet made by three companies, Alenia Aermacchi, Airbus and BAE systems — as well as from Boeing. Denmark is one of nine countries worldwide that partnered with Lockheed to push the F-35 joint strike fighter program. Those other countries include Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the F-35 website. Six of those countries have already received their first jets from the program. Three foreign nonpartners received their first jets in 2016.

Photo: REUTERS/Gary Cameron “Our company has evolved parallel to the program and we are excited to see what this new phase in our collaboration will bring. One thing is certain: We look forward to explore new areas of cooperation and bring ‘best value’ to the F-35 program,” Jens Maaløe, president of Terma, Denmark’s largest defense company and a manufacturer of parts for the F-35, said in a statement following the announcement. “To be a supplier to the international military aircraft industry takes hard work and dedication — and we are ready to continue down the road we began more than a decade ago.” The F-35 is the most expensive weapons system in history and has seen its fair share of controversy. Wanting to stay ahead of China and Russia, the U.S. Pentagon started buying the jet before testing — a break from general practices for weapons acquisition. The aircraft, however, had several unforeseen flaws, resulting in $163 billion in extra costs above what was expected.  Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

We want to hear your story BUSINESS How to invest for the Age of Trump Donald Trump Drew Angerer / Getty Images Donald Trump's blunt and off-the-cuff Twitter style can sink a company's stock. Donald Trump's blunt and off-the-cuff Twitter style can sink a company's stock. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images) Tom Petruno Investing for the Age of Trump presents some special considerations for financial advisors. For one, there's the risk of a 3 a.m. Donald Trump tweet that torpedoes one of your favorite stocks. Never before have advisors faced the kind of power the new president can wield over financial markets and individual investments via social media. Witness Trump’s use of Twitter in recent weeks to criticize publicly traded companies including Ford, General Motors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin for business decisions he didn't like. But it’s the bigger picture that will be crucial for advisors to get right: choosing the optimal mix of stocks, bonds and other assets appropriate for the economic backdrop under Trump, as well as for each client’s risk tolerance. Here are some of the concerns and opportunities advisors see as the Trump era begins: Bonds are the biggest worry Short- and long-term interest rates jumped immediately after the election, as traders and investors bet that Trump will succeed in boosting U.S. economic growth. What’s more, the Federal Reserve in December raised its benchmark short-term rate for the first time in 12 months. In theory, stronger growth should mean rates will continue to rise from the super-low levels of  the last eight years. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note now is 2.38%, up from a record low of 1.32% in July but still relatively depressed historically. Higher market rates make new bonds more attractive. But they also devalue the trillions of dollars in older bonds that carry lower fixed rates. As a result, investors’ bond holdings mostly lost ground in the second half of 2016. The share price of the popular Vanguard Total Bond Market exchange-traded fund slid 5.8% from its summer peak to its December low.  That wiped out the equivalent of two years’ worth of interest earnings from the fund. “People don’t realize the damage that bonds can cause” as market rates rise, said Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors. For uninformed investors, “it’s what is going to cause the most pain” if the economy accelerates, he said. To limit potential bond losses, Bel Air is keeping clients’ bond holdings mostly in issues that mature within 2.5 years, Morgan said. Shorter-term bonds decline less than longer-term issues when interest rates rise. Laila Pence, president of Pence Wealth Management in Newport Beach, also is keeping clients’ bond holdings in shorter-term issues. In addition, she said the firm has moved money into floating-rate bonds that pay more as market rates increase. More excitement over U.S. stocks Typically at new market highs, some clients call Pence wondering if it’s a good time to sell stocks, she said. But this time, “our clients are excited and they are more bullish,” she said. Morgan said Bel Air over the last year has raised stocks from 30% to 40% of total assets in one of its benchmark portfolios, with 25% in bonds and 35% spread across a variety of other investments.  But he said he still finds many people prefer to keep “too much in cash and too much in bonds.” That may change if investors see Trump’s pro-growth policies such as tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation take root, Morgan said. Many advisors and fund managers continue to favor U.S. banks and other financial stocks as a way to play rising interest rates. “I still think there may be opportunity there,” said Jerry Dodson, whose highly rated Parnassus Fund in San Francisco has stakes in companies including brokerage Charles Schwab and insurance giant Progressive Corp. Foreign stocks still attractive Many Wall Street pros in recent years have been recommending foreign shares as better values than richly priced U.S. issues. Yet foreign markets in general have continued to lag behind the U.S. market. That isn't deterring foreign-stock fans.  Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, notes that if the global economy finally picks up steam, profit growth at foreign companies could be impressive. Compared with U.S. companies, many foreign firms “are at a younger point in their earnings cycle,” he said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s chief investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, expects European stocks to produce double-digit returns this year. The plunge in the euro from $1.40 three years ago to $1.06 now has made European exports cheaper.  The problem is that the slump in most currencies against the dollar also has devalued Americans’ overseas investments. So far this year, however, the dollar has weakened modestly. If it slips further, or just stabilizes, that could end the currency drag on U.S. investors’ foreign holdings. Emerging-market stocks remain depressed: The average emerging-markets mutual fund has lost an average of 3.2% a year over the last three years while the U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 index has surged 9.5% a year. A big risk with emerging markets is Trump's trade-war threat against major exporters including China and Mexico. Still, investors who like to go against conventional wisdom “should be tempted by emerging markets,” Hartnett said. Is it time to think about timing? With U.S. stocks flying high, and the bull market nearing its eighth birthday, the lure of selling out completely and waiting for the next bear market to buy is understandable. The problem is that even the savviest professionals find that timing the market correctly is virtually impossible. Selling may be easy; getting back in is not. Parnassus Fund's Dodson has been a star stock-picker for decades. The fund has gained an average of 9.6% a year over the last 10 years versus 7% for the S&P 500.  In his younger days, Dodson said, he periodically tried to make timing decisions about broad market trends. “But I stopped doing it because it hurt results,” he said. Now, he said, he pays attention only to the fundamentals of his individual stocks. Of course, having some cash reserves in a portfolio is a good idea if you’re hoping to take advantage of a market sell-off in the future. The challenge is having the discipline to buy into a falling market. That’s one big advantage that investors in 401(k)-style accounts have: Because they're investing with every paycheck, they can be sure they'll be buying low when stocks drop. Simple, but elegant.

(File photo / Reuters) NEW DELHI: A major acquisition by Indian budget airline SpiceJet this week underscored the vast potential of the world's fastest-growing aviation market, but experts say woefully inadequate infrastructure and high operating costs could threaten the industry's rapid expansion. India's burgeoning middle classes are taking to the skies in ever greater numbers, with passenger growth of 20 percent in 2015 according to industry body IATA -- nearly double China's 11-percent increase over the same period. Low-cost airlines are rushing to expand their fleets to take advantage of that growth, encouraged by a fall in fuel prices that last year pushed several private operators into profit for the first time. SpiceJet, India's fourth biggest airline with a 13-percent market share, said Friday it was buying up to 205 Boeing planes worth $22 billion to fuel a major expansion of its domestic operations. Experts say the country's aviation sector holds vast untapped potential, with just 100 million of India's 1.2 billion people taking to the skies last year. But they warn that India's rickety infrastructure could hold back future growth, with just 90 of the country's more than 460 airports currently operational. "Consistent 20-percent-plus growth per se is not a cause for celebration if the institutional framework is weak," said Kapil Kaul, South Asia head of industry advisory and research firm CAPA. "This only increases safety and security risks. And skill shortages are also emerging. An urgent fix is required." CAPA has warned that India could face a capacity crisis unless it builds 50 new airports over the next decade. To avoid that, the government is trying to revive some of the hundreds of disused regional airports -- among them a number of "ghost airports" that were built by the government but never used. That is because most airlines opt to increase flights to popular locations rather than adding new routes, analysts say. KPMG and industry body FICCI recently named 44 such airports that could quickly be brought into use in a research report. In 2015 the government announced a plan to "take flying to the masses" by making air travel affordable for millions more Indians, reviving struggling airports and connecting rural areas. The policy aims to slash airfares to 2,500 rupees ($37) per hour of flying on many regional routes through a slew of tax incentives and subsidies. The first round of bids for these subsidised regional routes are due to start this week, with winners getting a three-year exclusive on flying rights. Auctions for routes will be conducted twice a year.    - 'Costliest and toughest' -   High operating costs represent the second major threat to the industry. High fuel import taxes mean that about 50 percent of an Indian airline's costs go towards fuel, while a scarcity of pilots has pushed up salaries to global levels.  "Most of the large cost heads in Indian aviation like fuel, leases, maintenance, airport charges and interest rates are some of the highest in the world," said Amber Dubey, India head of aerospace and defence at global consultancy KPMG. "There are shortages of commanders and bringing in expat pilots is costly and time-consuming... Overall, the Indian market is one of the costliest and toughest to operate in." India's airlines are banking on higher passenger numbers to help distribute those high fixed costs as an emerging middle class increasingly opts for the plane over the train. Among them is electrician Shankar Singh, who took his first flight last May at the age of 31. Singh, who earns 15,000 rupees ($220) a month, has now flown nearly 10 times to different cities to stores run by his employer, an Indian clothing retailer. He plans to take his wife and three-year-old son on their first flight to visit her family in Kolkata in eastern India early this year -- replacing a 24-hour train ride with a two-and-a-half hour journey. "I really want them to experience it," he said, a smile lighting up his face. KPMG's Dubey said India remained "one of the most under-penetrated countries in the world". "With passenger traffic growing at over 20 percent for nearly two years despite severe infrastructure challenges, India is the place to be," he told AFP.

While one had around 360 passengers, the other was empty and parked. The incident took place on December 2, 2016. Officials said an Emirates Airlines plane, which had just landed, was asked to park on a bay already occupied by a Turkish Airlines aircraft. As the airplane moved towards the assigned bay amid dense fog, the pilot suddenly saw an aircraft parked 15 metres away. He brought his plane to a halt with just a few metres to spare. Airport technology had wrongly shown that Turkish Airlines had vacated its stand at B15, and that its aircraft has already moved from its position at 6:57am. The probe finds that Universal Flight Information System (UFIS), traffic and resource planning and management system, showed that stand B15 was vacated by the Turkish aircraft at 6.57am at the airport. “Although Delhi airport has state-of-the-art technology, it has limitations during low visibility. If the flight was moving at the prescribed speed of 12 nautical miles on the ground, it could have led to a disaster. Luckily, it was going much slower,” a senior official claimed. “Turkish Airlines didn’t vacate the stand and Emirates aircraft was not informed about it since the UFIS had told that Turkish aircraft had taken off,” a report said.

The launch, which is the first since Sept.1, delivered 10 satellites to low-Earth orbit for the communications company Iridium. The 10 satellites are the first of at least 70 that SpaceX will launch for Iridium's global satellite constellation, Iridium NEXT, over the next 14 months. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, Jan. 14, 2017. Photo: SpaceX In addition to clinching the launch, SpaceX also successfully landed the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, setting it down on a drone ship named “Just Read the Instructions” off the coast of California. Landing and reusing recovered boosters is a key part of the company’s ambitious space program, as it would drastically reduce the cost of launches and space travel. Related Stories SpaceX, Boeing Win NASA Contracts For Crewed ISS Missions SpaceX Releases Teaser For 'World's Most Powerful Rocket' Satuday’s launch is the first one since the September disaster, when an explosion destroyed one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets and a $200 million AMOS-6 communications satellite it was carrying. Earlier this month, after an in-depth Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-monitored investigation, SpaceX announced it had pinpointed the cause of the Sept.1 mishap. Its investigation revealed “buckles” in the inner liner of one of the composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs), which are used to store liquid helium. “Although buckles were not shown to burst a COPV on their own, investigators concluded that super chilled liquid oxygen can pool in these buckles under the overwrap. When pressurized, oxygen pooled in this buckle can become trapped; in turn, breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap, causing the COPV to fail,” SpaceX explained in an anomaly update. “In addition, investigators determined that the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen, which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition.” In order to prevent such catastrophic COPV failure, the company plans to — in the short-term — change the way it loads helium, and, in the long term, implement design changes to the COPV to stop it from buckling. Saturday’s successful launch puts SpaceX back on track toward fulfilling its space ambitions. The company currently has a backlog of over 70 missions, estimated to be worth over $10 billion. According to internal documents recently accessed by the Wall Street Journal, SpaceX hopes to fly as many as 27 times this year — much more than it has ever done in a single year.

PHOTO: AFP NEW DELHI,: A major acquisition by Indian budget airline SpiceJet this week underscored the vast potential of the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, but experts say woefully inadequate infrastructure and high operating costs could threaten the industry’s rapid expansion. India’s burgeoning middle classes are taking to the skies in ever greater numbers, with passenger growth of 20 percent in 2015 according to industry body IATA – nearly double China’s 11-percent increase over the same period. Low-cost airlines are rushing to expand their fleets to take advantage of that growth, encouraged by a fall in fuel prices that last year pushed several private operators into profit for the first time. SpiceJet, India’s fourth biggest airline with a 13-percent market share, said on Friday it was buying up to 205 Boeing planes worth $22 billion to fuel a major expansion of its domestic operations. Experts say the country’s aviation sector holds vast untapped potential, with just 100 million of India’s 1.2 billion people taking to the skies last year. But they warn that India’s rickety infrastructure could hold back future growth, with just 90 of the country’s more than 460 airports currently operational. Air India ranked third-worst airline in the world “Consistent 20-percent-plus growth per se is not a cause for celebration if the institutional framework is weak,” said Kapil Kaul, South Asia head of industry advisory and research firm CAPA. “This only increases safety and security risks. And skill shortages are also emerging. An urgent fix is required.” CAPA has warned that India could face a capacity crisis unless it builds 50 new airports over the next decade. To avoid that, the government is trying to revive some of the hundreds of disused regional airports — among them a number of “ghost airports” that were built by the government but never used. That is because most airlines opt to increase flights to popular locations rather than adding new routes, analysts say. KPMG and industry body FICCI recently named 44 such airports that could quickly be brought into use in a research report. In 2015 the government announced a plan to “take flying to the masses” by making air travel affordable for millions more Indians, reviving struggling airports and connecting rural areas. The policy aims to slash airfares to 2,500 rupees ($37) per hour of flying on many regional routes through a slew of tax incentives and subsidies. The first round of bids for these subsidised regional routes are due to start this week, with winners getting a three-year exclusive on flying rights. Auctions for routes will be conducted twice a year. ‘Costliest and toughest’  High operating costs represent the second major threat to the industry. High fuel import taxes mean that about 50 percent of an Indian airline’s costs go towards fuel, while a scarcity of pilots has pushed up salaries to global levels. “Most of the large cost heads in Indian aviation like fuel, leases, maintenance, airport charges and interest rates are some of the highest in the world,” said Amber Dubey, India head of aerospace and defence at global consultancy KPMG. “There are shortages of commanders and bringing in expat pilots is costly and time-consuming. Overall, the Indian market is one of the costliest and toughest to operate in.” Indian teen stripped, has head shaved on train for stealing bag India’s airlines are banking on higher passenger numbers to help distribute those high fixed costs as an emerging middle class increasingly opts for the plane over the train. Among them is electrician Shankar Singh, who took his first flight last May at the age of 31. Singh, who earns 15,000 rupees ($220) a month, has now flown nearly 10 times to different cities to stores run by his employer, an Indian clothing retailer. He plans to take his wife and three-year-old son on their first flight to visit her family in Kolkata in eastern India early this year – replacing a 24-hour train ride with a two-and-a-half hour journey. “I really want them to experience it,” he said, a smile lighting up his face. KPMG’s Dubey said India remained “one of the most under-penetrated countries in the world.” “With passenger traffic growing at over 20 percent for nearly two years despite severe infrastructure challenges, India is the place to be,” he told AFP.

It's been more than a decade since a handful of ambitious entrepreneurs saw their plans to provide global telecommunications service through massive satellite constellations blow up, doomed by runaway costs. Now, a new generation of satellite entrepreneurs is headed back to the launch pad. Backed by billions of dollars from deep-pocketed investors, they plan to blanket the earth in the next few years with perhaps thousands of miniature satellites beaming cheap, ubiquitous broadband service. What's different? Launching one of these smaller satellites can cost a fraction of the price for a larger, school-bus-sized satellite. These new satellites will largely be mass-produced. And consumers now demand high-speed internet connectivity pretty much everywhere, on airplanes, cruise ships and in the remotest village in Africa. Companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb and Boeing have all recently proposed networks of satellites in low-Earth orbit to provide high-speed broadband access around the globe. Even Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has aspirations to bring internet to poorly connected areas — a plan that was derailed in September after a satellite set to beam high-speed service to areas including sub-Saharan Africa was destroyed in the explosion of a SpaceX rocket on a Florida launch pad. If this latest wave of satellite networks gets off the ground, it could pose a challenge to a $224.6 billion industry currently dominated by telecom and cable companies with their miles of fiber optic and copper wires. “That's going to shake up how these operators are controlling different regions, and it's going to allow the consumer a little more of an option,” said Taylor Palmer, industry analyst at market research firm IBISWorld. In mid-December, the Arlington, Va.-based OneWeb said it secured $1.2 billion of funded capital in a round led by Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group Corp., which contributed $1 billion of the total. The money will fund construction of a Florida satellite manufacturing plant, which is set to start production in 2018. SoftBank is just one addition to OneWeb's list of big-name investors, which includes Qualcomm Inc., Airbus Group, the Coca-Cola Co. and Richard Branson's Virgin Group. “One of the main challenges is raising financing from investors, so this proves they are able to continue doing that and they're still attracting money from these big, established companies,” said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at market research firm Forecast International. “That's going to be really vital.” Satellite-provided broadband service is still tiny. It generated revenues of $1.9 billion in 2015, according to a June report from the Tauri Group that was commissioned by the Satellite Industry Association trade group. That compares with $97.8 billion for satellite television. But interest in satellite broadband is growing as consumers expect high-speed service in places that aren't always well-served by fiber or cable. Last month, Southwest Airlines said it planned to equip its entire fleet of more than 700 planes with WiFi. “There's a competitive advantage for those that have that service available,” said Tom Stroup, president of the Satellite Industry Association. “Broadband has essentially become an expected fact of life.” Analysts say satellite constellations could have the biggest effect in remote areas. In 2014, almost half of the world's population lived in rural regions, which are largely unconnected to the internet, according to a report from ITU, a special agency of the United Nations that handles information and communication technologies. “Internet access is fundamental for understanding of culture, cultural differences, civic understanding and participation,” said Greg Wyler, founder and executive chairman of OneWeb. “It helps make the unconnected economically relevant to the developed world. When they're economically relevant, we pay a lot more attention to them.” The company has an ambitious timeline. It plans to launch the first 10 satellites into low-Earth orbit in early 2018 to test their capabilities. More launches will follow, with its broadband access beginning as early as 2019. By 2022, OneWeb says it will connect every unconnected school to the internet. Eventually, OneWeb plans a 700-satellite constellation. OneWeb's satellite manufacturing facility in Exploration Park, Fla., is key to these plans. The company will mass produce its micro-satellites with automated assembly capabilities similar to those used in aircraft production facilities, eventually making three a day. OneWeb has said the satellites will weigh about 330 pounds. SpaceX, based outside Los Angeles, plans to eventually launch more than 4,000 satellites for its network. Each satellite would be about 13 feet long and 6 feet wide, with 19-foot-long solar arrays. In 2015, the company received a $1 billion infusion from Google Inc. and Fidelity Investments and opened an office in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle, to focus on developing the small satellites. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the whole constellation could cost $10 billion to $15 billion.

He was 82. "It is with very deep sadness that we share the loss of our beloved husband and father," said Cernan's family. "Our family is heartbroken, of course, and we truly appreciate everyone's thoughts and prayers. Gene, as he was known by so many, was a loving husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend." If you're viewing on our ABC13 news app, tap on the photo above to see more images. Cernan, commander of Apollo 17 in December 1972, was the 11th person to walk on the moon, and the last one. Humbled by his life experiences, particularly as an Apollo Astronaut, the retired Naval officer recently said, "I was just a young kid in America growing up with a dream. Today what's most important to me is my desire to inspire the passion in the hearts and minds of future generations of young men and women to see their own impossible dreams become a reality." RELATED: Remembering Apollo 11 moon landing anniversary Cernan, a captain in the US Navy, flew in space three times, including two trips to the moon. He was one of 14 astronauts selected by NASA in October 1963. Cernan was commander of NASA's Apollo 17 mission and on his third space flight when set foot on the lunar surface in December 1972. He became the last of only a dozen men to walk on the moon on Dec. 14, 1972 - tracing his only child's initials in the dust before climbing the ladder of the lunar module the last time. It was a moment that forever defined him in both the public eye and his own. "Those steps up that ladder, they were tough to make," Cernan recalled in a 2007 oral history. "I didn't want to go up. I wanted to stay a while." Cernan called it "perhaps the brightest moment of my life. ... It's like you would want to freeze that moment and take it home with you. But you can't." "Even at the age of 82, Gene was passionate about sharing his desire to see the continued human exploration of space and encouraged our nation's leaders and young people to not let him remain the last man to walk on the Moon," the family continued. If you're viewing on our ABC13 news app, tap on the photo above to see more images. Decades later, Cernan tried to ensure he wasn't the last person to walk on the moon, testifying before Congress to push for a return. But as the years went by he realized he wouldn't live to witness someone follow in his footsteps - still visible on the moon more than 40 years later. "Neil (Armstrong, who died in 2012) and I aren't going to see those next young Americans who walk on the moon. And God help us if they're not Americans," Cernan testified before Congress in 2011. "When I leave this planet, I want to know where we are headed as a nation. That's my big goal." Cernan died less than six weeks after another American space hero, John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. Their flights weren't the first or last of the Mercury and Apollo eras. Yet to the public they were the bookends of America's space age glory, starting with Godspeed John Glenn and ending with Cernan's footprints on the moon. On Dec. 11, 1972, Cernan guided the lander, named Challenger, into a lunar valley called Taurus-Littrow, with Harrison "Jack" Schmitt at his side. He recalled the silence after the lunar lander's engine shut down. "That's where you experience the most quiet moment a human being can experience in his lifetime," Cernan said in 2007. "There's no vibration. There's no noise. The ground quit talking. Your partner is mesmerized. He can't say anything. "The dust is gone. It's a realization, a reality, all of a sudden you have just landed in another world on another body out there (somewhere in the) universe, and what you are seeing is being seen by human beings - human eyes - for the first time." Three days earlier, Cernan, Schmitt and Ronald Evans had blasted off atop a Saturn rocket in the first manned nighttime launch from Kennedy Space Center. Evans remained behind as pilot of the command module that orbited the moon while the other two landed on the moon's surface. Cernan and Schmitt, a geologist, spent more than three days on the moon, including more than 22 hours outside the lander, and collected 249 pounds of lunar samples. "In that whole three days, I don't think there's anything that became routine," Cernan recalled. "But if I had to focus on one thing ... it was just to look back at the overwhelming and overpowering beauty of this Earth." "To go a quarter of a million miles away into space and have to take time out to sleep and rest ... I wished I could have stayed awake for 75 hours straight. I knew when I left I'd never have a chance to come back." Completing their third moon walk on Dec. 14, Schmitt returned to the lunar module and was followed by Cernan. "We leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind," Cernan said. He later acknowledged that he had grasped for words to leave behind, knowing how the world remembered Neil Armstrong's "giant leap for mankind" on stepping on the moon in 1969. Before heading home, Cernan said he drew the letters "TDC" - the initials of his then 9-year-old daughter, Teresa Dawn - with his finger on the dusty gray lunar surface. He said he imagined someone in the distant future would find "our lunar rover and our footprints and those initials and say, 'I wonder who was here? Some ancient civilization was here back in the 20th century, and look at the funny marks they made.'" Eugene A. Cernan was born in 1934 in Chicago and graduated from Indiana's Purdue University in 1956 with a degree in electrical engineering. (Armstrong also was a Purdue grad.) He had been a Navy attack pilot and earned a master's degree in aeronautical engineering when NASA selected him in October 1963 as one of 14 members of its third astronaut class. Cernan had the looks of an astronaut from central casting. "He's your classic sort of handsome debonair flyboy," said space historian Roger Launius, associate director of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. In 1966, he was pilot of Gemini 9, a three-day flight with command pilot Tom Stafford where they used different techniques to rendezvous with a docking adapter that was previously launched. On the flight, Cernan became the second American to walk in space, spending more than two hours outside the Gemini spacecraft.

"It was very serious," said Launius, the historian. "He lost all kinds of water, his equipment did not work effectively. He overheated. His visor glossed over with water, he could barely see. He barely got back in the spacecraft." Cernan's sweat so much he lost 13 pounds. The space agency was forced to go back to the drawing board. "That was a really important learning experience," Launius said. "The difficult thing about that is they put an astronaut's life at great risk there. They learned the lesson." With the Apollo program under way, Cernan flew on Apollo 10 in May 1969. It was a dress rehearsal for the lunar landing on the next flight and took Cernan and Stafford, aboard the lunar module Snoopy, to within 9 miles of the moon's surface. The mission was marked by a glitch when the wrong guidance system was turned on and the lunar module went out of control before Stafford righted it by taking manual control. Cernan often joked that his job was to paint a white line to the moon that Armstrong and the rest of the Apollo 11 crew could follow. Yet Cernan was one of only three people to voyage twice to the moon - either to its surface or in moon orbit. James Lovell and John Young are the others. In 1973, Cernan became special assistant to the program manager of the Apollo program at Johnson Space Center in Houston, assisting in planning and development of the U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz mission. He was senior U.S. negotiator with the Soviets on the test project. He retired from NASA three years later. He worked for a Houston energy firm, Coral Petroleum, then in 1981 began his own aerospace consulting company. He eventually became chairman of an engineering firm that worked on NASA projects. He also worked as a network television analyst during shuttle flights in the 1980s. A documentary about his life, "The Last Man on the Moon" was released in 2016. Eyewitness News sat down with Cernan ahead of the documentary's release.

The couple married in 1961 and divorced 20 years later. In 1987, he married again, to Jan Nanna, and they lived in Houston. In all, Cernan logged 566 hours and 15 minutes in space, more than 73 hours of them on the moon's surface. "I can always walk on Main Street again, but I can never return to my Valley of Taurus-Littrow, and that cold fact has left me with a yearning restlessness," he wrote in his 1999 autobiography, also entitled "The Last Man on the Moon." "It was perhaps the brightest moment of my life, and I can't go back," he said. "Enriched by a singular event that is larger than life, I no longer have the luxury of being ordinary." Cernan is survived by his wife, Jan Nanna Cernan, his daughter and son-in-law, Tracy Cernan Woolie and Marion Woolie, step-daughters Kelly Nanna Taff and husband, Michael, and Danielle Nanna Ellis and nine grandchildren.

The plane was attempting a landing at the Manas airport in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek in thick fog. Crushed cars, shattered homes and huge chunks of burnt debris littered the village, which was hit by the plane at around 7:30 am (0130 GMT), as many residents were still at home in bed. "Our grandson said something was burning," Tajikan, a Dacha Suu resident who identified herself only by her first name, told AFP. "We heard a roar and (what felt) like an earthquake. Many people were sleeping, everything around was burning. One of the parts of the aircraft fell on our neighbour's house. She and her whole family died," the pensioner said. Zumriyat Rezakhanova, another resident of Dacha-Suu, said the plane fell "right on the homes" where residents were sleeping. "My sister's home is badly damaged. Luckily she and her family survived," Rezakhanova told AFP. DEEPLY SADDENED The flight was travelling from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Billion Dollar Investments in Satellite Internet Signal Strong Potential Growth, Says SatelliteWerx.com Billion Dollar Investments in Satellite Internet Signal Strong Potential Growth, Says SatelliteWerx.com Posted on January 16, 2017 by Charles Sanderson Public Relations in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ / ACCESSWIRE / January 16, 2017 / The largest high-tech companies are in a race to bring high-speed Internet service to remote areas of the US, as well as the rest of the planet. While most of us in the West take high-speed Internet access for granted, there are about 4 billion people, mostly in developing countries, or roughly 60% of the worlds population, that do not have any Internet access at all, according to SatelliteWerx.com, a popular news and reviews service focusing on satellite TV and satellite Internet. See here: http://satellitewerx.com/. Satellite Internet is a technology that has the ability to provide a space-based alternative to cable and fiber optics, and the ability to connect those regions of the world lacking Internet access. A number of companies, including some of the tech giants such as Facebook, Google, SpaceX, and others, are working on the development of these capabilities. Presently, only the US, Europe, Asia, and parts of India have good availability of high-speed Internet service. Much of the rest of the world has limited access or none at all. But even in many remote areas of the United States, Internet service of the high-speed variety is sorely lacking. At this time, fiber optic cables account for 99% of international communication, while satellites account for only about 1%. But looming technological advancements may change that equation. SpaceX, the rocket launch company founded by Elon Musk of Pay Pal and Tesla fame, is pursuing a major venture into satellite Internet. In late 2016, SpaceX filed a request with the U.S. FCC (Federal Communications Commission) for approval for a huge satellite network in order to employ a global high-speed Internet service. The SpaceX proposal would ultimately be made up of 4,425 satellites and would cost a minimum of $10 billion. Among the SpaceX financial investors are Google (now Alphabet) and Fidelity Investments, which have thus far invested a reported $1 billion. According to the company’s FCC filing, “The system is designed to provide a wide range of broadband and communications services for residential, commercial, institutional, government, and professional users worldwide.” Another pending venture for satellite Internet is in the works from the company OneWeb. OneWeb recently received a $1.2 billion investment from Softbank, a large Japanese telephone and Internet company. Investors including Virgin, Boeing, Coca Cola, Qualcomm, and Airbus provided an earlier investment of $500 million. Additionally, the Facebook venture into satellite is also potentially significant, as well. They indicate that most of the world does not have access to the Internet and they are working on methods to change this through a number of different technologies, including high-altitude long-endurance planes, lasers, and satellites. Since Facebook’s future growth will be greatly impacted by the amount of people who have access to the Internet, and since a large portion of the planet does not currently have access, it is advantageous for Facebook to see expanded global Internet access. Facebook is partnering with Eutelsat Communications on this project to launch the AMOS-6 satellite. The Paris, France headquartered Eutelsat Communications is one of the world’s leading satellite communications companies. The upcoming rollout of the ViaSat-3 ultra-high capacity satellite platform that will include three ViaSat Class 3 satellites, and the venture proposes to make available to most of the planet the opportunity to receive super fast high speed Internet, with 100+ Mbps broadband service for every consumer. Each one of these new ViaSat satellites will offer 1-Terabit per second of network capacity. That translates to three times the total capacity of all commercial satellites presently orbiting the Earth. So everyone, in every part of the globe, could have access to high-speed Internet and video streaming services if the ViaSat plan becomes fully functional. The core technology exists for a significant expansion of satellite communications services, including satellite Internet and satellite TV, and may become more viable subject to pending technological advancements, as well as improved economics, in the next few years. SatelliteWerx.com is a popular reviews service covering satellite Internet services and satellite television services. The site also features an entertainment blog with reviews of movies and TV shows. The company recently added a new section on SatelliteWerx.com that is a marketplace for domain names related to the satellite communications industry, and television and video streaming services, a growing niche market for content delivery expected to see explosive growth in the coming years.

Authorities are blaming pilot error. A massive section of the aircraft’s tail billowed smoke as rescuers searched for victims among the wreckage in the village of Dacha-Suu, home to the majority of the victims. “According to preliminary information, the plane crashed due to a pilot error,” Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev said at a briefing broadcast on state television. At least 37 people, including the plane’s four pilots, were killed and the toll may rise, said Muhammed Svarov, a spokesman for the emergency services. The plane, which was operated by a Turkish cargo airline, was attempting a landing at Manas airport in Bishkek in thick fog. Crushed cars, shattered homes and huge chunks of burnt debris littered the village, which was hit by the plane around 7:30am, a time when many of its residents would still be at home in bed. “Our grandson said something was burning,” one villager told reporters. “We heard a roar and (what felt) like an earthquake.

She and her whole family died.” Zumriyat Rezakhanova, another villager, said that the plane fell “right on the homes” where residents were sleeping. “My sister’s home is badly damaged. Luckily she and her family survived,” Rezakhanova said. The cargo plane was on its way from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan’s capital. One of the plane’s black boxes was recovered from the crash site, the government said in a statement. It did not say how long it would take to decipher. International aviation experts and representatives of the company who flew the plane, ACT Airlines, will arrive at the crash site today, Abulgaziev said at a late briefing, adding that the search operation will resume in the morning in areas where the largest pieces of the plane fell. In a statement, the Turkish cargo airline said it was a Boeing 747-400 which crashed. ACT Airlines said it was “deeply saddened” by the crash and noted that “the cause of the accident is unknown.” Boeing, the plane’s manufacturer, meanwhile extended its “deepest condolences” over the crash and offered to assist Kyrgyz authorities with the investigation. Elmira Sheripova, a spokeswoman for the emergency services ministry, said that 17 houses had been “completely destroyed” when the plane crashed. Manas airport has since reopened despite air authorities initially saying the hub would remain shut until the evening.

About nine minutes later, the first stage returned to Earth and landed successfully on a barge in the Pacific Ocean south of Vandenberg. The 10 satellites launched Saturday are part of McLean, Virginia-based Iridium's project to replace its existing network of satellites that provide global voice and data communications. (SpaceX via AP) Print Email The Republican Editorials By The Republican Editorials masslive.com on January 16, 2017 at 10:31 AM, updated January 16, 2017 at 10:32 AM comments On the same day that The Wall Street Journal published a lengthy account of the financial difficulties suffered by SpaceX, which saw a rocket catch fire and then blow up on its launch pad last fall, the private company that has touted its plans to bring people to Mars as soon as 2024 successfully launched its first rocket since the September disaster. SpaceX says it has plans for 70 future launches currently on the books. Here's hoping for success, not only for SpaceX, but also for other private space ventures. Space is still the final frontier – and will be for a very long time to come. Though SpaceX founder Elon Musk hopes to make the journey into space cheaper and more routine, getting a rocket ship off the ground and into space is still no simple feat. The rocket that blew up last fall had been carrying a $200 million Israeli satellite that Facebook had intended to lease. The rocket that was successfully launched on Saturday was ferrying 10 replacement satellites for Iridium Communications. SpaceX plans six additional launches over the next 14 months, each with another 10 Iridium satellites. That would be a positive step, but it would be just getting going. For those who remember the space race of the 1960s, when NASA and the Soviet Union sought to one-up each other, the doings of the current crop of competing private companies can seem a bit reminiscent of those days. SpaceX hopes to launch a series of satellites that will be used to provide high-speed Internet access across the globe. And with the money it expects to make from that venture, it will then get to work on its planned mission to Mars. Put simply, SpaceX is thinking big. If it and competing companies – a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed martin, and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, to name but two – are successful, it's possible that imaginings once exclusive to works of science fiction will one day become our reality. SpaceX's next rocket, dubbed the Falcon Heavy, will be the most powerful rocket since NASA's Saturn V, which launched men on their way to the moon. Fifty years later, we'll finally be getting back to where we were. And heading, one can only hope, far, far beyond.

The order includes an upgrade of an existing order for 20 A320ceos (current engine option) to the new engine option (neo) version plus 60 new planes. The airline’s entire current fleet is leased. The dollar amount of the order was revealed last Thursday by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal’s Kingdom Holding Company which owns 34% of flynas. The number and type of aircraft were not announced until Monday morning. In February of last year the airline said its fleet comprised 29 Airbus jets in the A320 family. According to planespotters.net, 27 of the jets are Airbus planes, one A319 and 26 A320s, and 2 737s from The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). In August of last year flynas leased the two 737s from Turkish budget carrier Pegasus. In October flynas and Pegasus announced a code-share arrangement. Pegasus flies 58 Boeing 737s and 21 Airbus A320s about half which are leased. It’s a fair guess that the two 737s in the flynas fleet were leased as part of the agreement with Pegasus. This is one of those deals that is essentially captive. The Saudi carrier has settled on the Airbus 320 and barring some irresistibly compelling reason to change, the budget airline will stick with the A320 because it is much cheaper to train crews and provide maintenance for one airplane instead of two.

The cargo plane crashed Monday morning, killing people in the residential area adjacent to the Manas airport as well as those on the plane. (Photo | AP) DACHA SUU: A cargo plane attempting to land in thick fog crashed Monday into a village near Kyrgyzstan's main airport and killed at least 37 people, with authorities blaming "pilot error".  A massive section of the aircraft's tail billowed smoke as rescuers searched for victims among the wreckage in the village of Dacha-Suu, home to the majority of the victims. "According to preliminary information, the plane crashed due to a pilot error," Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev said at a briefing broadcast on state television. A minimum of 37 people, including the plane's four pilots, were killed and the toll may rise, said a spokesman for the emergency services, Muhammed Svarov.  The plane, operated by a Turkish cargo airline, was attempting a landing at the Manas airport in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek in thick fog.   Crushed cars, shattered homes and huge chunks of burnt debris littered the village, which was hit by the plane at around 7:30 am (0130 GMT), as many residents were still at home in bed. "Our grandson said something was burning," Tajikan, a Dacha Suu resident who identified herself only by her first name, told AFP.  "We heard a roar and (what felt) like an earthquake. Many people were sleeping, everything around was burning. One of the parts of the aircraft fell on our neighbour's house. She and her whole family died," the pensioner said.  Zumriyat Rezakhanova, another resident of Dacha Suu, said the plane fell "right on the homes" where residents were sleeping.  "My sister's home is badly damaged. Luckily she and her family survived," Rezakhanova told AFP.  The flight was travelling from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek. One of the plane's black boxes was recovered from the crash site, the government said a statement without specifying how long it would take to decipher it.  International aviation experts and representatives of the company who flew the plane, ACT Airlines, will arrive at the crash site Tuesday, Abulgaziev said at a late briefing, adding that search operation will resume in the morning in areas where the largest pieces of the plane fell. The Turkish cargo airline, said in a statement that its Boeing 747-400 was involved in the crash.  ACT Airlines said it was "deeply saddened" by the crash and noted that "the cause of the accident is unknown." Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, meanwhile extended its "deepest condolences" over the crash and offered to assist Kyrgyz authorities with the investigation.  Elmira Sheripova, a spokeswoman for the emergency services ministry, told AFP that 17 houses had been "completely destroyed" by the plane. The country's Manas airport has since reopened despite air authorities initially saying that the hub would remain shut until the evening.   Prime Minister Sooronbai Jeenbekov was heading a specially-appointed government commission to probe the crash and the country's state prosecutor also opened an investigation.   Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev cancelled his visit to China to return to Bishkek, according to Kyrgyz media. Authorities said the country will observe a day of mourning on Tuesday.

The 80 A320neo order is valued at $8.6 billion, flynas Chairman Ayed Al Jeaid said at press conference in Riyadh on Monday. The order is for 60 A320neos and an upgrade of an existing order for 20 current model A320s to neos, an Airbus spokesman confirmed. The agreement also includes purchasing options for a further 40 A320neo jets, according to flynas. Reuters reported last week that Flynas, partly owned by Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal's investment vehicle, had agreed to buy more than 60 A320neos. Delivery of the 80 A320s will take eight years from 2018, according to an Airbus statement, likely to give flynas one of the largest Middle East budget airline fleets The order means Airbus has beat rival Boeing (BA.N) to replace and expand flynas' fleet of 27 leased A320 jets. Flynas, which launched as Nas Air in 2007 and first turned a profit in 2015, is facing increasing competition in Saudi Arabia, its primary market. Start-up SaudiGulf Airlines and Saudi-owned, Egypt-based Nesma airline were granted domestic operating licenses in 2016. State-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines has announced plans for its own budget carrier, Flyadeal, to launch in mid-2017 with a target of 50 jets by 2020. Qatar Airways-owned Al Maha is waiting for a domestic Saudi operating license.

The 80 A320neo order is valued at $8.6 billion, flynas Chairman Ayed Al Jeaid said at press conference in Riyadh on Monday. The order is for 60 A320neos and an upgrade of an existing order for 20 current model A320s to neos, an Airbus spokesman confirmed. The agreement also includes purchasing options for a further 40 A320neo jets, according to flynas. Advertisement Reuters reported last week that Flynas, partly owned by Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal's investment vehicle, had agreed to buy more than 60 A320neos. Delivery of the 80 A320s will take eight years from 2018, according to an Airbus statement, likely to give flynas one of the largest Middle East budget airline fleets The order means Airbus has beat rival Boeing to replace and expand flynas' fleet of 27 leased A320 jets. Flynas, which launched as Nas Air in 2007 and first turned a profit in 2015, is facing increasing competition in Saudi Arabia, its primary market.

See Offers Posted January 15 Updated January 16 increase font size Trump says his health care proposal’s goal is ‘insurance for everybody’ The president-elect also wants drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices in Medicare and Medicaid. By Robert CostaWashington Post Share Comment Read Article President-elect Donald Trump, seen here on Wednesday, said in addition to working on an ACA replacement, he will target pharmaceutical companies over drug prices and demand that they negotiate directly with Medicaid and Medicare. Jabin Botsford/Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law with the goal of “insurance for everybody,” while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices in Medicare and Medicaid. Trump declined to reveal specifics in the telephone interview late Saturday with The Washington Post, but any proposals from the incoming president would almost certainly dominate the Republican effort to overhaul federal health policy as he prepares to work with his party’s congressional majorities. Trump’s plan is likely to face questions from the right, following years of Republican opposition to further expansion of government involvement in the health-care system, and from those on the left, who see his ideas as disruptive to changes brought by the Affordable Care Act that have extended coverage to tens of millions of Americans. In addition to his replacement plan for the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Trump said he will target pharmaceutical companies over drug prices and demand that they negotiate directly with Medicaid and Medicare. “They’re politically protected but not anymore,” he said of pharmaceutical companies. The objectives of broadening access to insurance and lowering health-care costs have always been in conflict, and it remains unclear how the plan that the incoming administration is designing – or ones that will emerge on Capitol Hill – will address that tension. In general, congressional Republican plans to replace Obamacare have tended to try to constrain costs by reducing government requirements, such as the medical services that must be provided under health plans sold through the law’s marketplaces and through state’s Medicaid programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and other Republicans have been talking lately about providing “universal access” to health insurance, instead of universal insurance coverage. Trump said he expects Republicans in Congress to move quickly and in unison in the coming weeks on other priorities as well, including enacting sweeping tax cuts and beginning the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump warned Republicans that if the party splinters or slows his agenda, he is ready to use the power of the presidency – and Twitter – to usher his legislation to passage. “The Congress can’t get cold feet because the people will not let that happen,” Trump said during the interview with The Post. Trump said his plan for replacing most aspects of Obama’s health-care law is all but finished. Although he was coy about its details – “lower numbers, much lower deductibles” – he said he is ready to unveil it alongside Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven’t put it in quite yet but we’re going to be doing it soon,” Trump said. He noted that he is waiting for his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to be confirmed. That confirmation rests with the Senate Finance Committee, which has not yet scheduled a hearing. Trump’s declaration that his replacement plan is ready comes after many Republicans – moderates and conservatives – expressed anxiety last week about the party’s lack of a formal proposal as they held votes on repealing the law. Once made public, Trump said he is confident his plan could get enough votes to pass in both chambers but he declined to discuss how he would court wary Democrats. So far, Republicans have used budget reconciliation – where only a majority is needed – on the initial steps to repeal the health law. Removing or replacing other parts of the law will likely require 60 votes to overcome Democratic filibusters. Republicans control the Senate 52 to 48. “I think we will get approval. I won’t tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what’s happened in the House in recent weeks,” Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed. As he has developed a replacement package, Trump said he has paid attention to critics who say that repealing Obamacare would put coverage at risk for more than 20 million Americans covered under the law’s insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion. “We’re going to have insurance for everybody,” Trump said. “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.” People covered under the law “can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.” For conservative Republicans dubious about his pledge to ensure coverage for millions, Trump pointed to several interviews he did during the campaign where he promised to “not have people dying on the street.” “It’s not going to be their plan,” he said of people covered under the current law. “It’ll be another plan. But they’ll be beautifully covered. I don’t want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people,” he said Saturday. Trump did not say how his program overlaps with the comprehensive plan authored by House Republicans. Earlier this year, Price suggested that a Trump presidency would advance the House Republicans’ health-care agenda. When asked in the interview whether he intends to cut benefits for Medicare as part of his plan, Trump said “no,” a position that was reiterated Sunday on ABC by Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff. He did not elaborate on that view or how it would affect his proposal. He expressed that view throughout the campaign. Timing could be difficult as Trump puts an emphasis on speed. Obama’s law took more than 14 months of debate and hundreds of hearings. To urge the Congress on, Trump will attend a congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia later this month. Moving ahead, Trump said lowering drug prices is central to lowering health costs nationally – and will make it a priority for him as he uses his bully pulpit to shape policy. When asked how exactly he would force drug manufacturers to comply, Trump said part of his approach would be public pressure “just like on the airplane,” a nod to his tweets about Boeing’s F-35 fighter jet, which Trump said was too costly. Trump waved away the suggestion that such activity could lead to market volatility. “Stock drops and America goes up,” he said. “I don’t care. I want to do it right or not at all.”He added that drug companies “should produce” more products in the United States. On his plan for new tax cuts, Trump said “We’re getting very close” to putting together legislation. His advisers and Ryan met last week and have been working from his campaign’s plan and from congressional proposals to slash current rates. “It’ll probably be 15 to 20 percent for corporations. For individuals, probably lower. Great middle-class tax cuts,” Trump said. On corporate tax rates, “We may negotiate a little, but we want to bring them down and get as close to 15 percent as we can so we can see a mushrooming of jobs moving back.” Trump said he would not relent on his push for increasing taxes on U.S. companies that manufacture abroad – and insisted that the upcoming tax cuts should be enough reason for companies to produce within the United States. “If companies think they’re going to make their cars or other products overseas and sell them back into the United States, they’re going to pay a 35 percent tax,” he said. Briefly touching on immigration, Trump said that building a border wall and curbing illegal immigration remains at the top of his to-do list and he is spending significant time looking at ways to begin various projects, both with Congress and through executive action. But he did not disclose what was to come on those fronts. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Serena motivated to win more grand slam titles The Edit: Five new digital publishing apps Mexico criticises Israel over Netanyahu’s wall tweet Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article Rescue teams are seen at the crash site of a Turkish cargo jet near Kyrgyzstan's Manas airport outside Bishkek, January 16, 2017. ― Reuters picDACHA SUU, Jan 16 ― A cargo plane attempting to land in thick fog crashed today into a village near Kyrgyzstan’s main airport and killed at least 37 people, with authorities blaming “pilot error”.  A massive section of the aircraft’s tail billowed smoke as rescuers searched for victims among the wreckage in the village of Dacha-Suu, home to the majority of the dead. “According to preliminary information, the plane crashed due to a pilot error,” deputy prime minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev said at a briefing broadcast on state television. A minimum of 37 people, including the plane’s four pilots, were killed in the crash and the toll may rise, said a spokesman for the country’s emergency services, Muhammed Svarov.  The plane was attempting a landing at the Manas airport in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek in thick fog.   Crushed cars, shattered homes and huge chunks of burnt debris littered the village, which was hit by the plane at around 7:30 am (0130 GMT), as many residents were still at home in bed. “Our grandson said something was burning,” Tajikan, a Dacha Suu resident who identified herself only by her first name, told AFP.  “We heard a roar and (what felt) like an earthquake. Many people were sleeping, everything around was burning. One of the parts of the aircraft fell on our neighbour’s house. She and her whole family died,” the pensioner said.  Zumriyat Rezakhanova, another resident of Dacha-Suu, said the plane fell “right on the homes” where residents were sleeping.  “My sister’s home is badly damaged. Luckily she and her family survived,” Rezakhanova told AFP.  ‘Deeply saddened’ The flight was travelling from Hong Kong to Istanbul via Kyrgyzstan’s capital Bishkek. One of the plane’s black boxes was recovered from the crash site, the government said a statement without specifying how long it would take to decipher it. International aviation experts and representatives of the company who flew the plane, ACT Airlines, will arrive at the crash site tomorrow, Abulgaziev said at a late briefing, adding that search operation will resume in the morning in areas where the largest pieces of the plane fell. ACT Airlines, a Turkish cargo airline, said in a statement that its Boeing 747-400 was involved in the crash.  ACT Airlines said it was “deeply saddened” by the crash and noted that “the cause of the accident is unknown.” Boeing, the plane’s manufacturer, meanwhile extended its “deepest condolences” over the crash and offered to assist Kyrgyz authorities with the investigation.  Elmira Sheripova, a spokeswoman for the emergency services ministry, told AFP that 17 houses had been “completely destroyed” by the crashing plane.

L.A. Now Are you an immigrant? We want to hear your story BUSINESS When Trump tweets, Wall Street trades — instantly Toyota Luke Sharrett / Bloomberg A worker welds components on the assembly line at a Toyota factory in Indiana. A worker welds components on the assembly line at a Toyota factory in Indiana. (Luke Sharrett / Bloomberg) James F. PeltzContact Reporter The jaw-dropping speed at which certain stocks have moved in response to Donald Trump’s tweets about corporate America makes it seem as if Wall Street already was waiting for the president-elect’s words. It was. Some sophisticated traders with automated programs are using computer algorithms that instantly capture Trump’s Twitter remarks and then immediately buy or sell the affected stocks, analysts said. “It’s in the algorithms. They’ve done it,” said Joe Gits, chief executive of Social Market Analytics Inc. Gits’ firm isn’t among those traders, he said. Instead, the company culls the 500 million tweets issued daily on Twitter to find comments from influential people such as Trump that could affect stocks and then immediately relays that “sentiment” data to traders. Wall Street is tight-lipped about which firms use the automatic trading programs in their bid to profit from Trump’s tweets, and it’s unclear how much of the stocks’ trading volume reflects the automated trades. Representatives from venerable investment firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley Co. and Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch all declined comment. So did Citadel Securities, a well-known automated trading firm that also operates a hedge fund. Gits likewise said he was not at liberty to disclose the names of traders using such automated programs.

For the second time in a few weeks, an aerospace giant emerged from a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump with news that the cost of a big-ticket program could be cut.

(Samantha Masunaga and Aaron Gregg) The secrecy isn’t surprising because firms employing the programs, which try to profit from even modest point spreads on high-volume trades, don’t want to reveal their advantage, said Josh Brown, chief executive of Ritholtz Wealth Management who also runs the Reformed Broker website. “Nobody would share this publicly,” Brown said. “Who would say, ‘Yeah, this is how we’re doing this, and it’s working great?’ But it’s obvious that’s not human traders.” For average investors, the instant post-Trump market moves can largely be ignored, analysts said. That’s because the stocks that have quickly dropped in response to Trump soon bounce back, a trend that’s likely to continue, they said. “If you’re a day trader, you want to know about it, but if you’re the average 401(k) investor, it doesn’t make any difference in the long run,” Gits said. Nonetheless, there’s surging interest even among investors who don’t rapidly trade stocks to be immediately notified when a new Trump tweet appears. At Bloomberg — a major provider of market data and news, with about 325,000 of its computer terminals used by traders and others worldwide — Trump tweet notifications are “one of the fastest-growing alerts for a news product that we have ever launched,” Ted Merz, Bloomberg’s global head of news product, said in a statement. There also are new phone apps from firms such as Trigger Finance Inc. and IFTTT Inc. that quickly alert users if Trump tweets about any companies in which they own stock. Trump, who will be sworn into office Friday, is a prolific Twitter user who in recent weeks has taken to the social media platform to criticize corporate giants such as defense firms Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. and automakers Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. Trump attacked the defense firms for the high costs of certain aerospace programs, and he railed against the car companies for building cars in Mexico that are sold in the U.S. In each case, the companies’ stocks dropped immediately after Trump’s comments appeared on his Twitter feed. “The almost instantaneous movement in stock prices following some Trump tweets, most notably for Toyota, suggest to us that traders are using algorithms that execute trades immediately,” Merz said. Trump jumped on Toyota on Jan. 5, tweeting his displeasure that the company plans to build Corolla cars for U.S. sale at a new plant in Mexico. “NO WAY!” he said. “Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.” Trump says he'll turn over his company to his sons, but ethics questions persist Jim Puzzanghera, Joseph Tanfani President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he won’t be selling his company, virtually ensuring that his administration will continue to face questions about potential conflicts between his public duties and private interests.

(Jim Puzzanghera, Joseph Tanfani) Toyota’s U.S.-traded shares quickly fell nearly 1%, wiping $2 billion from Toyota’s total market value, then soon recovered some of those losses. The software and algorithms that enable Wall Street’s high-speed traders to respond automatically to Trump’s outbursts weren’t developed specifically in the aftermath of Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8, analysts said. “It’s been around for a time predating Trump,” Brown said. He pointed to how past tweets by Clinton, billionaire investor Carl Icahn and Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk, among others, have sparked immediate moves in stocks of companies they mentioned. Clinton, for instance, sent biotech stocks tumbling in September 2015 after she tweeted about wanting to lower “outrageous” prices in the specialty drug market. Trump’s market moves are “getting press now because of our next president’s propensity to tweet” and Trump’s upcoming ability to actually change the business climate, Gits said. “But it really started a couple of years ago.” There are several ways traders could profit from Trump’s tweets. They simply could buy or sell the individual stocks involved, or they could simultaneously do both on different exchanges as an arbitrage play, whereby they profit from small discrepancies in the stock’s price. They also could simultaneously buy the stock and short it — that is, sell the stock in hopes it drops and then buy it back later at a lower price — as a hedge maneuver. There’s another contrarian tactic: If a stock suddenly falls in response to Trump’s comments, traders can buy the shares with the expectation they’ll soon rebound, said Zachary David, a senior analyst and automated-trading expert at the markets consultant KOR Group. “It’s a strategy a lot of traders employ, to trade on overreactions,” David said. So how do Trump’s tweets and Wall Street’s immediate response affect investors who don’t watch the market every hour? CNBC markets analyst Jim Cramer said on his TheStreet.com website that “if you decide to make a strategy on [Trump’s] tweets, you better make it a buy strategy — because [Trump’s criticism] clearly hasn’t had any lasting effect” on stocks he mentions. Otherwise, Brown said, “the only way to beat a high-frequency trader is to be a low-frequency trader. The longer your time horizon, and the more you own stocks for fundamental reasons, the less short-term price fluctuations matter to you.” He noted billionaire Warren Buffett, who’s famous for holding solid investments for years. “Can you imagine Warren Buffett trading on someone else’s tweet?” Brown said. “It would never occur to him.” Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Have the women’s marches started a movement? In the presidential election, just seven of L.A.’s 1,700 precincts went for Trump. In a fiery State of the State, Brown returned to a familiar conclusion. Prosecutors believed two officers feared for their lives when they fatally shot Ezell Ford in 2014. 'La La Land' danced its way to 14 Oscar nominations. Mary Tyler Moore was a beloved TV icon who symbolized the independent career woman. Chinese New Year begins this weekend.

Alexei Druzhinin/Sputnik Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev arrive for a Security Council meeting in the Kremlin on Friday in Moscow. By Robert Costa / The Washington Post President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview published Sunday that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Barack Obama’s signature health care law with the goal of “insurance for everybody,” while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices in Medicare and Medicaid. In comments that were published the same day that Mr. Trump’s administration-in-waiting came out swinging against criticism from all corners, the president-elect declined to reveal specifics in the telephone interview late Saturday with The Washington Post, but any proposals from the incoming president are expected to almost certainly dominate the Republican effort to overhaul federal health policy as he prepares to work with his party’s congressional majorities. Mr. Trump’s plan is expected to face questions from the right, following years of GOP opposition to further expansion of government involvement in the health care system, and from those on the left, who see his ideas as disruptive to changes brought by the Affordable Care Act that have extended coverage to tens of millions of Americans. In addition to his replacement plan for the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Mr. Trump said he will target pharmaceutical companies over drug prices and demand that they negotiate directly with Medicaid and Medicare. “They’re politically protected but not anymore,” he said of pharmaceutical companies. The objectives of broadening access to insurance and lowering health care costs have always been in conflict, and it remains unclear how the plan that the incoming administration is designing — or ones that will emerge on Capitol Hill — will address that tension. In general, congressional GOP plans to replace Obamacare have tended to try to constrain costs by reducing government requirements, such as the medical services that must be provided under health plans sold through the law’s marketplaces and through state’s Medicaid programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and other Republicans have been talking lately about providing “universal access” to health insurance, instead of universal insurance coverage. Mr. Trump said he expects Republicans in Congress to move quickly and in unison in the coming weeks on other priorities as well, including enacting sweeping tax cuts and beginning the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Mr. Trump warned Republicans that if the party splinters or slows his agenda, he is ready to use the power of the presidency — and Twitter — to usher his legislation to passage. “The Congress can’t get cold feet because the people will not let that happen,” Mr. Trump said during the interview with the Post. Mr. Trump said his plan for replacing most aspects of Mr. Obama’s health care law is all but finished. Although he was coy about its details — “lower numbers, much lower deductibles” — he said he is ready to unveil it alongside Mr. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven’t put it in quite yet but we’re going to be doing it soon,” Mr. Trump said. He noted that he is waiting for his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to be confirmed. That confirmation rests with the Senate Finance Committee, which has not yet scheduled a hearing. Mr. Trump’s declaration that his replacement plan is ready comes after many Republicans — moderates and conservatives — expressed anxiety last week about the party’s lack of a formal proposal as they held votes on repealing the law. A full repeal without an immediate replacement would strip health care insurance from millions of Americans. Once made public, Mr. Trump said he is confident his plan could get enough votes to pass in both chambers but he declined to discuss how he would court wary Democrats. So far, Republicans have used budget reconciliation — where only a majority is needed — on the initial steps to repeal the health law. Removing or replacing other parts of the law will likely require 60 votes to overcome Democratic filibusters. Republicans control the Senate 52 to 48. The plan that Mr. Trump is preparing will come after the House has taken more than 60 votes in recent years to kill all or parts of the ACA to kill to adopt more conservative health-care policies, which tend to rely more heavily on the private sector. Republican leaders have said that they will not strand people who have gained insurance under the ACA without coverage. But it remains unclear from either Mr. Trump’s comments in the interview or recent remarks by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill how exactly they intend to accomplish that. “I think we will get approval. I won’t tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what’s happened in the House in recent weeks,” Mr. Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed. As he has developed a replacement package, Mr. Trump said he has paid attention to critics who say that repealing Obamacare would put coverage at risk for more than 20 million Americans covered under the law’s insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion. “We’re going to have insurance for everybody,” Mr. Trump said. “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.” People covered under the law “can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.” For conservative Republicans dubious about his pledge to ensure coverage for millions, Mr. Trump pointed to several interviews he did during the campaign where he promised to “not have people dying on the street.” “It’s not going to be their plan,” he said of people covered under the current law. “It’ll be another plan. But they’ll be beautifully covered. I don’t want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people,” he said Saturday. Mr. Trump did not say how his program overlaps with the comprehensive plan authored by House Republicans. Earlier this year, Mr. Price suggested that a Trump presidency would advance the House GOP’s health care agenda. When asked in the interview whether he intends to cut benefits for Medicare as part of his plan, Mr. Trump said “no,” a position that was reiterated Sunday on ABC by Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s incoming chief of staff. He did not elaborate on that view or how it would affect his proposal. He expressed that view throughout the campaign. Timing could be difficult as Mr. Trump puts an emphasis on speed. Mr. Obama’s law took more than 14 months of debate and hundreds of hearings. To urge the Congress on, Mr. Trump will attend a congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia later this month. Moving ahead, Mr. Trump said lowering drug prices is central to lowering health costs nationally — and will make it a priority for him as he uses his bully pulpit to shape policy. When asked how exactly he would force drug manufacturers to comply, Mr. Trump said part of his approach would be public pressure “just like on the airplane,” a nod to his tweets about Boeing’s F-35 fighter jet, which Mr. Trump said was too costly. Mr. Trump waved away the suggestion that such activity could lead to market volatility. “Stock drops and America goes up,” he said. “I don’t care. I want to do it right or not at all."He added that drug companies “should produce” more products in the United States. The question of whether the government should start negotiating how much it pays drug-makers for older Americans on Medicare has long been a partisan dispute, ever since the 2003 law that created Medicare drug benefits prohibited such negotiations. Mr. Trump’s goal, however, with respect to Medicaid, the insurance for low-income Americans run jointly by the federal government and states is uncertain. Under what is known as a Medicaid “best price” rule, pharmaceutical companies already are required to sell drugs to Medicaid as the lowest price they negotiate with any other buyer. On his plan for new tax cuts, Mr. Trump said “We’re getting very close” to putting together legislation. His advisers and Mr. Ryan met last week and have been working from his campaign’s plan and from congressional proposals to slash current rates. “It’ll probably be 15 to 20 percent for corporations. For individuals, probably lower. Great middle-class tax cuts,” Mr. Trump said. On corporate tax rates, “We may negotiate a little, but we want to bring them down and get as close to 15 percent as we can so we can see a mushrooming of jobs moving back.” Mr. Trump said he would not relent on his push for increasing taxes on U.S. companies that manufacture abroad — and insisted that the upcoming tax cuts should be enough reason for companies to produce within the United States. “If companies think they’re going to make their cars or other products overseas and sell them back into the United States, they’re going to pay a 35 percent tax,” he said. Briefly touching on immigration, Mr. Trump said that building a border wall and curbing illegal immigration remains at the top of his to-do list and he is spending significant time looking at ways to begin various projects, both with Congress and through executive action. But he did not disclose what was to come on those fronts. As Mr. Trump’s Post interview was published, the president-elect was feeling new pressure. Barack Obama used his final national television interview as president — shown Sunday on CBS’s “60 Minutes” — to express doubts that Mr. Trump will be able to effectively govern by firing off tweets. “We are moving into an era where a lot of people get their information through tweets and sound bites and some headline that comes over their phone. And I think that there’s a power in that,” Mr. Obama said. “There’s also a danger, what generates a headline or stirs up a controversy and gets attention isn’t the same as the process required to actually solve the problem.” Also on Sunday, the outgoing CIA director, John Brennan, charged that Mr. Trump lacks a full understanding of the threat Moscow poses to the United States, delivering a public lecture on national television to the president-elect that further highlighted the bitter state of Mr. Trump’s relations with American intelligence agencies. “Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests,” Mr. Brennan declared. Mr. Trump, who has unleashed a series of aggressive tweets against the U.S. intelligence community and his political rivals in recent weeks, responded aggressively on Twitter several hours later. “Was this the leaker of Fake News?” Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday evening, referring to a recent document that contains unverified financial and personal information that could be damaging to the president-elect. The Associated Press has not been able to verify the contents of the document. The combative stance comes five days before Mr. Trump will take the oath of office and address a bitterly divided nation. “For many years our country has been divided, angry and untrusting. Many say it will never change, the hatred is too deep. IT WILL CHANGE!!!!” Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon. Taking its cue from Mr. Trump, his administration-in-waiting came out swinging this weekend against criticism from all corners. His aides went on the attack against the Democratic Party and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the civil rights icon who questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Trump’s claim to the White House. And a top aide issued a pointed warning to Walter Shaub, the head of the Office of Government Ethics, to “be careful” after he publicly called for Mr. Trump to make a cleaner break with his business interests. Furthermore, Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, piqued the news media’s interest by acknowledging that there had been discussion about moving press briefings out of the White House to accommodate larger crowds. Mr. Priebus also called on Mr. Obama to tell fellow Democrats to stop questioning Mr. Trump’s legitimacy — and rejected comparisons to Mr. Trump’s own well-publicized doubts about Mr. Obama’s eligibility to serve. Also, Vice President-elect Mike Pence denied that the Trump campaign had any contacts with Russia during the campaign. In the meantime, two senior aides to Mr. Trump denied a report in The Sunday Times of London that his advisers had told U.K. officials the incoming president’s first foreign trip will be a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Reykjavik. Meanwhile, with just a week to go, details of Mr. Trump’s inauguration are finally starting to fall into place: The Presidential Inaugural Committee says that it has raised a record $90 million, it expects more than 30,000 people to attend the three official inaugural balls, and it has landed country star Toby Keith and ’90s rock band 3 Doors Down to headline the pre-inaugural concert on the Mall. At the same time, a member of the Trump transition team recently announced that Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. attorney in Baltimore and currently the longest-serving U.S. attorney, is the incoming Trump administration’s pick to become the next deputy attorney general — the second-highest position in the Justice Department.

File photo by Pablo Martinez Monsivais The Associated Press i By Robert Costa The Washington Post LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story President-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law with the goal of “insurance for everybody,” while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices in Medicare and Medicaid. Trump declined to reveal specifics in the telephone interview late Saturday with The Washington Post, but any proposals from the incoming president would almost certainly dominate the Republican effort to overhaul federal health policy as he prepares to work with his party’s congressional majorities. Trump’s plan is likely to face questions from the right, following years of GOP opposition to further expansion of government involvement in the health-care system, and from those on the left, who see his ideas as disruptive to changes brought by the Affordable Care Act that have extended coverage to tens of millions of Americans. In addition to his replacement plan for the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Trump said he will target pharmaceutical companies over drug prices and demand that they negotiate directly with Medicaid and Medicare. “They’re politically protected but not anymore,” he said of pharmaceutical companies. The objectives of broadening access to insurance and lowering health-care costs have always been in conflict, and it remains unclear how the plan that the incoming administration is designing — or ones that will emerge on Capitol Hill — will address that tension. In general, congressional GOP plans to replace Obamacare have tended to try to constrain costs by reducing government requirements, such as the medical services that must be provided under health plans sold through the law’s marketplaces and through state’s Medicaid programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and other Republicans have been talking lately about providing “universal access“ to health insurance, instead of universal insurance coverage. Trump said he expects Republicans in Congress to move quickly and in unison in the coming weeks on other priorities as well, including enacting sweeping tax cuts and beginning the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump warned Republicans that if the party splinters or slows his agenda, he is ready to use the power of the presidency — and Twitter — to usher his legislation to passage. “The Congress can’t get cold feet because the people will not let that happen,” Trump said during the interview with The Post. Trump said his plan for replacing most aspects of Obama’s health-care law is all but finished. Although he was coy about its details — “lower numbers, much lower deductibles“ — he said he is ready to unveil it alongside Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. “It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven’t put it in quite yet but we’re going to be doing it soon,” Trump said. He noted that he is waiting for his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, to be confirmed. That confirmation rests with the Senate Finance Committee, which has not yet scheduled a hearing. Trump’s declaration that his replacement plan is ready comes after many Republicans — moderates and conservatives — expressed anxiety last week about the party’s lack of a formal proposal as they held votes on repealing the law. Once made public, Trump said he is confident his plan could get enough votes to pass in both chambers but he declined to discuss how he would court wary Democrats. So far, Republicans have used budget reconciliation — where only a majority is needed — on the initial steps to repeal the health law. Removing or replacing other parts of the law will likely require 60 votes to overcome Democratic filibusters. Republicans control the Senate 52 to 48. “I think we will get approval. I won’t tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what’s happened in the House in recent weeks,” Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed. As he has developed a replacement package, Trump said he has paid attention to critics who say that repealing Obamacare would put coverage at risk for more than 20 million Americans covered under the law’s insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion. “We’re going to have insurance for everybody,” Trump said. “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.” People covered under the law “can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.” For conservative Republicans dubious about his pledge to ensure coverage for millions, Trump pointed to several interviews he did during the campaign where he promised to “not have people dying on the street.” “It’s not going to be their plan,” he said of people covered under the current law. “It’ll be another plan. But they’ll be beautifully covered. I don’t want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people,” he said Saturday. Trump did not say how his program overlaps with the comprehensive plan authored by House Republicans. Earlier this year, Price suggested that a Trump presidency would advance the House GOP’s health-care agenda. When asked in the interview whether he intends to cut benefits for Medicare as part of his plan, Trump said “no,” a position that was reiterated Sunday on ABC by Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff. He did not elaborate on that view or how it would affect his proposal. He expressed that view throughout the campaign. Timing could be difficult as Trump puts an emphasis on speed. Obama’s law took more than 14 months of debate and hundreds of hearings. To urge the Congress on, Trump will attend a congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia later this month. Moving ahead, Trump said lowering drug prices is central to lowering health costs nationally — and will make it a priority for him as he uses his bully pulpit to shape policy. When asked how exactly he would force drug manufacturers to comply, Trump said part of his approach would be public pressure “just like on the airplane,” a nod to his tweets about Boeing’s F-35 fighter jet, which Trump said was too costly. Trump waved away the suggestion that such activity could lead to market volatility. “Stock drops and America goes up,” he said. “I don’t care. I want to do it right or not at all.”He added that drug companies “should produce“ more products in the United States. On his plan for new tax cuts, Trump said “We’re getting very close“ to putting together legislation. His advisers and Ryan met last week and have been working from his campaign’s plan and from congressional proposals to slash current rates. “It’ll probably be 15 to 20 percent for corporations. For individuals, probably lower. Great middle-class tax cuts,” Trump said. On corporate tax rates, “We may negotiate a little, but we want to bring them down and get as close to 15 percent as we can so we can see a mushrooming of jobs moving back.” Trump said he would not relent on his push for increasing taxes on U.S. companies that manufacture abroad — and insisted that the upcoming tax cuts should be enough reason for companies to produce within the United States. “If companies think they’re going to make their cars or other products overseas and sell them back into the United States, they’re going to pay a 35 percent tax,” he said. Briefly touching on immigration, Trump said that building a border wall and curbing illegal immigration remains at the top of his to-do list and he is spending significant time looking at ways to begin various projects, both with Congress and through executive action. But he did not disclose what was to come on those fronts.

The question of whether the government should start negotiating how much it pays drug-makers for older Americans on Medicare has long been a partisan dispute, ever since the 2003 law that created Medicare drug benefits prohibited such negotiations. Trump’s goal, however, with respect to Medicaid, the insurance for low-income Americans run jointly by the federal government and states is uncertain. Under what is known as a Medicaid ‘‘best price’’ rule, pharmaceutical companies already are required to sell drugs to Medicaid as the lowest price they negotiate with any other buyer.

Adml Sir Philip Jones said the Navy was dealing with the highest level of activity from Vladimir Putin’s fleet since the end of the Cold War, even as it has to make “difficult” cuts to equipment. The message from the head of the Royal Navy comes as British warships are again being readied to escort the Russian carrier Admiral Kuznetsov past the UK as it returns from its bombing campaign against Syrian rebels. The Admiral Kuznetsov is due to be escorted past the UK again in the coming weeks as it returns from the Mediterranean Credit: Dover Marina/Handout But naval sources said high-profile deployments by Russia’s surface fleet were of far less concern than a sharp increase in Russian submarine missions in waters north of Scotland. British frigates and submarines, backed by Nato allies, are waging an increasingly intense cat-and-mouse game trying to find and track the Russian vessels. Watch | Russia's military arsenal - in 90 seconds 01:39 Russia analysts fear the jump in submarine activity to levels not seen since the 1980s is accompanied by increased efforts to spy on Britain’s nuclear deterrent vessels, based at Faslane. In a New Year message to the Navy, Sir Philip said: “In northern Europe and the Baltic, we are responding to the highest level of Russian naval activity since the end of the Cold War.” Vladimir Putin has poured money into the Russian military and radically modernised his fleet Credit:  Planet Pix/REX/Shutterstock His comments follow a warning last year by the commander of the US Navy’s European fleet that Nato was on the verge of a new “battle of the Atlantic” with increasingly sophisticated Russian submarines. Dr Andrew Foxall, director of the Russia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society, said waters separating Greenland, Iceland and the UK which had once been a key Cold War battleground were again the centre of a secret confrontation. The so-called GIUK gap represents the gateway for Russian vessels entering the Atlantic and during the Cold War was one of the most watched stretches of water in the world. Watch | US Navy releases new video of Russian fighters 'buzzing' destroyer 01:03 He said: “I don’t think it’s the increase in absolute number [of missions] that’s the increase of concern, it’s the information that these Russian submarines are trying to collect.” “Russia has been ramping up its presence in the North Atlantic at the same time that other countries have been winding theirs down.” He said the UK decision to scrap the troubled Nimrod maritime surveillance aircraft in 2010 and the delay in getting the Boeing P8 replacement had “left the country vulnerable to the sort of activity that Russian submarines conduct”. In northern Europe and the Baltic, we are responding to the highest level of Russian naval activity since the end of the Cold WarAdml Sir Philip Jones Sir Philip also admitted the Royal Navy is battling budget, manning and equipment woes after details of cuts and personnel shortfalls were revealed. The Navy is understood to be facing a £500 million budget black hole with commanders ordered to find more savings. Writing in Navy News, he said the power plants of the Type 45 destroyers, which are to have engine refits after a string of power failures, “have turned out to be less reliable than originally envisaged”. But he said the difficulties were “the challenges of a first rate Navy”. He said: “You don’t hear about the same issues in many other navies – and believe me, they exist – because they don’t operate with the same sophistication or expectation.” A Royal Navy frigate and destroyer are on standby to accompany the Kuznetsov when it passes back past the UK in the coming weeks. The ageing carrier is currently in the Mediterranean accompanied by a Russian battlecruiser, two destroyers and a tanker.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon WestJet Airlines Ltd. is thinking about adding yet another aircraft type to its fleet as it evaluates “more fuel-efficient” options for its international expansion plans. Since 2013, WestJet has grown its fleet from one type of aircraft — the Boeing 737 — to three, with the addition of 45 new Bombardier Q400s for its Encore regional airline and four used Boeing 767s for its first wide-body overseas flights. But the 767 is an “old plane,” the airline’s chief financial officer told an investor conference Thursday. “Is it the fleet type of the future? No,” Harry Taylor told the AltaCorp Capital and ATB Financial investor conference in Toronto. “We’d like to have a more fuel-efficient wide-body engine. We’re just conscious of the capital investment, so whether it’s new or newish is one of the things that we’ll consider.” Related ALPA takes first steps to unionize WestJet pilots but warns of ‘fear-mongering’ tactics by management The race is on to launch new ultra-low-cost airline after Canada grants foreign ownership exemptions Taylor described the 767s, which were plagued with early reliability issues, as a “test.” “We liked the results so it’s no longer a test and we’re going to expand,” he said. “But we’re going to take some time to do that. You don’t want to go too far or too fast.” The airline’s pilots voted in December to approve expanded wide-body operations after rejecting an earlier offer. Chief executive Gregg Saretsky said the vote would allow WestJet to turn its attention “to acquiring additional wide-body aircraft.” Currently, the 767s are used on flights to London’s Gatwick Airport from Toronto and Calgary and to Hawaii from Edmonton and Calgary, as well as some domestic routes. Taylor said the airline’s network planners are now looking at other possible destinations in both Europe and Asia. “We believe we’ve got some good business cases to go both east and west, and the question is when and how?” Taylor said. “We don’t want to establish too many different isolated beachheads and lose our economies of scale, so we’re going to work through where we see the most profitable, most attractive opportunities and pursue them.” BMO analyst Fadi Chamoun downgraded WestJet to market perform from outperform Thursday and lowered his price target to $24 from $26, arguing that the airline’s wide-body expansion will weigh on its balance sheet. “We believe that WestJet is likely to underwrite a major wide-body expansion initiative in the near term, which is likely to weigh on balance-sheet metrics and free cash flow and perhaps even raise the operational risk profile in the short term, albeit with attractive long-term growth potential assuming it is successful,” Chamoun wrote in a research note. WestJet has said it’s talking to both Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE about possible aircraft purchases. Bombardier Inc., meanwhile, said it has no plans at present to build a CS500, the rumoured stretch variant of its CSeries aircraft. “At this point in time there’s no plan for a larger CSeries, that is not part of the strategic conversation,” chief financial officer John Di Bert told the AltaCorp conference. “The conversation on a bigger platform would only evolve if the market demanded it, if the supply chain was willing to get behind it, and if the customers were willing to step forward on it.” Bombardier will make a decision on its next major project in the next 12 to 24 months, Di Bert said. That could include federal government investment if a deal is reached on the company’s 14-month-old request for US$1 billion in aid.

Brendan Cavanaugh into the chair of the horizontal impulse accelerator inside the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton in November 2005. Associated press file By The Associated Press Posted: 01/16/17, 12:00 PM EST | Updated: 1 week, 5 days ago # Comments WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE >> An agency at Ohio’s largest military base has handled $8.1 billion in foreign military sales in fiscal year 2016. The Dayton Daily News reports the amount is a drop of more than half from the prior year. Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation Directorate sales reached $19 billion in fiscal year 2015. Gen. Gregory Gutterman expects the Wright-Patterson-headquartered agency to see a “spike” in future sales with the roll out of items that include a new Boeing KC-46 Pegasus aerial refueling tanker. According to the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency, upcoming deals include a $21.1 billion expected agreement with Qatar to purchase 72 of Boeing’s F-15 Eagle strike fighter jets and a $1.9 billion deal with Japan to buy four aerial tankers.

Flynas chairman Ayed al-Jeaid said at the signing ceremony in Riyadh that the deal includes an option for 40 more of the short to medium-haul planes in what airline executives said is a growing domestic market. Bander al-Mohanna, the chief executive of NAS Holding, of which flynas is a division, signed the agreement with Fouad Attar, Middle East director for the European Aerospace company. Mohanna told a news conference following the ceremony that the deal was made for flynas "to play a leading role in the market". Delivery would begin next year and continue until at least 2026, flynas executives said. The 10-year-old airline exclusively operates the A320, leasing almost 30 of the aircraft, and its passenger numbers now exceed six million annually, executives said. The carrier focuses on the Arabian peninsula and the immediate vicinity. State-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, known as Saudia, is the dominant player and aims to expand its own fleet to 200 aircraft by 2020. Saudia flew more than 29 million passengers in 2015, and in June last year placed an USD 8-billion order with Airbus for 50 planes for domestic flights. Two new entrants, Nesma and SaudiGulf, have launched domestic flights but Jeaid told the ceremony: "We don't believe that such competition threatens us." He said flynas had chosen Airbus over the planes of one other company which he did not name. Under its wide-ranging Vision 2030 plan announced in April, Saudi Arabia aims to diversify its oil-dependent economy. Among the measures is development of the tourism sector, privatisation of state-owned services including airports, and a linking of transport networks to position Saudi Arabia as a regional logistics hub. The plan also calls for an increase in the number of Muslim visitors performing the umra minor pilgrimage. Even before it unveiled its economic reform plan, the Arab world's largest economy was spending billions of dollars on building and upgrading airports. Riyadh-based Kingdom Holding Co owns a 34 percent stake in flynas. Airbus said last week it had outstripped its own delivery expectations in 2016, closing the gap with Boeing and beating its US rival on orders. The European manufacturer said it delivered a record 688 commercial planes, exceeding its own target which was raised in November from 650 to 670.

The 10-year-old airline exclusively operates the A320, leasing almost 30 of the aircraft, and its passenger numbers now exceed six million annually, executives said. The carrier focuses on the Arabian peninsula and the immediate vicinity. State-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, known as Saudia, is the dominant player and aims to expand its own fleet to 200 aircraft by 2020. Saudia flew more than 29 million passengers in 2015, and in June last year placed an USD 8-billion order with Airbus for 50 planes for domestic flights. Two new entrants, Nesma and SaudiGulf, have launched domestic flights but Jeaid told the ceremony: "We don't believe that such competition threatens us." He said flynas had chosen Airbus over the planes of one other company which he did not name. Under its wide-ranging Vision 2030 plan announced in April, Saudi Arabia aims to diversify its oil-dependent economy. Among the measures is development of the tourism sector, privatisation of state-owned services including airports, and a linking of transport networks to position Saudi Arabia as a regional logistics hub. The plan also calls for an increase in the number of Muslim visitors performing the umra minor pilgrimage. Even before it unveiled its economic reform plan, the Arab world's largest economy was spending billions of dollars on building and upgrading airports. Riyadh-based Kingdom Holding Co owns a 34 percent stake in flynas. Airbus said last week it had outstripped its own delivery expectations in 2016, closing the gap with Boeing and beating its US rival on orders. The European manufacturer said it delivered a record 688 commercial planes, exceeding its own target which was raised in November from 650 to 670.

Flynas chairman Ayed al-Jeaid said at the signing ceremony in Riyadh that the deal includes an option for 40 more of the short to medium-haul planes in what airline executives said is a growing domestic market. Bander al-Mohanna, the chief executive of NAS Holding, of which flynas is a division, signed the agreement with Fouad Attar, Middle East director for the European Aerospace company.

Trump declined to reveal specifics in the telephone interview late Saturday with The Washington Post, but any proposals from the incoming president would almost certainly dominate the Republican effort to overhaul federal health policy as he prepares to work with his party’s congressional majorities. Trump’s plan is likely to face questions from the right, following years of GOP opposition to further expansion of government involvement in the health care system, and from those on the left, who see his ideas as disruptive to changes brought by the Affordable Care Act that have extended coverage to tens of millions of Americans. In addition to his replacement plan for the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Trump said he will target pharmaceutical companies over drug prices and demand that they negotiate directly with Medicaid and Medicare. “They’re politically protected but not anymore,” he said of pharmaceutical companies. The objectives of broadening access to insurance and lowering health care costs have always been in conflict, and it remains unclear how the plan that the incoming administration is designing — or ones that will emerge on Capitol Hill — will address that tension. In general, congressional GOP plans to replace Obamacare have tended to try to constrain costs by reducing government requirements, such as the medical services that must be provided under health plans sold through the law’s marketplaces and through state’s Medicaid programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and other Republicans have been talking lately about providing “universal access” to health insurance, instead of universal insurance coverage. Trump said he expects Republicans in Congress to move quickly and in unison in the coming weeks on other priorities as well, including enacting sweeping tax cuts and beginning the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump warned Republicans that if the party splinters or slows his agenda, he is ready to use the power of the presidency — and Twitter — to usher his legislation to passage. “The Congress can’t get cold feet because the people will not let that happen,” Trump said during the interview with The Post. Trump said his plan for replacing most aspects of Obama’s health care law is all but finished. Although he was coy about its details — “lower numbers, much lower deductibles” — he said he is ready to unveil it alongside Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “It’s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven’t put it in quite yet but we’re going to be doing it soon,” Trump said. He noted that he is waiting for his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to be confirmed. That confirmation rests with the Senate Finance Committee, which has not yet scheduled a hearing. Trump’s declaration that his replacement plan is ready comes after many Republicans — moderates and conservatives — expressed anxiety last week about the party’s lack of a formal proposal as they held votes on repealing the law. Once made public, Trump said he is confident his plan could get enough votes to pass in both chambers but he declined to discuss how he would court wary Democrats. So far, Republicans have used budget reconciliation — where only a majority is needed — on the initial steps to repeal the health law. Removing or replacing other parts of the law will likely require 60 votes to overcome Democratic filibusters. Republicans control the Senate 52 to 48. “I think we will get approval. I won’t tell you how, but we will get approval. You see what’s happened in the House in recent weeks,” Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed. As he has developed a replacement package, Trump said he has paid attention to critics who say that repealing Obamacare would put coverage at risk for more than 20 million Americans covered under the law’s insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion. “We’re going to have insurance for everybody,” Trump said. “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.” People covered under the law “can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.” For conservative Republicans dubious about his pledge to ensure coverage for millions, Trump pointed to several interviews he did during the campaign where he promised to “not have people dying on the street.” “It’s not going to be their plan,” he said of people covered under the current law. “It’ll be another plan. But they’ll be beautifully covered. I don’t want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people,” he said Saturday. Trump did not say how his program overlaps with the comprehensive plan authored by House Republicans. Earlier this year, Price suggested that a Trump presidency would advance the House GOP’s health care agenda. When asked in the interview whether he intends to cut benefits for Medicare as part of his plan, Trump said “no,” a position that was reiterated Sunday on ABC by Reince Priebus, Trump’s incoming chief of staff. He did not elaborate on that view or how it would affect his proposal. He expressed that view throughout the campaign. Timing could be difficult as Trump puts an emphasis on speed. Obama’s law took more than 14 months of debate and hundreds of hearings. To urge the Congress on, Trump will attend a congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia later this month. Moving ahead, Trump said lowering drug prices is central to lowering health costs nationally — and will make it a priority for him as he uses his bully pulpit to shape policy. When asked how exactly he would force drug manufacturers to comply, Trump said part of his approach would be public pressure “just like on the airplane,” a nod to his tweets about Boeing’s F-35 fighter jet, which Trump said was too costly. Trump waved away the suggestion that such activity could lead to market volatility. “Stock drops and America goes up,” he said. “I don’t care. I want to do it right or not at all.”He added that drug companies “should produce” more products in the United States. On his plan for new tax cuts, Trump said “We’re getting very close” to putting together legislation. His advisers and Ryan met last week and have been working from his campaign’s plan and from congressional proposals to slash current rates. “It’ll probably be 15 to 20 percent for corporations. For individuals, probably lower. Great middle-class tax cuts,” Trump said. On corporate tax rates, “We may negotiate a little, but we want to bring them down and get as close to 15 percent as we can so we can see a mushrooming of jobs moving back.” Trump said he would not relent on his push for increasing taxes on U.S. companies that manufacture abroad — and insisted that the upcoming tax cuts should be enough reason for companies to produce within the United States. “If companies think they’re going to make their cars or other products overseas and sell them back into the United States, they’re going to pay a 35 percent tax,” he said.
