By Rachel Middleton April 19, 2017 04:53 BST Close Malaysia Airlines MH370 search to be suspended Reuters Authorities undertaking the search for the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 have come under fire from relatives of the passengers on board the Boeing 777, after they refused to release material pertaining to the missing aircraft. The Australian newspaper, which tried to obtain information via a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, said that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's Chief Commissioner Greg Hood invoked the Transport Safety Investigation Act in rejecting the request. He said the act covers the FOI request for critical documents the ATSB claims support its "ghost flight" and "death dive" scenario, which officials claim resulted in the Boeing 777 going down in an unpiloted crash. The newspaper was trying to get access to the opinions of international experts, including those from the US and British air crash agencies, Boeing, aerospace group Thales and the British satellite group Inmarsat. The Australian claims that some ATSB officials are having "second thoughts" about the agency's official line that the pilots on board were either unconscious or dead at the end of the flight. In February, ATSB general manager for strategic capability, Colin McNamara threw out The Australian's FOI request, claiming the information could "cause damage to the international relations of the commonwealth." Following an internal review of McNamara's decision, Hood also refused to release the documents sought, saying: "The activities of the ATSB with respect in assisting the Malaysian investigation are covered by the TSI Act." He also warned that if a serving or former ATSB staff or consultant "discloses information to any person or to a court; and the information is restricted," they have breached the act. Any breach carries a two year jail sentence, The Australian reported. Malaysia says not hiding anything The fate of MH370 is one of aviation's biggest unsolved mysteriesReuters Meanwhile Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said that it was unfair to accuse the Malaysian and Australian governments of hiding information. He said that all next-of-kin of those on board the missing flight have been given access to the latest details on the investigation, which is published on a website and updated weekly. "Wait for a full investigation report to come out, then everyone will get to see it. We cannot give everybody these details," he said, reports FreeMalaysiaToday.com. He told the website that Malaysia was "very thankful to Australia and China, who have helped us all along." Malaysia's transport minister Liow Tiong Lai at a news conference about debris found on a beach in Mozambique.Reuters The final report on the investigation into the missing aircraft is expected to be released at the end of the year. He said that the seven-member International Civil Aviation Annexe 13 safety investigation team led by Kok Soo Chon, the former Malaysian Civil Aviation Department director-general, was working "around the clock to complete the investigation." The investigation team comprises aviation experts from the US, China, France, Australia as well as from Boeing and Inmarsat. MH370, with a total of 239 passengers and staff on board was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March, 2014 when it disappeared. Satellite tracking data appears to confirm that the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean, southwest of Australia, but a massive underwater search operation led by the ATSB and funded by Australia, China and Malaysia was called off in January 2017 after failing to locate the aircraft.

(Al Cannon Detention Center) VIEW PHOTO GALLERY3 photos AA NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) - Authorities have arrested a second man in connection with a fake bomb threat made against Boeing’s North Charleston plant last year. Charleston County Aviation Authority Police say Devon Maurice Wigfall called in a bomb threat on behalf of Jermaine Mustapher on Sept. 22, 2016. Both have been arrested and charged with making bomb threats. Mustapher was arrested Monday, April 17, in Berkeley County after a traffic stop showed he was wanted in connection to the Boeing threat. RELATED | Boeing facility evacuated after threat; no bomb found Wigfall was arrested Oct. 19, 2016. Investigators say Mustapher was a contracted plumber working on the Boeing site. Wigfall told investigators Mustapher asked him to call his supervisor and say there was an emergency and that Mustapher needed to leave early. Instead, authorities say Wigfall told them he decided to call in a bomb threat. Boeing’s two main construction buildings were evacuated while police searched the area. No bomb was found. Officials say Wigfall used a prepaid phone to call in the threat, and used the *67 feature to hide his number, thinking no one would be able to trace it back to him. Police say they were able to get all the information they needed from Verizon, however. Phone records show Wifgall and Mustapher spoke on the phone four times the day the bomb threat was made. Investigators say when they questioned Mustapher in October, he insisted Wigfall was only an acquaintance of his and did not have his phone number, so they could not have spoken, despite a detective presenting him a copy of phone records showing their conversations. Mustapher was laid off from his contracted position at Boeing Oct. 19, the same day Wigfall was arrested. Wigfall was released from jail in March. Mustapher remains in jail. close Trending 1   Weaverville Police investigating after an attempted child abduction 2   Texas mom accused of holding lighter to baby's hand, sending videos of abuse to dad 3   Steve Stephens, suspected of posting murder to Facebook, has killed himself 4   Asheville man charged with assault after trying to hit trooper 5   Facebook murder victim had ties to North Carolina DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLOS Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO News In Pictures Overturned tractor-trailer on Future I-26 causes morning congestion, delays Buncombe County authorities search for missing Fairview teen 7 charged, 3 on the run after authorities seize 20 pounds of meth and $500,000 4 arrested in recent string of Henderson County armed robberies ShareTweet × Trending 1 Weaverville Police investigating after an attempted child abduction 2 Texas mom accused of holding lighter to baby's hand, sending videos of abuse to dad 3 Steve Stephens, suspected of posting murder to Facebook, has killed himself 4 Asheville man charged with assault after trying to hit trooper 5 Facebook murder victim had ties to North Carolina 6 7 charged, 3 on the run after authorities seize 20 pounds of meth and $500,000 7 Overturned tractor-trailer on Future I-26 causes morning congestion, delays 8 Baked Pie Company opens in South Asheville 9 Ask 13: What is being built on Brevard Road across from Asheville Outlets? 10 Buncombe County authorities search for missing Fairview teen

Carney | Apr 18, 2017, 6:01 PM Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email this article Share on LinkedIn Selling Ex-Im as a nationalist entity is a bit odd. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) A good globalist can speak many languages. French is useful in Geneva. A phrase or two in German will pay off. Even a Marathi idiom can pay dividends in Mumbai. In Northwest D.C., earlier this month, the self-described "Davos Crowd," got a lesson in a new language: Trump-era nationalist populism. The venue was the chandelier-laden ballroom of the Omni Shoreham hotel in Woodley Park. The occasion was the annual conference of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the federal agency that subsidizes U.S. exports by extending taxpayer-backed financing to foreign buyers of U.S. goods. A crowd of global bankers, ranging from the National Bank of Egypt to Zurich Bank, and manufacturers from Boeing to Embraer came to grease the skids of global trade. Ever since the Tea Party got serious about battling corporate welfare in 2012, the Ex-Im annual conference has also been, in part, a lobbying pep rally to fight for the agency's continued existence. This year, the lobbying goal was bringing Ex-Im up to full speed by filling the vacancies on the board of directors (without a quorum, Ex-Im can't approve deals greater than $10 million). The first panel at this year's conference lamented and addressed growing populist tides. The panelists, including Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News honchos, didn't try to hide their tribal loyalties. "We, the Davos crowd, oversold globalization as an end itself," worried David Wessell, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Greg Ip of the Wall Street Journal tried to ease the crowd by assuring that the "globalist wing" of the White House is on the defensive but that it still could win (this was before Trump's reversals on NATO, China, Ex-Im, and Janet Yellen). How to save the globalization agenda was the theme of the panel, and the global crowd of globe-trotting bankers nodded with concern. After that panel, Ex-Im brought in two congressmen whose job it was to rehearse the populist, national pitch for Ex-Im. Congressmen Chris Collins, R-N.Y., (himself a recipient of Ex-Im subsidies) and Mike Kelly, R-Pa., took the stage to talk "America First," and the need to knock out China. "We've been on the losing end of one bad deal after another," Collins said of NAFTA and the rest of the globalization agenda. "Make America First Again. Make it great and put us first," Collins said. "Trump gets it. He's going to put America first," Collins said to this crowd from dozens of countries and every continent. "We need to really stand up to some of these countries that we have significant deficits with on trade." So Ex-Im, rather than being a subsidy for global bankers and globe trotters, is now being sold as an economic nationalist undertaking. The following Tuesday, April 11, Trump met with longtime Boeing CEO Jim McNerney. On Wednesday April 12, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he had changed his mind and now supported Ex-Im, which in the typical year extends about 40 percent of its financing to Boeing's customers. Ex-Im was needed, Trump said, to beat other countries, which subsidize their exports, after all. Selling Ex-Im as a nationalist entity is a bit odd, though. Siemens, a preeminent Germany company, won Ex-Im's deal of the year in 2015 for helping a Spanish company build two wind farms in Peru. Is this an example of "America First?" Ex-Im's biggest subsidies don't go to U.S. companies, but to foreign companies, and to Chinese companies above all. A majority of Ex-Im's China subsidies go to government-owned businesses, such as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China — the largest bank in the world — and Air China. Heck, twice in recent years, U.S. Ex-Im directly subsidized the Export-Import Bank of China. The world's export subsidizers aren't Ex-Im's competitors as Collins would say and as Trump seems to believe. They're all part of a global club. Katsuyoshi Goto, a representative of NEXI, one of Japan's export-subsidy agencies, met with me at a recent annual conference. "NEXI is more a collaborator with U.S. Ex-Im rather than competitor," he said. "The U.S. Ex-Im is more the partner of NEXI." But to win over Trump and U.S. congressmen, this global Kumbaya story doesn't help Ex-Im's cause. Instead, the agency's beneficiaries speak the nationalist language: Ex-Im is for America against China. The true us-vs-them fight here is different. The "us" who benefit from Ex-Im were the people in that ballroom: bankers, journalists, manufacturers, lawyers, lobbyists, politicians from around the world, whose common bond is access to power and capital. This tribe profits not from free trade, precisely, but from globalization, which sometimes means laissez-faire but often means subsidies and corporate welfare and powerful uber-governments like the European Union. The "them" is the people left out of this deal. The Brexiteers in England and many of the Trumpers here in the U.S. Ex-Im, like any government subsidy program, doesn't create wealth. It moves wealth around. Specifically, it moves wealth from non-exporting businesses to exporting businesses. The guy who wanted the loan to build a movie theater in Peoria can't get an Ex-Im guarantee, and so the loan goes to a Brazilian buyer of U.S. machinery. Manufacturers who sell domestically have to compete — for customers and inputs — with companies pocketing subsidies because they export. So within the U.S., there's no net gain from these subsidies. But again, that's not the relevant boundary. The net gain goes to the Davos crowd. China hurts its economy with export subsidies, but China's politically connected bankers and exporters benefit. Yet with envoys like Collins and McNerney, the Ex-Im crowd has found a way to sell subsidies to China's government as an "America First" idea. The globalist tribe is nothing if not flexible. These days, they've learned to speak even the language of Trump. Timothy P. Carney, The Washington Examiner's senior political columnist, can be contacted at tcarney@washingtonexaminer.com.

The Daily Herald reported Monday that a memo from the company’s vice president of engineering for Boeing Commercial Airplanes John Hamilton says the cuts are necessary to stay competitive. Hamilton also said in the memo that more cuts in engineering could come later this year. In just over the past year, Boeing Commercial Airplanes reduced its work force by more than 9,000, mainly through buyouts and retirements. At the end of March, the division employed nearly 74,200 people, down from over 83,000 at the end of 2015.

(Submitted photo) Print Email Lee Roop | lroop@al.com By Lee Roop | lroop@al.com The Huntsville Times Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 18, 2017 at 12:01 PM comments Boeing and its employees are giving $150,000 to cancer research and a patient transportation program in Alabama, the aerospace company announced today. The gift will support $100,000 in kidney cancer research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Comprehensive Cancer Center and Huntsville's HudsonAlpha Center for Biotechnology. It also provides $50,000 for a patient transportation program. The goal of the research is building on advances in biomarkers found in patient urine and blood samples. Scientists can already identify molecular changes driving cancer growth, which helps develop better drugs, and they are aiming for earlier detection to improve patient recovery. In 2014, HudsonAlpha scientists identified a panel of biomarkers that are strong predictors of kidney cancer. In 2016, UAB and HudsonAlpha identified gene changes associated with kidney cancer. The goal now is to refine these biomarkers into a non-invasive test for kidney cancer and better monitoring of cancer's return and its response to certain drugs. Hudson Alpha's Dr. Brittany Lasseigne will perform the first experiments to investigate these biomarkers in fluids such as blood and urine.  "HudsonAlpha, one of the top genetic sequencing centers in the nation, and UAB, a premier medical research institution, can together change the standard of care for cancer patients by diagnosing patients earlier and using the right treatment for the right person at the right time," said Dr. Rick Myers, HudsonAlpha faculty investigator, president and science director. "Boeing's support will be instrumental in making significant advances in cancer research by saving lives through earlier disease diagnosis and treatment options." The Boeing employee fund will also support a five-county patient transport program for up to 18 months. Dependable transportation is key to the treatment of cancer patients, especially elderly, rural and minority residents who can have problems reaching care centers. "The Employee Community Fund Board has supported the American Cancer Society for many years," fund board member Jeanetta Wilson said in a news release, "but when Boeing announced the 'Boeing Against Cancer' drive in February and encouraged employees to 'Discover Your Power,' we knew we had the power to do more." "We're just so thrilled that Boeing shares our vision for a world without cancer," said Karen Borden, the American Cancer Society's senior manager for community engagement. "Their shared value of innovation, their penchant for generosity, and their genuine interest for the health and well-being of their employees, families, and community members created this invaluable opportunity."

Americans for Affordable Products, a coalition of retailers and other importers created to fight the House GOP's proposed import tax, on Tuesday promoted research touting the subsidies received by the corporations in a rival coalition that favors the tax plan, including the credit that Ex-Im has facilitated for Boeing.

The group also detailed subsidies received by other companies in the pro-import tax coalition, including General Electric, Honeywell and Caterpillar. In a new web ad, Americans for Affordable Products accused Boeing and the others of receiving "corporate welfare" and argued that the import tax would be just one more break for companies that already are paying low effective tax rates. The invocation of Ex-Im is a new tactic in the unusually sharp industry-versus-industry battle over the import tax. In recent years, conservative congressional Republicans have pushed to end Ex-Im, which facilitates credit for U.S. companies selling products overseas. They have criticized Ex-Im financing, much of which goes to Boeing, as interference in the market. The House Republican tax plan would adjust taxes at the border so that only products sold in the U.S. are taxed and overseas sales are not. That change would be accomplished by allowing companies to write off all exports from their taxable income, while preventing them from deducting the cost of imported products. As a result, imports would effectively be taxed at the 20 percent tax rate the Republicans envision. For retailers such as Kohl's and Walmart, both members of Americans for Affordable Products, the prospect of a tax on imports is enough of a threat to wage a major public relations effort against the tax plan.

The downsizing is to come through a mix of “attrition, leaving open positions unfilled, a voluntary layoff program and in some cases, involuntary layoffs,” he added. The cuts are to take effect on June 23, and primarily affect production sites in Washington state, a person familiar with the situation said. Boeing is the biggest private employer in the state, with more than 70,000 workers. At the start of the year, Boeing eliminated 305 engineering jobs and cut 1,500 mechanics as part of a voluntary programs. Boeing plans additional job cuts later this year, a person close to the matter said. Boeing has 146,962 employees, down 7.6 percent from last year. UNITED STATES Treasury bill rates fall Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills fell slightly in Monday’s auction. The Department of the Treasury auctioned US$39 billion in three-month bills at a discount rate of 0.820 percent, down from 0.825 percent last week. Another US$33 billion in six-month bills was auctioned at a discount rate of 0.945 percent, down from 0.950 percent last week. The rates last week were the highest in more than eight years. The discount rates reflect that the bills sell for less than face value. For a US$10,000 bill, the three-month price was US$9,979.27, while a six-month bill sold for US$9,952.23. That would equal an annualized rate of 0.833 percent for the three-month bills and 0.963 percent for the six-month bills. Separately, the Federal Reserve on Monday said that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 1.03 percent on Thursday from 1.07 percent on Monday last week. CONSTRUCTION VolkerWessels seeks listing Dutch construction company VolkerWessels yesterday said it would seek an initial public offering (IPO) of shares and a stock market listing on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam. The company is owned by Reggeborgh Holding, which said it would sell a minority stake of a yet-to-be-determined size in the IPO. VolkerWessels had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of 254 million euros (US$270.5 million) last year and sales of 5.5 billion euros, it said. ENGINEERING Kleinfeld steps down Arconic Inc chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld, who oversaw the company’s split from former parent Alcoa, yesterday stepped down after the aluminum-parts maker’s board said he showed “poor judgment” in sending a letter to Elliott Management Corp amid a proxy fight. Kleinfeld’s resignation upends what had been shaping up as the biggest and most aggressive US proxy battle this year. Shares of the supplier for aircraft and automobiles surged the most in two months. Until Monday, Arconic’s board had stuck by Kleinfeld as Elliott, billionaire Paul Singer’s hedge fund, accused him of financial underperformance, an “obsession” with image and wasteful spending on a Manhattan, New York headquarters.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Boeing Is Laying Off Hundreds of Workers -- Here's Why Sales are in a slump, but margins should be the real worry. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 18, 2017 at 10:33AM Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock soared 2% higher on Monday, and for a most surprising reason: layoffs. On Monday, according to Reuters, Boeing Engineering VP John Hamilton circulated an email within the company stating that "hundreds of engineering employees" will be let go beginning June 23. This comes on top of some 1,800 Boeing workers who were offered and accepted voluntary buyout packages earlier this year, and 245 more workers laid off involuntarily in March. But even after reducing its workforce by more than 2,000 in the space of a few months, Boeing now sees the need to make additional cuts. Boeing's cruising for a PR bruising with its latest layoffs announcement -- so why are investors cheering? Image source: Getty Images. Who will go? Hamilton says this "second phase of involuntary layoffs" will affect engineering staff "in Washington state and other enterprise locations," but will not extend to workers in Boeing's 787 Dreamliner plant in South Carolina. (Although some employees at the Charleston plant have been offered, and have accepted, voluntary buyouts.) That doesn't necessarily mean that South Carolinian jobs are safe, though. In addition to the layoffs just announced, Hamilton mentioned the possibility of "additional reductions in engineering later this year" if business conditions necessitate them. Why must they go? What business conditions might he be referring to? There are at least three theories. Currently, Boeing is wrapping up development of its new 737 Max regional jet and its 787-10 supersized Dreamliner, and preparing to finalize development of the new 777X long-haul jet. That all means less need for engineers -- which is why engineers in particular are being targeted in this latest round of layoffs. The more important reason for layoffs, though, is not engineering-related, but economic. Simply put, sales of commercial jets are in a slump, and Boeing's not earning anywhere near the kind of profits that it's been accustomed to earning over the past few years. Sales slump Let's run down the numbers. In 2014, Boeing recorded 1,432 net orders for new commercial aircraft. A year later, that number had fallen by nearly half (to 768 in 2015). Fast-forward another year, and in 2016 orders declined a further 13% -- just 668 net new orders received. In investing circles, we call this a "trend" -- and the trend doesn't look good for Boeing. Profits slump, too Granted, Boeing still has a huge backlog of work to be done -- nearly 5,700 firm orders. In theory, this should mean that the sales slump wouldn't affect the company for years, and Boeing could keep rolling along, fulfilling old orders while waiting for new orders to return. In practice, though, things aren't working out that way. Profits are taking a hit, too. Data from S&P Global Market Intelligence from 2011 through 2015 show that Boeing averaged 9.7% operating profit margins at its Commercial Airplanes division, ranging from a high of 10.9% in 2013 to a low of 7.8% in 2015. In 2016, however, margins at the commercial unit plunged to just 4.8% -- less than half the average from the preceding five years. This happened because sales declined 2% in 2016, and profits declined even faster, falling 5% year over year. What it means for employees -- and investors Now Boeing is promising a big reversal in fortunes for 2017. In its guidance for this fiscal year, released in January, management forecast a continuing sales slide to about $91.5 billion for the year, with most of that decline hitting the Commercial Airplanes division. Despite the continuing sales slump, though, Boeing is promising to boost its earnings per share by 36% -- from $7.61 earned last year to about $10.35 earned in 2017. That's not going to be easy to pull off. In fact, if Boeing is to have any chance of satisfying investors by hitting its profit target, it needs to start pulling levers ASAP to help pull margins out of their dive -- by cutting expenses, and specifically cutting payroll. Judging from the stock market's reaction, investors like the fact that they're seeing Boeing taking at least a first step toward fulfilling its promise. I'm guessing the folks getting laid off, though, are less enthused. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Bill Dugovich, a union spokesman, said the latest round of cuts is "very disappointing."

The firings follow a round of voluntary buyouts Boeing offered to its staff in January. Back then, more than 300 engineering and technical staff and 1,500 members of the Machinists union accepted the offer. Boeing told all of the engineers and around 1,000 of the machinists that they should leave the company permanently this Friday. “We need to reduce our employment levels further,” John Hamilton, vice president of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, wrote in a memo, according to The Seattle Times. In late March, Boeing issued another 245 involuntary layoff notices that will take effect in mid-May. This is while, since January last year, the company has fired 1,332 engineering and technical employees from its Washington workforce. The job cuts come despite previous rounds of voluntary reductions and layoffs, in addition to further cuts through natural attrition. “We anticipate (Friday’s notices) will impact hundreds of engineering employees,” read the memo by Hamilton. “Additional reductions in engineering later this year will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition.” Despite cutting a total of 7,400 jobs last year, Boeing Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kevin McAllister, warned of more cuts in 2017 due to “fewer sales opportunities and tough competition.” The Washington Examiner says the number of all voluntary and involuntary cuts over the past year, mainly through buyouts and retirements, exceeds 9,000. The Chicago-based aviation giant, which employs more than 74,000 people, reported $95 billion in revenue last year.

Cancel order!” he wrote in a tweet. Boeing managed to save the deal after negotiating a price cut with the new Republican president.

The manufacturer plans to hand out pink slips on Friday, the same day that 305 engineers and technical workers will leave voluntarily under an earlier buyout offer. Boeing has pared 1,332 of the jobs from its Seattle-area manufacturing center since the start of 2016, according to Speea, the union representing the workers. Boeing may make additional engineering cuts depending on "our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition", John Hamilton, the vice president of engineering for the commercial airplanes unit, said in a letter to employees. The dismissals are needed to "meet our operating plan and additional challenges in the marketplace". The Chicago-based company, which emerged as the face of US manufacturing under the US president Donald Trump, has been winnowing employment for more than a year as a record jetliner sales spree fades. Boeing trimmed the Washington workforce by 9 per cent to 70,640 employees over the past year. The company’s total headcount has shrunk 7.6 per cent to 146,962 since March 2016. Total revenue for 2016 dipped 1.6 per cent to US$94.6 billion as Boeing slowed output of the 747 jumbo jetliner amid declining sales and said it would reduce the production rate of the 777 twin-aisle plane for a second time. As demand for new planes has waned amid record order backlogs and a surplus of older models, Boeing has trimmed its overhead and worked to ratchet down supplier costs. The latest workforce reduction, which should take effect June 23, follows a separate exodus of 1,500 mechanics who agreed to leave voluntarily this year. Both union and non-union engineering workers will be included, said Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman. He would not say where the job cuts would occur. Union leaders are seeking details on the plants and positions affected by the latest cutback. "We’ve also asked Boeing to expand the voluntary layoff programme and provide other assistance to employees," said Rich Plunkett, Speea’s director of strategic development. Some unionised workers may be eligible to be recalled at a future date. Shares of the largest US exporter rose 1.9 per cent to $179.02 at the close in New York yesterday. The trading gain was the largest among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. * Bloomberg business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Boeing to axe hundreds of jobs this week Airbus sued over aircraft sales practices Day in the life of Emirates’ A380 fleet – video Lockheed’s new military helicopter to cost billions more MOST VIEWED Business | All Arabtec pursuing cases against former management, says chairman IMF sharply cuts Mideast oil exporters’ economic growth forecasts Abu Dhabi’s TDIC mulls idea of affordable housing for Saadiyat Island Cityscape Abu Dhabi, 2017 – in pictures Arabtec rights issue gets green light after stormy general meeting LG G6 review: The right phone at the wrong time UAE retailers put the focus on customer service UAE banking sector on its way to recovery, report says Airbus sued over aircraft sales practices Some listed firms need a sensible talk on governance More Most Viewed Swimwear alert at new Dubai beaches Something in the UAE air: 100 per cent humidity Arabtec pursuing cases against former management, says chairman Oman imam returns Dh2.4m won in bank raffle, citing Sharia UAE public and private sector Israa wal Miraj holidays announced Passport power lifts UAE influence Iran’s election is soon, but still there is no clarity Trump is turning into a pretty decent president Clubs and bars step up ID checks to ensure customers are old enough to drink alcohol IMF sharply cuts Mideast oil exporters’ economic growth forecasts More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Your Money blog: How the UAE’s new credit scoring system affects you Abu Dhabi residential sale prices drop in the first quarter Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Cityscape Abu Dhabi, 2017 – in pictures Arabtec rights issue gets green light after stormy general meeting Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

The company told staff in a memo Monday that “hundreds of Engineering employees” in Washington state and other company sites will receive layoff notices Friday. This follows a round of voluntary buyouts Boeing offered in January. That proposal was accepted by more than 300 engineering staff and 1,500 members of the Machinists union. About 1,000 machinists who accepted that buyout offer will leave permanently on Friday. In late March, Boeing issued an earlier round of 245 involuntary layoffs, including 62 engineering staff and 111 machinists. Those also did not affect the Charleston site. Despite the earlier rounds of voluntary reductions and layoffs, plus further cuts through natural attrition, “we need to reduce our employment level further,” wrote John Hamilton, vice president of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in Monday’s memo to the company’s engineers. Hamilton also indicated that there are likely more layoffs coming later this year. “We anticipate [Friday’s notices] will impact hundreds of Engineering employees,” Hamilton wrote. “Additional reductions in Engineering later this year will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition.” Hamilton’s memo applies only to engineering staff. Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace said the union is trying to get further information from the company about the planned layoffs. International Association of Machinists spokeswoman Connie Kelliher said that union has not been informed by the company of any imminent layoffs. Boeing cut almost 7,400 jobs in Washington state last year. Then in December, Boeing Vice Chairman Ray Conner and the new chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Kevin McAllister, issued a joint message to employees warning that “fewer sales opportunities and tough competition” would drive further cuts in 2017. That warning followed on the heels of a decision to cut 777 production in Everett, Wash., from seven planes per month to five per month beginning in August. That move was forced by a continuing slump in widebody jet sales. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said Boeing South Carolina will not be hit by this round of layoffs. That manufacturing complex in North Charleston has cut 110 jobs this year through attrition, all achieved without involuntary layoffs. Boeing South Carolina’s current workforce of 7,455 is down 787 people from its peak last May.

Additional reductions in engineering later this year will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition.” ADVERTISEMENT Boeing reportedly offered a round of voluntary buyouts in January, an offer that was accepted by more than 300 engineering and technical staff and 1,500 members of the machinists union. The Times said all the engineering staff who accepted the proposal will permanently leave Boeing Friday, along with roughly 1,000 machinists. Boeing has purportedly cut 1,332 engineering and technical jobs from its Washington workforce since January 2016. The Times added the aviation company issued an earlier round of layoffs in March resulting in 245 involuntary layoffs, including 62 engineering staff and 111 machinists, taking place in mid-May. The Washington Examiner said Boeing has terminated more than 9,000 employees over the past year, mainly through buyouts and retirements. The Chicago-based company currently employs 74,200 people, it added, and reported $95 billion in revenue last year. President Trump fiercely criticized Boeing during his transition period over the cost of its replacement Air Force One program, calling the price of two new 747s “out of control.” The president has since claimed he helped lowered the program’s costs after meeting with Boeing’s CEO earlier this year.

(AP) — Boeing will issue hundreds of layoff notices to engineers in Washington state this week. The Daily Herald reported Monday (https://goo.gl/BWosp) that a memo from the company’s vice president of engineering for Boeing Commercial Airplanes John Hamilton says the cuts are necessary to stay competitive. Hamilton also said in the memo that more cuts in engineering could come later this year. In just over the past year, Boeing Commercial Airplanes reduced its workforce by more than 9,000, mainly through buyouts and retirements.

(Reuters photo) - + The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) has been delayed five times and faces rising costs, yet its future as the vanguard of Japanese-built passenger jets seems assured by the corporate muscle behind it and a government set on reviving an aerospace industry dismantled after World War II. The delays -- the new 90-seat plane was due to take off in 2013, but the first delivery is not now seen until 2020 -- have dented its chances of commercial success as established regional jet makers, Brazil's Embraer SA and Canada's Bombardier Inc, catch up with its innovations, and China and Russia flex their aerospace ambitions. But the Japanese government's primary goal isn't to make money for Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, the MRJ's manufacturer, rather it's to have the plane cement an industry revival that failed to take off half a century ago with Japan's last passenger plane, the YS-11. "Rather than a simple question of whether it makes a profit or loss, what is more important is will it over the longer term be the foundation of a strong aerospace industry," a government source who is helping the programme told Reuters. He asked not to be identified as he is not authorized to talk to the media. Presentation documents prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, seen by Reuters, see the MRJ as the first in a three-generation programme stretching beyond 2060. With the plane still awaiting US-standard certification for commercial flights, signed-up customers are banking on the backing of big-name Japanese companies to see the project through. Mitsubishi Aircraft is 64%-owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, with Toyota Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Corp each holding a 10% stake. Other shareholders include state-owned Development Bank of Japan, Sumitomo Corp and Mitsui & Co. "Not a bad list," says Jep Thornton, a partner at Aerolease Aviation in Florida which has ordered 10 of the planes. "This is coming from the government sector, the financial sector and the investor sector." Launch customer All Nippon Airways, Japan's biggest carrier, says it won't walk away from its order for 15 MRJs even as it has to keep older aircraft flying and leases four Boeing 737-800 aircraft to make up for a capacity shortfall. "We want this plane in our fleet and although we have been on stand-by for a while, we await it with anticipation," said Yuji Hirako, who runs All Nippon Airways. RE-WIRING The plane's latest delay, announced in January, can be dated back more than 20 years -- six years before Mitsubishi even considered a passenger jet -- when a Boeing 747 plunged into the Atlantic, killing 230 people. Investigators blamed a short circuit that ignited a fuel tank fire, prompting the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) to tighten wiring certification in 2007. Mitsubishi, which had by then begun work on the MRJ, overlooked the change, said two people with knowledge of the project. "Mitsubishi was clearly aware of it but did not apply it to the design," said one, who didn't want to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. Hundreds of engineers wiring the MRJ did so without using a common design framework incorporating the new rule. So, when asked by Japanese regulators certifying the jet to FAA standards how it complied with the stricter standard, Mitsubishi Aircraft faced a time-consuming task to explain each twist and turn in the 23,000 wires snaking through the plane's fuselage. "They decided it would be easier to start from scratch," the second person said. In response to Reuters queries, Mitsubishi Aircraft said: "We were aware of the regulation in our early phase of design, so it is not accurate to say we overlooked the regulation. Our design was made reflecting the regulations, but we made a subsequent decision to relocate certain systems for a better design. System location was the main reason for requiring wiring changes and the re-routing ensures we meet the highest safety standards." Four of the five delays so far have been caused to some degree by similar failures to document work for certification, forcing engineers to redo some of their work, said Yugo Fukuhara, vice president and general manager of sales and marketing at Mitsubishi Aircraft, adding the company is hiring ex-Boeing engineers and other foreign experts to help it better navigate FAA rules. BREAKING EVEN? Mitsubishi Aircraft has orders for 233 MRJs, and aims to sell more than 1,000 of the planes over two decades. The company declined to say how many planes it has to sell to break even. Based on presentations by Mitsubishi Heavy, the first four delays doubled the MRJ's development cost, and the latest delay could add another 30% -- taking total spending to 350 billion yen ($3.17 billion), equivalent to the value of 67 list-price MRJs. At the average operating margin of 7.84% at commercial planemakers including Embraer, Boeing Co and Airbus SAS over the past three years, the profit per MRJ plane would be $3.7 million, according to Reuters calculations. At that rate of return, Mitsubishi Aircraft would need to sell more than 800 of the planes to cover its costs. "Assume a very conservative 30% discount to the list price, then re-do. That probably brings us to 1,200 jets, and they'll never get there," said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group, when asked about Reuters' estimate. A more realistic number, he says, would be 30 aircraft a year over 25 years, adding up to sales of around 750 MRJs. "We understand that the commercial aircraft business is a long-term investment, and we expect to absorb the development costs over the long run," Mitsubishi Aircraft told Reuters. "We see this as the creation of a new industry, establishing supply chains and a regulatory certification process," said Fukuhara, the sales and marketing manager, in his office at Nagoya Airport. "I don't think it will end with the MRJ."

According to Reuters, Boeing has warned its employees that it "planned another round of involuntary layoffs that would affect hundreds of engineers at its commercial airplanes unit." From the report: The latest job cuts followed a prior involuntary reduction of 245 workers set for May 19 as the company responded to increasing competition and slowing aircraft sales. The additional layoffs are due to start June 23, according to the memo from John Hamilton, vice president of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "We are moving forward with a second phase of involuntary layoffs for some select skills in Washington state and other enterprise locations," the memo said. "We anticipate this will impact hundreds of engineering employees. Additional reductions in engineering later this year will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition." boeing business money ← You may like to read: → Microsoft's Cool Quantum Computing Plan Embraces Cryogenic Memory Donald Trump Wins US Presidency Garmin Engineer Shot And Killed By Man Yelling 'Get Out Of My Country!'

A variety of companies, including Google, SpaceX, Boeing and Samsung, are vying to launch global broadband networks via the deployment of thousands of micro satellites into low orbit. The first launches are planned for 2018. However, a team of Southampton University researchers, led by Dr. Hugh Lewis, senior lecturer in aerospace engineering, have concluded the results could well be calamitous. The group ran a 200-year simulation to assess possible consequences of such a rise in orbital traffic, concluding it could create a 50 percent increase in the number of catastrophic satellite collisions. Microsatellites, megaconstellations & strategies for combatting increasing volumes of #spacedebris https://t.co/WBOi0gz4iW #SpaceDebris2017 pic.twitter.com/6USZxxHoma — DLR — English (@DLR_en) April 18, 2017​ Such crashes would likely produce a further increase in the amount of space junk orbiting the Earth, raising the prospect of further collisions and potential damage to the services the satellites were intended to provide.  "The constellations that are due to be deployed from next year contain an unprecedented number of satellites, and a constellation launched without much thought will see a significant impact on the space environment because of the increased rate of collisions that might occur," Dr. Lewis said. With approximately 750,000 objects larger than one centimeter orbiting Earth, junk surrounding the planet is already a major obstacle to attempts to explore space. At average speeds of 40,000 kilometers per hour, impacts on space hardware would deliver roughly the energy equivalent to the explosion of a hand grenade, with potentially dramatic consequences for operational satellites. Transforming the silent movement of 27000 pieces of space junk into sound — by @ProjectAdrift #spacedebris2017 https://t.co/Ela89WLnt9 — ESA Operations (@esaoperations) April 18, 2017​ The team's research was funded by the European Space Agency, which is now calling for all satellites planned for orbital mega-constellations to be able to move to low altitudes once their missions are over, so they burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The ESA state they should also be able discharge all batteries, fuel tanks and pressure tanks to prevent explosions that would scatter debris. Dr. Holger Krag, head of the Agency's space debris office, said many companies proposing to launch services provided by such mega constellations lacked experience of the difficulties of working in Earth's orbit. Moreover, Dr. Krag expressed concern at ambitions to manufacture satellites at a fraction of the cost and many times the rate of traditional taxpayer-funded spacecraft, while still meeting exacting guidelines for their post-mission disposal. "Right now, under all the taxpayer-funded space flight we are doing today is only able to achieve 60 percent of success rate for that maneuver. How can they be better under commercial pressure and with cheaper satellites? That's the worry we have," he said. Dr. Lewis is to present his research at the ESA center in Darmsadt, Germany, where some of the aspirant private space explorers will also be in attendance. "Even with good intentions it remains an extremely high technological challenge to manage to [meet ESA proposals]. Let them achieve a success rate of 90 percent, which would be extremely good compared with what we do now, and it still means a few hundred satellites will be lost and at that altitude it's not good. It's as simple as that," Dr. Krag concluded. Exacerbating the situation, Dr. Lewis believes, is a lack of a dedicated international body dealing with the issue of space junk. "Junk is dangerous. While some will de-orbit naturally after 5-10 years, some will drift indefinitely. Disposal isn't easy either — even to get a ship into orbit is very costly, and then there's the issue of securing the junk in space before you can even consider getting rid of it," Dr. Lewis told Sputnik. However, he adds that research into these issues is significant and ongoing — the end result could be spacecraft equipped with retrieval solutions similar to those seen in science fiction movies. Another option is "in-orbit" servicing, which would mean satellites could be upgraded and repaired in space — meaning few if any satellites will be reduced to junk status. "In-orbit servicing is the next big thing. However, there are a number of challenges to achieving that goal — and another issue is upgrading old satellites that aren't equipped for updates. It's difficult to interact with an object that is not prepared for it. We need to ensure in our quest to clean up the junk that we don't add more and make the problem worse." ...

Thanks to its two coaxial rotors and a pusher propeller, the aircraft can speed through the skies at 300 mph at altitudes of 6,000-feet, and hover like a bird. Inside, there's enough room for 12 people, or up to 8 medivac pallets, while the Blackhawk only has an 11 soldier capacity. "The primary advantage that Defiant's going to offer over a traditional helicopter is, it's got twice the speed, two to three times the range, and is just an extremely maneuverable and agile platform," said retired Marine Major Frank P. Conway, who is also Boeing's experimental test pilot for the SB1. Click here to view the first image in today's viral picture gallery.

The manufacturer plans to hand out pink slips on Friday, the same day that 305 engineers and technical workers will leave voluntarily under an earlier buyout offer. Boeing has pared 1,332 of the jobs from its Seattle-area manufacturing center since the start of 2016, according to SPEEA, the union representing the workers. Boeing may make additional engineering cuts depending on "our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition," John Hamilton, vice president of engineering for the commercial airplanes unit, said in a letter to employees Monday. The dismissals are needed to "meet our operating plan and additional challenges in the marketplace." Boeing lands in Plano's $3 billion Legacy West project The Chicago-based company, which emerged as the face of U.S. manufacturing under President Donald Trump, has been winnowing employment for more than a year as a record jetliner sales spree fades. Boeing trimmed the Washington workforce by 9 percent to 70,640 employees over the past year. The company's total headcount has shrunk 7.6 percent to 146,962 since March 2016. Revenue Drop Total revenue for 2016 dipped 1.6 percent to $94.6 billion as Boeing slowed output of the 747 jumbo jetliner amid declining sales and said it would reduce the production rate of the 777 twin-aisle plane for a second time. As demand for new planes has waned amid record order backlogs and a surplus older models, Boeing has trimmed its overhead and worked to ratchet down supplier costs. The latest workforce reduction, which should take effect June 23, follows a separate exodus of 1,500 mechanics who agreed to leave voluntarily earlier this year. Both union and non-union engineering workers will be included, Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman, said Monday. He wouldn't say where the job cuts would occur. What Boeing taught D-FW 16 years ago helped land the jet giant this time Union leaders are seeking details on the plants and positions affected by the latest cutback. "We've also asked Boeing to expand the voluntary layoff program and provide other assistance to employees," Rich Plunkett, SPEEA's director of strategic development, said in a statement. Some unionized workers may be eligible to be recalled at a future date. Shares of the largest U.S. exporter rose 1.9 percent to $179.02 at the close in New York. The trading gain was the largest among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Vijay Mallya TTV Dinakaran Donald Trump IPL 2017 Narendra Modi News World Post-sanctions Iran helps planemakers solve 'orphan jet' problem Shares1 Tue, 18 Apr 2017-07:28pm , Reuters Iran's return to the world economy is helping planemakers cope with a downturn in global demand, providing homes for airplanes orphaned by reversals in the growth plans of airlines elsewhere. Planemakers are also gambling that the early delivery of such aircraft could help prop up a nuclear sanctions deal between Iran and world powers, threatened by conservative opponents in both Washington and Tehran, Western sources said. Since sanctions were lifted under the deal to reopen trade and curb Iran's nuclear projects, the Islamic Republic, trying to boost its economy after years of isolation, has joined a waiting list of up to eight years for 200 new aircraft. But efforts to meet its most immediate needs have been boosted by financial problems facing other airlines across the globe as new airplanes come onto the market at bargain prices. "We hunt opportunities in the market. If there are opportunities, we can take advantage of that," Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters. Despite denials by manufacturers that the downturn is hurting, Iran's return to the market has brought to light pockets of surplus aircraft. With presidential elections looming in May and keen to show the 2015 nuclear deal is working, Iran has proved only too keen to take up the slack. So far it has taken delivery of three Airbus jets. Industry executives say they were left on the planemaker's books when their Colombian buyer, Avianca, balked at taking delivery. Such orphan planes are often known as 'white tails'. Last week, Iran also signed a deal for 20 ATR turboprops. Unusually in a risk-averse industry with high costs, four of those are already built and ready to be delivered: short-circuiting their usual l8 months' waiting time. Although it denies they are white tails, ATR took the rare decision to build them for IranAir before the final contract was signed. Analysts say that too is a signal of market weakness as manufacturers wrestle with weakness in developing economies. TURKISH SWAP The sudden reshuffling suits both sides as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tries to demonstrate results from the nuclear deal, opposed by hardline candidates in May elections. It also holds up a mirror to geopolitical changes in the region, played out in the fortunes of national carriers. While Iran's aviation industry is coming out of decades of cold storage as sanctions are lifted, Turkey has seen a slump in travel demand after a failed coup and attacks in major cities. Now, Turkish Airlines is having doubts about taking one of the industry's key growth engines, a 350-seat Boeing 777-3000ER. Uncertainty over next month's scheduled delivery contrasts with Iran's urgent need for the same model, the first of which is due to be delivered to Tehran in April or May next year. At Boeing's suggestion, Iranian representatives are now inspecting the Turkish configuration to see whether the airlines could swap deliveries, Fakhrieh-Kashan confirmed. Boeing declined to comment. Iran has ordered 15 777-300ERs as part of a deal for 80 Boeing jets. They are crucial to Boeing's efforts to steady declining 777 production, pending the arrival of a new model. Bringing forward Boeing's first delivery to Iran since the 1970s could also provide broader momentum to the sanctions pact, hampered by funding problems and uncertainty about the attitude of U.S. President Donald Trump who has said he dislikes it. Since all planemakers need U.S. export licences due to the number of U.S. parts in their planes, any decision to block the Boeing deals would likely halt European activities in Iran too. "It helps to bring Boeing to the same table as everyone else," said a senior European industry executive, referring to the talks to swap Turkish and Iranian deliveries. Iranian officials have however been forced to defend the reshuffling from suggestions that Iran is getting cast-off airplanes. They stress the Avianca jets, for example, had been sitting unused for two years and had never flown commercially. "It is good for Airbus and Boeing, but this is part of the game that everyone knows," Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters.

ATR spokesman David Vargas also told the Associated Press the deal is for the 20 ATR 72-600s, a twin-propeller aircraft, and said Iran Air had an option to purchase another 20. The lifting of economic sanctions in 2015 came after Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium. That opened a promising market for products made by Pratt, Boeing, and others in the West, an aerospace industry analyst said Thursday. The ATR 72-600 planes are made by Avions de Transport Regional, a France-based partnership of Airbus Industries and Italy's Leonardo S.p.A. Two PW127M engines, built by Pratt & Whitney Canada, power each planes. Vargas declined to offer a value for the deal with Iran Air. The confirmed portion of the deal is worth $536 million at list prices, though buyers typically negotiate discounts on bulk orders. Iranian state TV described the deal as being worth about $400 million. Engines typically make up a quarter of the cost of an aircraft. But it's the potential for more sales — and much larger orders — that makes the deal significant, Ray Jaworowski, a senior aerospace analyst with Newtown-based Forecast International, said. "The potential of Iran as a civil aviation market is considerable," Jaworowski said. Since the economic sanctions were imposed, Iran Air has been prevented from modernizing its fleet, which has left it with a mix of older Airbus, Boeing and planes from other companies' planes which have an average age of more than 20 years, Jaworowski said. "Iran has the second-largest economy in the Middle East, with a large and growing middle class, so prospects are bright for substantial air traffic growth on both domestic and international routes," he said. Still, Jaworowski said, there are risks that the Iranian market could dry up again. The political situation is still fragile, he said, and the "potential for some disruption in relations down the road is real." Boeing Co. has already made a $16.6 billion sale already to Iran Air, while its European rival Airbus signed one estimated to be worth some $25 billion. The Treasury has signed off on both those deals. Chicago-based Boeing also signed a $3 billion deal this month to sell 30 737 MAX aircraft to Iran's Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. The Boeing sales represent the first major deals for an American company in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The financing side of the equation — whether from banks, leasing companies, other financial institutions, or even the aircraft manufacturers themselves — also is something of an unknown at this point, Jaworowski said.     KeyWords ATR plane Iran   Related News : CEO: ATR ready to sell more passenger planes to Iran Iran to begin receiving ATR planes in November Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran complying with commitments under nuclear deal: Tillerson Iran FM urges Persian Gulf-Black Sea corridor launch Iran’s Faghani to officiate Gamba Osaka vs. Adelaide United Kolakovic: There is no shortcut to success Iran, EU sign first ever project for nuclear safety cooperation Rouhani: Youth must be prepared for interaction with tomorrow's technologies Russia says trade with Iran to grow further in 2017 Iran, Georgia seek stronger ties Iran to deploy 20k special police forces on Election Day Iranian-Americans challenge US travel ban in court Most Visited Trump installs two hate groups leaders in administration US accuses Russia of covering up Syrian govt.'s role in gas attack Asian man violently dragged off US plane www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/1202 sec

"We need to reduce our employment levels further," John Hamilton, Vice President of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said on Monday. "We anticipate (Friday's notices) will impact hundreds of engineering employees. Additional reductions in engineering later this year will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition," The Hill magazine quoted Hamilton as saying. The Chicago-based company reportedly offered a round of voluntary buyouts in January, an offer that was accepted by more than 300 engineering and technical staff. According to the Seattle Times, all the engineering staff who accepted the proposal will permanently leave Boeing on Friday. Boeing has purportedly cut 1,332 engineering and technical jobs from its Washington workforce since January 2016. The Seattle Times added that the aviation company issued an earlier round of layoffs in March, resulting in 245 involuntary layoffs, including 62 engineering staff, in mid-May. The Washington Examiner said Boeing has terminated more than 9,000 employees over the past year, mainly through buyouts and retirements. The company currently employs 74,200 people, it added, and reported $95 billion in revenue last year. President Donald Trump had criticised Boeing during his transition period over the cost of its replacement Air Force One programme, calling the price of two new 747s "out of control". --IANS ksk/vt SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features No bars on highways Rare April snow, heavy rains cut off Kashmir Dalai Lama's Arunachal visit rattles China, jubilates exiled Buddhists Cartoon: Aadhar everywhere!

PHOTO: REUTERS Boeing Co warned employees on Monday it planned another round of involuntary layoffs that would affect hundreds of engineers at its commercial airplanes unit, according to a source and a memo seen by Reuters. The latest job cuts followed a prior involuntary reduction of 245 workers set for May 19 as the company responded to increasing competition and slowing aircraft sales. The additional layoffs are due to start June 23, according to the memo from John Hamilton, vice president of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Iran signs $16.6 billion deal for 80 Boeing planes “We are moving forward with a second phase of involuntary layoffs for some select skills in Washington state and other enterprise locations,” the memo said. “We anticipate this will impact hundreds of engineering employees. Additional reductions in engineering later this year will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition.” Boeing’s airplane unit eliminated several hundred engineers through voluntary redundancies announced in January and March. PIA operates Boeing 737-800 aircraft on wet lease from Turkey In a statement, the aerospace and defense company said the extra job cuts would include managers and executives and be achieved through a combination of attrition, voluntary layoffs and in some cases involuntary layoffs. “In an ongoing effort to increase overall competitiveness and invest in our future, we are reducing costs and matching employment levels to business and market requirements,” the statement said. It was not immediately clear whether workers at Boeing’s Dreamliner factory in South Carolina would be affected.

Long term investment funding required by the manufacturers as well as for the end users may curb the demand. Budget constraints and delay in delivery of the aircraft have led to development of aircraft with extended life. This service life extension will restrict the support system growth including aviation test equipment market size. Development of standard and synthetic test instruments, updating legacy equipment and rise in unmanned aerial vehicle testers in battlefield and in the national airspace platforms provides growth opportunities to the aviation test equipment market players. APAC is a promising regional sector for the long-haul segment and heavily relies on medium and small wide body aircraft. Manufacturers are shifting their focus on countries such as India, China, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Morocco due to availability of cheap labor, skilled employees and favorable government initiatives. For instance, in August 2016, Honeywell and Wuhan Hangda signed a new licensing agreement for providing MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) services for Honeywell’s mechanical and pneumatic products on the Airbus A330 and A320, also the Boeing fleet. Make an inquiry for buying this report @ www.gminsights.com/inquiry-before-buying/1446 Some of the players in the aviation test equipment market are Honeywell International Inc., Airbus, Boeing, Rockwell Collins, Rolls Royce Holdings Plc, 3M, General Electric Aviation, Moog, Teradyne, SPHEREA Test & services, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Avtron Aerospace, Testek, DAC International, DMA-Aero Ideal Aerosmith Inc, etc. The aviation test equipment industry is characterized by intense competition among the players. The parameters for competing includes product quality, reliability, cost, aftermarket service and innovation & technology. For instance, Airbus defense & space segment provides ATEC (automatic test equipment) Series 6 for major avionics equipment manufacturers on the Airbus, ATR and Boeing aircraft. This system is also used for 787 and A350 maintenance. ATEC S6 provides RFEM (Radio Frequency expansion module) designed to evaluate & test airborne RF component and TPEM (Test Power Extension Module) to test aircraft power electronics and electrical power controls.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   The President is sending very mixed signals on the Ex-Im bank posted at 12:01 pm on April 17, 2017 by Jazz Shaw Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES I had expressed my severe disappointment back in early February when we heard rumors that President Trump was going back on one of his strongly held campaign themes of wanting to do away with the massive slush fund and bastion of crony capitalism known as the Export Import Bank. Those fears were pretty much confirmed last week during a flurry of announcements which seemed to signal other such reversals. (Take a deep breath and keep repeating, at least we got Gorsuch. At least we got Gorsuch. At least we got Gorsuch.) Now it’s official, with the president making two nominations for positions on the bank’s board. Curiously, the two individuals are seemingly miles apart in terms of their attitude toward Ex-Im. (Politico) President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he intends to nominate two former Republican lawmakers to fill empty seats on the Export-Import Bank’s board, one of whom has been a prominent opponent of the agency. Trump tapped Scott Garrett, an Ex-Im critic and a former House member from New Jersey, as president of the bank’s board, and Spencer Bachus, a former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, as a board member. If they are confirmed, the bank would once again have a quorum, and therefore the ability to approve deals above $10 million. Ex-Im guarantees loans for foreign companies interested in buying U.S. exports, and also runs programs such as providing insurance and credit to help small businesses secure new customers and working capital. While leaving the bank’s board unmanned would have been closer to a permanent solution to the problem, the stupidly optimistic side of me has to wonder if these nominations don’t signal something of a “third way” approach which might not be a complete disaster. Last year, when it looked like we had finally driven a stake through the heart of the bank, former New Jersey Congressman Scott Garrett was listed by Heritage Action as being on record against Ex-Im and he had previously referred to it as, “a bank that embodies the corruption of the free enterprise system.” Conversely, Scott Garrett used to represent Alabama, the home of one of Boeing’s larger plants. (Boeing is the recipient of the vast majority of Ex-Im’s largess and Garrett is a steady supporter.) So what does this mean? We’ve got the pro-bank guy being nominated to be president of the board but one of the other votes any significant funding will require is to be held by a bitter opponent. A more hopeful person could see it as a signal that perhaps the gigantic giveaways benefiting Boeing may be shut off (or at least tapered back) and the focus of the bank might return to actual small businesses as was originally intended. Is that possible? At the New York Times business section, Alexandria Stevenson sees hints that what Trump is actually looking to do is “reshape the bank.” Mr. Trump said in an interview this week he no longer wanted to eliminate the Export-Import Bank, adding that he planned to fill two openings on the board, which has five members… “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies are really helped, the vendor companies,” he said, adding that other countries give similar assistance. “When other countries give it we lose a tremendous amount of business.” Choosing to focus far more heavily on small businesses might turn Ex-Im into something which is at least tolerable (though still picking winners and losers) and represent a “reshaping” of the institution. Could that work? I suppose anything could happen in the post-2016 era, but Boeing moves a lot of money around in lobbying circles and donates to almost everyone in Congress. With the door once again open for the bank, it’s hard to see them not being able to muscle their way through. I’m prepared to be joyfully proven wrong, but this isn’t my first time at the rodeo. I wouldn’t bank on it… pun intended.

(NYSE: BA) will shed more employees as it faces new orders and production slow down for some of the company’s current commercial jets. According to reports Monday morning, the company plans to fire “hundreds” more engineers this year with the cuts scheduled to begin on June 23. The job cuts announced Monday come in addition to 245 job losses already scheduled for May 19 and voluntary reductions that have chopped about 1,800 engineering and technical positions so far this year. According to a Boeing spokesman, the cuts will affect both union and non-union workers. While the company did not specify which locations would be affected, chances are high that the Seattle area will take the brunt of the cuts. Boeing’s 777 production will be cut to 5 per month later this year and is likely to be cut further as the company transitions to the 777X models scheduled to reach customers in 2020. Production of the 747 jumbo jet has also been reduced as orders for new 747s dry up. Both the 747 and 777 are produced in Washington state. Boeing has floated the idea of raising production of its 787 Dreamliner from a current level of 12 per month to 14. The plane is built both in Washington and South Carolina. The 787-10 is slated to begin production this year (which will slow deliveries) with first deliveries next year (which will make up for the slowdown in 2017). By 2020, 787 production could drop to 10 per month according to some analysts, with production falling to 7 early in the 2020s according to Buckingham Research. Boeing’s stock rose about 1.5% Monday afternoon to $178.17 in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $185.71. The stock’s 12-month price target is $179.81.

The delays – the new 90-seat plane was due to take off in 2013, but the first delivery is not now seen until 2020 – have dented its chances of commercial success as established regional jet makers, Brazil’s Embraer SA <EMBR3.SA> and Canada’s Bombardier Inc <BBDb.TO>, catch up with its innovations, and China and Russia flex their aerospace ambitions. But the Japanese government’s primary goal isn’t to make money for Mitsubishi Aircraft, the MRJ’s manufacturer, rather it’s to have the plane cement an industry revival that failed to take off half a century ago with Japan’s last passenger plane, the YS-11. “Rather than a simple question of whether it makes a profit or loss, what is more important is will it over the longer term be the foundation of a strong aerospace industry,” a government source who is helping the program told Reuters. He asked not to be identified as he is not authorized to talk to the media. Presentation documents prepared by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, seen by Reuters, see the MRJ as the first in a three-generation program stretching beyond 2060. With the plane still awaiting U.S.-standard certification for commercial flights, signed-up customers are banking on the backing of big-name Japanese companies to see the project through. Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp is 64 percent-owned by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T>, with Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Mitsubishi Corp <8058.T> each holding a 10 percent stake. Other shareholders include state-owned Development Bank of Japan, Sumitomo Corp <8053.T> and Mitsui & Co <8031.T>. “Not a bad list,” says Jep Thornton, a partner at Aerolease Aviation in Florida which has ordered 10 of the planes. “This is coming from the government sector, the financial sector and the investor sector.” Launch customer ANA Holdings <9202.T>, Japan’s biggest carrier, says it won’t walk away from its order for 15 MRJs even as it has to keep older aircraft flying and leases four Boeing <BA.N> 737-800 aircraft to make up for a capacity shortfall. “We want this plane in our fleet and although we have been on stand-by for a while, we await it with anticipation,” said Yuji Hirako, who runs All Nippon Airways. RE-WIRING The plane’s latest delay, announced in January, can be dated back more than 20 years – six years before Mitsubishi even considered a passenger jet – when a Boeing 747 plunged into the Atlantic, killing 230 people. Investigators blamed a short circuit that ignited a fuel tank fire, prompting the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) to tighten wiring certification in 2007. Mitsubishi, which had by then begun work on the MRJ, overlooked the change, said two people with knowledge of the project. “Mitsubishi was clearly aware of it but did not apply it to the design,” said one, who didn’t want to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media. Hundreds of engineers wiring the MRJ did so without using a common design framework incorporating the new rule. So, when asked by Japanese regulators certifying the jet to FAA standards how it complied with the stricter standard, Mitsubishi Aircraft faced a time-consuming task to explain each twist and turn in the 23,000 wires snaking through the plane’s fuselage. “They decided it would be easier to start from scratch,” the second person said. In response to Reuters queries, Mitsubishi Aircraft said: “We were aware of the regulation in our early phase of design, so it is not accurate to say we overlooked the regulation. Our design was made reflecting the regulations, but we made a subsequent decision to relocate certain systems for a better design. System location was the main reason for requiring wiring changes and the re-routing ensures we meet the highest safety standards.” Four of the five delays so far have been caused to some degree by similar failures to document work for certification, forcing engineers to redo some of their work, said Yugo Fukuhara, vice president and general manager of sales and marketing at Mitsubishi Aircraft, adding the company is hiring ex-Boeing engineers and other foreign experts to help it better navigate FAA rules. BREAKING EVEN? Mitsubishi Aircraft has orders for 233 MRJs, and aims to sell more than 1,000 of the planes over two decades. The company declined to say how many planes it has to sell to break even. Based on presentations by Mitsubishi Heavy, the first four delays doubled the MRJ’s development cost, and the latest delay could add another 30 percent – taking total spending to 350 billion yen ($3.17 billion), equivalent to the value of 67 list-price MRJs. At the average operating margin of 7.84 percent at commercial planemakers including Embraer, Boeing and Airbus <AIR.PA> over the past three years, the profit per MRJ plane would be $3.7 million, according to Reuters calculations. At that rate of return, Mitsubishi Aircraft would need to sell more than 800 of the planes to cover its costs. “Assume a very conservative 30 percent discount to the list price, then re-do. That probably brings us to 1,200 jets, and they’ll never get there,” said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at Teal Group, when asked about Reuters’ estimate. A more realistic number, he says, would be 30 aircraft a year over 25 years, adding up to sales of around 750 MRJs. “We understand that the commercial aircraft business is a long-term investment, and we expect to absorb the development costs over the long run,” Mitsubishi Aircraft told Reuters. “We see this as the creation of a new industry, establishing supply chains and a regulatory certification process,” said Fukuhara, the sales and marketing manager, in his office at Nagoya Airport. “I don’t think it will end with the MRJ.” (For graphic comparing regional jets, click: http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/1/25/49/index.html) (Reporting by Tim Kelly and Maki Shiraki, with additional reporting by Allison Lampert in MONTREAL and Brad Haynes in SAO PAULO; Editing by Ian Geoghegan) Share this article: euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

(BA) plans to lay off hundreds of engineers in Washington state and other locations -- and may eliminate more jobs later this year. The manufacturer plans to hand out pink slips on Friday, the same day that 305 engineers and technical workers will leave voluntarily under an earlier buyout offer. Boeing may make additional engineering cuts depending on "our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition," John Hamilton, vice president of engineering for the commercial airplanes unit, said in a letter to employees Monday. The dismissals are needed to "meet our operating plan and additional challenges in the marketplace." The latest workforce reduction, which should take effect June 23, follows a separate exodus of 1,500 mechanics who agreed to leave voluntarily earlier this year.

U.S. equities rose on Monday as a weekend filled with geopolitical worries ended more calmly than investors expected, while bank stocks charged ahead. Quotes in the article M&T Bank Corp MTB ▼ 151.85 -1.86 -1.21% Netflix Inc NFLX ▼ 143.36 -3.89 -2.64% United Continental Holdings Inc UAL ▼ 67.75 -3.02 -4.27% AdChoices The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 100 points as Boeing and Goldman Sachs contributed the most gains on the 30-stock index. The S&P 500 gained nearly 0.6 percent, with financials leading advancers. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) rose more than half a percent after the top two Wells Fargo executives bought $5 million worth of Wells stock. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.5 percent. "I think this is a relief rally," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "Are out of the woods? No. I still think we're in the midst of a pullback" given geopolitical conditions. U.S. stocks also rose higher on Monday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Financial Times that Republicans could complete tax reform without incorporating the border adjustment tax. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF rose more than 1 percent, led by Rent-A-Center up almost 6 percent. Vice President Mike Pence said the "era of strategic patience" with North Korea was over. Pence made the comments on the border between North and South Korea a day after North Korea's failed missile test. The Trump administration is working with China and its allies on a response to North Korea's missile program. "The fact that Pence was able to go there and come out unharmed led some bulls back into the market," said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments. "This is a combination of relief in financial markets and the geopolitical front." James Smigiel, managing director at SEI, said the rise in stocks may be a byproduct of low trading volumes after the Easter holiday. "I think it's somewhat counter-intuitive that we're up this much," he said. "We didn't get anything good today, ... yet the market keeps on finding reasons to trade up. The benchmark 10-year note yield hit its lowest level since Nov. 17 before bouncing back to trade around 2.23 percent. Gold futures, which had been a popular trade over the past week, also traded off its session highs. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded more than 7 percent lower near 15. The index briefly broke above 16 last week. Investors went home on Thursday on edge after the U.S. dropped "the mother of all bombs" in Afghanistan. The U.S. used GBU-43 bomb on a cave complex believed to have ISIS fighters. Meanwhile, earnings season was set to kick into full gear this week, with Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and eBay, among others, set to report this week. Netflix was also set to report Monday after the close. Investors have high hopes for first-quarter earnings, with Wall Street expecting the best season since 2011. But it's the second-quarter guidance that has Nick Raich of The Earnings Scout worried. In a Monday note, The Earnings Scout's CEO said that just six of the 29 S&P 500 components that had reported also raised their second-quarter estimates, while 18 lowered them. "It remains highly likely that 2Q 2017 EPS estimates will go lower as more companies report and this week, there will be 69 more companies in the S&P 500 reporting," Raich said. In economic news, the Empire State index hit 5.2 in April, well below the 16.4 print reached in March. The NAHB survey showed sentiment among homebuilders slipped. The so-called hard economic data have softened recently. On Friday, the Labor Department said the consumer prices index — a key gauge of inflation — posted its biggest drop in more than two years in March, while the Commerce Department said retail sales dropped more than expected last month. In turn, market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike in June have slipped. But writing off tighter monetary policy — even near term — might be premature, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "It's going to take a lot for the Fed to pull back from its path to normalization," she said. "I think the Fed will tolerate more weakness" before deviating from its path. Investors also focused on the outcome of France's presidential election. Polls suggest a growing number of voters are turning away from mainstream parties, according to Reuters.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) dropped $2.29 last week (about 1.6%), closing at $141.05 on Thursday. Markets were closed Friday. Even so, it remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities the comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company’s stock is up 21.78% year to date, still well above second-place Boeing’s 12.81% improvement. Apple stock dropped sharply early Tuesday, likely due to a countersuit filed by Qualcomm in response to Apple’s January lawsuit against the chipmaker. Apple has charged Qualcomm with throttling its LTE processors and with abusing its market power. All told, Apple listed 389 specific allegations in its filing. In its response, Qualcomm denied all 389 allegations, citing 35 specific defenses to the charges, as well as claiming that the charges are unfounded. There is a lot of money at stake, and these opposing lawsuits will take months or years to sort out. Apple also got some bad news from Laptop magazine early last week. In the publication’s list of best notebook brands, the MacBook finished fifth behind Lenovo, Asus, Dell, HP and Acer (tied with Apple). The company was taken to task for offering too narrow a range of models, and MacBooks were also judged to be too expensive. Apple shares closed at $141.05 on Thursday, down about 0.5% for the day, in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $145.46. The consensus 12-month price target is $147.61 in a price target range of $104 to $185 per share.

At average speeds of 40,000 kilometers per hour, impacts on space hardware would deliver roughly the energy equivalent to the explosion of a hand grenade, with potentially dramatic consequences for operational satellites. Plans by private space explorers to launch "mega constellations" of thousands of communications satellites to allow for global wireless services could lead to a rise in collisions and buildup of dangerous space junk in Earth's orbit, a study has warned, suggesting corporate interest in space is perhaps somewhat sky high. A variety of companies, including Google, SpaceX, Boeing and Samsung, are vying to launch global broadband networks via the deployment of thousands of micro satellites into low orbit. The first launches are planned for 2018. However, a team of Southampton University researchers, led by Dr. Hugh Lewis, senior lecturer in aerospace engineering, have concluded the results could well be calamitous. The group ran a 200-year simulation to assess possible consequences of such a rise in orbital traffic, concluding it could create a 50 percent increase in the number of catastrophic satellite collisions. Such crashes would likely produce a further increase in the amount of space junk orbiting the Earth, raising the prospect of further collisions and potential damage to the services the satellites were intended to provide. "The constellations that are due to be deployed from next year contain an unprecedented number of satellites, and a constellation launched without much thought will see a significant impact on the space environment because of the increased rate of collisions that might occur," Dr. Lewis said. With approximately 750,000 objects larger than one centimeter orbiting Earth, junk surrounding the planet is already a major obstacle to attempts to explore space. At average speeds of 40,000 kilometers per hour, impacts on space hardware would deliver roughly the energy equivalent to the explosion of a hand grenade, with potentially dramatic consequences for operational satellites. The team's research was funded by the European Space Agency, which is now calling for all satellites planned for orbital mega-constellations to be able to move to low altitudes once their missions are over, so they burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The ESA state they should also be able discharge all batteries, fuel tanks and pressure tanks to prevent explosions that would scatter debris. Dr. Holger Krag, head of the Agency's space debris office, said many companies proposing to launch services provided by such mega constellations lacked experience of the difficulties of working in Earth's orbit. Moreover, Dr. Krag expressed concern at ambitions to manufacture satellites at a fraction of the cost and many times the rate of traditional taxpayer-funded spacecraft, while still meeting exacting guidelines for their post-mission disposal. "Right now, under all the taxpayer-funded space flight we are doing today is only able to achieve 60 percent of success rate for that maneuver. How can they be better under commercial pressure and with cheaper satellites? That's the worry we have," he said. Dr. Lewis is to present his research at the ESA center in Darmsadt, Germany, where some of the aspirant private space explorers will also be in attendance. "Even with good intentions it remains an extremely high technological challenge to manage to [meet ESA proposals]. Let them achieve a success rate of 90 percent, which would be extremely good compared with what we do now, and it still means a few hundred satellites will be lost and at that altitude it's not good. It's as simple as that," Dr. Krag concluded. Exacerbating the situation, Dr. Lewis believes, is a lack of a dedicated international body dealing with the issue of space junk. "Junk is dangerous. While some will de-orbit naturally after 5-10 years, some will drift indefinitely. Disposal isn't easy either - even to get a ship into orbit is very costly, and then there's the issue of securing the junk in space before you can even consider getting rid of it," Dr. Lewis told Sputnik. However, he adds that research into these issues is significant and ongoing - the end result could be spacecraft equipped with retrieval solutions similar to those seen in science fiction movies. Another option is "in-orbit" servicing, which would mean satellites could be upgraded and repaired in space - meaning few if any satellites will be reduced to junk status. "In-orbit servicing is the next big thing. However, there are a number of challenges to achieving that goal - and another issue is upgrading old satellites that aren't equipped for updates. It's difficult to interact with an object that is not prepared for it. We need to ensure in our quest to clean up the junk that we don't add more and make the problem worse."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Aeromexico Taps Yalochat.com and IV.AI to Build First Advanced AI Customer Service Chatbot MEXICO CITY and SAN JOSE, Calif., April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Today, as part of the Facebook F8 Conference, Aeromexico formally introduced Aerobot, its Artificial Intelligence (AI) customer service chatbot, with the help of its partners at Yalochat.com and IV.AI, leaders in chatbot development, neural network and machine learning programming.  In just six months, the bot has taken the customer service department from 0-96% automation and dramatically reduced the average customer service resolution time via chat from an average of 16 minutes to down to 2 minutes. „Mexicans are some of the most avid users of social chat platforms, such as Facebook Messenger and we saw a definite gap in what was being done to ease ongoing travelers pain points,” said Brian Gross, vice president of digital innovation, Aeromexico. „As part of our commitment to innovation and with the help of Yalochat.com and IV.AI, we were able to build a truly advanced AI brain that was fed historical customer service data in all forms, in order for it to be truly smart in how it handles requests, despite possible language challenges.” Aerobot has been being quietly used by customers for the last six months, but is now about to gain full marketing support and is the first of its kind to handle any question posed in natural language (in Spanish; English coming soon) about a customer’s trip or the company’s service.  This includes everything from checking flight status and purchasing tickets to providing recommendations on other information for their destinations and asking basic information like when to arrive at the airport. At F8, the airline is debuting its newest feature, group booking, which eliminates the need to coordinate tickets for multiple family or friends through email and phone calls. „How many times have you missed a group trip because you couldn’t reach consensus? We are thrilled that Aeromexico is launching the Chat Extension feature for Aerobot; this is a game-changer for air travel,” said Stan Chudnovsky, Vice President of Product for Messenger. „This feature will allow groups to plan a trip together from within Messenger with the help of the AI customer service chatbot and split payments.” Yalochat.com, is the premier chatbot and AI platform for Latin American businesses that are looking to radically improve their customer’s experience through chat. IV.AI automates customer service and builds proprietary AI ‚brains’ with its clients.  Companies keep their data and the AI ‚brain’ is designed to address specific business needs. This sets IV.AI and Yalochat.com apart from competitors and with their combination of machine learning, neural networks and natural language, they provide AI solutions that achieve real results. „Unlike many companies looking to jump on the AI bandwagon without the proper planning, Aeromexico knew what it was trying to achieve and was able to provide us with the data and their desired goals, allowing us to do what we do best — help companies use AI to get real results,” said Vince Lynch, CEO, IV.AI. „With the help of our partner Yalochat.com we were able to overcome some truly challenging issues, like multiple languages, slang and turning unstructured data into something comprehensive and useful, to create and feed a truly smart and effective AI brain for Aeromexico.  Now Aeromexico is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition with the Aerobot.” To try out the Aerobot, visit the Aeromexico Facebook page and send a message, or go to m.me/AeromexicoMX (Spanish version).

The shit can hit the fan in this lifetime or in some future reincarnation, but it will happen. Not that I personally subscribe to Hinduism or any other religion, but I do believe that there’s a large dose of merit in their world view. A lot can be said for lifestyles which involve veganism and peaceful coexistence with our fellow beings. Stray from the path, commit the crime, and you’ll eventually do the time. Like the Hindus, we’ll define “sentient beings” as including (most) humans, all other creatures with eyes and mothers, and most importantly Mother Earth herself; for she’s borne the brunt of harm caused by her thoughtless, careless, greedy human children. Dead meat is the fuel that powers Empire, and the resulting karmic disaster now bites all its citizens in the ass in oh so many ways. We’ve been told since birth that we need to kill and consume cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, ducks, sheep, goats, rabbits, and/or squirrels, to maintain a necessary level of protein in our diets. Whack ’em, gut ’em, skin ’em, cook ’em (optional), and eat ’em. We’ve also been instructed to drink the milk meant for calves, in its many forms, and to ingest the embryos of large birds. If you are a believer in the studies and lifework of Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, or are even mildly observant, you understand that your morbidly obese friends and neighbors (or you) are dying prematurely from meat/dairy/egg-intensive diets, in ever-increasing numbers. Heart/coronary artery disease, cancers, diabetes, dementia, Alzheimer’s, and untold other karmic paybacks are their rewards for either directly killing animals or buying their dead flesh from Safeway’s meat case, and consuming it. If Dr. Esselstyn is correct, by the time the average meat-consuming high school graduate in The U.S.A. accepts his diploma, coronary artery disease is already ravaging his body. Dead meat is the fuel that powers Empire. War is its business, and fast becoming its only business. Bombs, bullets, missiles, rockets, warships, and warplanes are its preferred delivery methods. Its young people are lured into the bloody, tangled web of death and destruction by slick-huckster, pseudo-patriotic, U.S. Military-glorifying advertising schemes. The lucky do their time, emerging with bodies largely intact, suffering only a lifetime of residual mental anguish and PTSD, souls stolen away, brains scrambled, expressionless, and aimless, demented, self-doubting heroes to the masses who cheerlead Empire’s wars. Warfare for profit drives the stock markets. In my lifetime alone: A few million dead Koreans, a few million dead Vietnamese, Cambodians, Laotians, a few million dead Afghans, Iraqis, Libyans, and Syrians, and the market values of Boeing, Exxon-Mobil, Raytheon, Halliburton, Monsanto, and Northrop Grumman soar. Billionaires, corporate executives, bankers, and politicians rake in the blood money. Combat boots leave their marks upon the faces of dead populations across the globe, as the looming shadow of Bad Karma darkens the land. Dead meat, the fuel that powers Empire, brings a tear to the eye of Mother Earth. Mega-corporate meat-growing mass-execution operations grow sentient mammals and birds in immobile squalor, pumping them full of antibiotics and growth hormones, raping (force-breeding) them, stealing their progeny and milk, unceremoniously slaughtering them, and feeding them to the masses of sick, mindless, obese humans. Filling the atmosphere with the stench of uncontained defecation and urination, and contributing more greenhouse gas emissions than all other sources combined. Crops feeding death-row, USDA-inspected, four-legged or feathered prisoners consume more water in Empire than all other uses combined, both domestic and agricultural, not to mention the associated, indiscriminate use of toxic soil-killing herbicides and pesticides connected with corporate agriculture. Dead meat. Populations of third world countries cry out for food and drinking water, but receive bombs instead. Citizens unfortunate enough to live in oil-rich lands yearn for basic needs, but find themselves to be testing grounds for Empire’s newest, state-of-the-art WMD’s. But who needs rice when you can have depleted uranium? Countries ravaged, war’s ultimate goal: death, destruction, chaos. Dead meat litters broken countrysides. Empire’s exceptional citizens stuff their fat faces full of dead meat. They watch in awestruck approval the fireworks of death, in countries they can’t find on a map, on their favorite corporate “news” channels. Meat; it’s what’s for dinner. Meat; it’s what you become if you’re not in sync with Empire’s agenda. Meat; it’s what all sentient beings are, in the eyes of those who push the buttons and pull Empire’s strings. Resources to be harvested. Meat. The U.S.A. is now ground zero for karmic disaster. A nation of zombies feeds on the flesh of dead animals, salutes, pledges allegiance to, and sings the patriotic songs of the Empire which spreads death and destruction worldwide. Few have noticed Bad Karma nibbling away at their sorry asses. Few have noticed the Fall of Empire in progress. Their national borders are prison bars, their economy in shambles, their hopes and dreams gone. When it comes to neighbors, love has been replaced by fear. More firearms than humans populate the land. Pawnshops and porn stores offer temporary solace from wretched lives of impending poverty and loveless relationships with despised partners. Self-loathing zombies cover their bodies, head to toe, with senseless colorful graffiti, squalor of the skin, ill-conceived epidermal etchings. Drug and alcohol addiction run rampant. Hungry, homeless, hopeless people beg on every street corner, while others turn a blind eye. The Police State grows like a malignant tumor across the land, but soulless faces buried in miniature electronics fail to pay heed. It would be easy to end this sordid little piece on a hopeless note, for Empire’s apparent future appears to hold little in the way of hope. If only there was someone who might have a chance of gaining enough power to turn things around, end constant warfare for profit, and bring a degree of sanity to The U.S.A. before Bad Karma brings the wrath of the rest of the world down upon us in a big and final way. Someone who would have the huevos to run for and be elected POTUS, buck the power of The C.I.A., The U.S. Military, the neocon/neolib war consortium, and Wall Street. A John F. Kennedy reincarnate. Maybe a disillusioned combat veteran who’s also a beautiful, well-spoken, and fearless U.S. Congresswoman from Hawaii. Someone who’s travelled to Syria (with Dennis Kucinich), spoken with President Assad, doubts that he was responsible for the sarin gassing of his people, and would be extremely hesitant to EVER AGAIN start another war. How about a lifelong vegetarian Hindu? President Tulsi Gabbard….hmmm. We can only hope and dream. Karmic disaster is imminent as our karmic debt comes due, but there may yet be time to bury Empire and save The U.S.A. To ignore the possibility would be to roll over and die.

Connectivity Satellite Swarms Could Eat Themselves The more satellites we launch without retiring old ones, the more there are to collide with one another. by Jamie Condliffe April 18, 2017 What goes up, may come down in pieces—and cause some trouble in the process. Recommended for You The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI Edible CRISPR Could Replace Antibiotics We Need More Alternatives to Facebook Engineering the Perfect Astronaut How to Pull Water Out of Thin Air, Even in the Driest Parts of the Globe As hardware prices and launch costs fall, there’s an increasing trend to launch swarms of satellites into space to monitor our planet and transmit data. But some academics are concerned that the rising numbers may make an existing space junk problem far worse. At the end of 2016, it was estimated that 1,459 operating satellites were in orbit around Earth. But that number looks set to rise quickly, as companies continue to launch swarms of smaller spacecraft. Earlier this year, for instance, Planet Labs popped 88 of its tiny satellites into space to photograph the planet below. That shouldn't be much of a problem, you might think. After all, each of the Planet Labs satellites is small—about the size of a backpack and around nine pounds in weight. But other organizations have grander visions. SpaceX plans to launch 4,425 satellites to blanket the planet in Internet connectivity. Samsung has described how 4,600 could enable it to do a similar job, and Boeing also wants in on the idea with a 3,000-strong fleet of its own. The prospect of these huge swarms of satellites has been keeping Hugh Lewis, from the University of Southampton in the U.K., up at night. His concern: that an increasing number of satellites in orbit increases the risk of collisions, and current rules stipulating that old satellites be brought back down within 25 years of the end of their service life won’t be enough to stop the problem from escalating out of control. Instead of simply imagining what might happen, Lewis simulated how 1,000 extra satellites in orbit might interact with each other over the coming 200 years. His supercomputer calculations, which will be presented at a European Space Agency conference this week, suggest there could be a 50 percent increase in the number of satellite collisions if existing guidelines for decommissioning are followed. Speaking to the BBC, Lewis explained the origin of the problem: What we found was that when you put the constellation satellites on to a disposal orbit, they intersect with objects below them. And if they take 25 years to pass through those lower altitudes, there is a good chance that they will have collisions with objects in the background population on the way down. But by reducing the 25 years to five years, you greatly minimise the chances of those interactions taking place. You might think that a 50 percent increase doesn’t sound like a great deal, all things considered. But as New Scientist points out, it could put us closer than ever to the long-feared Kessler syndrome: a cascade of collisons that ultimately gives rise to a space junk belt encircling Earth. That could write off many existing satellites, as well as making new launches and space exploration far more difficult than today. There have been some radical ideas for clearing the ensuing debris, including a rocket that feasts on the stuff. But Lewis has a simpler suggestion: simply enforce a five-year retirement window, rather than the current 25 years. For the sake of the satellite swarms and our Internet connections, that might be a good idea.

The 191-foot (58-meter) Atlas V lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 11:11 a.m. EDT (1511 GMT), blazing through partly cloudy skies as it headed out over the Atlantic Ocean. "It was a beautiful launch," said Vern Thorp, United Launch Alliance (ULA) commercial missions program manager. "It looks like we nailed the orbit once again."

Credit: United Launch Alliance/Jeff Spotts The cargo launch had been planned for last month, but ULA, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, delayed the mission due to an issue with the Atlas rocket's hydraulic system. "We are sorry we missed Easter, but we're pretty sure they'll be excited about their Easter baskets and whatever great things International Space Station science put on board for them," said Frank Culbertson, president of Orbital's Space Systems Group. The rocket carried a Cygnus cargo capsule loaded with more than 7,600 pounds (3,450 kilograms) of clothes, food, water, equipment and science experiments for the space station crew. For the first time, NASA, in partnership with ULA and Orbital, broadcast a live, 360-degree view of the launch on YouTube.

"You can manipulate the video on the screen, virtually placing you closer to a live rocket with a 360-degree view just a few feet away … as it's lifting off," Diller said. Tuesday's launch was the seventh under Orbital's 10-flight contract with NASA that runs through 2018 and is worth up to $3.1 billion. The U.S. space agency also buys station resupply flights from Elon Musk's SpaceX, and in 2019 will begin using Sierra Nevada Corp’'s Dream Chaser space plane. Orbital ATK's own midsize launch vehicle, Antares, returned to flight in October following an accident in 2014, but this time the company and NASA opted for a hired ride aboard ULA's beefier Atlas V, which can carry more cargo into orbit. Orbital ATK previously bought two Atlas V rides to fill the gap while Antares was retrofitted with new engines. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+. Original article on Space.com.

By Robin Seemangal • 04/18/17 11:17am Astronaut John Glenn before the historic Friendship 7 mission NASA KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FL—NASA has launched a cargo spacecraft named in honor of the first American to orbit the Earth, John Glenn. The spacecraft is headed to the International Space Station loaded with almost 4 tons of supplies for the orbiting crew. The mission lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station this morning at 11:11AM ET. The SS John Glenn is a Cygnus spacecraft built by commercial spaceflight company Orbital ATK and this is the seventh resupply service mission (dubbed OA-7)  they are facilitating for NASA. The packed vessel was launched atop an Atlas V rocket built by Lockheed Martin–Boeing joint venture, United Launch Alliance. Among the usual provisions (and a few Easter baskets) for the crew, the SS John Glenn is delivering groundbreaking science. One experiment will test how a microgravity environment could contribute to improved drug designs for patients stricken with cancer and inform on reducing costs associated with related drug development. NASA will study how objects burn up on reentry through Earth’s atmosphere to determine what materials need to be used to build future spacecraft. “The ability to predict how an object will break apart is valuable in the protection of people and property,” says NASA, who will use a RED-Data2 device to take measurements when the SS John Glenn vehicle is headed back toward Earth. Perhaps the most crucial experiment to NASA’s long-term goals is an Advanced Plant Habitat that will be used to study plant cultures aboard the International Space Station. The biological study will inform on how to increase efficiency when growing food and producing oxygen in a microgravity environment. This is a major component in NASA’s vision of long-duration human spaceflight throughout the Solar System and, specifically, toward Mars. The SS John Glenn Spacecraft before being loaded into the Atlas V fairing. Robin Seemangal “John Glenn paved the way for America’s space program, from moon missions, to the space shuttle and the International Space Station,” said Orbital ATK in a public statement. “His commitment to America’s human spaceflight program and his distinguished military and political career make him an ideal honoree for the OA-7 Mission.” On February, 20th 1962, John Glenn was launched atop an earlier version of the same Atlas rocket (and from the same location) on the historic Friendship 7 mission. The flight saw Glenn orbit the Earth three times while piloting the Mercury capsule. The former Marine fighter pilot and long-serving US Senator passed away at the age of 95 in Columbus, Ohio, late last year. Glenn was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on April 6th and was the last remaining survivor of the original seven astronauts of NASA’s Mercury program. “Senator Glenn was more than an astronaut – he was the hero we needed in a rapidly changing world and an icon of our American spirit,” said acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot in a statement. “We will never forget him, and future generations will continue to live out his legacy as we venture farther into the solar system.” The events surrounding John Glenn’s historic Friendship 7 flight were dramatized and told through the eyes of three African-American female engineers working at NASA in the film Hidden Figures. The story follows Mary Winston Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Katherine Johnson as they overcome racial and gender discrimination while working at the federal space agency. John Glenn is played by Glen Powell and is portrayed as a benevolent man who trusted the work of “human computer” Kathryn Johnson and staked his life on it. “Get the girl. If she says they’re good, then I’m ready to go,” Glenn famously said when going through the pre-flight checklist before launch. Glen Powell portrays John Glenn in the film Hidden Figures. 20th Century Fox “I always loved John Glenn. It was before our time that all of this happened but the thing that struck me the most is that he made a decision to put his life in the hands of an African-American woman,” said Hidden Figures star Octavia Spencer to the Observer. “That was not a popular decision at the time and, if you can do that, put aside your differences and believe in a person based on what they can contribute and how they contribute, man could go beyond the stars.” The SS John Glenn Cygnus spacecraft will arrive at the International Space Station about four days after this morning’s launch. It would be sooner, but the Russians are launching the Soyuz with an Expedition crew to the space station on April 20th. The SS John Glenn must wait until the crew arrives to dock with the ISS.

By Ryan Vlastelica Published: Apr 18, 2017 1:29 p.m. ET Share Some “niche” funds have posted strong results, but do they serve a broad purpose? Getty Images Examples of thematic ETFs include funds dedicated to medical marijuana, drones, whiskey, 3d printing, and online retail By RyanVlastelica Markets reporter It has become something of a joke on Wall Street: if the industry exists, there is an ETF for it. Fund issuers have been looking for ways to tap into the white-hot market for exchange-traded funds, one of the fastest-growing vehicles in the financial industry, but with major asset classes and regions already dominated by multibillion-dollar funds from major asset managers, new players are hoping to make a name for themselves by engineering niche ETFs. As a result, the market has been flooded by new “thematic” ETFs, which track a narrow sliver of the equity market, focusing on a specific subsector of a broader industry. In the past year alone, funds dedicated to wearable technology WEAR, -0.62% whiskey WSKY, -0.61%  medical marijuana HMMJ, -1.72%  health and fitness FITS, +0.67% 3D printing PRNT, +0.39% the Internet of Things SNSR, -0.23% and mobile payments IPAY, +0.32% among many others, have all been released. Check out: Would you buy a GOP ETF? You may soon get the chance “The issue isn’t that there is no place for these types of funds, but that the themes are often redundant with larger, cheaper funds, or that they don’t offer pure exposure to the theme they’re supposed to.” Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds The category is small, with most products struggling to amass much in assets or daily trading volume (Morningstar says it doesn’t track thematic funds as a category). Still, it has come under fire, with critics charging that the funds misrepresent the exposure they claim to offer, or that they serve little use to the average investor. “The problem investors have isn’t that there aren’t enough products, it’s that the products aren’t good. You don’t create 40 solutions by launching 40 funds; you just create new questions about how or if they should be used,” said Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds. “The issue isn’t that there is no place for these types of funds, but that the themes are often redundant with larger, cheaper funds, or that they don’t offer pure exposure to the theme they’re supposed to.” Do women-led companies get better returns on Wall Street?(1:36) The "SHE" ETF allows everyday people to invest in companies with strong female leadership. It is based on recent data that suggests companies with a high representation of women in the executive ranks outperform their male-dominated peers. A major complaint about thematic funds is that the industries they track are too small or ill-defined to have many public companies that work directly—and exclusively—within the “theme.” The PureFunds Drone Economy Strategy ETF IFLY, -0.05% for example, holds a number of companies that aren’t, strictly speaking, drone companies. The fund’s top 10 holdings include Boeing Co. BA, -0.65% Jabil Circuit Inc. JBL, +0.10% and Honeywell International Inc. HON, -0.28% While those companies do have products related to drones, the business segments makes up a fraction of their overall revenue. As a result, the companies likely won’t move on drone-related news or trends, meaning the fund won’t either, given their weight within it. In addition, the Drone ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.75%, more than twice the 0.35% fee of the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR, -0.12% which has many of the same top holdings, making it difficult for investors to outperform. (The fund is up 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with the 25% rise of the SPDR fund.) “We knew out of the gate that there aren’t a ton of pure-play drone technology companies. Right now you’re getting diversified aerospace companies [with the Drone ETF], because how else would you capture companies doing various things in the drone industry?” said Andrew Chanin, chief executive officer of PureFunds, which operates the fund. He added that the fund was “built towards being a pure play” offering, and that as more drone-specific companies went public, they would become components. “We knew out of the gate that there aren’t a ton of pure-play drone technology companies. Right now you’re getting diversified aerospace companies [with the Drone ETF], because how else would you capture companies doing various things in the drone industry?” Andrew Chanin, chief executive officer of PureFunds PureFunds also operates what could be the greatest success of the thematic category, the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF HACK, -0.69% which tracks cybersecurity related software companies. The fund, which coincidentally launched in the immediate aftermath of the hack of Sony, garnered massive attention and inflows, and has seen spikes in trading whenever a data breach is reported. Currently, it has nearly $1 billion in assets. Comparatively, many thematic funds struggle to reach $10 million. Read: Here’s why the ETF graveyard is getting crowded “Good thematic ETFs provide different exposure. Bad ones just slap on a buzzword and call it something different.” -Chanin What distinguishes the fund from the drone ETF, for example, is that there are dozens of companies dedicated exclusively to cyber security, with each offering different products and services within the industry. That means the fund is a pure play, but a diversified one, and one that can be reasonably expected to perform differently than the broader technology space. The Cyber Security fund is up 23% over the past 12 months, compared with the 19% gain of the Technology Select Sector SPDR XLK, -0.02% —a level of outperformance that may justify its higher fee (0.75% to 0.14%). “A niche, if it is distinct enough, will have different drivers and correlations than the overall sector, and a thematic fund can give you exposure to that niche while reducing single-company risk,” Chanin said. “Good thematic ETFs provide different exposure. Bad ones just slap on a buzzword and call it something different.” The performance of thematic funds overall depends on the components they hold and the broader economic environment. But some themes have posted dramatic results, making a strong case for looking for growth areas within sectors. The Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +0.03% for example, tracks companies that derive 70% of their revenue from online purchases. It is up more than 10% thus far this year. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, +0.38% which has a heavy weighting toward brick-and-mortar stores, a category that has been struggling, is down 4.9% over the same period (see chart below): Source: FactSet data “There needs to be a reason for the specialization—cyber security doesn’t have the same story as technology, and the outlook for online retail is much different than the one for brick and mortar,” said Christian Magoon, chief executive officer of Amplify ETFs. “A successful fund needs to have limited overlap with a broad index, it needs to reduce company-specific risk, and it needs to bring a certain characteristic that is additive to your portfolio, like higher growth or less volatility.” “I actually think the fund is interesting, and worth looking into. However, I think ETFs generally need to solve a specific problem for investors, in terms of the exposure they can provide or the strategy they can be a part of.” Matthew Hougan, chief executive officer for Inside ETFs The problem is, few funds can meet that criteria, particularly within major parts of the economy like retail. The alcohol-themed Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF WSKY, -0.61%  has been cited as a fund that, while boasting strong year-to-date performance, is more of a novelty than a strategy. “I actually think the fund is interesting, and worth looking into. However, I think ETFs generally need to solve a specific problem for investors, in terms of the exposure they can provide or the strategy they can be a part of,” said Matthew Hougan, chief executive officer for Inside ETFs. “I just don’t know what problem a fund like this solves.” More from MarketWatch Look Who's Coming With Dinner Goldman’s earnings were the most disappointing ever for investors Iraqi Christians Endure Amid Fighting, Persecution Related Topics Exchange Traded Funds Markets Investing Quote References WEAR -0.10 -0.62% WSKY -0.16 -0.61% HMMJ -0.18 -1.72% FITS +0.17 +0.67% PRNT +0.09 +0.39% SNSR -0.04 -0.23% IPAY +0.09 +0.32% IFLY -0.01 -0.05% BA -1.17 -0.65% JBL +0.03 +0.10% HON -0.35 -0.28% XAR -0.08 -0.12% HACK -0.20 -0.69% XLK -0.01 -0.02% IBUY +0.01 +0.03% XRT +0.16 +0.38% Show all references Most Popular Ossoff appears unlikely to win Georgia House seat outright, forcing runoff This is why people are declining your wedding invitations Americans get an ‘F’ on income tax quiz To improve your productivity, paint your office this color (it’s scientifically proven) Richard Thaler: Here's the best investing strategy Data Provided By Today's Interest Rates Mortgage Equity Savings Auto Credit Cards 30 yr fixed Jumbo 4.38% 30 yr fixed 3.84% 15 yr fixed 3.03% 10 yr fixed 2.83% 30 yr fixed refi 3.83% 15 yr fixed refi 3.03% 5/1 ARM 3.16% 5/1 ARM refi 3.34% National averages from Bankrate.com $30K HELOC 4.83% $50K HELOC 4.87% $75K HELOC 4.87% $100K HELOC 4.59% $30K Home Equity Loan 4.68% $50K Home Equity Loan 4.34% $75K Home Equity Loan 4.31% $100K Home Equity Loan 4.23% National averages from Bankrate.com 5 yr CD 1.3% 2 yr CD 0.78% 1 yr CD 0.62% MMA $10K+ 0.25% MMA $50K+ 0.39% MMA Savings 0.32% MMA Savings Jumbo 0.4% National averages from Bankrate.com 60 Mo Used Car 3.1% 48 Mo Used Car 3.08% 36 Mo Used Car 3.34% 72 Mo New Car 2.98% 60 Mo New Car 3.35% 48 Mo New Car 3.21% 60 Mo Auto Refi 2.89% 36 Mo Auto Refi 2.64% National averages from Bankrate.com Avg.

By Ryan Vlastelica Published: Apr 18, 2017 1:29 p.m. ET Share Some “niche” funds have posted strong results, but do they serve a broad purpose? Getty Images Examples of thematic ETFs include funds dedicated to medical marijuana, drones, whiskey, 3d printing, and online retail By RyanVlastelica Markets reporter It has become something of a joke on Wall Street: if the industry exists, there is an ETF for it. Fund issuers have been looking for ways to tap into the white-hot market for exchange-traded funds, one of the fastest-growing vehicles in the financial industry, but with major asset classes and regions already dominated by multibillion-dollar funds from major asset managers, new players are hoping to make a name for themselves by engineering niche ETFs. As a result, the market has been flooded by new “thematic” ETFs, which track a narrow sliver of the equity market, focusing on a specific subsector of a broader industry. In the past year alone, funds dedicated to wearable technology WEAR, -0.62% whiskey WSKY, -0.61%  medical marijuana HMMJ, -1.72%  health and fitness FITS, +0.67% 3D printing PRNT, +0.39% the Internet of Things SNSR, -0.23% and mobile payments IPAY, +0.32% among many others, have all been released. Check out: Would you buy a GOP ETF? You may soon get the chance “The issue isn’t that there is no place for these types of funds, but that the themes are often redundant with larger, cheaper funds, or that they don’t offer pure exposure to the theme they’re supposed to.” Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds The category is small, with most products struggling to amass much in assets or daily trading volume (Morningstar says it doesn’t track thematic funds as a category). Still, it has come under fire, with critics charging that the funds misrepresent the exposure they claim to offer, or that they serve little use to the average investor. “The problem investors have isn’t that there aren’t enough products, it’s that the products aren’t good. You don’t create 40 solutions by launching 40 funds; you just create new questions about how or if they should be used,” said Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds. “The issue isn’t that there is no place for these types of funds, but that the themes are often redundant with larger, cheaper funds, or that they don’t offer pure exposure to the theme they’re supposed to.” Do women-led companies get better returns on Wall Street?(1:36) The "SHE" ETF allows everyday people to invest in companies with strong female leadership. It is based on recent data that suggests companies with a high representation of women in the executive ranks outperform their male-dominated peers. A major complaint about thematic funds is that the industries they track are too small or ill-defined to have many public companies that work directly—and exclusively—within the “theme.” The PureFunds Drone Economy Strategy ETF IFLY, -0.05% for example, holds a number of companies that aren’t, strictly speaking, drone companies. The fund’s top 10 holdings include Boeing Co. BA, -0.65% Jabil Circuit Inc. JBL, +0.10% and Honeywell International Inc. HON, -0.28% While those companies do have products related to drones, the business segments makes up a fraction of their overall revenue. As a result, the companies likely won’t move on drone-related news or trends, meaning the fund won’t either, given their weight within it. In addition, the Drone ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.75%, more than twice the 0.35% fee of the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR, -0.12% which has many of the same top holdings, making it difficult for investors to outperform. (The fund is up 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with the 25% rise of the SPDR fund.) “We knew out of the gate that there aren’t a ton of pure-play drone technology companies. Right now you’re getting diversified aerospace companies [with the Drone ETF], because how else would you capture companies doing various things in the drone industry?” said Andrew Chanin, chief executive officer of PureFunds, which operates the fund. He added that the fund was “built towards being a pure play” offering, and that as more drone-specific companies went public, they would become components. “We knew out of the gate that there aren’t a ton of pure-play drone technology companies. Right now you’re getting diversified aerospace companies [with the Drone ETF], because how else would you capture companies doing various things in the drone industry?” Andrew Chanin, chief executive officer of PureFunds PureFunds also operates what could be the greatest success of the thematic category, the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF HACK, -0.69% which tracks cybersecurity related software companies. The fund, which coincidentally launched in the immediate aftermath of the hack of Sony, garnered massive attention and inflows, and has seen spikes in trading whenever a data breach is reported. Currently, it has nearly $1 billion in assets. Comparatively, many thematic funds struggle to reach $10 million. Read: Here’s why the ETF graveyard is getting crowded “Good thematic ETFs provide different exposure. Bad ones just slap on a buzzword and call it something different.” -Chanin What distinguishes the fund from the drone ETF, for example, is that there are dozens of companies dedicated exclusively to cyber security, with each offering different products and services within the industry. That means the fund is a pure play, but a diversified one, and one that can be reasonably expected to perform differently than the broader technology space. The Cyber Security fund is up 23% over the past 12 months, compared with the 19% gain of the Technology Select Sector SPDR XLK, -0.02% —a level of outperformance that may justify its higher fee (0.75% to 0.14%). “A niche, if it is distinct enough, will have different drivers and correlations than the overall sector, and a thematic fund can give you exposure to that niche while reducing single-company risk,” Chanin said. “Good thematic ETFs provide different exposure. Bad ones just slap on a buzzword and call it something different.” The performance of thematic funds overall depends on the components they hold and the broader economic environment. But some themes have posted dramatic results, making a strong case for looking for growth areas within sectors. The Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +0.03% for example, tracks companies that derive 70% of their revenue from online purchases. It is up more than 10% thus far this year. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, +0.38% which has a heavy weighting toward brick-and-mortar stores, a category that has been struggling, is down 4.9% over the same period (see chart below): Source: FactSet data “There needs to be a reason for the specialization—cyber security doesn’t have the same story as technology, and the outlook for online retail is much different than the one for brick and mortar,” said Christian Magoon, chief executive officer of Amplify ETFs. “A successful fund needs to have limited overlap with a broad index, it needs to reduce company-specific risk, and it needs to bring a certain characteristic that is additive to your portfolio, like higher growth or less volatility.” “I actually think the fund is interesting, and worth looking into. However, I think ETFs generally need to solve a specific problem for investors, in terms of the exposure they can provide or the strategy they can be a part of.” Matthew Hougan, chief executive officer for Inside ETFs The problem is, few funds can meet that criteria, particularly within major parts of the economy like retail. The alcohol-themed Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF WSKY, -0.61%  has been cited as a fund that, while boasting strong year-to-date performance, is more of a novelty than a strategy. “I actually think the fund is interesting, and worth looking into. However, I think ETFs generally need to solve a specific problem for investors, in terms of the exposure they can provide or the strategy they can be a part of,” said Matthew Hougan, chief executive officer for Inside ETFs. “I just don’t know what problem a fund like this solves.” More from MarketWatch To improve your productivity, paint your office this color (it’s scientifically proven) China leads broad declines in Asian markets Chinese Online Celebrities Go Under The Knife for Success Related Topics Exchange Traded Funds Markets Investing Quote References WEAR -0.10 -0.62% WSKY -0.16 -0.61% HMMJ -0.18 -1.72% FITS +0.17 +0.67% PRNT +0.09 +0.39% SNSR -0.04 -0.23% IPAY +0.09 +0.32% IFLY -0.01 -0.05% BA -1.17 -0.65% JBL +0.03 +0.10% HON -0.35 -0.28% XAR -0.08 -0.12% HACK -0.20 -0.69% XLK -0.01 -0.02% IBUY +0.01 +0.03% XRT +0.16 +0.38% Show all references Most Popular Ossoff appears unlikely to win Georgia House seat outright, forcing runoff This is why people are declining your wedding invitations Americans get an ‘F’ on income tax quiz To improve your productivity, paint your office this color (it’s scientifically proven) Richard Thaler: Here's the best investing strategy Data Provided By Today's Interest Rates Mortgage Equity Savings Auto Credit Cards 30 yr fixed Jumbo 4.38% 30 yr fixed 3.84% 15 yr fixed 3.03% 10 yr fixed 2.83% 30 yr fixed refi 3.83% 15 yr fixed refi 3.03% 5/1 ARM 3.16% 5/1 ARM refi 3.34% National averages from Bankrate.com $30K HELOC 4.83% $50K HELOC 4.87% $75K HELOC 4.87% $100K HELOC 4.59% $30K Home Equity Loan 4.68% $50K Home Equity Loan 4.34% $75K Home Equity Loan 4.31% $100K Home Equity Loan 4.23% National averages from Bankrate.com 5 yr CD 1.3% 2 yr CD 0.78% 1 yr CD 0.62% MMA $10K+ 0.25% MMA $50K+ 0.39% MMA Savings 0.32% MMA Savings Jumbo 0.4% National averages from Bankrate.com 60 Mo Used Car 3.1% 48 Mo Used Car 3.08% 36 Mo Used Car 3.34% 72 Mo New Car 2.98% 60 Mo New Car 3.35% 48 Mo New Car 3.21% 60 Mo Auto Refi 2.89% 36 Mo Auto Refi 2.64% National averages from Bankrate.com Avg.

You don’t create 40 solutions by launching 40 funds; you just create new questions about how or if they should be used,” said Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds. “The issue isn’t that there is no place for these types of funds, but that the themes are often redundant with larger, cheaper funds, or that they don’t offer pure exposure to the theme they’re supposed to.” Do women-led companies get better returns on Wall Street?(1:36) The "SHE" ETF allows everyday people to invest in companies with strong female leadership. It is based on recent data that suggests companies with a high representation of women in the executive ranks outperform their male-dominated peers. A major complaint about thematic funds is that the industries they track are too small or ill-defined to have many public companies that work directly—and exclusively—within the “theme.” The PureFunds Drone Economy Strategy ETF IFLY, -0.05% for example, holds a number of companies that aren’t, strictly speaking, drone companies. The fund’s top 10 holdings include Boeing Co. BA, -0.65% Jabil Circuit Inc. JBL, +0.10% and Honeywell International Inc. HON, -0.28% While those companies do have products related to drones, the business segments makes up a fraction of their overall revenue. As a result, the companies likely won’t move on drone-related news or trends, meaning the fund won’t either, given their weight within it. In addition, the Drone ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.75%, more than twice the 0.35% fee of the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR, -0.12% which has many of the same top holdings, making it difficult for investors to outperform. (The fund is up 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with the 25% rise of the SPDR fund.) “We knew out of the gate that there aren’t a ton of pure-play drone technology companies. Right now you’re getting diversified aerospace companies [with the Drone ETF], because how else would you capture companies doing various things in the drone industry?” said Andrew Chanin, chief executive officer of PureFunds, which operates the fund. He added that the fund was “built towards being a pure play” offering, and that as more drone-specific companies went public, they would become components. “We knew out of the gate that there aren’t a ton of pure-play drone technology companies. Right now you’re getting diversified aerospace companies [with the Drone ETF], because how else would you capture companies doing various things in the drone industry?” Andrew Chanin, chief executive officer of PureFunds PureFunds also operates what could be the greatest success of the thematic category, the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF HACK, -0.69% which tracks cybersecurity related software companies. The fund, which coincidentally launched in the immediate aftermath of the hack of Sony, garnered massive attention and inflows, and has seen spikes in trading whenever a data breach is reported. Currently, it has nearly $1 billion in assets. Comparatively, many thematic funds struggle to reach $10 million. Read: Here’s why the ETF graveyard is getting crowded “Good thematic ETFs provide different exposure. Bad ones just slap on a buzzword and call it something different.” -Chanin What distinguishes the fund from the drone ETF, for example, is that there are dozens of companies dedicated exclusively to cyber security, with each offering different products and services within the industry. That means the fund is a pure play, but a diversified one, and one that can be reasonably expected to perform differently than the broader technology space. The Cyber Security fund is up 23% over the past 12 months, compared with the 19% gain of the Technology Select Sector SPDR XLK, -0.02% —a level of outperformance that may justify its higher fee (0.75% to 0.14%). “A niche, if it is distinct enough, will have different drivers and correlations than the overall sector, and a thematic fund can give you exposure to that niche while reducing single-company risk,” Chanin said. “Good thematic ETFs provide different exposure. Bad ones just slap on a buzzword and call it something different.” The performance of thematic funds overall depends on the components they hold and the broader economic environment. But some themes have posted dramatic results, making a strong case for looking for growth areas within sectors. The Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUY, +0.03% for example, tracks companies that derive 70% of their revenue from online purchases. It is up more than 10% thus far this year. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, +0.38% which has a heavy weighting toward brick-and-mortar stores, a category that has been struggling, is down 4.9% over the same period (see chart below): Source: FactSet data “There needs to be a reason for the specialization—cyber security doesn’t have the same story as technology, and the outlook for online retail is much different than the one for brick and mortar,” said Christian Magoon, chief executive officer of Amplify ETFs. “A successful fund needs to have limited overlap with a broad index, it needs to reduce company-specific risk, and it needs to bring a certain characteristic that is additive to your portfolio, like higher growth or less volatility.” “I actually think the fund is interesting, and worth looking into. However, I think ETFs generally need to solve a specific problem for investors, in terms of the exposure they can provide or the strategy they can be a part of.” Matthew Hougan, chief executive officer for Inside ETFs The problem is, few funds can meet that criteria, particularly within major parts of the economy like retail. The alcohol-themed Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF WSKY, -0.61%  has been cited as a fund that, while boasting strong year-to-date performance, is more of a novelty than a strategy. “I actually think the fund is interesting, and worth looking into. However, I think ETFs generally need to solve a specific problem for investors, in terms of the exposure they can provide or the strategy they can be a part of,” said Matthew Hougan, chief executive officer for Inside ETFs. “I just don’t know what problem a fund like this solves.” More from MarketWatch Trump Sees North Korea as Top Threat Look Who's Coming With Dinner Ossoff appears unlikely to win Georgia House seat outright, forcing runoff Related Topics Exchange Traded Funds Markets Investing Quote References WEAR -0.10 -0.62% WSKY -0.16 -0.61% HMMJ -0.18 -1.72% FITS +0.17 +0.67% PRNT +0.09 +0.39% SNSR -0.04 -0.23% IPAY +0.09 +0.32% IFLY -0.01 -0.05% BA -1.17 -0.65% JBL +0.03 +0.10% HON -0.35 -0.28% XAR -0.08 -0.12% HACK -0.20 -0.69% XLK -0.01 -0.02% IBUY +0.01 +0.03% XRT +0.16 +0.38% Show all references Most Popular Ossoff appears unlikely to win Georgia House seat outright, forcing runoff This is why people are declining your wedding invitations Americans get an ‘F’ on income tax quiz To improve your productivity, paint your office this color (it’s scientifically proven) Richard Thaler: Here's the best investing strategy Data Provided By Today's Interest Rates Mortgage Equity Savings Auto Credit Cards 30 yr fixed Jumbo 4.38% 30 yr fixed 3.84% 15 yr fixed 3.03% 10 yr fixed 2.83% 30 yr fixed refi 3.83% 15 yr fixed refi 3.03% 5/1 ARM 3.16% 5/1 ARM refi 3.34% National averages from Bankrate.com $30K HELOC 4.83% $50K HELOC 4.87% $75K HELOC 4.87% $100K HELOC 4.59% $30K Home Equity Loan 4.68% $50K Home Equity Loan 4.34% $75K Home Equity Loan 4.31% $100K Home Equity Loan 4.23% National averages from Bankrate.com 5 yr CD 1.3% 2 yr CD 0.78% 1 yr CD 0.62% MMA $10K+ 0.25% MMA $50K+ 0.39% MMA Savings 0.32% MMA Savings Jumbo 0.4% National averages from Bankrate.com 60 Mo Used Car 3.1% 48 Mo Used Car 3.08% 36 Mo Used Car 3.34% 72 Mo New Car 2.98% 60 Mo New Car 3.35% 48 Mo New Car 3.21% 60 Mo Auto Refi 2.89% 36 Mo Auto Refi 2.64% National averages from Bankrate.com Avg.

Vey Fellow and Co-Director - Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Initiative on Innovation and Placemaking Twitter jvey1 Meg Walker Senior Vice President - Project for Public Spaces The implications of this new competitive landscape for Oklahoma City are significant. Two of the region’s largest economic clusters—energy and health care—are undergoing substantial disruption.  The expansion of North American natural gas has opened the energy economy to new players. In health care, life science breakthroughs are coupling with information technology in areas like personalized medicine and health IT to redefine the care continuum, creating wide openings for technology and life science capitals like Austin, Texas; Boston; and San Francisco. Yet as crosscutting technologies—from “big data” to sensing—expand the competitive playing field in industries critical to Oklahoma City, they also create unprecedented opportunity for the region to vault ahead of its peers. This great leap will not happen spontaneously, however.  To leverage advantages in health, energy, and other sectors, Oklahoma City’s public and private leaders need to take action to improve joint industry-relevant research; grow, attract, and retain new technology companies; and ensure that the workforce is prepared for future jobs.  They need to invest in creating dynamic, high-quality places where research institutions, firms, and talent concentrate and connect.  And they need to nurture the talents and potential of low-income residents, who, if history is any lesson, will otherwise remain disconnected from the innovation economy’s growth. Related Content Cities & Regions The Rise of Innovation Districts Bruce Katz and Julie Wagner Monday, June 9, 2014 The Oklahoma City metropolitan area has long-standing industry strengths and assets on which to build a new convergence economy. The region dominates in oil and gas extraction, and it is becoming a global center for advanced energy technology, evidenced by the recent opening of the General Electric (GE) Global Research Oil & Gas Technology Center.  Outside of energy, the region has economic strengths in aerospace engineering, led by Tinker Air Force Base, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, and in health care, driven by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), and several private-sector firms, including COARE Biotechnology, Charlesson, and Selexys. The new GE facility and these health care assets largely concentrate in Oklahoma City’s emerging innovation district.  Bounded roughly by Robinson and Lottie Avenues to the west and east and 4th and 13th Streets to the south and north, this 1.3-square-mile area encompasses both the Oklahoma Health Center and the vibrant commercial corridor of Automobile Alley.  A significant center of job growth, the district reflects the shifting geography of the global economy and the emergence of dense hubs of economic activity where innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and placemaking intersect. With the right investments, the Oklahoma City innovation district has the potential to become a major center of gravity for innovation and economic development in Oklahoma City. With the right investments, the Oklahoma City innovation district has the potential to become a major center of gravity for innovation and economic development in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City’s innovation district is already a vital part of the region’s innovation economy.  Over 18,000 people work in the area, almost 5 percent of the city’s total. Its cluster of medical and research institutions attracts three-quarters of the project dollars the state receives from the National Institutes of Health, and its improved commercialization outcomes, coupled with the presence of business support organizations like i2E, position it to become the region’s hub of entrepreneurial activity.  Furthermore, the district’s proximity to downtown—which is home to several major energy company headquarters—and other areas of growth give it a powerful locational advantage.  Though only about 1,200 people live within the district itself, the neighborhoods to the west and south, such as Bricktown and Deep Deuce, have enjoyed a noticeable uptick in housing values, development, and amenities. For all its strengths, however, the district yet to tap its full potential, and it faces a number of challenges in terms of innovation, place, and inclusion: Innovation challenges: A historically medical-centric area, the district has neither the density nor diversity of institutions, firms, startup companies, and innovations spaces that many of its peers possess. And while many of the area’s health care and energy institutions and firms are physically close to one another, few organizing structures exist to strategically connect these industries—to one another and to other regional assets in Norman and elsewhere—around common technology platforms. Place-related challenges: The district’s car-centric physical layout and lack of gathering spaces hinder companies and workers from taking advantage of their proximity to interact, exchange ideas, and build collaborative networks.  Meanwhile, limited walkability in and around the district makes the more amenity-rich areas nearby feel further away than they actually area. Such place-related drawbacks may impede the ability of district firms and institutions to attract young talent. Inclusion challenges: Though well-paying jobs exist in the district for workers with varying education and skill levels—roughly 55 percent of district jobs do not require a four-year degree—the low-income residents of neighboring communities remain largely disconnected from employment within the district. Oklahoma City’s innovation district concentrates innovation and technology assets that could propel the region into global prominence within a range of converging technologies, particularly those related to health and energy. Oklahoma City’s innovation district concentrates innovation and technology assets that could propel the region into global prominence within a range of converging technologies, particularly those related to health and energy.  But reaching this potential will require that district and Oklahoma City leaders address the area’s challenges and collectively define and support a new vision and set of strategies to create a dynamic, inclusive hub of innovative and entrepreneurial activity. To this end, this report recommends four multifaceted strategies around which innovation district anchor institutions, firms, and civic leaders should rally city and regional stakeholders to engage with their time, expertise, and resources: Establish an Oklahoma Center for Energy and Health Collaboration that serves as the physical and programmatic umbrella for innovation and applied research within these and other sectors. The center would be a staged, multitiered initiative that supports the collaboration between prominent but currently disjoined economic clusters, beginning with energy and health care and eventually expanding to other clusters such as aerospace. The district should become the central hub of collaboration by securing space for the new center and attracting strategic partners, including corporate anchors, faculty from external universities, and entrepreneurs. The center should also house a translational research and commercialization office for crosscutting industry applications of research. The new center would likely be initially funded and operated by the overarching governance structure of the district, but eventually—as regional energy companies and universities outside the district begin to partner with the center on translational research—a coalition of internal and external organizations should emerge to help set the center’s agenda and direction. Implement a technology-based economic development and entrepreneurship effort within the innovation district specifically tasked with overseeing strategic business development, technology business attraction, marketing, and regional cluster development between entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized enterprises, and large firms. This new effort should serve as a conduit between market-oriented entities in the district like i2E, which works with entrepreneurs, researchers, and companies to help them commercialize their technologies and grow new businesses.  Finally, an innovation district seed fund and tailored accelerator would go a long way toward helping research entrepreneurs access early-stage capital for prototyping and market testing. This effort likely does not require a new institution. Instead, existing organizations could coordinate and be tasked and resourced to focus on economic development and entrepreneurship activity within the district. Create a denser, more active, and better-connected mixed-use urban environment in and around the innovation district, an essential complement to the actions recommended above to build a collaborative network among institutions and companies to spark innovation and firm development. To do so leaders should undertake new land use and real estate development efforts that will provide the types of commercial and residential uses, whether in new infill development or in existing buildings, that will lead to a more vibrant, sociable, and around-the-clock district environment; implement new placemaking efforts such as lectures, networking activities, food events and festivals, outdoor performances, recreational activities, health fairs, and opportunities for outdoor play; strengthen connections between the Health Center and Automobile Alley via new landscaping, lighting, and other pedestrian improvements on NE 10th and NE 13th Streets and on the bridges over Interstate 235, and by new development along 10th Street; improve bike and pedestrian routes within the Health Center to allow for easier access between parking lots and workplaces and between workplaces and new destinations (such as programmed public spaces); and make the innovation district more porous and connected to residential neighborhoods. Form a standing committee on diversity and inclusion charged with overseeing the design of strategies aimed at forging better economic, social, and physical connections between the innovation district and the underserved communities surrounding it. The committee would comprise and/or work more broadly with representatives from the district’s institutional and private-sector stakeholders; education providers such as Oklahoma City Public Schools, local community colleges, and technology (CareerTech) centers; area workforce entities; and the nonprofit community, including neighborhood groups.  The committee would focus on issue areas like education, workforce development, entrepreneurship, and placemaking/neighborhood development; guide and oversee goal and strategy development; and serve as a liaison between parties to facilitate alignment and coordination of efforts.  The committee would also evaluate proposals and make funding recommendations. Finally—and as called for in the Oklahoma Regional Innovation District Project Plan—district leaders need to establish a new type of governance entity that gives voice to the district’s narrative, defines what the district should aspire to become, and works with other area stakeholders to determine what innovation, place, and inclusion strategies it needs to employ as a unified place so as to have maximum collective impact on the city and region. Whether Oklahoma stakeholders decide to create a new organization or repurpose an existing one, they have a chance to be trailblazers in establishing an entity that has a singular focus on the district and undertakes all the responsibilities that task entails. Such an entity does not need an army of dedicated staff, but it must have: an executive director who understands the innovation ecosystem and has the ability to coordinate actors both within and outside of the district around defined goals and strategies; a leadership structure (a board or steering committee) with the influence and authority to rally critical stakeholders and guide district efforts; discrete committees (e.g., on diversity and inclusion) and/or standalone initiatives (e.g., the Oklahoma Center for Energy and Health Collaboration) that will develop and drive key strategies; the staff capacity needed to support and coordinate the board, committees, and initiatives; interact with district and non-district stakeholders (including regional industry leaders, local government, the Urban Renewal Authority, neighborhood organizations, etc.); develop, implement, and align district-wide programs, land use planning, and placemaking activities; and raise funds. Most importantly, this entity requires a strong innovation team (or at minimum a high-level leader) that sits between institutions and can catalyze a shared vision that holds a strong value proposition for each individual actor. Fulfilling this role will require a scientific understanding of the research portfolio and the ability to identify external partners, market opportunities, and funding opportunities. Oklahoma City is poised to organize itself to be a fierce competitor in the innovation economy and to build a stronger regional economy as a result—if it has the vision and will to do so.  The city has demonstrated its capacity to coalesce around bold ambitions before, rallying to build the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, investing in its downtown, and passing multiple rounds of the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS) initiative to finance major redevelopment, infrastructure, and school improvements.  It is again time to channel that collective spirit to grow a more inventive, entrepreneurial, and inclusive Oklahoma City economy.

Use These Financial Strategies to Come Out on Top Executives navigating layoffs and buyouts have some critical decisions to make. Here's what they need to consider. iStockphoto By Lisa Brown, CFP® | Brightworth April 2017 Contact Me A large number of Fortune 500 companies have recently announced layoffs — from Disney’s ESPN unit to PepsiCo to General Motors. Even educational institutions like The University of California-San Francisco are making cuts. Most of these are involuntary layoffs, meaning positions are cut and people are likely to lose their jobs. Voluntary layoffs, where employees can choose to take a buyout, have also been announced at other major employers, such as Boeing and Fidelity Investments. SEE ALSO: Which Career Path Are You On? Your Retirement Strategy Depends On Learning that your job has been eliminated is an incredibly stressful moment. On top of that news, many people need to make major decisions involving their money in a short period, such as whether to try to find another job at that company or take the severance package. These decisions can be overwhelming for the most seasoned executive. Once a person has been informed that their job is gone, the first step is to take a deep breath and clear your head. It’s natural to be angry or feel resentment for a few days. But it’s important to focus on the future, read the details of your severance package and run the numbers. I’ve worked with several corporate executives who have lost their high-paying jobs and to help ease the financial burden, I suggest the following three-step decision-making process. Advertisement Step One: Determine the length of time that you will be able to pay your bills and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I start by calculating the amount of money in the executive’s nest egg and the severance benefits they’ll walk away with. My analysis includes answering these questions: After taxes, how long can the person live from the cash in their bank account plus their severance check? How much savings is in their retirement accounts? What funds can be tapped without major tax consequences if money is needed in the next few years? Do we need to restructure the executive’s financial portfolio to boost cash and other liquid assets? What are the debt payments due and other fixed monthly expenses? Are there areas where spending can be reduced? Step Two: Take a mid- to long-term view of your financial plan. These questions include: Is there enough money saved to retire today when the severance pay is included? If not, how much must they earn in a new job? And how much longer do they need to work to meet their retirement goal? What other financial obligations are still outstanding? Do they need to pay for a child’s college education or plan for long-term care needs? Is moving to a new job in a different state likely? Laws governing income and estate taxes vary by state, so determine how your income will be affected and update your will. Step Three: Make key time-sensitive financial decisions about leaving the company. Severance strategy. A number of executives receive six-figure severance packages, so how should they spend, save and invest these funds? While this money may feel like a windfall, it’s a great opportunity to boost their progress toward retirement or college savings goals. Next, be sure there is enough money in the emergency fund; if a person needs to find another job, they should consider having at least 12 months of living expenses in cash. Company stock. For many executives, stock options and restricted stock grants in their former company are their largest assets, so it’s important to develop a plan for how much stock to keep or cash in. A guideline I use is to have enough diversified assets outside of company stock so their core lifestyle can be funded for the rest of their lives without the risk of owning too much in one single stock. The taxes owed on any grants cashed in may be considerable, so speak with a tax adviser before making this decision. 401(k) savings. These funds can be left with the executive’s former company, rolled into a new employer’s plan or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). For anyone who leaves their company between the ages 55 and 59½, consider leaving part of your 401(k) plan intact if you think you may need to tap this money soon, because the IRS lets those departing workers make early withdrawals without subjecting them to the usual 10% penalty. And if there is after-tax money in your 401(k) plan, you may be able to roll over part of your 401(k) into a Roth IRA, which can provide income-tax free withdrawals during retirement Pension. If your former employer still offers a traditional pension plan, whether you take a lump sum or a monthly annuity could be the most important decision you ever make regarding your retirement. Everyone has different needs, but most people who are married, in good health and between 55 and 65 choose the monthly annuity. Those with significant assets or other company pensions, are going back to work for several years, or have major health issues may want to roll the lump sum into an IRA, deferring the taxes.

Yet, prisons not only employ labour but also cast a shadow on the labour force in or out of work. The early labour movement considered the then prevalent use of prison labour for commercial purposes as unfair competition. By the 1930s, the U.S. labour movement was strong enough to have work for commercial purposes prohibited in prisons. In the decades following, the number of prisoners decreased to a historic minimum. But with cutbacks in the welfare state, the prison population exploded from about 200,000 in 1975 to 2,300,000 in 2013 (Scherrer and Shah, 2017: 37) and prison labour for commercial purposes became legal again. Today, about 15% of the inmates in federal and state prisons perform work for companies such as Boeing, Starbucks and Victoria’s Secret. Migrants detained for violating immigration laws are one of the fastest growing segments of prison labour. Under the Trump administration, their numbers are most likely to increase. Using the example of the U.S., we will discuss drivers of the return of commercial prison labour. Neoliberalism: From Mass Incarceration to Commercial Exploitation The drastic expansion of the penal state was driven especially by the widening of statutory offences for non-violent delicts – such as drug abuse or public urination – and increased minimum penalties. The conservative administrations’ ‘war against drugs’ reveals the racist dimensions of the mass incarceration. The people imprisoned because of substance abuse did not at all reflect the actual proportions of drug consumers. Whereas the Afro-American population constitutes only 13% of drug consumers, roughly corresponding to their demographic weight, they represent three quarters of all those who were imprisoned because of drug-related offenses (Wacquant, 2009: 61). The transition toward a penal state is closely linked to cuts in state welfare spending. The U.S. prison population is especially large in U.S. states with traditionally lower social security benefits or with big cuts to the social security net (Beckett and Western, 2001). While social programmes aim at social peace, the objective of prisons is disciplining. The prison is an expression of ‘social disapproval’ toward groups with little success in the labour market. It degrades them morally as well as factually to second-class citizens (Alexander 2010: 208). To date, more than 6 million people in the U.S. have lost their right to vote due to a police record. The deterrent, disciplining moment of this policy of mass incarceration lies in demonstrating the lack of alternatives to precarious work and living conditions, which cannot be circumvented either by hanging around in the streets or by profitable illegal deals such as drug trafficking. Those who resist the discipline of the work society have to expect prison. The consistent disciplining of ‘superfluous workers’ (Gans, 2012) through mass imprisonment resulted in a steep rise in expenditure on security and prisons. In addition to overcrowding, opportunities for training and rehabilitation were cut to reduce costs. From there it was only a small step to propose using prisoners’ labour power as a source of income. The discourse on financing prisons and detainees moved from ‘public assistance’ to ‘self-financing’. Under neoliberalism, detention itself is becoming a self-inflicted penalty for which the prisoner and the prisoner’s relatives literally have to pay: processing charges for visits, rents for beds, and co-financing for medical care. In many cases, prisoners are released with bills for prison services of several thousand dollars (Levingston, 2007). By the late 1970s, federal and state legislation provided legal frameworks for private companies to contract with public prisons to exploit inmates’ labour. Work programmes at the federal level are rather transparent and trade unions as well as local companies are consulted, but state run programs overall employ a much higher share of inmates under undisclosed and highly exploitative conditions. In past decades, a patchwork of decentralized governmental, profit-oriented prison industries has developed. In Colorado, for instance, about 1,600 prisoners were employed in 37 different industrial sites in 2014 (Scherrer and Shah, 2017: 41). That was approximately 15% of the prison population able to work. Production ranges from manufacture of furniture and dairy products to services such as car repair or landscape gardening. Workers received an average daily wage of $3.95 (U.S.) in 2014. Thus the hourly wage, assuming a four-hour working day, remains under $1 (Scherrer and Shah, 2017: 41). The commercial exploitation of prison labour, although growing, only affects parts of the prison population. The majority of prisoners work on the preservation of the prison itself – for example in the laundry, the kitchen or food distribution. Without this work, the system of mass incarceration would hardly be operable, financially as well as organizationally. Private Profiting from Migration The privatization of prisons proceeded in parallel to the recommodification of prison labour. The private prison sector now guards about one tenth of all prisoners. Government agencies pay private companies per prisoner. Unsurprisingly, privatization has not resulted in savings for tax payers despite the paring down of personnel, declining wages and lower fringe benefits – circumstances which have been criticized by trade unions for years. Migration in particular has developed into a profitable branch for private companies. Mandatory detention for migration offences, which was introduced in 1996, resulted in a rapid expansion of deportation centres. By 2011, the daily average population of 32,000 detainees were kept in more than 200 detention centres. Just less than one tenth of all prisoners serve time in private prisons, but 40% of all immigration detention prisons in the U.S. are privately operated. Two major corporations – CoreCivic and the GEO group – provide one third of detention centre capacity. In 2012, these two companies concluded contracts worth $738-million (U.S.) with federal authorities for detention jails. The government pays for the prisoners as long as the companies meet a minimum quota (34,000 detainees at any moment, since 2013). Thus there is an incentive to detain as many people as possible, for as long as possible. Information about the working conditions in immigration detention prisons are provided solely by newspaper reports. Repeatedly, cases have emerged where migrants were forced to work without payment. About 60,000 migrants are estimated to be working in ‘voluntary’ labour programmes for a daily wage of less than $1 in privately and publicly operated institutions (Urbina 2014). Overcoming Exploitative Prison Labour Changes in prison labour practices might be brought about by the inmates themselves. Recently, several attempts at organizing have been reported. In September 2016, the Formerly Incarcerated, Convicted People and Families Movement (FICPFM) and the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) hosted a conference on mass incarceration and exploitation of prison labour. At the same time, prisoners required to work went on strike in a number of prisons. Unfortunately, they failed to get the topic of prison labour on to the agenda of the presidential elections. The media mostly ignored the strikes. In August 2016, the Department of Justice announced that it would end the use of private contractors to run its federal prisons after a report by its independent inspector-general highlighted massive safety and security problems in private prisons. Civil rights activists hailed the decision and already foresaw the end of an era. Less than half a year later, the Trump administration instructed the Department of Homeland Security to “take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico” (Hamilton 2017). The decision placed $40-billion (U.S.) for the fiscal year 2017 into the service of privately operated detention centres. Within hours, the stock prices of GEO Group and CoreCivic soared. Trump’s victory is likely to intensify the corporate takeover of prisons, exploitation of inmates’ labour, and profiting from criminalizing migration. These policies will also cast a shadow on labour: their disciplining force will be felt by marginalized segments of the labour force, and their dividing powers by organized labour. Therefore it is vital to join forces against neoliberalism, racial oppression, immigrant baiting and mass incarceration. Labour’s role should be to foster solidarity amongst social movements involved in these struggles. Christoph Scherrer is Professor for Globalization and Politics at University of Kassel, Germany.

The resolution calls for the University of Wisconsin to break ties with 20 companies that conduct business in Israel, the U.S. and Palestine they say contribute to human rights violations both in the Middle East and domestically. Those companies include Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Students for Justice in Palestine, who led the proposal’s creation, believe divestment will continue to be a goal moving forward despite the failure of the recent legislation’s failure. Vanessa McHale, secretary of SJP at UW, said the group is in the process of drafting a new version of the proposal and hopes to have it before ASM prior to the semester’s end. “We expect legislation to pass in the near future, and we will continue our divestment push next year if we are able to,” McHale said. Proposal asks for UW divestment from corporations participating in human rights abusesAs the Students for Justice in Palestine prepare to bring a resolution to the Associated Students of Madison Wednesday, some Read… McHale said the new piece of legislation will be shorter, more focused and include more voices, particularly of SJP allies. She also said the group hopes to introduce the proposal via an ASM member who voted against the first draft to show significant changes were made. But members of Badgers United Against Hate, the most vocal opposition to divestment that has emerged on campus, said meetings between ASM representatives, groups in support of divestment and Badgers United Against Hate have not amounted to any meaningful compromise. Zach Urisman, a junior at UW and BUAH member, said despite finding some common ground with members of SJP, their talks “weren’t as productive as [they] had hoped.” “I saw a draft [of the new proposal] and raised my objections, but my objections were not heeded,” Urisman said. Urisman said he is not hopeful for the divestment proposal’s new draft. Fellow member Deeba Abrishamchi said in the case of an act of bias on campus, BUAH will “stand against” that. ASM indefinitely postpones divestment resolution after hours of heated debateAfter six hours of heated debate, the University of Wisconsin Associated Students of Madison voted 13-12-1 to postpone a resolution demanding the Read… Though divestment discussions are just beginning at UW, similar activities on campuses across the country suggest the struggle over divestment is far from over. Student efforts to divest from companies judged to be complicit in human rights violations have been ongoing at schools across the country since at least 2009, when Hampshire College became the first college or university to divest due to the Israeli occupation of Palestine. At the University of Michigan-Dearborn, students pushed for more than two years to pass a similar resolution through their student government. It eventually passed unanimously in March, though the resolutions of student government only function as “recommendations” for the Michigan Board of Regents, Susan Janin Yaseen, president of SJP at Dearborn, said. Students for Justice in Palestine speaker on postponed divestment proposal: ‘Vote yes’After a series of performances centered around social justice, Palestinian-American poet and writer Remi Kanazi discussed this week’s proposal to the Read… “I’m aware that divestment is unlikely and that we maybe have 10 more years to go,” Yaseen said. “But I believe we planted a seed, and [the movement] is going to continue to grow.” University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently voted on its own divestment proposal but was unsuccessful in passing it, according to the UIUC Divest website. Meanwhile at UW, McHale said SJP does not have plans to introduce proposals that call for divestment from any additional companies. But divestment from the original 20 companies will remain a goal.

By Agamoni Ghosh April 18, 2017 12:44 BST The United Launch Alliance rocket will take off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida with payload headed to the International Space StationUnited Launch Alliance Nasa will for the first time will air a 360-degree live coverage of an Orbital Cygnus spacecraft's resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS). Until now space enthusiasts could only see rockets lift off from a distance in real time, but the 360 viewing experience will take you virtually to the launch pad itself. Nasa has teamed up with Orbital ATK, United Launch Alliance (ULA), Lockheed Martin and Boeing's Space technology company for the resupply mission. How and when to watch? The launch will be broadcast a live in a 360-degree video format on the agency's website and on its YouTube channel on 18 April 11:11 am EDT (4:11 pm BST/CET). The launch has a 30-minute window so make sure to tune in just on time to not miss any part of it. The video can be viewed on PC's, mobile, tablets and even your VR headsets for that ultimate virtual experience. Those on desktops must use Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge or Opera browsers to view the launch. Viewers wanting to see the video on their mobiles and tablets should get the YouTube app which supports the 360-degree video format. To achieve the 360-degree view Orbital ATK and ULA have placed four fisheye-lens cameras on the launch pad, around 300 feet from the rocket. A computer protected by a blast-proof box nearby will stitch the images from these cameras in near-real time. Meteorologists have predicted very promising conditions for the launch and expect it to go off as scheduled on time.

"We need to reduce our employment levels further," John Hamilton, Vice President of engineering at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said on Monday. "We anticipate (Friday's notices) will impact hundreds of engineering employees. Additional reductions in engineering later this year will be driven by our business environment and the amount of voluntary attrition," The Hill magazine quoted Hamilton as saying. The Chicago-based company reportedly offered a round of voluntary buyouts in January, an offer that was accepted by more than 300 engineering and technical staff. According to the Seattle Times, all the engineering staff who accepted the proposal will permanently leave Boeing on Friday. Boeing has purportedly cut 1,332 engineering and technical jobs from its Washington workforce since January 2016. The Seattle Times added that the aviation company issued an earlier round of layoffs in March, resulting in 245 involuntary layoffs, including 62 engineering staff, in mid-May. The Washington Examiner said Boeing has terminated more than 9,000 employees over the past year, mainly through buyouts and retirements. The company currently employs 74,200 people, it added, and reported $95 billion in revenue last year.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by satprnews satprnews Global More Electric Aircraft Market 2017 Growth, Drivers, Trends and Future Outlook 2021 Summary Orbis Research Present’s Global More Electric Aircraft Market 2017-2021 has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. Description Global More Electric Aircraft Market to grow at a CAGR of 4.09% during the period 2017-2021 The Following Companies as the Key Players in the Global More Electric Aircraft Market: Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Embraer, and Honeywell International. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Raytheon, Safran, Siemens, Thales Group, United Technologies, and Zodiac Aerospace. Commenting on the report: “The latest trend gaining momentum in the market is meeting power demand through no-bleed concept. In a traditional commercial jet, the environmental control system and wing ice protection system use the hot air generated from the engine to energize the systems. On an MEA platform, this bleed air is superfluous because the systems are electrically powered. Since MEA models generate more electric power demand as compared to traditional designs, the implementation of no-bleed systems is practical.” According to the report, one of the major drivers for this market is combined expertise expected to generate quicker results. From an engine manufacturer perspective, the quantity of bleed air that the airframe requires from an engine is comparable to the level of electrical power extracted via generators and is the basic difference between a conventional aircraft and a more electric design. Parameters such as engine size, engine design, as well as the aircraft design dictate whether a more electric engine needs to be implemented in an MEA or not. Get a PDF Sample of Global More Electric Aircraft Market Report at: http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/244637 Further, the report states that one of the major factors hindering the growth of this market is relatively immature technologies. The concept of MEA focuses on the replacement of pneumatic and hydraulic systems with electricity-driven alternatives. This makes the electric power demand higher than that generated from traditional approaches. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

Plans to launch “mega constellations” of thousands of communications satellites to allow for global wireless internet could lead to a rise in collisions and build-up of dangerous space junk in Earth’s orbit, a study warns.  Google, SpaceX, Boeing and Samsung are among the companies vying to launch global broadband networks by deploying thousands of tiny satellites into low orbit. The first launches are planned for next year. Dr Hugh Lewis, a senior lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of Southampton, ran a 200-year simulation to assess the possible consequences of such a rise in orbital traffic. He found it could create a 50% increase in the number of catastrophic collisions between satellites. Such crashes would probably lead to a further increase in the amount of space junk in orbit, he said, leading to the possibility of further collisions and potential damage to the services the satellites were intended to provide. “The constellations that are due to be deployed from next year contain an unprecedented number of satellites, and a constellation launched without much thought will see a significant impact on the space environment because of the increased rate of collisions that might occur,” he said. With about 750,000 objects larger than 1cm orbiting Earth, the junk surrounding the planet is already a major obstacle to attempts to exploit space. At average speeds of 40,000 km/h, impacts on space hardware would deliver roughly the energy equivalent to the explosion of a hand grenade, with potentially dramatic consequences for operational satellites. The European Space Agency, which funded Lewis’s research, is calling for the satellites planned for orbital mega-constellations to be able to move to low altitudes once their missions are over so they burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. They must also be able discharge all batteries, fuel tanks and pressure tanks to prevent explosions that would scatter debris. Dr Holger Krag, the head of the space debris office at the ESA, said many of the companies proposing to launch services provided by such mega constellations lacked experience of the difficulties of working in Earth’s orbit. He expressed concern at ambitions to manufacture satellites at a fraction of the cost and many times the rate of the current batch of taxpayer-funded spacecraft, while still meeting exacting guidelines for disposing of them at the end of their missions. “They are companies so they have competitors, so they have pressure,” Krag said. “Under these conditions they would have to manufacture satellites that are reliable enough after five years of operations to reliably conduct this disposal manoeuvre. “Right now, under all the taxpayer-funded space flight we are doing today is only able to achieve 60% of success rate for that manoeuvre. How can they be better under commercial pressure and with cheaper satellites? That’s the worry we have.” Lewis is presenting his research this week at the European conference on space debris at the ESA’s centre in Darmsadt, Germany. Krag said he expected some of the companies planning launches to attend. “Even with good intentions it remains an extremely high technological challenge to manage to [meet the ESA’s proposed guidelines],” he said. “Let them achieve a success rate of 90%, which would be extremely good compared with what we do now, and it still means a few hundred satellites will be lost and at that altitude it’s not good. It’s as simple as that.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

Bass Initiative on Innovation and Placemaking Twitter jvey1 Meg Walker Senior Vice President - Project for Public Spaces The implications of this new competitive landscape for Oklahoma City are significant. Two of the region’s largest economic clusters—energy and health care—are undergoing substantial disruption.  The expansion of North American natural gas has opened the energy economy to new players. In health care, life science breakthroughs are coupling with information technology in areas like personalized medicine and health IT to redefine the care continuum, creating wide openings for technology and life science capitals like Austin, Texas; Boston; and San Francisco. Yet as crosscutting technologies—from “big data” to sensing—expand the competitive playing field in industries critical to Oklahoma City, they also create unprecedented opportunity for the region to vault ahead of its peers. This great leap will not happen spontaneously, however.  To leverage advantages in health, energy, and other sectors, Oklahoma City’s public and private leaders need to take action to improve joint industry-relevant research; grow, attract, and retain new technology companies; and ensure that the workforce is prepared for future jobs.  They need to invest in creating dynamic, high-quality places where research institutions, firms, and talent concentrate and connect.  And they need to nurture the talents and potential of low-income residents, who, if history is any lesson, will otherwise remain disconnected from the innovation economy’s growth. Related Content Cities & Regions The Rise of Innovation Districts Bruce Katz and Julie Wagner Monday, June 9, 2014 The Oklahoma City metropolitan area has long-standing industry strengths and assets on which to build a new convergence economy. The region dominates in oil and gas extraction, and it is becoming a global center for advanced energy technology, evidenced by the recent opening of the General Electric (GE) Global Research Oil & Gas Technology Center.  Outside of energy, the region has economic strengths in aerospace engineering, led by Tinker Air Force Base, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, and in health care, driven by the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (OMRF), and several private-sector firms, including COARE Biotechnology, Charlesson, and Selexys. The new GE facility and these health care assets largely concentrate in Oklahoma City’s emerging innovation district.  Bounded roughly by Robinson and Lottie Avenues to the west and east and 4th and 13th Streets to the south and north, this 1.3-square-mile area encompasses both the Oklahoma Health Center and the vibrant commercial corridor of Automobile Alley.  A significant center of job growth, the district reflects the shifting geography of the global economy and the emergence of dense hubs of economic activity where innovation, entrepreneurship, creativity, and placemaking intersect. With the right investments, the Oklahoma City innovation district has the potential to become a major center of gravity for innovation and economic development in Oklahoma City. With the right investments, the Oklahoma City innovation district has the potential to become a major center of gravity for innovation and economic development in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City’s innovation district is already a vital part of the region’s innovation economy.  Over 18,000 people work in the area, almost 5 percent of the city’s total. Its cluster of medical and research institutions attracts three-quarters of the project dollars the state receives from the National Institutes of Health, and its improved commercialization outcomes, coupled with the presence of business support organizations like i2E, position it to become the region’s hub of entrepreneurial activity.  Furthermore, the district’s proximity to downtown—which is home to several major energy company headquarters—and other areas of growth give it a powerful locational advantage.  Though only about 1,200 people live within the district itself, the neighborhoods to the west and south, such as Bricktown and Deep Deuce, have enjoyed a noticeable uptick in housing values, development, and amenities. For all its strengths, however, the district yet to tap its full potential, and it faces a number of challenges in terms of innovation, place, and inclusion: Innovation challenges: A historically medical-centric area, the district has neither the density nor diversity of institutions, firms, startup companies, and innovations spaces that many of its peers possess. And while many of the area’s health care and energy institutions and firms are physically close to one another, few organizing structures exist to strategically connect these industries—to one another and to other regional assets in Norman and elsewhere—around common technology platforms. Place-related challenges: The district’s car-centric physical layout and lack of gathering spaces hinder companies and workers from taking advantage of their proximity to interact, exchange ideas, and build collaborative networks.  Meanwhile, limited walkability in and around the district makes the more amenity-rich areas nearby feel further away than they actually area. Such place-related drawbacks may impede the ability of district firms and institutions to attract young talent. Inclusion challenges: Though well-paying jobs exist in the district for workers with varying education and skill levels—roughly 55 percent of district jobs do not require a four-year degree—the low-income residents of neighboring communities remain largely disconnected from employment within the district. Oklahoma City’s innovation district concentrates innovation and technology assets that could propel the region into global prominence within a range of converging technologies, particularly those related to health and energy. Oklahoma City’s innovation district concentrates innovation and technology assets that could propel the region into global prominence within a range of converging technologies, particularly those related to health and energy.  But reaching this potential will require that district and Oklahoma City leaders address the area’s challenges and collectively define and support a new vision and set of strategies to create a dynamic, inclusive hub of innovative and entrepreneurial activity. To this end, this report recommends four multifaceted strategies around which innovation district anchor institutions, firms, and civic leaders should rally city and regional stakeholders to engage with their time, expertise, and resources: Establish an Oklahoma Center for Energy and Health Collaboration that serves as the physical and programmatic umbrella for innovation and applied research within these and other sectors. The center would be a staged, multitiered initiative that supports the collaboration between prominent but currently disjoined economic clusters, beginning with energy and health care and eventually expanding to other clusters such as aerospace. The district should become the central hub of collaboration by securing space for the new center and attracting strategic partners, including corporate anchors, faculty from external universities, and entrepreneurs. The center should also house a translational research and commercialization office for crosscutting industry applications of research. The new center would likely be initially funded and operated by the overarching governance structure of the district, but eventually—as regional energy companies and universities outside the district begin to partner with the center on translational research—a coalition of internal and external organizations should emerge to help set the center’s agenda and direction. Implement a technology-based economic development and entrepreneurship effort within the innovation district specifically tasked with overseeing strategic business development, technology business attraction, marketing, and regional cluster development between entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized enterprises, and large firms. This new effort should serve as a conduit between market-oriented entities in the district like i2E, which works with entrepreneurs, researchers, and companies to help them commercialize their technologies and grow new businesses.  Finally, an innovation district seed fund and tailored accelerator would go a long way toward helping research entrepreneurs access early-stage capital for prototyping and market testing. This effort likely does not require a new institution. Instead, existing organizations could coordinate and be tasked and resourced to focus on economic development and entrepreneurship activity within the district. Create a denser, more active, and better-connected mixed-use urban environment in and around the innovation district, an essential complement to the actions recommended above to build a collaborative network among institutions and companies to spark innovation and firm development. To do so leaders should undertake new land use and real estate development efforts that will provide the types of commercial and residential uses, whether in new infill development or in existing buildings, that will lead to a more vibrant, sociable, and around-the-clock district environment; implement new placemaking efforts such as lectures, networking activities, food events and festivals, outdoor performances, recreational activities, health fairs, and opportunities for outdoor play; strengthen connections between the Health Center and Automobile Alley via new landscaping, lighting, and other pedestrian improvements on NE 10th and NE 13th Streets and on the bridges over Interstate 235, and by new development along 10th Street; improve bike and pedestrian routes within the Health Center to allow for easier access between parking lots and workplaces and between workplaces and new destinations (such as programmed public spaces); and make the innovation district more porous and connected to residential neighborhoods. Form a standing committee on diversity and inclusion charged with overseeing the design of strategies aimed at forging better economic, social, and physical connections between the innovation district and the underserved communities surrounding it. The committee would comprise and/or work more broadly with representatives from the district’s institutional and private-sector stakeholders; education providers such as Oklahoma City Public Schools, local community colleges, and technology (CareerTech) centers; area workforce entities; and the nonprofit community, including neighborhood groups.  The committee would focus on issue areas like education, workforce development, entrepreneurship, and placemaking/neighborhood development; guide and oversee goal and strategy development; and serve as a liaison between parties to facilitate alignment and coordination of efforts.  The committee would also evaluate proposals and make funding recommendations. Finally—and as called for in the Oklahoma Regional Innovation District Project Plan—district leaders need to establish a new type of governance entity that gives voice to the district’s narrative, defines what the district should aspire to become, and works with other area stakeholders to determine what innovation, place, and inclusion strategies it needs to employ as a unified place so as to have maximum collective impact on the city and region. Whether Oklahoma stakeholders decide to create a new organization or repurpose an existing one, they have a chance to be trailblazers in establishing an entity that has a singular focus on the district and undertakes all the responsibilities that task entails. Such an entity does not need an army of dedicated staff, but it must have: an executive director who understands the innovation ecosystem and has the ability to coordinate actors both within and outside of the district around defined goals and strategies; a leadership structure (a board or steering committee) with the influence and authority to rally critical stakeholders and guide district efforts; discrete committees (e.g., on diversity and inclusion) and/or standalone initiatives (e.g., the Oklahoma Center for Energy and Health Collaboration) that will develop and drive key strategies; the staff capacity needed to support and coordinate the board, committees, and initiatives; interact with district and non-district stakeholders (including regional industry leaders, local government, the Urban Renewal Authority, neighborhood organizations, etc.); develop, implement, and align district-wide programs, land use planning, and placemaking activities; and raise funds. Most importantly, this entity requires a strong innovation team (or at minimum a high-level leader) that sits between institutions and can catalyze a shared vision that holds a strong value proposition for each individual actor. Fulfilling this role will require a scientific understanding of the research portfolio and the ability to identify external partners, market opportunities, and funding opportunities. Oklahoma City is poised to organize itself to be a fierce competitor in the innovation economy and to build a stronger regional economy as a result—if it has the vision and will to do so.  The city has demonstrated its capacity to coalesce around bold ambitions before, rallying to build the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum, investing in its downtown, and passing multiple rounds of the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS) initiative to finance major redevelopment, infrastructure, and school improvements.  It is again time to channel that collective spirit to grow a more inventive, entrepreneurial, and inclusive Oklahoma City economy.

Google, SpaceX, Boeing and Samsung are among the companies vying to launch global broadband networks by deploying thousands of tiny satellites into low orbit. The first launches are planned for next year. Space junk cleanup mission prepares for launch Read more Dr Hugh Lewis, a senior lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of Southampton, ran a 200-year simulation to assess the possible consequences of such a rise in orbital traffic. He found it could create a 50% increase in the number of catastrophic collisions between satellites. Such crashes would probably lead to a further increase in the amount of space junk in orbit, he said, leading to the possibility of further collisions and potential damage to the services the satellites were intended to provide. “The constellations that are due to be deployed from next year contain an unprecedented number of satellites, and a constellation launched without much thought will see a significant impact on the space environment because of the increased rate of collisions that might occur,” he said. With about 750,000 objects larger than 1cm orbiting Earth, the junk surrounding the planet is already a major obstacle to attempts to exploit space. At average speeds of 40,000 km/h, impacts on space hardware would deliver roughly the energy equivalent to the explosion of a hand grenade, with potentially dramatic consequences for operational satellites. The European Space Agency, which funded Lewis’s research, is calling for the satellites planned for orbital mega-constellations to be able to move to low altitudes once their missions are over so they burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. They must also be able discharge all batteries, fuel tanks and pressure tanks to prevent explosions that would scatter debris. Dr Holger Krag, the head of the space debris office at the ESA, said many of the companies proposing to launch services provided by such mega constellations lacked experience of the difficulties of working in Earth’s orbit. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The launch of mega-constellations of communication satellites could lead to a rise in collisions, scientists warn. Photograph: University of Southampton/PA He expressed concern at ambitions to manufacture satellites at a fraction of the cost and many times the rate of the current batch of taxpayer-funded spacecraft, while still meeting exacting guidelines for disposing of them at the end of their missions. “They are companies so they have competitors, so they have pressure,” Krag said. “Under these conditions they would have to manufacture satellites that are reliable enough after five years of operations to reliably conduct this disposal manoeuvre. “Right now, under all the taxpayer-funded space flight we are doing today is only able to achieve 60% of success rate for that manoeuvre. How can they be better under commercial pressure and with cheaper satellites? That’s the worry we have.” Lewis is presenting his research this week at the European conference on space debris at the ESA’s centre in Darmsadt, Germany. Krag said he expected some of the companies planning launches to attend. “Even with good intentions it remains an extremely high technological challenge to manage to [meet the ESA’s proposed guidelines],” he said. “Let them achieve a success rate of 90%, which would be extremely good compared with what we do now, and it still means a few hundred satellites will be lost and at that altitude it’s not good. It’s as simple as that.” Topics Space Satellites European Space Agency Broadband Internet University of Southampton news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by satprnews satprnews DARPA signs agreement with SSL in spite of Orbital ATK law suit The article from SpaceFlights.NEWS DARPA decided to sign agreement with SSL covering continuing program of creating jointly robotic space vehicle able to service satellites remaining on orbit. It is important step for recovering many government satellites remaining on orbit. Joint effort of SSL developing satellite bus and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) with advanced work on payload entered into another phase. Both organizations will create satellite able to refuel, perform service actions or help in orbit change for satellites remaining on orbit. Cooperation between DARPA and SSL is rather oriented to creating satellite for typically military and strictly governmental purposes and not completely focused on commercial purposes already caused some controversies. First among others was question about economic sense of establishing separate program by DARPA, while already NASA and several private companies started similar projects. One company with particularly most advanced project of service satellite was Orbital ATK, which in fact started such program in 2010. Their Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV) was based on the GEOStar 3 bus and already was contracted to perform first mission in 2018 and perform service action to one from Intelsat satellites. It is advanced program and surely Orbital ATK was not quite satisfied, that DARPA decided to sign agreement with SSL (owned by Canadian  MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates) offering far less advanced solution comparing to MEV. Orbital ATK decided even to form lawsuit against DARPA accusing Agency for lack of economic management and the detriment of American space industry. Lawsuit was formed in February 2017 and first trial is scheduled for 5th May 2017, but probably Orbital ATK has small chance to win. DARPA as research Agency can freely decide about purposes and general directions of development of different projects lead by Agency are not restricted by any law. It could be considered as quite strange, that DARPA doubles commercial programs, not to mention about existing NASA project called Restore-L. But when we take a deeper look on DARPA we will see, that this is rather kind of tradition. To remind, X-37 space plane is utilized by U.S. Air Force since 2010 and was in fact project developed by Boeing and DARPA before it was given to military. DARPA is at the moment developing XS-1 space plane (in the cooperation with Boeing and Northrop) which seems to be similar to Dream Chaser designed by Sierra Nevada Corporation. Dream Chaser was already selected to be used under CRS-2 resupply missions program in future. It seems that it could be easily adopted by DARPA, what would be far less expensive than XS-1 project. in spite of this fact DARPA is continuing development of XS-1. Why ? Probably it is caused by the desire to maintain sustainable development of concepts, which are expensive and has limited number of commercial purposes, or their development is commercially pointless. From the point of view of DARPA not everything should be economically motivated, sometimes long term goals are more important than financial benefits. Boosting projects like XS-1 or service satellite DARPA can test technologies rejected by companies because of their cost or rejected by NASA due the limited possibilities of civilian usage. NASA as civilian agency is simply officially not allowed to test military technologies. DARPA as military focused agency can spent their budget on such concepts and give developed projects to Military, like it was with X-37 in the past.  In case of service satellite, this project is important, because Military is operating number of expensive satellites, which are currently reaching end of their service life due the reaching end of propellant or minor technical issues. They could be easily bring to life with service satellite; using separate military service robotic vehicle will help in servicing secret military satellites without engaging civilian personnel, which would be impossible to avoid with commercial contractors. On picture above: prototype arm of service satellite.

Watch our Facebook Live of the launch, via NASA TV.  In a first for a NASA rocket launch, a 360-degree video camera live streamed the launch of an Atlas V rocket — carrying Orbital-ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft, dubbed the the S.S. John Glenn — towing supplies and research from Cape Canaveral to the International Space Station. The Cygnus capsule will rendezvous with the ISS on Saturday. The mission is the sixth Orbital-ATK spacecraft to visit the International Space Station as part of the Commercial Resupply Program, a contract Orbital-ATK shares with Boeing and SpaceX. Some of the cargo includes a miniature greenhouse and 38 cubesats, tiny satellites that will study Earth’s thermosphere. This is the last time in the foreseeable future that Cygnus will launch from Cape Canaveral, as the next launches are scheduled to take place at Wallops Island, Virginia. It’s been almost three years since Orbital-ATK’s last launch from Wallops exploded seconds after liftoff, resulting in a fiery conflagration that destroyed the launchpad. Space missions are no strangers to 360 video. In 2016, cosmonaut Andrey Borisenko shot a 360-degree video tour of the ISS and presented a view of Earth from the Cupola module. But this is the first time you’ll be able to see a rocket launch into space in 360 degrees, from the comfort of your computer.

"Our businesses continue to face too many barriers to entry, which tilts the playing field against American workers.” ADVERTISEMENT Pence then urged South Korea to “level that playing field” by reevaluating the Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). “We will work with you [to] reform KORUS in the days ahead,” he told about 100 U.S. and South Korean business representatives gathered for his remarks. Pence’s meeting reportedly included representatives from Boeing, Ford, Visa, United Airlines, Oracle, Chevron and more. The vice president said the U.S. will not waver on its decadeslong partnership South Korea amid rising tensions with North Korea. “We are with you 100 percent, don’t doubt it for a second,” Pence told listeners during his roughly 17-minute remarks. A senior North Korean official said Monday that the U.S. has “created a dangerous situation in which a thermonuclear war may break out at any minute.” “[North Korea] is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the U.S.,” Kim In Ryong, North Korea’s deputy United Nations ambassador, said in Panmunjom, North Korea. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have soared amid satellite imagery indicating that North Korea is preparing for its sixth nuclear test. North Korea attempted to launch a ballistic missile off its east coast Sunday but ultimately failed, according to U.S. and South Korean military officials. Trump has pressured China in recent weeks to help curb North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and deescalate tensions in Asia.

The 19-story booster soared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 11:11 a.m. EDT/1511 GMT. NASA broadcast an unprecedented 360-degree view of the launch via YouTube, in a debut of new video technology. "A beautiful launch," said Vern Thorp, a United Launch Alliance manager. "It looks like we nailed the orbit once again." Atop the rocket was an Orbital ATK (OA.N) Cygnus capsule loaded with more than 7,600 pounds (3,450 kg) of food, supplies and experiments for the station, a $100 billion research lab flying about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The Cygnus is scheduled to reach the station, a project of 15 nations, on Saturday. Its cargo includes a greenhouse that the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing to grow food for astronauts on long missions. The capsule also carries 38 shoebox-sized satellites and a high school student's science project that will test how telomeres, which are structures at the ends of chromosomes, are affected by microgravity. As people age, telomeres tend to shorten. Preliminary results from a study of astronaut twins, however, show the telomeres of former astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent nearly a year aboard the station in 2015 and 2016, actually lengthened during his time in orbit, the opposite of what was expected. "The researchers are kind of scratching their heads at that," space station associate scientist Tara Ruttley said during a press conference on Monday. Tuesday's successful launch followed a month's delay while United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N), resolved a technical issue with the rocket's hydraulic system. The Cygnus cargo ship is the seventh of 10 planned missions through 2018 under Orbital's space station resupply contract with NASA, worth up to $3.1 billion. NASA also hired privately owned SpaceX to fly cargo to the station. In 2019, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp will begin operating a third U.S. supply line to the station. Russia and Japan also fly cargo ships to the station. By the time the Cygnus arrives, the station will have two new crew members. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin are scheduled for launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:13 a.m. EDT/0713 GMT on Thursday, docking at the station about six hours later.

 California may be the most desirable place to live in the US, but employers can't recruit 'high-performers' thanks to insane housing prices Tanza Loudenback Apr. 14, 2017, 7:27 PM 40,472 facebook linkedin twitter email print Los Angeles-based businesses may be in danger of being priced out of the region. Melpomene/Shutterstock The effect of California's housing crisis is reaching new heights. According to a new report from the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Business Council, exorbitant housing costs in Los Angeles, the second most populous city in the US, are inhibiting employers from attracting "high-performers," or top talent, to their companies. For the study — which was led by Raphael Bostic, a USC Price School of Public Policy Professor and the newly appointed head of the Atlanta Federal Reserve — USC surveyed 14 of Los Angeles' largest employers, which account for nearly 200,000 jobs in the region. Nearly 60% of the employers say Los Angeles' high cost of living impacts employee retention, with 75% naming housing costs as a specific concern, according to the survey results. Further, 10 employers (71%) view high housing costs as "a barrier" to hiring new mid- and upper-level employees. "This study shows that high housing costs are burdening our leading employers, either by having to develop special hiring packages, or subsidizing transportation and relocation costs," Bostic said. By contrast, most of the employers surveyed said no special outreach or programs have been put in place to retain lower-skilled workers because local supply is abundant. "It's concerning that high housing costs could lead to Los Angeles losing its competitive edge in recruiting top talent. That would be devastating to our economy," Mary Leslie, president of the Los Angeles Business Council, said. In 2015, Boeing moved a manufacturing facility from Long Beach to Seattle likely to escape Southern California housing costs despite the state's pleas for it to stay, the report said. And Los Angeles-based SpaceX opened an engineering office in Seattle the same year in an effort to hire top talent who "just refuse to live in LA," founder Elon Musk previously said. Southern California's real estate market has been red hot for a few years now, thanks to low mortgage rates, a strengthening economy, and dwindling home supply. Zillow pegs the median home value in Los Angeles at $616,900 and the median rent at about $2,860. That's compared to $195,700 and $1,500 for the US as a whole. "Though we have yet to see a critical mass of businesses priced out of the region, this is an area of concern," Bostic said. "There's ample evidence to show that the time is now to implement strategies to reduce housing costs.” But while expensive housing has become ubiquitous with cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, overpaying for housing is a widespread problem. Over 10 million households pay more than half their income in housing costs nationwide, according to the report.

Sriwijaya Air commercial director Toto Nursatyo said it will launch three new routes in June for Jakarta to Nanning, Jakarta to Haikou, and Denpasar to Nanning. “China is our main target for international market. The three will add to our existing eight flights to China,” Nursatyo told Xinhua. Last year, Sriwijaya carried around 600,000 foreign visitors, with 350,000 coming from China. It expects to double the number of its international passengers to 1 million in 2017 including 650,000 Chinese tourists, he said. In total, Sriwijaya is targeting overall passenger numbers to 15 million by year-end from 11.4 million passengers in 2016. Nursatyo said to achieve that goal, Sriwijaya is slated to welcome 13 new aircrafts this year, including two Boeing 777s. The company currently operates 52 aircraft on 55 domestic and international routes. Nursatyo said the main destinations for Chinese tourists are Bali, Jakarta, and Manado in North Sulawesi. The company also hoped to fly Chinese tourists to five more destinations including Bintan, Belitung, Lake Toba, Tarakan and Ternate by charter flights this year. Meanwhile, two other airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Indonesia AirAsia are also setting up for expansions in China. Garuda Indonesia CEO Pahala N. Mansury said it plans to fly from Denpasar to Chengdu this year. The state-owned airline currently operates regular flights between Jakarta and Denpasar to three Chinese cities including Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai. Indonesia AirAsia CEO Dendy Kurniawan said it will fly from Jakarta to Shenzhen, as well as from Jakarta to China’s Macao Special Administrative Region this year. “This is our real action to support the Tourism Ministry’s program to bring in 15 million foreign tourists in… Post navigation ACT schools pull out of online NAPLAN testing China builds panda-themed library Search for: Recent Posts Alia Bhatt or Anushka Sharma: Who wore Masaba Gupta’s denim-on-denim better?

American space hero John Glenn’s legacy took flight as a cargo ship bearing his name toward the International Space Station.  (John Raoux / The Associated Press)   By Marcia DunnThe Associated Press Tues., April 18, 2017 CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA.—John Glenn’s trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds of food, equipment and research for the space station. It’s due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA’s shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn’s widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. Article Continued Below “It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenn’s name emblazoned in space,” said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK’s space systems group. Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. “And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries,” he said.

John Glenn of Ohio has died at 95 Photos: John Glenn, American space hero, dies at 95 Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit — it’s the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft — as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK — one of NASA’s prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX — normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance’s bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. “Looks like we nailed the orbit once again,” said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA’s 360-degree video streaming of the launch — the first such attempt for a live broadcast — didn’t go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting about 400 kilometres high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeing’s Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions — hundreds of rocket launches in all. “We’re really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George,” said Kennedy Space Center’s director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a “heck of a ride.” “I couldn’t do better if I’d been riding a rocket.” Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

The White House announced late Friday that Trump plans to nominate Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey, to serve as president of the credit agency, which helps overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. exports. Trump will also nominate Spencer T. Bachus III of Alabama, another former House member, to serve as a member of the bank’s board of directors. Garrett voted against renewing the bank’s charter while he was in Congress, denouncing it as “corporate welfare.” “I opposed the House’s vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism,” he tweeted in 2015. Trump used to share that view. During his campaign, Trump criticized the credit agency as an unnecessary giveaway to politicians and certain companies. “I don’t like it because I don’t think it’s necessary,” he told Bloomberg, describing it as “sort of a featherbedding for politicians” and “a few companies.” “And these are companies that can do very well without it. So I don’t like it. I think it’s a lot of excess baggage,” he added. But this past week Trump announced he had changed his mind, telling The Wall Street Journal that he now supports it. “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies will really be helped — the vendor companies. But also, maybe more importantly, other countries give” credit, he said. “And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business.” “So instinctively,” he added, “you would say it’s a ridiculous thing, but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money.” The bank has been hobbled in recent years without enough board members to produce a quorum, blocking it from approving transactions exceeding $10 million. Much of the bank’s financing benefits large corporations such as Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar. Many moderate, business-minded groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support the bank.

(NASA/Handout via REUTERSTHIS) CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.—A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket lifted off from Florida on Tuesday, propelling a cargo capsule filled with supplies and science experiments toward the International Space Station. The 19-story booster soared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 11:11 a.m. EDT/1511 GMT. NASA broadcast an unprecedented 360-degree view of the launch via YouTube, in a debut of new video technology. “A beautiful launch,” said Vern Thorp, a United Launch Alliance manager. “It looks like we nailed the orbit once again.” Atop the rocket was an Orbital ATK Cygnus capsule loaded with more than 7,600 pounds of food, supplies and experiments for the station, a $100 billion research lab flying about 250 miles above Earth. The Cygnus is scheduled to reach the station, a project of 15 nations, on Saturday. Its cargo includes a greenhouse that the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing to grow food for astronauts on long missions. The capsule also carries 38 shoebox-sized satellites and a high school student’s science project that will test how telomeres, which are structures at the ends of chromosomes, are affected by microgravity. As people age, telomeres tend to shorten. Preliminary results from a study of astronaut twins, however, show the telomeres of former astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent nearly a year aboard the station in 2015 and 2016, actually lengthened during his time in orbit, the opposite of what was expected. “The researchers are kind of scratching their heads at that,” space station associate scientist Tara Ruttley said during a press conference on Monday. Tuesday’s successful launch followed a month’s delay while United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co., resolved a technical issue with the rocket’s hydraulic system. The Cygnus cargo ship is the seventh of 10 planned missions through 2018 under Orbital’s space station resupply contract with NASA, worth up to $3.1 billion. NASA also hired privately owned SpaceX to fly cargo to the station. In 2019, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp will begin operating a third U.S. supply line to the station. Russia and Japan also fly cargo ships to the station. By the time the Cygnus arrives, the station will have two new crew members. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin are scheduled for launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:13 a.m. EDT/0713 GMT on Thursday, docking at the station about six hours later.

Photo courtesy Boys & Girls Club of Pasadena The Pasadena Boys & Girls Clubs “Youth of the Year” Ivonne Gonzalez is joining 22 other nominees to an all-expense paid trip to China for an international, cultural and educational expedition. This journey is a part of the Los Angeles County Alliance for Boys & Girls Clubs taking the program to the next level! The China Expedition is a creation by the fantastic partners of the Alliance who had a shared vision of helping the 23 Youth of the Year nominees to see beyond their communities and looking into a world they might never know. With the mission of promoting collaboration among Chinese and U.S. businesses, communities and stakeholders, the China Enterprise Council helped with the platform to make this extraordinary experience possible. Club members who earn the Youth of the Year title embody the values of leadership service; community service, academic excellence; and healthy lifestyles. They exemplify the critical impact that Boys Girls Clubs have on the lives of young people. “This trip is paramount in changing the lives of the well-deserved nominees who I believe will build on this experience and in turn help their communities see beyond for cultural integration and appreciation”, states Mary Hewitt, Executive Director of the Los Angeles County Alliance for Boys & Girls Clubs. She went on, “schools don’t have the resources to maintain their art and gym classes, let alone send students on trips outside their community. These nominees are the best of the best, we are doing this to help students become global citizens, bring life to the subjects they learn in school, and expose them to new ideas and cultures.” Brian Davis, Executive Director & CEO of the Pasadena Boys & Girls Clubs states, “Travel is a powerful agent for change. It broadens our horizons and helps us find our purpose. Think how travel has been a positive influence on your life and how it’s connected you to people and communities. We are thrilled with this opportunity for Ivonne.” This trip is the first of its kind for the Boys & Girls Clubs to have all Youths of the Year travel together overseas. It would not be possible without the support of these incredible sponsors: China Enterprise Council, Coolpad, XIAMEN Airlines, BYD, International Vitamin Corporation, and COMAC America. “Headquartered in Southeast coast of China, Xiamen Airlines currently operates 168 all-Boeing aircrafts, with route network covering Asia, Europe, Australia and North America. Every year, more than 26 million passengers choose to fly with Xiamen Airlines, ranking top 30 in the global aviation industry. Xiamen Airlines always honors its social responsibility by actively conserving energy, cutting emission and supporting philanthropic and volunteer activities. Combining Discover China Trip with Xiamen Airlines inaugural flight from Los Angeles to Xiamen and showing the kids how pilot and flight attendants are trained for duty, embodies our best wishes for them to carry their dream forward flying on B787-9 Dreamliner,” stated Susie Zhu, General Manager of LA Office, Xiamen Airlines.

By Doug G. Ware and Andrew V. Pestano   |   April 18, 2017 at 4:13 PM Follow @upi Comments 1 of 8 | License Photo April 18 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump on Tuesday traveled to Wisconsin to act on one of the central tenets of his administration so far -- keeping jobs inside the United States -- by signing a new executive order aimed at guarding domestic labor. Trump visited the Kenosha, Wis., headquarters of tool-maker Snap-on Inc., where he reiterated his encouragement to "buy American, hire American." "The 'Buy and Hire American' order I'm about to sign will help protect workers and students like those of you in the audience today," the president said in a speech. "This historic action declares that the policy of our government is to aggressively promote and use American-made goods." Trump said his order aims to reevaluate U.S. trade deals with foreign governments and enforce 'Hire American' rules -- saying too many domestic jobs have been taken by foreign workers through widespread "abuses" in the United States' immigrant work visa program. "Right now, H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery, and that's wrong," he said. "Instead, they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants and they should never, ever be used to replace Americans. No one can compete with American workers when they are given a fair and level playing field. "The American people voted to end the theft of American prosperity. They voted to bring back their jobs and to bring back their dreams." Trump's executive action Tuesday orders federal agencies to revamp the H-1B visa program -- to make it more difficult for tech companies to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. The order will also strengthen rules prohibiting foreign contractors from bidding on government projects. "With this action, we are sending a powerful signal to the world -- we are going to defend our workers, protect our jobs and finally put America first," Trump said. "America first, you better believe it." The order directs the Departments of Labor, Justice, State and Homeland Security to crack down on fraud and abuse in H-1B guest-worker programs by issuing new immigration rules. The Commerce Department will also review federal procurement rules and trade agreements in an effort to put American firms at an advantage during contract bidding. "We will fully monitor, uphold and enforce our 'Buy American' laws, which we haven't done," the president said. "Buy American laws require that when the federal government buys bills or funds a project, domestic goods and products should be used." Earlier this year, Trump said he mandated the use of U.S.-made steel after learning that the Keystone XL oil pipeline was made with imported steel. He made similar remarks about "Hire American" in February during a visit to a Boeing plant in South Carolina. "With this order, I am directing every single agency in our government to strictly uphold our 'Buy American' laws ... and to maximize 'Made in America' content in all federal projects," he said. Trump has signed previous orders aimed at improving trade deals and rejecting "dumped" steel, which occurs when foreign governments export steel at a lower price than it would sell for domestically. Those orders pledged to crack down on violators and Trump said, "Those who break the rules will face the consequences, and they will be very severe consequences.' "We are going to crack down on foreign bidders that use dumped steel and other subsidized goods to take contracts from workers like you. They take them away and they have been doing it for a long time. Not going to happen anymore." "This is the policy that ensures no one gets left behind in America anymore -- that we protect our industry from unfair competition, favor the products produced by our fellow citizens and make certain that when jobs open those jobs are given to American workers first," the White House said in a statement. "We are finally standing up for our workers and for our companies. ... We are going to investigate every single trade deal that undermines [domestic labor]," Trump continued. "We believe jobs must be offered to American workers first, does that make sense?" RELATEDTrump signs orders to review trade laws, severely punish foreign 'cheaters' In his remarks Tuesday, Trump said the new order is another step in his future vision for the United States, which also includes ramping up focus on other areas he believes the country has fallen behind. "We are going to spend again on NASA, the space program," he said, echoing a desire to re-dominate the space race. Earlier this year, NASA indicated it's thinking about making a return to the moon quicker than previously planned. "That's something we need, and we need it psychologically. It's going to be very exciting." During his campaign last year, Trump received critical support from several blue collar states that typically vote Democratic -- such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- due to his repeated promises to bring back American jobs. Trump has made multiple steps so far in keeping with those pledges, including orders aimed at reviving the declining U.S. coal industry -- an enterprise some experts have dismissed as impractical and ineffective. "The people of Wisconsin, you have been so incredible to me and my administration and we will never, ever let you down," the president concluded. "God bless you, God bless the American worker, God bless the American dream and God bless the United States of America."

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket lifted off from Florida on Tuesday, propelling a cargo capsule filled with supplies and science experiments toward the International Space Station. The 19-story booster soared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 11:11 a.m. EDT/1511 GMT. NASA broadcast an unprecedented 360-degree view of the launch via YouTube, in a debut of new video technology. "A beautiful launch," said Vern Thorp, a United Launch Alliance manager. "It looks like we nailed the orbit once again." Atop the rocket was an Orbital ATK (OA.N) Cygnus capsule loaded with more than 7,600 pounds (3,450 kg) of food, supplies and experiments for the station, a $100 billion research lab flying about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The Cygnus is scheduled to reach the station, a project of 15 nations, on Saturday. Its cargo includes a greenhouse that the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing to grow food for astronauts on long missions. The capsule also carries 38 shoebox-sized satellites and a high school student's science project that will test how telomeres, which are structures at the ends of chromosomes, are affected by microgravity. As people age, telomeres tend to shorten. Preliminary results from a study of astronaut twins, however, show the telomeres of former astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent nearly a year aboard the station in 2015 and 2016, actually lengthened during his time in orbit, the opposite of what was expected. "The researchers are kind of scratching their heads at that," space station associate scientist Tara Ruttley said during a press conference on Monday. Tuesday's successful launch followed a month's delay while United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N), resolved a technical issue with the rocket's hydraulic system. The Cygnus cargo ship is the seventh of 10 planned missions through 2018 under Orbital's space station resupply contract with NASA, worth up to $3.1 billion. NASA also hired privately owned SpaceX to fly cargo to the station. In 2019, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp will begin operating a third U.S. supply line to the station. Russia and Japan also fly cargo ships to the station. By the time the Cygnus arrives, the station will have two new crew members. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin are scheduled for launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:13 a.m. EDT/0713 GMT on Thursday, docking at the station about six hours later.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    John Glenn's trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. It's due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA's shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn's widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. "It's a great tribute to John to be able to take his name to orbit once again," said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK's space systems group. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit — it's the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft — as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK — one of NASA's prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX — normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance's bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. "Looks like we nailed the orbit once again," said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA's 360-degree video streaming of the launch — the first such attempt for a live broadcast — didn't go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Three astronauts currently are at the outpost, which is orbiting 250 miles (402.32 kilometers) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman on board will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after nearly four decades. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions, among numerous other launches. "We're really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George," said Kennedy Space Center's director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. "I'm sure when I'm retired and up in the mountains somewhere, there's a launch going, it will be hard not to tune it in some way," Diller replied. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Aeromexico Taps Yalochat.com and IV.AI to Build First Advanced AI Customer Service Chatbot Leading Global Airline Delivers AI Chat Solution Through Facebook Messenger Based on Machine Learning and Neural Networks, Achieving 96% Automation for Customer Service by Chat in First Six Months MEXICO CITY and SAN JOSE, Calif., April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, as part of the Facebook F8 Conference, Aeromexico formally introduced Aerobot, its Artificial Intelligence (AI) customer service chatbot, with the help of its partners at Yalochat.com and IV.AI, leaders in chatbot development, neural network and machine learning programming.  In just six months, the bot has taken the customer service department from 0-96% automation and dramatically reduced the average customer service resolution time via chat from an average of 16 minutes to down to 2 minutes. "Mexicans are some of the most avid users of social chat platforms, such as Facebook Messenger and we saw a definite gap in what was being done to ease ongoing travelers pain points," said Brian Gross, vice president of digital innovation, Aeromexico. "As part of our commitment to innovation and with the help of Yalochat.com and IV.AI, we were able to build a truly advanced AI brain that was fed historical customer service data in all forms, in order for it to be truly smart in how it handles requests, despite possible language challenges." Aerobot has been being quietly used by customers for the last six months, but is now about to gain full marketing support and is the first of its kind to handle any question posed in natural language (in Spanish; English coming soon) about a customer's trip or the company's service.  This includes everything from checking flight status and purchasing tickets to providing recommendations on other information for their destinations and asking basic information like when to arrive at the airport. At F8, the airline is debuting its newest feature, group booking, which eliminates the need to coordinate tickets for multiple family or friends through email and phone calls. "How many times have you missed a group trip because you couldn't reach consensus? We are thrilled that Aeromexico is launching the Chat Extension feature for Aerobot; this is a game-changer for air travel," said Stan Chudnovsky, Vice President of Product for Messenger. "This feature will allow groups to plan a trip together from within Messenger with the help of the AI customer service chatbot and split payments." Yalochat.com, is the premier chatbot and AI platform for Latin American businesses that are looking to radically improve their customer's experience through chat. IV.AI automates customer service and builds proprietary AI 'brains' with its clients.  Companies keep their data and the AI 'brain' is designed to address specific business needs. This sets IV.AI and Yalochat.com apart from competitors and with their combination of machine learning, neural networks and natural language, they provide AI solutions that achieve real results. "Unlike many companies looking to jump on the AI bandwagon without the proper planning, Aeromexico knew what it was trying to achieve and was able to provide us with the data and their desired goals, allowing us to do what we do best -- help companies use AI to get real results," said Vince Lynch, CEO, IV.AI. "With the help of our partner Yalochat.com we were able to overcome some truly challenging issues, like multiple languages, slang and turning unstructured data into something comprehensive and useful, to create and feed a truly smart and effective AI brain for Aeromexico.  Now Aeromexico is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition with the Aerobot." To try out the Aerobot, visit the Aeromexico Facebook page and send a message, or go to m.me/AeromexicoMX (Spanish version).

on Machine Learning and Neural Networks, Achieving 96% Automation for Customer Service by Chat in First Six Months News provided by Grupo Aeromexico, S.A.B. de C.V. Apr 18, 2017, 15:00 ET Share this article MEXICO CITY and SAN JOSE, Calif., April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, as part of the Facebook F8 Conference, Aeromexico formally introduced Aerobot, its Artificial Intelligence (AI) customer service chatbot, with the help of its partners at Yalochat.com and IV.AI, leaders in chatbot development, neural network and machine learning programming.  In just six months, the bot has taken the customer service department from 0-96% automation and dramatically reduced the average customer service resolution time via chat from an average of 16 minutes to down to 2 minutes. "Mexicans are some of the most avid users of social chat platforms, such as Facebook Messenger and we saw a definite gap in what was being done to ease ongoing travelers pain points," said Brian Gross, vice president of digital innovation, Aeromexico. "As part of our commitment to innovation and with the help of Yalochat.com and IV.AI, we were able to build a truly advanced AI brain that was fed historical customer service data in all forms, in order for it to be truly smart in how it handles requests, despite possible language challenges." Aerobot has been being quietly used by customers for the last six months, but is now about to gain full marketing support and is the first of its kind to handle any question posed in natural language (in Spanish; English coming soon) about a customer's trip or the company's service.  This includes everything from checking flight status and purchasing tickets to providing recommendations on other information for their destinations and asking basic information like when to arrive at the airport. At F8, the airline is debuting its newest feature, group booking, which eliminates the need to coordinate tickets for multiple family or friends through email and phone calls. "How many times have you missed a group trip because you couldn't reach consensus? We are thrilled that Aeromexico is launching the Chat Extension feature for Aerobot; this is a game-changer for air travel," said Stan Chudnovsky, Vice President of Product for Messenger. "This feature will allow groups to plan a trip together from within Messenger with the help of the AI customer service chatbot and split payments." Yalochat.com, is the premier chatbot and AI platform for Latin American businesses that are looking to radically improve their customer's experience through chat. IV.AI automates customer service and builds proprietary AI 'brains' with its clients.  Companies keep their data and the AI 'brain' is designed to address specific business needs. This sets IV.AI and Yalochat.com apart from competitors and with their combination of machine learning, neural networks and natural language, they provide AI solutions that achieve real results. "Unlike many companies looking to jump on the AI bandwagon without the proper planning, Aeromexico knew what it was trying to achieve and was able to provide us with the data and their desired goals, allowing us to do what we do best -- help companies use AI to get real results," said Vince Lynch, CEO, IV.AI. "With the help of our partner Yalochat.com we were able to overcome some truly challenging issues, like multiple languages, slang and turning unstructured data into something comprehensive and useful, to create and feed a truly smart and effective AI brain for Aeromexico.  Now Aeromexico is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition with the Aerobot."

(AP Photo/John Raoux) Posted: Tuesday, April 18, 2017 8:22 am John Glenn honored with launch of space station supply ship Associated Press | 0 comments CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — John Glenn's trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. It's due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA's shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn's widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. "It's a great tribute to John to be able to take his name to orbit once again," said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK's space systems group. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit — it's the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft — as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK — one of NASA's prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX — normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance's bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. "Looks like we nailed the orbit once again," said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA's 360-degree video streaming of the launch — the first such attempt for a live broadcast — didn't go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Three astronauts currently are at the outpost, which is orbiting 250 miles (402.32 kilometers) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman on board will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after nearly four decades. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions, among numerous other launches. "We're really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George," said Kennedy Space Center's director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. "I'm sure when I'm retired and up in the mountains somewhere, there's a launch going, it will be hard not to tune it in some way," Diller replied. ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions — hundreds of rocket launches in all. “We’re really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George,” said Kennedy Space Center’s director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a “heck of a ride.” “I couldn’t do better if I’d been riding a rocket.” ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/ Share this: Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

(AP) — John Glenn's trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. It's due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. Story continues below video × Advertisement NASA's shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn's widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. "It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenn's name emblazoned in space," said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK's space systems group. Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. "And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries," he said. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit — it's the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft — as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK — one of NASA's prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX — normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance's bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. "Looks like we nailed the orbit once again," said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA's 360-degree video streaming of the launch — the first such attempt for a live broadcast — didn't go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeing's Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years.

"We're really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George," said Kennedy Space Center's director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a "heck of a ride."

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Wednesday April 19, 2017 About Us App Advertise Contact Us China Shanghai Macau Hong Kong Beijing Local News National News Business CEO Talks C919 ends first high-speed taxi test ANN@The China Post  Wednesday, April 19, 2017, 12:04 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 The much-anticipated C919, the large homegrown passenger jet, has finished its first high-speed taxiing test, and it is just one step closer to its maiden flight. Shanghai-based State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd, the manufacturer of the C919, completed the high-speed taxiing test in Shanghai on Sunday. Since the first C919 rolled off the assembly line, COMAC has been conducting tests in preparation for its first flight. So far, it has completed most of ground-based pre-flight evaluations, including the low-speed and medium-speed taxiing tests, to examine the whole aircraft and its key components and connecting parts. Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said high-speed taxiing tests are usually conducted at speeds of 230 to 260 kilometers per hour, with the front landing gear slightly lifted to simulate takeoff. "It is hard to evaluate the intervals between each high-speed taxiing tests. It could be two to three days or one week. It could be very fast if everything went right and no big technical faults occurred," Wang said. "Usually, every latter high-speed test will be conducted at a faster speed than the previous one, and more similar to the real condition before takeoff." He said COMAC will evaluate if the experimental performance is consistent to the designed capability, and the company would have to finish all the steps to guarantee the success of its flight. For B787 of Boeing Co and A350 of Airbus Group SE, both widebody planes required high-speed taxiing tests of less than 10 times. The C919, the single-aisle, 168-seat and twin-engine jet, is a commercial aircraft for medium-haul flights. The homemade plane is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and the new-generation B737, which currently dominate the market. As of last November, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from more than 20 customers, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines, Sichuan Airlines and Joy Air.

An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. It's due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA's shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn's widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. "It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenn's name emblazoned in space," said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK's space systems group. Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. "And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries," he said. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit - it's the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft - as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK - one of NASA's prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX - normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance's bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. "Looks like we nailed the orbit once again," said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA's 360-degree video streaming of the launch - the first such attempt for a live broadcast - didn't go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeing's Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions - hundreds of rocket launches in all. "We're really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George," said Kennedy Space Center's director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a "heck of a ride." "I couldn't do better if I'd been riding a rocket." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/ Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Eric Berger - Apr 18, 2017 5:13 pm UTC Atlantis and the final landing of the Space Shuttle program. NASA / Wikimedia Commons reader comments 103 Share this story No humans have launched into space from US soil for more than five years, when space shuttle Atlantis made its final voyage. Since that spacecraft landed on July 21, 2011, a total of 2,098 days have passed. Former Space Shuttle Program Manager Wayne Hale noted on Twitter Tuesday that this gap has now surpassed the previous longest US spaceflight gap—2,089 days—which occurred between the end of the Apollo program and the first space shuttle mission. Further ReadingWhat it was like to watch the last shuttle fly home—from space The final Apollo mission, which launched in 1975 and featured an in-space rendezvous with a Russian spacecraft, presaged the end of the "space race" and future cooperation between the United States and Russia in space. And since the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, NASA has relied exclusively on Russia to get its astronauts to the International Space Station. It will do so again on Thursday, with the launch of Jack Fischer from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. It would be easy to pillory NASA for this gap, but the space agency largely doesn't deserve the blame. The failure belongs to the American government, which knew literally for more than a decade that the shuttle's end was coming, but it failed to prepare for its inevitable retirement or articulate a plan for what was to come next. This failure belongs to the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama and especially to Congress, which underfunded the program both Bush and Obama settled on to replace the space shuttle—a commercial crew plan to leverage development of private spacecraft. The gap in human spaceflight capability for NASA programs continues to grow. Eric Berger So far, NASA's stopgap measure of relying on Russia has worked. Despite some provocations, the Russians have largely been reliable partners in keeping the International Space Station staffed, supplied, and safe. For example, when US astronauts were forced to retreat to the Russian side of the station due to fears of an ammonia leak in 2015, the deputy prime minister over space, Dmitry Rogozin, called the station to ensure the cosmonauts were taking care of their American colleagues. Ending the gap, forever Moreover, NASA is taking steps to ensure this kind of capability gap never again occurs. With the commercial crew program, NASA will have two providers of human launches, SpaceX and Boeing, likely beginning sometime early in 2019. Moreover, through its cargo delivery program, NASA is also helping a third provider, Sierra Nevada Corp., complete an orbital vehicle that will eventually be capable of bringing humans into space. It's not clear when the present gap will ultimately end, and it may depend on how one views Blue Origin. The private company led by Jeff Bezos is likely to begin test launches from West Texas late this year or early in 2018. The tests will briefly lift "test passengers" into space on suborbital flights. These missions are analogous to the early Mercury flights. Virgin Galactic also has a chance to make crewed, suborbital flights in 2018. Further ReadingTechnical troubles likely to delay commercial crew flights until 2019 If one does not count Blue Origin as closing the gap, the government's orbital capability will come from the commercial crew program. Both private providers' programs have faced delays. Right now it is possible that SpaceX or Boeing could launch crewed flights in the second half of 2018, although early 2019 seems more likely. There is also an outside chance the Trump administration will direct NASA to put crew on the first flight of NASA's Space Launch System rocket, and if so, that flight could come in late 2019. Regardless, the latest and longest gap in US spaceflight activities should close within two years or less. Thanks to a multiplicity of private providers, which should eventually include orbital flights by Blue Origin as well, the gap may never open again after that.

Spencer Olson Our state has an estimated (and mind-boggling) 700 tax breaks and loopholes in its tax code. If the legislature is serious about investing in the priorities that help Washington’s communities thrive – like schools, job training programs, and public health clinics – it needs to follow the lead of the House Democrats whose budget would clean up the tax code by getting rid of unnecessary tax breaks. A growing chorus of people in Seattle and throughout the state are demanding tax reform, and lawmakers in both chambers should be taking them seriously. Washingtonians are calling for an end to tax breaks that drain state investments away from our communities in order to serve corporations and special interests. They are asking why our state hasn’t fixed its upside-down tax code – in which middle- and low-income people pay up to seven times as much in-state and local taxes as the wealthiest 1 percent as a share of income. And they’re asking why our state is leaving money on the table by giving wealthy Washingtonians a tax break on the capital gains profits they make on the sale of high-end stocks and bonds. It’s time to reform our state’s tax code to favoring special interests at the expense of everyone else. Not all state tax breaks are bad, of course. Some help strengthen small businesses, while others help families who are struggling to make ends meet. But in all too many cases, they are outdated, misguided, or simply unnecessary. Consider the tax break originally enacted to benefit the timber industry that now actually helps big oil extractors. You read that right. Big oil. Or the preferential tax rate for prescription drug resellers that was initially put in place to attract drug wholesalers to relocate to our state, but that now goes even to those who operate out-of-state warehouses. Again, yes, you read that right: pharmaceutical companies who don’t even operate in our state. And of course, it’s no secret that Boeing received the biggest corporate tax break in U.S. history in 2013, then promptly started laying people off and shipping jobs out of state the next year. These kinds of tax breaks prevent our legislature from having enough money for schools and other essentials that make up the foundations of communities. They siphon money out of our state budget and into the coffers of companies and individuals who already get a special deal from the most upside-down tax code in the nation. Which is why community members statewide are sounding off about tax reform at town halls and rallies, in Olympia, on social media, and in their local papers. Like for example, this past President’s Day, when more than 500 people showed up at the state capitol in the rain to demand that lawmakers invest in education equity – in part by cleaning up the tax code. Or a few weeks ago, when more than 60 Washingtonians, many of them parents with kids in tow, trekked to Olympia for an early morning hearing to testify in support of the House tax reform proposal (which would wisely scale back and eliminate certain tax breaks, like the one on capital gains). Or the fact that thousands of people wrote and called their legislators in support of the House proposal and against the Senate’s budget proposal, which would add more tax breaks to the tax code. And of course, we can’t forget the hundreds who have shown up to legislative town halls this session to call for tax reform. Or the thousands of Washingtonians taking to the streets of Seattle this past weekend to not just demand that Trump release his tax returns, but also to declare that it’s time to clean up our state’s upside-down tax code. State lawmakers must listen to these voices of everyday Washingtonians – rather than prioritizing the voices of big corporations and special interests who, let’s be frank, will always ask for ever-more special deals to increase their own bottom line. Washingtonians deserve schools where all kids have access to current learning tools. Parks and trails that are well-maintained. Public health programs that keep our communities healthy. If we want these priorities for all Washingtonians, then lawmakers must get rid of unnecessary tax breaks that make it continually harder to fund them.

Lindsey Wasson Former Mayor Mike McGinn Jumps in the Race: “Of course, I looked at the lay of land and made an analysis," McGinn said, addressing questions of whether the sexual abuse allegations embroiling Mayor Murray impacted his decision. Speaking to reporters on his front lawn, McGinn introduced a platform that included a citywide income tax, more neighborhood process in development, fewer property taxes and opposing a plan for a new youth jail. He said his first priority as mayor would be to "house the homeless," but didn't offer specifics. McGinn announced his campaign on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/xMfUxdYiMO — Mike McGinn (@mayormcginn) April 17, 2017 Heidi was incredulous that a practiced politician would announce his candidacy with a logo apparently created on MS Paint and a slogan that just seems to trail off. Keep Trying. A Legal Defense Fund for Undocumented Immigrants: Both Seattle and King County councils voted to approve a combined $1.3 million in legal aid for undocumented immigrants facing deportation. The cash will be funneled to nonprofit legal groups like the Northwest Immigrants Rights Project. Immigrants held by ICE don't benefit from a constitutionally guaranteed right to an attorney. Many of them don't have lawyers. In related news... Arrests of Immigrants Without Criminal Records Double Under Trump: That's 5,441 immigrants under threat of deportation for doing nothing more than living in the United States without documentation. If we include immigrants with criminal records, ICE arrested 21,362 from January through mid-March, a 32.6 percent increase from the same period last year. In the same Washington Post story, King County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Satterberg, addressing the presence of ICE agents in state courthouses, tells a reporter: My sense is that ICE is emboldened in a way that I have never seen...The federal government, in really just a couple of months, has undone decades of work that we have done to build this trust.

That comes after 1,805 voluntary buyouts since June 2016 and 245 layoffs last month. Airplane sales are down. Cascade Mall Shooter Found Dead at Snohomish County Jail: Suspected of killing 5 people, Arcan Cetin apparently hanged himself in his cell Sunday evening, according to Skagit County prosecutors. Cetin had recently been transferred to the jail after allegedly making compromising statements at the Skagit County lockup, the Times reports. Since 2010, 14 people have died while in-custody at Snohomish County Jail. If a medical examiner corroborates the prosecutors in Cetin's case, his death will be the fourth suicide at the jail during that timeframe. Jury Deadlocks on Convictions for Six "Break Free" Climate Protestors: Skagit County prosecutors thought this would be an open-and-shut case. After all, they'd won convictions in five previous trials of protestors who blocked trains from leaving Washington State's largest oil refinery in May. (Guilty of a civil misdemeanor, the offenders must pay $250 in fines and complete eight hours of community service.) But on Monday, six of the 52 protesters arrested in May met Karen Swan, one of two jurors who out of conscience refused to dole out convictions. "I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your stand and your risk, I’m honored to have been a juror in your case,” Swan said. The case is scheduled for retrial next month, the Weekly reports. The US Supreme Court Upholds Arkansas Inmate's Stay of Execution: Don Davis was scheduled to die last night, the first of seven planned executions in an 11-day span. Arkansas' attorney general attempted to lift a stay on his execution, but the Supreme Court refused to grant that motion just minutes before Davis' death warrant was set to expire, sparing his life. The AG didn't attempt to appeal a stay of execution on another man, Bruce Earl Ward, also scheduled to die last night. Still, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says he is determined to execute 5 other prisoners by April 27, before the state runs out of midazolam, an execution drug.

The 19-story missile soared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 11:11 a.m. EDT/1511 GMT. NASA broadcast an unprecedented 360-degree view of the launch via YouTube, in a debut of new video technology. Atop the rocket was an Orbital ATK Cygnus capsule loaded with more than 7,600 pounds (3,450 kg) of food, supplies and experiments for the station, a $100 billion research lab flying about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The Cygnus is scheduled to reach the station, a project of 15 nations, on Saturday. Its cargo includes a greenhouse that the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing to grow food for astronauts on long missions. The capsule also carries 38 shoebox-sized satellites and a high school student's science project that will test how telomeres, which are structures at the ends of chromosomes, are affected by microgravity. As people age, telomeres tend to shorten. Preliminary results from a study of astronaut twins, however, show the telomeres of former astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent nearly a year aboard the station in 2015 and 2016, actually lengthened during his time in orbit, the opposite of what was expected. "The researchers are kind of scratching their heads at that," space station associate scientist Tara Ruttley said during a press conference on Monday. Tuesday's successful launch followed a month's delay while United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, resolved a technical issue with the rocket's hydraulic system. The Cygnus cargo ship is the seventh of 10 planned missions through 2018 under Orbital's space station resupply contract with NASA, worth up to $3.1 billion. NASA also hired privately owned SpaceX to fly cargo to the station. In 2019, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp will begin operating a third U.S. supply line to the station. Russia and Japan also fly cargo ships to the station. By the time the Cygnus arrives, the station will have two new crew members. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin are scheduled for launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:13 a.m. EDT/0713 GMT on Thursday, docking at the station about six hours later.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Vijay Mallya TTV Dinakaran Donald Trump IPL 2017 Narendra Modi News Sci/Tech U.S. cargo ship blasts off for space station with supplies, experiments Shares1 Tue, 18 Apr 2017-09:19pm , Reuters A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket lifted off from Florida on Tuesday, propelling a cargo capsule filled with supplies and science experiments toward the International Space Station. The 19-story missile soared off its seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 11:11 a.m. EDT/1511 GMT. NASA broadcast an unprecedented 360-degree view of the launch via YouTube, in a debut of new video technology. Atop the rocket was an Orbital ATK Cygnus capsule loaded with more than 7,600 pounds (3,450 kg) of food, supplies and experiments for the station, a $100 billion research lab flying about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The Cygnus is scheduled to reach the station, a project of 15 nations, on Saturday. Its cargo includes a greenhouse that the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing to grow food for astronauts on long missions. The capsule also carries 38 shoebox-sized satellites and a high school student's science project that will test how telomeres, which are structures at the ends of chromosomes, are affected by microgravity. As people age, telomeres tend to shorten. Preliminary results from a study of astronaut twins, however, show the telomeres of former astronaut Scott Kelly, who spent nearly a year aboard the station in 2015 and 2016, actually lengthened during his time in orbit, the opposite of what was expected. "The researchers are kind of scratching their heads at that," space station associate scientist Tara Ruttley said during a press conference on Monday. Tuesday's successful launch followed a month's delay while United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co, resolved a technical issue with the rocket's hydraulic system. The Cygnus cargo ship is the seventh of 10 planned missions through 2018 under Orbital's space station resupply contract with NASA, worth up to $3.1 billion. NASA also hired privately owned SpaceX to fly cargo to the station. In 2019, privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp will begin operating a third U.S. supply line to the station. Russia and Japan also fly cargo ships to the station. By the time the Cygnus arrives, the station will have two new crew members. NASA astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin are scheduled for launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:13 a.m. EDT/0713 GMT on Thursday, docking at the station about six hours later.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Silicon Valley, Silicon roundabout and now the Silicon O By Meghan DiGiacomo Feature  Orlando sets out its claim to be a world-class tech hub. Shares With 2017 well under way, it’s remarkable to think how much has changed over the past 12 months. Our world seems to be changing more quickly as each year passes, and this holds true for business as much as it does anywhere else.    One sector that is set to continue to thrive with support from governments and industry is the tech industry. From Silicon Valley to Silicon roundabout, to Berlin to Stockholm, cities worldwide are attracting talent and growing exciting tech hubs. With a longstanding history in space exploration and innovation, Orlando in Florida is well established as a leading tech hub – putting the state on the map for businesses that are looking to re-locate or expand their business internationally.  Florida is the fourth largest economy in the US and the ‘sunshine state’ (as many like to call it) has a highly skilled and diverse workforce of nearly 10 million people, state-of-the-art infrastructure and unmatched global access. Of this workforce, more than 310,000 are ‘high-tech’ employees and 28,000 new STEM graduates start work every year.    Florida has had tremendous success attracting and retaining IT companies in the recent years thanks to the mix of business climate advantages and industry assets. An appealing quality of life, reliable infrastructure, low taxes, and unique multilingual workforce are among the many other qualities that help businesses thrive as well as attract the 27,000 IT establishments, employing over 237,000 IT professionals.  Today, Florida boasts the nation’s third largest tech industry. The state’s IT strengths are wide ranging – from software to photonics to modeling, simulation and training. With the third most fibre miles among states (61,000+), the third most fibre lit buildings (over 47,000 total fibre lit structures), the most submarine fiber landings in the continental US, and the fourth most data center locations (275 total), Florida is a prime strategic destination for technology companies due to its location and strong cable connections.    Central Florida, in the heart of the sunshine state, has a longstanding history in space exploration and innovation and is making full use of its talent pool to maintain its position on the world stage. Orlando specifically is well-established as a leading tech hub – putting the state firmly on the map for businesses that are looking to re-locate or expand their business internationally.  Tech hub and the ‘simulation capital of the world’  Orlando is known the world over as a vacation hotspot with Disney World, Universal Studios, and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter delighting visitors from across the globe. If you couple this with the region’s strong military and space exploration tradition, you can see why Orlando is called the ‘simulation capital of the world’. Orlando is about much more than just its theme parks.  The city employs thousands of software developers, computer programmers, graphic designers and engineers.  It’s increasingly establishing itself as a high tech leader, attracting companies seeking a tech/start-up hub of innovation and it’s staking a claim as a tech hub. A booming tech community has emerged as a result of many multinationals having an outpost in the city as well as a motivated workforce attracted by the many lifestyle advantages that Orlando has to offer.  Co-working spaces have seen a huge wave of demand driven primarily by the emergence of this successful tech community. New spaces in the city such as Catalyst and the planned Creative Village reflect the continued popularity of more collaborative ways of working. Creative Village will help Orlando compete globally by creating a 68 acre mixed use, transit-oriented, urban infill neighbourhood in the heart of downtown Orlando. Add to this, Downtown Orlando’s historic Church Street Station, which is now home to more than 70 tech-related companies and Orlando’s start-up offer is very attractive to UK businesses looking for an alternative outside Europe.    Last summer, Imec, a Belgian nanotechnology company, agreed to create Imec Florida, a research and development design centre that will focus on photonics and high-speed electronics. Imec will be located in the new smart sensor consortium called BRIDG (Bridging the Innovation Development Gap) – the only advanced materials manufacturing development centre focused on the integration of semiconductor-based processes and materials into future products such as smart sensor and photonics devices.  The US National Centre for Simulation (NCS) is headquartered in Orlando and is at the epicentre of the modelling, simulation and training industry. The centre is a major contributor to the overall security of the United States, involved in everything from military readiness to space exploration to healthcare and transportation. The NCS is also part of the ‘Team Orlando’ partnership between military organizations, the modelling and simulation industry and academic institutions.  One member of the NCS is DiSTI, a graphical software company which creates 3D virtual environments for training in the aerospace, automotive, medical, and training industries and boasts Jaguar Land Rover and Boeing as some of its clients.    The right environment for business  Florida is committed to keeping regulatory requirements and business taxes low. That, along with a strong economy and zero personal state income tax, makes it a great place to do business. It’s true that Florida is the sunshine state, but Florida is also the place where IT, space, military and entertainment technology converge with start-up innovation. And the city of Orlando is increasingly competing with cities across North America to foster talent and new ideas in the technology sector. The state is encouraging the success of new and exciting tech companies, helping further Orlando’s economy and gain further recognition from around the world as a city of innovation.  Dozens of British businesses have set up in Florida attracted by everything the state has to offer. For businesses in the UK, Florida might be the business location they hadn’t even thought of.  As the world shapes itself following a year of huge changes experienced globally, it will be those businesses that can spot opportunities in new and previously unconsidered markets that will be in the best position to profit in 2017.  Meghan DiGiacomo, Director of Business Development at Enterprise Florida    Image Credit: Mariamichelle / Pixabay Topics Web enterprise startups silicon valley us florida orlando tech hub co-working GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

This "stress-under-fire" reaction lane kicks off the current Georgian Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRE), Jan. 29 - Feb. 26, integrating the units in preparation for deployment. The U.S. Marines and the Georgian Soldiers executed training at an urban MOUT sight and incorporated training mentor​s​, logistic and air assets from the U.S. Army, Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps. The MRE is a U.S.M.C.-lead exercise involving nearly 900 Soldiers from Georgia, Hungary and the U.S. The MRE is based on the current operational environment to prepare the 23rd Inf. Bn. (Georgian) for offensive, defensive, and a deployment in support of Operation Freedom Sentinel. (U.S. Army Photo by Sgt. Karen Sampson/ released)  see less | View Image Page HOHENFELS, BY, GERMANY 02.23.2017 Story by Sgt. Karen Sampson  Joint Multinational Readiness Center ✔ ✗ Subscribe 2 HOHENFELS, Germany -- Georgian Soldiers of the 23rd Light Infantry Battalion and the U.S. Marine Corps 2nd Detachment Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company (ANGLICO), from North Carolina, recently completed the Georgian Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRE), Jan. 29 - Feb. 26, at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center. The ANGLICO Marines and the Georgian 23rd Lt. In. Bn. will now deploy to a security mission protecting Bagram Airfield, the densely populated U.S. forward operating base in Afghanistan as part of Operation Freedom Sentinel. Marines from U.S. Marine Corps Security Cooperation Group (MCSCG), Virginia Beach, Va., served as OCTs and planners for this combined Georgian-U.S.M.C. exercise. Both sides worked hard this past month to ensure their integration at the tactical level in preparation for their deployment. "The MCSCGs during this exercise replicate our mission set in Afghanistan," said Lt. Col. Beka Ambroladze, Commander of the Georgian 23rd Lt. In. Bn. "The exercise at JMRC is exact preparation for what we will do in the upcoming months." The U.S. Marines' partnership with Georgian military, and direction of the Georgian MRE exemplifies interoperability, a keystone in JMRCs training methodology. JMRC's Bullseye Team, Falcon Team and Warhog Team played integral roles in hosting all parties at the training center, ranging from JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) operations, providing air assets and training lane safety Observer, Coach and Trainers (OCT). "Overall, the MRE is well planned and resourced," said Ambroladze. "We are happy with all of the support and feel ready for this deployment." An asset to preparation, MCSCG's training plan incorporates Joint Services and multinational forces, said Marine Staff Sgt. Jon Traylor, a JTAC Advisor and Fundamentals Instructor. "We coordinated liaisons, training, ground maneuver and air assets, and logistic support from the U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and the Georgian and Hungarian Armed Forces," he said. MCSCGs created a series of complex problems for the training units in a fast moving environment combining all the unit's assets and replicating elements they will be exposed to once in theater, added Traylor "ANGLICO helps the Georgians increase their understanding of the integration of close air support and rendering support for medical evacuation," said USMC Capt. Cameron Barker, Support Arms Liaison Team Delta Lead (SALT) and 2d ANGLICO OIC supporting the Georgian Deployment program. "The Georgians have the ability to call for close air support and perform MEDEVAC planning on their own, ANGLICO is here to facilitate the American assets." This deployment is Barker's second rotation with ANGLICO and a Georgian Light Infantry Battalion. Due to the need to rapidly integrate ANGLICOs mission capabilities with the Georgian Lt. In. Bn., early training lanes during the MRE offered advanced repetitions of ground to air operations training. The unit patrolled the training area's MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) sites incorporating air assets for casualty evacuations and call for fire. "In Afghanistan we will provide the Boeing AH-64 Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawk, F-16 E and some unmanned air systems (UAS) providing over watch, casualty evacuation and any kinetic fires for defense," said Barker. Each day, the training area's eastern skies filled with hammering beats of UH-60s conducting air assault transport, JTAC training or performing multiple cold-load and MEDEVAC training operations. The din and dust matched by ground maneuvers with the 100-plus MRAPs (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle) performing patrols, transport or quick reaction force (QRF) training. "The Marines from SALT are doing a fantastic job working tirelessly to integrate with the battalion on all levels," said Barker. "They have established rapport and strive for unit cohesion." Ultimately, the true bonds formed between 2d ANGLICO and the 23IN during this MRE will contribute to saving lives. MCSCG is in the ninth year of conducting the Georgian Deployment Program -- Resolute Support Mission (GDP-RSM). Working with the Georgians since 2009, U.S. Marines train, advise and deploy with Georgian Armed Forces infantry battalions to enhance their military capabilities.

 10 things you need to know before European markets open Ben Moshinsky Apr. 18, 2017, 1:38 AM 1,385 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump (C) waves to guests after delivering remarks from the Truman Balcony with first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron Trump (L) during the 139th Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House April 17, 2017 in Washington, DC. The White House said 21,000 people are expected to attend the annual tradition of rolling colored eggs down the White House lawn that was started by President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Good morning! Here's what you need to know.  1. A US judge ordered Brazilian engineering company Odebrecht to pay $2.6 billion in fines in a massive criminal corruption case. District Judge Raymond Dearie said at a hearing in Brooklyn federal court that about $93 million will go to the United States, $2.39 billion to Brazil and $116 million to Switzerland. 2. Citigroup appointed Carmen Haddad as head of the bank's Saudi Arabia business. The appointment coincides with the bank seeking a return to the kingdom after an absence of nearly 13 years. 3. Theresa May's Conservatives lead Labour by a huge 21-points according to a new opinion poll, despite the latter having launched a host of popular policies over the past week. A YouGov survey published on Sunday night said that 44% of Brits intends to vote for the Tories at the next election, up 2% on the company's last poll. 23% of respondents said they plan to vote Labour. 4. International observers cited flaws in Sunday's controversial referendum in Turkey while European leaders urged reconciliation in a divided country. The vote, whose outcome was welcomed by Ankara ally Saudi Arabia, has major implications for the long-standing EU bid of Turkey, also a key NATO member. 5. China denied any political motive in the cancellation of flights by its flag carrier to North Korea, as pressure mounts on Beijing to help curb Pyongyang's weapons programmes. State broadcaster CCTV reported that Air China had suspended its Beijing-Pyongyang route, leading to speculation the move was intended to pressure the North. 6. South Korean prosecutors charged the chairman of retail giant Lotte in connection with the corruption scandal that brought down former president Park Geun-Hye. Shin Dong-Bin is accused of using more than $6 million to bribe Park and her secret confidante Choi Soon-Sil, the prosecutors said on the same day they charged Park with bribery and abuse of power.  7. A hedge fund that told investors it couldn't lose money is under SEC investigation, according to a Bloomberg News report. Statim Holdings, a small Atlanta-based hedge fund firm, had previously been investigated by Georgia regulators starting in 2015. 8. Boeing warned employees on Monday that it plans another round of involuntary layoffs that will affect hundreds of engineers, according to a source and a memo seen by Reuters. The layoffs are set to start June 23, and follow a prior involuntary reduction of 245 workers set for May 19. 9. Theresa May has asked officials to develop plans for a scrappage scheme for diesel cars as part of proposals to improve air quality, according to the Financial Times. The government is due to announce by April 24 plans to comply with European Union legislation to improve air quality and meet nitrogen dioxide limits following a ruling by the High Court late last year. 10. The chairman of China's insurance regulator, Xiang Junbo, has been removed from his position for suspected disciplinary violations. On April 9, China's graft watchdog announced an investigation into Xiang, the most senior financial regulator to be probed as part of a government fight against graft.

International Search Search Autonomous VehiclesChinese Search Behemoth Baidu Set to Launch Self-Driving Car Technology in July WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: April 19 PoliticsWhite House Meeting on Paris Climate Deal Has Been Postponed PoliticsBernie Sanders Urges Democrats to Reach Out to Trump Supporters China Paul Manafort Meets with a Chinese Billionaire to Talk U.S. Infrastructure Scott Cendrowski Apr 17, 2017 President Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort met Chinese construction billionaire Yan Jiehe last week in Shanghai to discuss how the builder could join in Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan in the U.S., the Pacific Construction Group founder said. The meeting was first reported by the Financial Times. Last Tuesday was the third time Yan, the founder of Pacific Construction Group, met with Manafort, he separately told Fortune. They had previously met twice in Beijing. Also attending the same meeting were executives from Spain-based ACS Group, one of the world's largest construction companies. Manafort's spokesperson Jason Maloni told the FT that infrastructure deals weren't discussed. “The Pacific Construction Group was an impromptu meeting added to Mr. Manafort’s schedule at their request because the Chinese are interested in U.S. infrastructure,” the paper quoted Maloni as saying. He added that no current or future infrastructure projects in the U.S. were discussed. But according to Pacific Construction, Manafort was there to help Yan on potentially brokering deals in the U.S. market, one that could involve a joint venture shepherded by Manafort. International builders like Pacific Construction and ACS Group are trying to get in on a potential U.S. building boom through trusted connectors like Manafort, who met Yan in Shanghai last week on the same day that reports in the U.S. said Manafort was taking steps to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for his past lobbying work in Ukraine. Yan founded Pacific Construction in 1995, which soon became the country's largest private builder by moving faster to complete local government projects than bureaucratic state-owned builders. Pacific took on projects that others shunned, such as a recent plan to level hundreds of loess hills in the country's far west city of Lanzhou to prepare for a new city center. Yan told Fortune three years ago: “Boeing builds planes. We are in the business of building cities.” Last year, Pacific Construction ranked 99 on Fortune's Global 500 list, with $73 billion in revenues. Read more: China’s baddest billionaire builder As China's own building boom slows, Yan is looking for business opportunities outside China. Two years ago, he pitched construction services in Greece. Now, it appears he is ready to move into the U.S., where President Trump announced a $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan when he addressed Congress in February, which was short on details but big on promises. Yan sees Manafort as someone close to the Trump administration who can help him move into the U.S. to take advantage of the coming construction spending. Last week, he excitedly talked of a great meeting with "Paul," who was close to President Trump.

The Hollywood Reporter Movies TV Business Style Politics Tech Culture Awards Video Sites Heat Vision Live Feed Esq The Race Behind the Screen Bastard Machine Rambling Reporter The Fien Print Subscribe Site Tools Newsletters Daily Edition Travel Dining Theater Real Estate Books Podcasts Illustration by Michael Hirshon First Class Face-Off: The Hollywood Reporter Flies the L.A.-NYC Corridor Four Times for 36 Hours Straight by Peter Flax April 17, 2017, 6:20am PDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pass the organic ice cream and Baileys! An intrepid THR editor tests the ultra-luxe services of American, Delta, JetBlue and United, breezing through security, munching on parsnip mousse and cocooning in a pod at 30,000 feet. It was 9 a.m., and I was barely functioning on three hours of sleep, having just flown coast-to-coast-to-coast. Fidgeting in my lie-flat leather-trimmed lounger, I just couldn't fathom yet another glass of champagne. So I asked my preternaturally cheery Delta flight attendant if she could make me a mimosa. "Of course I can do that," she said, smiling as she handed me a hot hand towel with tongs. "That's what I'm here for." In that moment, feeling like I'd woken up on the floor somewhere in Vegas, I knew I had underestimated this seemingly cushy assignment: to compare the top premium flights between Los Angeles and New York City. Between noon on a Tuesday and midnight the following day, I jetted back and forth between the two cities on the carriers that offer lay-flat seating — American, JetBlue, Delta and United. (This trip took place in late March — a simpler time before the term "re-accommodate" had become a viral addition to the air-travel lexicon.) It was a 36-hour vision quest that spanned 10,000 miles and forced me to confront hard choices (lobster roll or lamb shank?). My only job during this mission was to assume a reclined position and weather a perfect storm of luxury and privilege befitting a bicoastal mogul. But up there, sipping a mimosa, I felt unexpected pressure. Fortunately, it subsided as soon as I unfastened the top snap of my jeans. ••• American First Class: Luxurious Solitude On Tuesday morning, I was greeted curbside at LAX by a rep with American's Five Star Service who led me into the Flagship First Class entrance. This check-in area is unassuming but a world away from the normal airport chaos just a few yards away. The room was hushed and spare and everyone greeted me by name. The efficiency actually was staggering — within five minutes of stepping out of my Lyft ride, I had checked in, taken an elevator and a series of secret passageways, been escorted to the front of a long security line, put my laptop in a bin and was on my way to the lounge. The appeal for high-profile Hollywood actors and other power players is obvious — no paparazzi or phone-wielding fans snapping photos, no plebeian security lines, no earthly hassles. For true A-list talent — the morning I was traveling Julie Andrews also was flying to New York, and Julia Roberts and her kids had been there the day before — American and TSA collaborate to empty the queue so no other travelers are in the room when they pass through security. And there's a back entrance to the Admiral's Club so heavy hitters can be escorted into the First Class Lounge without strolling through the main entrance. The Flagship Lounge at LAX is due for an update in late 2017 that will bring a larger space with sleek, modern furnishing and high-end a la carte dining options. For now, I was forced to make do with a sprawling breakfast buffet (I had a bagel loaded with lox and an assortment of dim sum) and the nicest unattended open bar I've ever set eyes upon. As I prudently drained a couple big bottles of Pellegrino, I enviously watched a trio of finely dressed Japanese businessmen sample the assemblage of single malts, top-shelf vodkas and small-batch tequilas, the unending supply of Taittinger Brut and well-curated California craft beer. Not hitting that bar was both the smartest and the dumbest thing I would do all day. When it was time to board, someone tapped me on the shoulder and led me to my flight. I never once looked at a screen or a boarding pass or even paused to consider what gate was mine; I just followed my Five Star guardian angel. There was a small crowd queued up to board, but I was led to a separate entrance just for the 10 first-class passengers. While other airlines of course have premium transcontinental offerings, American is the only one with three-class seating and a branded first-class product. The smell of the cabin was of fresh leather and old money. The seating is arranged in a reverse herringbone design with one seat on either side of the aisle, so even if I was sharing space with, say, some well-known movie producers and an Oscar-winning actress, we all were alone — our comfy Bose noise-cancelling headphones and padded ottomans mere symbols of our glorious solitude. No other carrier could match the refinement and peacefulness of the next six hours, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to travel with a spouse or coworker without actually talking to them. A parade of food and wine helped stave off loneliness. The highlight of my four-course meal surely was the roasted beet and goat cheese timbale, which paired beautifully with a sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley. I watched Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk and contemplated the dark side of American excess until my flight attendant asked if I'd like a freshly baked snickerdoodle, which hit the spot almost as much as the Ben & Jerry's hot fudge sundae. I turned down a glass of port, pulled out the Cole Haan eye mask and lowered my seat to bed mode. The hour that followed was as quiet and uninterrupted as modern life gets, until it was interrupted by a few semi-important work emails. After I landed, I took a brief tour of American's Flagship check-in and lounge at JFK, where I had just enough time to contemplate a shower (with intricate mosaic tile and C.O. Bigelow product), eyeball another champagne spread and interrupt James Taylor having a business meeting. It was roughly 9 p.m., and while most of my fellow first-class travelers were ensconced in the back seats of their black Escalades on the Belt Parkway, I immediately headed to Terminal 5 so I could fly back to Los Angeles. I only had 7,500 miles to go. ••• JetBlue Mint: Surprising Luxury — Once You Take Off Thanks to violent thunderstorms earlier in the day, flights in and out of JFK that evening on all airlines were delayed. So I wound up having an extra hour to kill before boarding my flight back to L.A. After being coddled by American, the in-terminal experience with JetBlue was decidedly more unvarnished. There was a dedicated security line for Mint travelers, but it was as long as all the other lines. There was no lounge offering fine spirits and amuse-bouches, or any ego-boosting perks for Hollywood aspirants. I shuffled around the terminal (which had far better than average restaurant options), studied the departures screens dutifully and perused the magazine rack at Hudson News like a normal weary traveler. But when I stepped onto that A321 and settled into seat 2A, I was back in the lap of luxury. JetBlue has an unusual configuration of seats in its five-row front cabin — alternating rows of two seats with stand-alone mini-suites in rows 2 and 4. While everyone in American first class had looked ready for lunch at the Polo Lounge, my cabinmates here looked like Venice Beach creatives (excluding the guy in the track suit who was shouting Russian into his iPhone before takeoff). JetBlue was the only airline to offer free Wi-Fi — someone at the legacy carriers needs to figure out how to seamlessly give free internet to travelers who spend thousands on a flight. Mint was the least costly of the products I flew, but the quality of the service was outstanding. Soon after takeoff I was noshing on a curiously tasty parsnip mousse with taro chips and sipping a slightly citrusy sparkling wine from Mendocino. The meal service — a small-plate selection designed with inspiration from Saxon + Parole, the decidedly downtown grill on The Bowery — was the best I'd experience in my whole journey. I kicked my legs up and enjoyed a flavorful carrot-ginger soup, a super-fresh kale Cobb salad and a restaurant quality sea bass-risotto combo. I drank a California craft beer and cleaned my plate as I pondered my present-tense experiences with time dilation while watching Arrival on my entertainment system. (I found that all the airlines' hardware and programming options were more similar than different, and noted that La La Land and Manchester by the Sea were available across the board while no one offered Moonlight.). By then it was late, and I had been flying for 10 hours, and Amy Adams' brooding stares were in my head, and my flight attendant smartly suggested I pair my organic Blue Marble ice cream with a glass of Baileys. In reclining mode, the seat is as long as American's first class product, and it even has a bit more legroom and a nifty lumbar-massage feature. My real-time map indicated I was somewhere over New Mexico but I was feeling more drained than enchanted. So I closed the door to my little airborne suite and hugged my comforter and slipped into a state just short of sleep. Around 2:30 a.m. we landed at LAX — I had been on the move for about 15 hours and was right back where I started. ••• Delta One: Friendly Sizzle After three hours of glorious shut-eye at the Sheraton Gateway, I headed back to LAX. It was a 15-minute walk — my workout for the day — to meet my Delta One rep. The Delta One check in area in Terminal 5 was an actual oasis with modern furniture and an automated espresso machine and a vague smell of lavender. You could actually sit there for a moment and pretend that the TSA did not exist. But alas, it was time to go. My friendly Delta One rep guided me to the front of the security line and it wasn't long before I was in a large and well-appointed club. Like United, Delta does not have a VIP club within a club, but it does have some special nooks where a high-profile movie star can recuse themselves from the business-class hordes. Still, the club had an airy and contemporary feel, and attendants pushed carts around the room so you didn't even have to get out of your plush chair to get fresh orange juice or a pastry. I think I had about 45 minutes until my flight would depart so of course someone asked me if I wanted a ride in a Porsche. Delta has a program for elite fliers that unapologetically is called Surprise and Delight, where travelers are offered special perks without notice. So that's why I suddenly was on the tarmac, climbing into a metallic blue Cayenne piloted by a sweet woman who called herself Miss Jackie. For 15 minutes, Miss Jackie jockeyed with jumbo jets as I toured the underbelly of two terminals and learned that Delta has a little-known program for affluent and high-profile passengers landing at LAX — in which you and your bags get off the plane, and into a Porsche that immediately whisks you out a side exit and deposits you at a back entrance of a nearby luxury-hotel partner. (Delta representatives were reluctant to discuss their celebrity passengers, but I relentlessly asked everyone I met and learned that John Legend, Alicia Keys, Derek Jeter and Rihanna are die-hard Delta fliers. One airport staffer who deals with VIPs told me "all the Hollywood celebrities are surprisingly nice. But the Middle Eastern princes — they're a different story.") As our tour concluded, I asked Miss Jackie if she enjoyed driving the Cayenne. "Yes I do," she said. "But our red Panamera is more my style." Miss Jackie and her second-choice chariot dropped me right at my gate and a Delta One rep walked me to my seat. Then I was greeted at length by the head flight attendant serving the front cabin of my flight. Throughout the course of the day I came to believe that all of the positive clichés about Southern hospitality were evinced by the Delta employees I met. So goddamned friendly! The front cabin on Delta One flights is marketed as a business-class product — I flew a Boeing B757-200 with two-by-two seating. (Some Delta flights between L.A. and New York are on wide-body aircraft set up with a 1-2-1 seating arrangement in business class, meaning everyone has direct aisle access.) I sat next to a CBS executive and long before our cheery pilot announced our passage over the Grand Canyon I partook in more conversation than I had in the first 5,000 miles the day before. Breakfast service was delightful — a fruit and cheese plate, an assortment of warmed breads, good coffee and the best airline omelet I've ever had (narrowly topping one I had years ago in Swissair business class that was cooked in the aisle). Other than a regrettable glass of California Merlot — honestly, what was I thinking? — the food and drink were very good, not as inventive as JetBlue but executed as well. I kicked back my seat and watched Jackie, which offered a deeply personal reminder that you can live like royalty and still suffer. At this point, I had been in the air for more than 15 hours and was not exactly feeling right. After downing a crisp glass of Italian Brut and a gooey chocolate chip cookie, I decided to pull an eye mask out of my Tumi amenity kit and attempt a nap, but it just wasn't happening. In the fully reclining position the seat was comfortable (though a bit narrower than the competition) and the Westin-branded comforter was the best I'd snuggle with on my entire journey, but sleep never came. My flight landed at JFK, and my final return to LAX was departing from Newark in a few hours, so I was able to take advantage of a new partnership with a helicopter operator called Blade that is being announced by Delta this month. When I walked off the plane, I was greeted by another rep, who immediately led me down a staircase to the tarmac and into another Cayenne. This gentleman regaled me with stories of driving Lionel Richie and Joan Rivers ("The funniest person I've ever met, period") around JFK as he zipped me to a helipad. There, a matte black helicopter waited — for me. From the moment we touched down at JFK to the time I was on terra firma on the West Side was 29 minutes. I got to stare down at traffic on the Belt and see early-evening light reflect off the Freedom Tower and take selfies as I wore a cool headset. As I waited in the Blade lounge for my Lyft ride to Newark Airport for my final flight, the lovely hostess asked if I wanted to sample a super-premium vodka from the bar. I felt like Mad Max near the crux of The Road Warrior at that point, and I think I had the hair to match. I asked for a Perrier and tried to synopsize how I spent the past 28 hours. She looked at me blankly. "So now you're going to fly back to LAX?" she asked. "You've got to be kidding." ••• United Premium Service — Right Up the Middle All I remember about the drive to Newark was the happy realization that I had one more clean T-shirt in my messenger bag, so I did a quick backseat costume change as we went over the Pulaski Skyway. So when I was met curbside by my concierge for United's Signature Service, I was as crisp as I was going to get. In a way that was becoming commonplace, I blew through security in two minutes. (At United, anyone can purchase concierge service, even if they fly coach with grandma.) I haven't been inside Newark's Terminal C in years and don't think it's an exaggeration to say it now has the best airport dining options in the United States. Many millions have been spent and many hundreds of iPads have been installed and the options are staggering — hand-pulled ramen noodles at Kaedama; Alain Ducasse's bistro, Saison; a selection of 200-plus tequilas at Tacquilla; and a curious reimagining of the CBGB brand, where you can honor punk history with a wedge salad or a Kobe chili dog. I had a perfectly prepared grilled scallop dish at Daily, a farm-to-table restaurant that changes its menu every day. Yes, I ate a multicourse meal right before I boarded a dinnertime transcontinental business-class flight. I did a quick tour of a large and well-appointed club, and one employee showed me the exact couch where Britney Spears passed out. (The United Club at LAX was even nicer, with a chandeliered centerpiece bar and an outdoor patio with a clear-if-distant view of the Hollywood sign, and two United staffers confirmed that Sigourney Weaver is extremely kind.) In my altered state, all I could do was settle into yet another lie-flat seat and linger over my final glass of champagne. It was bubbly. I studied my amenity kit and paid for GoGo internet for the third time in two days. My seat on this B757 was a little bit shorter and a little bit wider than Delta's. I was not exactly hungry, but I didn't let that stop me from enjoying a sriracha-glazed shrimp app with a Goose Island IPA. My portobello and kale lasagna was just fine but I spent 15 minutes wistfully eyeing the lamb shoulder with gnocchi and eggplant confit that my neighbor, a spunky UTA agent, ordered for dinner. The agents always win! Eager to turn things around, I ordered a full-bodied American cabernet and kicked up my feet and dug into The Accountant, which offered high-octane proof that my journey could go south and west at the same time. But just when things seemed pointless, a small crew of flight attendants wheeled an actual ice-cream cart down the aisle — with freshly crumbled cookies and toasted nuts — and made me a sundae that restored my senses. I don't remember the end of the sundae. I just remember the cabin lights snapping on and looking down to see DTLA glittering as I was handed one final hot washcloth. I stumbled out to the curb at LAX around midnight, a beleaguered but changed man. After all, I was at least five pounds heavier than when I started.

By: AP | Charleston (us) | Published:April 18, 2017 8:28 am In this Friday, July 23, 2010, photo, former VP Joe Biden chats with former Senator Ernest Fritz Hollings during the dedication ceremony of the new Ernest F Hollings Special Collections Library in Columbia. (AP Photo/Mary Ann Chastain, File photo) Colleagues of former US Senator Ernest “Fritz” Hollings said a statue unveiled Monday at the federal courthouse in Charleston that used to bear his name honors a man who served South Carolinians with courage, integrity and wit. Former Vice President Joe Biden said Hollings’ 2015 request that Congress rename the building for a judge considered a civil rights hero epitomized his friend’s lifetime of selfless service. “Nobody, nobody, nobody has ever said, ‘Take my name off a revered building in my city and put someone else’s name on it,”’ Biden said. US Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-SC, said congressional researchers confirmed to him before he introduced the legislation at Hollings’ insistence that it was a first. Hollings’ statue is outside the J Waties Waring Judicial Center, renamed for a South Carolina judge who attracted death threats for his rulings against segregation in the 1940s and 50s. Biden and other colleagues said the 95-year-old former Democratic governor is the reason South Carolina avoided the violence of other Southern states during desegregation. Before leaving the governor’s office in 1963, Hollings urged legislators to accept integration peacefully. South Carolina “must realize the lesson of 100 years ago and move on for the good of South Carolina and our United States,” Hollings told the Legislature in a joint assembly. “This should be done with dignity. It must be done with law and order.” Later that month, Harvey Gannt, a graduate of an African-American high school in Charleston, integrated Clemson University. Former Charleston Mayor Joe Riley noted Hollings made that speech while planning to run for the US Senate, when it politically made “no sense” for him to take an unpopular position. “Because of what he did, the door was opened in South Carolina,” Biden said, while other Deep South governors were “fomenting hate and division.” Hollings was elected to the US Senate in 1966 and went on to serve nearly 40 years before retiring in 2005. Colleagues praised Hollings for bringing attention to poverty, leading reporters on a series of “hunger tours” in 1969 and publishing a book the next year titled “The Case Against Hunger.” Hollings co-sponsored a law creating a program that provides nutritional food to pregnant women, new moms and children up to 5 years old. Riley said it’s impossible to calculate the lives saved through that law alone. He also said it was because of “this dynamo in Washington” that Charleston recovered as quickly as it did following Hurricane Hugo in 1989, because of the federal aid Hollings arranged, and survived the Navy base’s 1996 closure, with new military jobs sent to Charleston. US Sen. Lindsey Graham said BMW and Boeing would not be in South Carolina without the technical college system that Hollings created while governor. Part of the colleges’ role is training workers for industries moving into an area. Hollings, who served in the Army during World War II, represents the “greatest generation” well, Graham said. Governor Henry McMaster noted he was one of Hollings’ “victims,” getting “stomped firsthand” when he tried unsuccessfully in 1986 to unseat Hollings. Giving an example of Hollings’ quick wit, McMaster recalled challenging Hollings in a debate to take a drug test. “He immediately challenged me to an IQ test. We still laugh about that one,” McMaster said. “Few men in our country can match” Hollings’ service. Biden said Hollings is the reason he became a US senator and vice president. Their friendship began when Hollings endorsed him as a then-29-year-old Senate candidate and then, a month after the upset, convincing him not to give up the job when his wife and daughter died in a car crash. When Biden didn’t show up to his swearing in, Hollings arranged for it to happen at the hospital where his sons were, Biden said. They sat beside each other for the next 30 years. Biden was also the key speaker at the 2010 dedication of a University of South Carolina library named after Hollings. “I marvel at your integrity,” Biden told Hollings. While he remained seated, Hollings spoke briefly at the end, thanking the speakers and praising Biden’s ability to “wheel and deal” as senator and vice president.

The plane, China's homegrown big passenger jet, completed its first high-speed taxiing test on Sunday. The much-anticipated C919, the large homegrown passenger jet, has finished its first high-speed taxiing test, and it is just one step closer to its maiden flight. Shanghai-based State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd, the manufacturer of the C919, completed the high-speed taxiing test in Shanghai on Sunday. Since the first C919 rolled off the assembly line, COMAC has been conducting tests in preparation for its first flight. So far, it has completed most of ground-based pre-flight evaluations, including the low-speed and medium-speed taxiing tests, to examine the whole aircraft and its key components and connecting parts. Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said high-speed taxiing tests are usually conducted at speeds of 230 to 260 kilometers per hour, with the front landing gear slightly lifted to simulate takeoff. "It is hard to evaluate the intervals between each high-speed taxiing tests. It could be two to three days or one week. It could be very fast if everything went right and no big technical faults occurred," Wang said. "Usually, every latter high-speed test will be conducted at a faster speed than the previous one, and more similar to the real condition before takeoff." He said COMAC will evaluate if the experimental performance is consistent to the designed capability, and the company would have to finish all the steps to guarantee the success of its flight. For B787 of Boeing Co and A350 of Airbus Group SE, both widebody planes required high-speed taxiing tests of less than 10 times. The C919, the single-aisle, 168-seat and twin-engine jet, is a commercial aircraft for medium-haul flights. The homemade plane is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and the new-generation B737, which currently dominate the market. As of last November, COMAC had received 570 orders for the C919 from more than 20 customers, including domestic airlines such as Air China, China Southern, China Eastern, Hainan Airlines, Sichuan Airlines and Joy Air.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) prev next     comments CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — John Glenn's trailblazing legacy took flight Tuesday as a cargo ship bearing his name rocketed toward the International Space Station. An Atlas rocket provided the late morning lift to orbit, just as it did for Glenn 55 years ago. The commercial cargo ship, dubbed the S.S. John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. It's due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA's shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn's widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. "It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenn's name emblazoned in space," said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK's space systems group. Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. "And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries," he said. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit — it's the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft — as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK — one of NASA's prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX — normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance's bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. "Looks like we nailed the orbit once again," said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA's 360-degree video streaming of the launch — the first such attempt for a live broadcast — didn't go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeing's Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions — hundreds of rocket launches in all. "We're really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George," said Kennedy Space Center's director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a "heck of a ride." "I couldn't do better if I'd been riding a rocket." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/ Related Articles Ivanka's biz prospers as politics mixes with business US defense chief says NKorea 'recklessly tried to provoke' Arkansas inmates try variety of arguments to avoid death More On: National Aeronautics and Space Administration United States government John Glenn Share this Article Join the Conversation Herald Columnists Lindsay Kalter Kalter: Bay State co. eyes remedy to high health costs Howie Carr Carr: The latest from Elizabeth Warren leaves me… pooped Joe Fitzgerald Fitzgerald: Sister Patrice Garrity leaves inspiring legacy Kimberly Atkins Atkins: Climate accord divides Donald Trump advisers Bob McGovern McGovern: 20,000 cases, no winner Jessica Heslam Heslam: Daughter begs Facebook to not post mayhem Trending Now Report: Amazon shows interest in BJ’s Marine who lost leg in Afghanistan provides inspirational image of 2017 Boston Marathon Close to 20,000 tainted drug cases may be wiped today San Francisco earthquake and fire kills over 3,000 people Destroyed 75% of the city #HeraldArchive 1906… Married Connecticut teacher allegedly had sexual contact with student on couch in her classroom Cashman: Flag flap shows reporter’s out in left field 3 dead in Fresno shooting spree; suspect arrested, linked to Motel 6 slaying Tweets by @bostonherald ✖ Boston Herald News Local Coverage Local Politics Columnists National US Politics International Offbeat News Obituaries Opinion Op Ed Letters to the Editor Editorials Send a Letter Sports Red Sox Patriots Celtics Bruins Columnist College Soccer Golf High School Other Entertainment Inside Track Celebrity News Arts & Culture Movies Music Television LifeStyle Food & Beverage Style & Fashion Travel Health & Fitness Business Automotive Real Estate Technology Markets More… Classifieds Radio Horoscope Lottery Crossword Contests Weather RSS Feeds Archives Log In Legal Notices Advertise Purchase Back Copies Send a News Tip Contact Us Home Delivery e-Edition Mobile Apps Herald Newsletters Send a Letter to the Editor Boston Herald In Education Mass Literacy ©Copyright by the Boston Herald and Herald Media No portion of BostonHerald.com or its content may be reproduced without the owner's written permission.

John Glenn, holds nearly 7,700 pounds (3,500 kilograms) of food, equipment and research for the space station. It's due there Saturday, two days after the arrival of two fresh astronauts. NASA's shipper, Orbital ATK, asked Glenn's widow, Annie, for permission to use his name for the spacecraft, following his December death. Glenn, an original Mercury 7 astronaut, became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. He launched again in 1998 aboard shuttle Discovery at age 77, the oldest person ever in space. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery two weeks ago. "It is clearly a chance one more time to show John Glenn's name emblazoned in space," said Frank Culbertson, a former astronaut who now heads Orbital ATK's space systems group. Glenn was a courageous, pioneering leader who always promoted space and set a good example, Culbertson noted. "And I hope that putting his name on the space station is an inspiration to the next generation to aspire to do similar things, push the boundaries," he said. Besides supplies, the capsule contains a banner showing Glenn in his orange space shuttle launch suit — it's the first thing the station astronauts will see when they open the craft — as well as memorabilia for his family. Because the launch was delayed a month by hydraulic problems at the pad and on the rocket, no Glenn family members were able to make it to Cape Canaveral, according to Culbertson. Orbital ATK — one of NASA's prime delivery services for the space station, along with SpaceX — normally uses its own Virginia-based Antares rockets to launch its Cygnus cargo ships, named after the swan constellation. But it opted for the United Launch Alliance's bigger Atlas V rocket in order to carry up a heftier load. A new, larger greenhouse is flying up, along with equipment needed for a spacewalk next month. "Looks like we nailed the orbit once again," said Vern Thorp, a manager for the rocket maker. NASA's 360-degree video streaming of the launch — the first such attempt for a live broadcast — didn't go as well. Something went wrong moments before liftoff, and the video skipped over the actual rising of the rocket from the pad. NASA said it would try again, perhaps on an upcoming SpaceX delivery mission. Mission Control beamed up the launch broadcast for the three astronauts at the space station, which is orbiting 250 miles (about 400 kilometers) high. The American, Russian and Frenchman will be joined Thursday by another American and Russian who will take off from Kazakhstan. SpaceX and Boeing are developing new capsules that could fly U.S. astronauts to the space station as early as next year. Boeing's Starliner capsule will fly on the Atlas V. It was the last launch commentary for NASA spokesman George Diller, who is retiring next month after 37 years. His was the voice at liftoff for the final space shuttle flight, by Atlantis, in 2011, as well as the send-off of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and all five Hubble-servicing missions — hundreds of rocket launches in all. "We're really, really going to miss hearing your golden voice on console during launch, George," said Kennedy Space Center's director, Robert Cabana, patting him on the back. Diller said his time at the space agency has been a "heck of a ride." "I couldn't do better if I'd been riding a rocket." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html Orbital ATK: https://www.orbitalatk.com/ Copyright 2017 by The Associated Press.

That's because there was a special 360-degree camera installed near the base of the Atlas V rocket en route to the International Space Station. "The camera will stream video that you can manipulate," Rick Glasby of member station WFIT reports. "You can rotate the image, in real time, in a full 360-degree panorama. The video will continue through countdown and launch and until the rocket is out of sight." NASA worked in coordination with Orbital ATK, which makes the Cygnus spacecraft that sits atop the Atlas V, and rocket maker United Launch Alliance to place "four fisheye-lens cameras on the pad, around 300 feet from the rocket," the website Engadget explains. "Nearby, a computer protected by a blast-proof box will stitch images together in near-real time." What's in the cargo? More than 7,600 pounds of science research, crew supplies and hardware for the space laboratory, according to NASA. There are lots of ways to watch the launch — ULA has some tips here — but if you have a virtual reality headset, you can look around the launch pad as if you were standing on it. We can't all be rocket scientists, but this might be as close as we'll get. The resupply mission is a public-private partnership between NASA and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture owned by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. NASA awarded Orbital ATK and SpaceX commercial resupply services contracts, under which each company is to deliver at least 20 metric tons of cargo to the space station. united launch alliance NASA Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

April 18 - In the USA, many have welcomed President Trump's announcement last Friday naming former Congressmen Scott Garrett and Spencer Bachus as nominees to the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) board of directors. heavyliftpfi.com - News Desk Tuesday 18 April 2017 Share | The Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) said: "This is a crucial next step to restoring a quorum on the bank's board so it can approve transactions larger than USD10 million and restore American export competitiveness in the global marketplace." But others have questioned how firm Trump's support is for Ex-Im given that he regularly criticised the bank during his election campaign and promised to close it. Some members of Congress pointed out that Garrett has been one of the most vocal critics of Ex-Im and asked whether he is the right choice to be nominated as Ex-Im's president. Once a non-controversial US government agency that financed export credit loans, Ex-Im took centre stage in 2015, with many politicians criticising it as a vehicle for crony capitalism. Ex-Im's authorisation expired altogether for more than five months in 2015 before Congress restored its authority through to 2019 in December 2015. However, the Ex-Im Bank has been only partially operational since then because it lacks the requisite number of board members to authorise transactions of more than USD10 million. If Garrett and Bachus are confirmed to the board, Ex-Im will be restored to full power. The AIA added: "The bank currently has a backlog of 40 deals worth more than USD30 billion that it cannot process." It claimed: "Ex-Im Bank support is available to all American exporters when the private sector does not have the capacity to provide financing. It doesn't provide an advantage to our companies - rather it offsets the advantage that our foreign competitors have with export financing from 60 foreign government-backed export credit agencies." So, a victory for American manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric which have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products, as well as the companies that provide the logistics services to deliver those products.

That's because there was a special 360-degree camera installed near the base of the Atlas V rocket en route to the International Space Station. "The camera will stream video that you can manipulate," Rick Glasby of member station WFIT reports. "You can rotate the image, in real time, in a full 360-degree panorama. The video will continue through countdown and launch and until the rocket is out of sight." NASA worked in coordination with Orbital ATK, which makes the Cygnus spacecraft that sits atop the Atlas V, and rocket maker United Launch Alliance to place "four fisheye-lens cameras on the pad, around 300 feet from the rocket," the website Engadget explains. "Nearby, a computer protected by a blast-proof box will stitch images together in near-real time." What's in the cargo? More than 7,600 pounds of science research, crew supplies and hardware for the space laboratory, according to NASA. There are lots of ways to watch the launch — ULA has some tips here — but if you have a virtual reality headset, you can look around the launch pad as if you were standing on it. We can't all be rocket scientists, but this might be as close as we'll get. The resupply mission is a public-private partnership between NASA and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture owned by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. NASA awarded Orbital ATK and SpaceX commercial resupply services contracts, under which each company is to deliver at least 20 metric tons of cargo to the space station. Copyright 2017 NPR.

United Launch Alliance Originally published on April 18, 2017 11:03 am Updated at 11:15 a.m. ET A resupply rocket took off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Tuesday, and anyone with a computer, smartphone or virtual reality headset can experience it as if they were right on the launch pad. That's because there was a special 360-degree camera installed near the base of the Atlas V rocket en route to the International Space Station. "The camera will stream video that you can manipulate," Rick Glasby of member station WFIT reports. "You can rotate the image, in real time, in a full 360-degree panorama. The video will continue through countdown and launch and until the rocket is out of sight." NASA worked in coordination with Orbital ATK, which makes the Cygnus spacecraft that sits atop the Atlas V, and rocket maker United Launch Alliance to place "four fisheye-lens cameras on the pad, around 300 feet from the rocket," the website Engadget explains. "Nearby, a computer protected by a blast-proof box will stitch images together in near-real time." What's in the cargo? More than 7,600 pounds of science research, crew supplies and hardware for the space laboratory, according to NASA. There are lots of ways to watch the launch — ULA has some tips here — but if you have a virtual reality headset, you can look around the launch pad as if you were standing on it. We can't all be rocket scientists, but this might be as close as we'll get. The resupply mission is a public-private partnership between NASA and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture owned by Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

The accident shocked NASA as the agency was rushing to meet President Kennedy's 1961 challenge to have men on the moon by the end of the decade. The test was a dress rehearsal for the Apollo 1 crew — Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee. The ultimate goal was to check out the command module, NASA's first three-man spacecraft that would take astronauts to the moon. © 2017 Texas Public Radio About TPR Support TPR Financial Reports Public Events Calendar Employment/EEO Community Advisory Board Nominations Privacy Policy Contact TPR

With many cities around the world struggling to dispose of vast numbers of used plastic water bottles, the biodegradable 'Ooho balls' have begun quenching the thirst of consumers at special events in San Francisco and London. Read more 7 best biodegradable face wipes to remove your make-up The balls, which resemble large bubbles, have a jelly-like membrane made of plant and seaweed extracts. The company, Skipping Rocks Lab, says the membranes decompose after four to six weeks if not consumed. A report published by the London municipal authorities last Thursday said more than 4,000 plastic bottles had been removed from the River Thames in a one month period last year, demonstrating the scale of the waste problem. "We think Ooho, may not be the solution for all the applications that plastic bottles have, but definitely for short term consumption it could be a solution," Rodrigo Garcia Gonzalez, the founder of Skipping Rocks Lab, told Reuters. In a trial near London Bridge last Wednesday, the innovative balls drew a mixture of surprise, amusement and delight among those who sampled them.

Swedish student start-up signs deal to build electric cars for Siemens London based start-up to launch device to tackle air pollution London's city assembly said Ooho was a step forward. "It could be part of the solution but not the only solution. You also need to be able to refill bottles at railway stations for example," said Leonie Cooper, the Chair of the assembly's environment committee. Skipping Rocks, who spent three years developing Ooho, said they produce up to 2,000 balls a day but hope to increase that figure, extend the shelf-life of the product and improve the resistance of the membranes.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

By Samantha Schmidt, The Washington Post Posted April 18, 2017, at 9:21 a.m. A 20-year-old man accused of fatally shooting five people at a Macy’s store in a Washington state mall last year was found dead in a jail cell, authorities said. Jail personnel found Arcan Cetin unresponsive Sunday evening and began multiple lifesaving measures, including CPR, but were unable to revive him, according to a news release from the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office. He is believed to hanged himself, Skagit County prosecutors told the Seattle Times. The death remains under investigation. Cetin had recently been transferred to the Snohomish County Jail from Skagit County Corrections to await the results of a second mental competency evaluation. The transfer also was made because Cetin had made legally compromising comments about his criminal case to fellow inmates, Bronlea Mishler, the county’s communications coordinator told the Seattle Times. The inmate “did not let justice take its course,” Skagit County Prosecuting Attorney Rich Weyrich told the Skagit Valley Herald. “Some may have a great relief that it’s over; some may feel cheated.” Cetin was accused of shooting a teenage girl, a man and three women with a rifle on Sept. 23 at a Macy’s makeup counter in the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Washington, 65 miles north of Seattle. Detectives said surveillance video showed it only took Cetin about a minute to shoot all five victims. After the shooting, documents said, he left his Ruger rifle with a 25-round magazine on top of a cosmetics counter, then fled the mall in a car. Cetin confessed to the shooting to detectives but did not explain why he did it. Cetin had been charged with aggravated murder, which can bring the death penalty, but he had not entered pleas pending mental evaluations He had attempted suicide by swallowing medication in November 2015, and he was involuntarily committed at Fairfax Hospital, an inpatient psychiatric facility in Kirkland, Washington, according to court records obtained by the Seattle Times. At the time, Cetin was ranked as at risk for serious self-harm. He was diagnosed with disruptive disorder, depression, anxiety and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Doctors prescribed medication, and he also was undergoing court-ordered mental-health counseling in the months before the shootings, the Seattle Times reported. Cetin was a legal permanent resident of the U.S. who immigrated to this county as a young child from Adana, Turkey. He graduated in 2015 from high school in Oak Harbor, a rural community in western Washington state about 30 miles from the mall where he was accused of opening fire. Friends and neighbors described Cetin as a young man who had gotten in trouble with the law several times, with three assault charges since 2015, The Washington Post reported. Several of Cetin’s former classmates described him as a socially awkward teenager who later was given to inappropriately touching female students. After learning of Cetin’s death, the family of victim Chuck Eagan, a Boeing maintenance worker shot trying to protect his wife, said in a statement to the Skagit Valley Herald they were shocked. “We pray that the man repented to God before his death,” the statement said. “While this event puts to rest our fear of his release, we harbor no ill will towards Mr. Cetin or his family and pray for their comfort as we know all too well the pain of grief.”   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Reward posted in search for Bangor homicide suspect Ohio Street shooting victim dies Man charged with photographing, sharing picture of two young girls ‘It was really upsetting:’ Bangor mixed martial arts gym homeless after building sale Don’t expect to see lighthouses in this new TV show about Maine New poll shows that fewer and fewer people believe Trump’s lies Fox network’s response to sexual harassment reports sends chilling message to victims My job as a physician is to alleviate suffering, not cause death Democrats’ budget plan offers lawmakers a chance to show voters they’re listening Restaurant workers can tell you governing by referendum has consequences ‘It was really upsetting:’ Bangor mixed martial arts gym homeless after building sale Scarborough man, North Yarmouth woman top Maine finishers at Boston Marathon Old Town opens baseball title defense by beating Orono UMaine ties that bind: Former basketball standout savors NBA grind Wright, Benintendi lift Red Sox past Rays STATE & CAPITOL LePage: One school superintendent per county would still be too many POLLWAYS How I just missed becoming a widow GEORGE'S OUTDOOR NEWS Deer feeding, baiting, antler restrictions, and more debated at legislature THE BDN BUZZ This bank will take cheese as collateral for a loan #MAINE The Chainsmokers are more popular than ever, but not with music critics Don’t expect to see lighthouses in this new TV show about Maine Two Maine teachers get national recognition for nature-based teaching methods ‘It’s a part of life here’: Down East smelt fry a celebration of spring, local foods Strange and Delicious Vegetable Condiment Allan Holdsworth, progressive guitar virtuoso, dies at 70 Top Stories Wind power advocates alarmed by bill to move Monhegan test site Don’t expect to see lighthouses in this new TV show about Maine LePage intensifies push to cut the number of Maine school superintendents Church on the move — from former YMCA building to Bangor Mall Reward posted in search for Bangor homicide suspect Similar Articles 9.26.2016 Washington state mall shooter had no militant contact, official says 9.25.2016 Authorities capture suspect in mass shooting at Washington state mall 12.17.2012 Belfast District Court cases Sept. 11-Nov. 27, 2012 6.19.2011 Machias District Court, Cases Dec. 22, 2010 - May 20, 2011 10.10.2012 Belfast District Court cases May 26-Aug. 17, 2012 More in Nation   NCAA announces hockey regional sites; UMaine bid unaffected   Silicon Valley is giving employees paid time off to protest   Former President George H.W.

Previous Story The National Airline: Challenges and opportunities By Admin Added 18th April 2017 12:47 PM Print A A A Fill in your Name and Email Address to receive a Free Newsletter There should be the strong will in the government to oversee success of the industry. By Samson Rwahwire   The revival of the national airline is in high gear, this is as a result of the repeated calls from a section of the society and the Executive having goodwill to revive Uganda Airlines. Some of us who were born in the early eighties took a great deal of pride in state companies. While growing up at the Naguru Housing Estates, I was thrilled to know a neighbour was an employee of Uganda Airlines; Entebbe Airport was a dream place. The thrill of the roaring jumbo jets made us gaze up to the skies and watch the gigantic Sabena airlines cruise. It always made our hair stand on end! I should say, my selection of a course in Aeronautics was shaped by the pride we had that Uganda had an airline. Uganda Airlines was indeed the pride of the pearl of Africa.   Uganda Airlines started operations in 1977 during the Amin administration and was liquidated in 2001. What has the country generally lost? First and foremost, it is worth mentioning that the majority of countries in Africa and possibly in the world have national carriers with ownership ranging from private entities to a majority or minority state ownership shareholding. In Africa about 47 out of 54 countries own airlines or have a majority shareholding or minority shares in designated national airlines or flag carriers. The benefits of having a national carrier cannot be underestimated. The benefits achieved by Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt and South Africa through their respective airlines are there for any interested party to see. In the East African region only Uganda lacks a national carrier; even young Rwanda has a high flying Air Rwanda.   Let’s first study the tourism numbers, according to the World Tourism Organization, the most visited countries in 2015 by international tourist arrivals in order are: France, United States, Spain, China, Italy, Turkey, Germany, UK, Russia and Thailand. International tourism receipts grew to US$1.26 trillion in 2015, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.6% from 2014. The World Tourism Organization reports the following African countries, South Africa, Morocco, Tanzania, Mauritius, Tunisia, Uganda, Sudan, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Ghana as the top ten tourism earners for the year 2015. It’s evident that the billions of dollars raked in by tourism are also shared by the national carriers of the respective countries. Of the top largest airlines by passengers carried, four of them are based in United States; three of them are based in China. Well here we could argue that US and China are vast territorial countries. The list is also populated by Irish and UK low cost budget airlines Ryanair and Easyjet making it to the top ten respectively. When it comes to fleet size, still five out of ten are based in US, China has two, Germany, France and Canada with their respective national carriers Lufthansa, Air France and Air Canada making it to the top ten. In terms of the countries visited by airlines, the top four airlines are national carriers namely Turkish, Lufthansa, Air France and Qatar Airways. It’s evident that a functional national carrier spurs growth in tourism which is a multiplier effect in the profitability of the airline business.   An airline business needs top management; aviation is a highly volatile business and needs great care and handling. The main reason why most of national carriers have gone under is mismanagement. I don’t want to speak about US or UK which have no state owned national carriers, these are developed countries which can’t be compared to a least developed country like Uganda. Besides those countries already rake in billions of dollars and pounds respectively from the various tourism, educational and health facilities which we don’t have in Uganda. So comparing Uganda with US and UK not owning an airline is myopic in the business sense! Uganda definitely needs an airline, it definitely needs a national carrier, however, there should be the strong will in the government to oversee success of the industry.   Before the expansion at Entebbe airport, it was likened to a rural airport in developed countries. With the anticipated flow of oil cash, the President has time and again stressed that infrastructure will be the top priority, there’s need to construct a bigger regional hub to tap into the resources and also attract global carriers. If we study the model of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the latter started Emirates airlines and has made Dubai a top tourist destination which was actually a territory of sand dunes and now it’s a flourishing metropolis. The former started Etihad airlines and is racing towards catching up with Dubai. These two are using oil dollars to change the destiny of their provinces. We can also achieve the same with the oil resource. The tourism hotspots need to be renovated, when a tourist lands in Kampala, what should be our hotspots? Emin Pasha House, August House, Independence monument or Kasubi tombs? We need to set up tourist hotspots across the country. Most major cities in the world have zoos, a good example is the Singapore zoo. Uganda would have to visit some of these city zoos and understand how we can utilize our God given natural resource in attracting tourists.   On one of my trips to an academic conference, I used Egypt Air. Unfortunately, it turned out that the visa to my destination was to be activated the next day; to the amazement of myself and my fellow travelling colleagues Egypt Air booked us into a five star hotel in Cairo worth over 200 euros a night with full board! Imagine our joy at receiving such a treat from a national airline!! Well I later found out that the airline had put us up in a state owned hotel. During that day long stay in Egypt, we decided to visit the pyramids. This we did and also hired horses to ride to Giza. These activities were not free, we dug into our pockets for the experience. Looking back, initially we thought we had been given a free treat to a five star hotel, but in the end we spent more than the 200 euros offer because we left more dollars in Egypt as tourists because we hired a cab, horses, paid entrance fees, bought souvenirs etc. Now that is what is called marketing, and it is no secret that Cairo International Airport with its new International terminal is miles ahead of even European and US airports. Egypt receives millions of tourists because they have the infrastructure, an airline and the tourist hotspots.   A national carrier will need the skills base. It’s unfortunate that the country’s school of aviation isn’t performing as it’s supposed to be. The East African School of Aviation would play a major role towards the positive functioning of the national carrier. As a person who has worked as an aircraft maintenance engineer, Uganda has maybe not more than five qualified and experienced aircraft engineers with the capacity to support maintenance of Boeing and Airbus fleet. Even the fleet used by defunct Air Uganda used to be maintained by expatriates from France and Italy. We need to mitigate this through high level training, this is where the oil dollars can go to revamp the East African School of Aviation and probably turn it into an Aviation Institute offering aviation/ aeronautical degrees in the region.  A couple of Kenyan Universities are running undergraduate degrees in aviation and aeronautical engineering because of the availability of Kenya Airways and a host of other airlines. Uganda on the other hand is lagging behind with only Eagle Air to show and no university offering aviation/aerospace engineering discipline. Government needs to engage the experts, people like Cpt. Rubombora of Eagle Air and myself can have the needed input in revitalizing the aviation sector and the aviation school. Last but not least, an article in Handshake, IFC’s quarterly journal on PPPs, points out that overregulation, overstaffing, excessive debt, political interference and poor management are all too common which lead to the downfall of national carriers. The author also proposes that a major precondition is having a strong champion in government and a genuine wish for reform. It helps to get the tourist industry on board more competition means lower prices and more tourists.   Dr Samson Rwahwire holds a Master in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering; PhD in Materials Engineering and is a Senior Lecturer, Faculty of Engineering - Busitema University.

Industry sources told Vanguard that while the IOCs favour the use of drones and other high technology devices to monitor oil facilities, security agencies, such as the military and State Security Services, SSS are opposed to that, citing security concerns. Before now, the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ibas, had said that the Nigerian Navy would collaborate with other security agencies to deploy any measure that will result to checkmating illegal oil bunkering and pipeline vandalism. Ibas had stated: “We are deploying electronic surveillance equipment to ensure that this menace is brought to an end. “Secondly, the Navy has standby response teams ready to move at the quickest deployment because even if the drones are deployed as disclosed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, it is the Navy that will be required to implement the response aspect.” Security monitoring However, Vanguard learnt that the Navy must have succumbed to pressures and aligned with other security agencies who cautioned against the use of drones and remotely operated area vehicle, ROAV. The security agents were said to have insisted on the need to guard against allowing the technology to slip into the hands of terrorists, militants and kidnappers, who they fear, could use the technology to undermine the precarious security of the country. Drones are automated (pilotless) micro aircraft used for security monitoring and surveillance purposes, often described as “eyes in the sky.” According to the Social Science Research Network, SSRN, drones are “less expensive and more efficient than conventional aircraft at tracking the movements of large numbers of people without their knowledge. The capabilities of onboard instruments like high-resolution cameras, infrared devices, facial recognition systems, and other sensory enhancing technologies will make it virtually impossible to shield oneself from government watch.” This informed its use by the IOCs to monitor oil installations in Nigeria. It was learnt that between 2015 and 2016, Nigeria recorded about 3,400 attacks on the various pipelines in the country. The effect was a shut-in of about 250,000 barrels a day and a net loss of over $7 billion. According to an official of one of the IOCs who preferred to be anonymous, it is very expensive to use helicopter to monitor oil installations in Nigeria. He stated: “Helicopter is more expensive. Oil majors are not finding it funny, cost wise to deploy helicopter, especially this period that oil price is low. That is why we are talking about drones. Moreover, a drone can be deployed both at night and day, but helicopter is used only during the day,” he said. The plan of the oil majors to use drones in Nigeria followed the successful use in other oil producing countries. In 2013, ConocoPhillips (COP) conducted the first drone flight in commercial airspace off the coast of Alaska, in the United States of America. It used the ScanEagle, built by a subsidiary of Boeing Corporation. In 2014, BP Plc (BP) received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to use drones to monitor its pipeline network in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. It’s using the Puma AE, built by California-based AeroVironment Incorporated. Also in 2014, Royal Dutch Shell Plc began using drones from VDOS Global to inspect its flare stacks in the Gulf of Mexico.   Okogba View all posts by Okogba → Previous Post Power Investors flay FG’s plan to escrow discos’ accounts Next Post ExxonMobil partners with Kaduna State government to Improve education Disclaimer Comments expressed here do not reflect the opinions of vanguard newspapers or any employee thereof.

SCOUT Sign In Share & Embed Air Force Plans to Better Link F-22 and F-35 Sensor Targeting Technology Kris Osborn Monday at 8:54 PM / Originally published onWarrior The F-22 upgrade allows full functionality for the AIM-120D and AIM-9X Air-to-Air missiles as well as enhanced Air-to-Surface target location capabilities. The Air Force is in the early phases of designing new sensors for its stealthy 5th-generation F-22 Raptor as it proceeds with software upgrades, hardware adjustments, new antennas and data link improvements designed to better enable to connect the F-22 and F-35 sensor packages to one another, industry officials explained.   Sensor interoperability, two-way data links and other kinds of technical integration between the two 5th-Gen stealth aircraft are considered key to an Air Force combat strategy which intends for the F-22 speed and air-to-air combat supremacy to complement and work in tandem with the F-35's next-gen sensors, precision-attack technology, computers and multi-role fighting mission ability. "The F-22 is designed to fly in concert with F-35. Software Update 6 for the F-22 will give the Air Force a chance to link their sensor packages together. Sensors are a key component to its capability. As the F-22 gets its new weapons on board – you are going to need to upgrade the sensors to use the new weapons capability," John Cottam, F-22 Program Deputy, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, told Scout Warrior in an interview.  While the F-35 is engineered with dog-fighting abilities, its advanced sensor technology is intended to recognize enemy threats at much further distances - enabling earlier, longer-range attacks to destroy enemies in the air. Such technologies, which include 360-degree sensors known as Northrop Grumman's Distributed Aperture System and a long range Electro-Optical Targeting System, are designed to give the F-35 an ability to destroy targets at much longer ranges - therefore precluding the need to dogfight.  Like the F-35, the latest F-22s have radar (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and data-links (F-22 has LINK 16), radar warning receivers and targeting technologies. Being that the F-22 is regarded as the world's best air-to-air platform, an ability for an F-35 and F-22 to more quickly exchange sensor information such as targeting data would produce a potentially unprecedented battlefield advantage, industry developers and Air Force senior leaders have explained. The combined impact of each of the airplanes respective technological advantages makes for an unrivaled air-combat supremacy, observers have argued.  For example, either of the aircraft could use stealth technology to penetrate enemy airspace and destroy air defense systems. Once a safe air corridor is established for further attacks, an F-22 could maintain or ensure continued air supremacy while an F-35 conducted close-air-support ground attacks or pursued ISR missions with its drone-like video-surveillance technology. Additionally, either platform could identify targets for the other, drawing upon the strengths of each.  Conversely, an F-35 could use its long-range sensors and "sensor fusion" to identify airborne targets which the F-22 may be best suited to attack.  Air Force developers are, quite naturally, acutely aware of the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter and Russia's PAK-FA T-50 stealth aircraft as evidence that the US will need to work vigorously to sustain its technological edge. Along these lines, both the F-22 and F-35 are engineered to draw from "mission data files," described as on-board libraries storing information on known threats in particular geographical locations. This database is integrated into a radar warning receiver so that aircraft have the earliest possible indication of the threats they are seeing.  Air Force officials have told Scout Warrior that, by 2019, the service will begin upgrading F-22 functionality for the AIM-120D and AIM-9X Air-to-Air missiles as well as enhanced Air-to-Surface target location capabilities. The F-22 currently carries the AIM-9X Block 1 and the current upgrade will enable carriage of AIM-9X Block 2. Raytheon AIM-9X weapons developers explain that the Block 2 variant adds a redesigned fuze and a digital ignition safety device that enhances ground handling and in-flight safety. Block II also features updated electronics that enable significant enhancements, including lock-on-after-launch capability using a new weapon datalink to support beyond visual range engagements, a Raytheon statement said.  Another part of the weapons upgrade includes engineering the F-22 to fire the AIM-120D, a beyond visual range Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), designed for all weather day-and-night attacks; it is a "fire and forget" missile with active transmit radar guidance, Raytheon data states. The AIM-120D is built with upgrades to previous AMRAAM missiles by increasing attack range, GPS navigation, inertial measurment units and a two-way data link, Raytheon statements explain.  As the Air Force and Lockheed Martin move forward with weapons envelope expansions and enhancements for the F-22, there is of course a commensurate need to upgrade software and its on-board sensors to adjust to emerging future threats, industry developers explained. Ultimately, this effort will lead the Air Force to draft up requirements for new F-22 sensors.  Cottam also explained that the House and Senate have directed the Air Force to look at two different potential sensor upgrades for the F-22, an effort the service is now in the conceptual phase of exploring.  "A sensor enhancement program is now being configured. We do not know what that is going to entail because it is not yet funded by the Air Force and we have not seen a requirements documents," Cottam said. "Threats in the world are always evolving so we need to evolve this plane as well." An essential software adjustment, called “Update 6,” is now being worked on by Lockheed Martin engineers on contract with the Air Force. Work on the software is slated to be finished by 2020, Cottam added.   A hardware portion of the upgrades, called a “tactical mandate,” involves engineering new antennas specifically designed to preserve the stealth configuration of the F-22.  “New antennas have to be first constructed. They will be retrofitted onto the airplane. Because of the stealth configuration putting, antennas on is difficult and time consuming,” Cottam said. Meanwhile, the Air Force is performing key maintenance on the F-22 Raptor's stealth materials while upgrading the stealth fighter with new attack weapons to include improved air-to-air and air-to-surface strike technology, service officials said.  The AIM-120D also includes improved High-Angle Off-Boresight technology enabling the weapon to destroy targets at a wider range of angles.  Additional upgrades to the stealth fighter, slated for 2021, are designed to better enable digital communications via data links with 4th and 5th generation airplanes.  "The backbone of this upgrade also includes the installation of an open systems architecture that will allow for future upgrades to be done faster and at less expense than could be previously accomplished," 1st Lt. Carrie J. Volpe, Action Officer, Air Combat Command Public Affair, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va., told Scout Warrior.    Stealth Coating Maintenance The Air Force has contracted Lockheed Martin to perform essential maintenance to the F-22's low-observable stealth coating to ensure it is equipped to manage fast-emerging threats. Lockheed Martin completed the first F-22 Raptor at the company’s Inlet Coating Repair (ICR) Speedline, a company statement said.  "Periodic maintenance is required to maintain the special exterior coatings that contribute to the 5th Generation Raptor’s Very Low Observable radar cross-section," Lockheed stated.  The increase in F-22 deployments, including ongoing operational combat missions, has increased the demand for ICR. Additionally, Lockheed Martin is providing modification support services, analytical condition inspections, radar cross section turntable support and antenna calibration. F-22 Attack & Supercruise Technology  At the moment, targeting information from drones is relayed from the ground station back up to an F-22.  However, computer algorithms and technology is fast evolving such that aircraft like an F-22s will soon be able to quickly view drone video feeds in the cockpit without needing a ground station -- and eventually be able to control nearby drones from the air. These developments were highlighted in a special Scout Warrior interview with Air Force Chief Scientist Greg Zacharias.  U.S. Air Force Zacharias explained that fifth generation fighters such as the F-35 and F-22 are quickly approaching an ability to command-and-control nearby drones from the air. This would allow unmanned systems to deliver payload, test enemy air defenses and potentially extend the reach of ISR missions. Newer F-22s have a technology called Synthetic Aperture Radar, or SAR, which uses electromagnetic signals or “pings” to deliver a picture or rendering of the terrain below, allow for better target identification. The SAR technology sends a ping to the ground and then analyzes the return signal to calculate the contours, distance and characteristics of the ground below. Overall, the Air Force operates somewhere between 80 and 100 or more F-22s. Dave Majumdar of The National Interest writes that many would like to see more F-22s added to the Air Force arsenal. (Story HERE). For instance, some members of Congress, such as former Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va., have requested that more F-22s be built, given its technological superiority.  Citing budget concerns, Air Force officials have said it is unlikely the service will want to build new F-22s, however it is possible the Trump administration could want to change that.  F-22 Technologies The F-22 is known for a range of technologies including an ability called “super cruise” which enables the fighter to reach speeds of Mach 1.5 without needing to turn on its after burners. “The F-22 engines produce more thrust than any current fighter engine. The combination of sleek aerodynamic design and increased thrust allows the F-22 to cruise at supersonic airspeeds. Super Cruise greatly expands the F-22’s operating envelope in both speed and range over current fighters, which must use fuel-consuming afterburner to operate at supersonic speeds,” Col. Larry Broadwell, the Commander of the 1st Operations Group at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, told Scout Warrior in a special pilot interview last year.  The fighter jet fires a 20mm cannon and has the ability to carry and fire all the air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons including precision-guided ground bombs, such Joint Direct Attack Munitions called the GBU 32 and GBU 39, Broadwell explained. In the air-to-air configuration the Raptor carries six AIM-120 AMRAAMs and two AIM-9 Sidewinders, he added. “The F-22 possesses a sophisticated sensor suite allowing the pilot to track, identify, shoot and kill air-to-air threats before being detected. Significant advances in cockpit design and sensor fusion improve the pilot's situational awareness,” he said. It also uses what’s called a radar-warning receiver – a technology which uses an updateable data base called “mission data files” to recognize a wide-range of enemy fighters, Broadwell said. Made by Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the F-22 uses two Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofan engines with afterburners and two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles, an Air Force statement said.  It is 16-feet tall, 62-feet long and weighs 43,340 pounds. Its maximum take-off weight is 83,500. The aircraft was first introduced in December of 2005, and each plane costs $143 million, Air Force statements say. “Its greatest asset is the ability to target attack and kill an enemy without the enemy ever being aware they are there,” Broadwell added. The Air Force’s stealthy F-22 Raptor fighter jet delivered some of the first strikes in the U.S.-led attacks on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when aerial bombing began in 2014, service officials told Scout Warrior. After delivering some of the first strikes in the U.S. Coalition-led military action against ISIS, the F-22 began to shift its focus from an air-dominance mission to one more focused on supporting attacks on the ground. "An F-22 squadron led the first strike in OIR (Operation Inherent Resolve). The aircraft made historic contributions in the air-to-ground regime,” he added.  Even though ISIS does not have sophisticated air defenses or fighter jets of their own to challenge the F-22, there are still impactful ways in which the F-22 continues to greatly help the ongoing attacks, Broadwell said. “There are no issues with the air superiority mission. That is the first thing they focus on. After that, they can transition to what they have been doing over the last several months and that has been figuring out innovative ways to contribute in the air-to-ground regime to support the coalition,” Broadwell said.

The cash infusion comes as House Democrats face pressure to break from their party and support Trump administration initiatives that could benefit the lobbyists’ clients. A filing last week by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) shows four corporate lobbyists raised more than $380,000 for the organization -- the primary campaign arm for Democratic House candidates -- between January and March. The three-month figure is nearly four times as much as the amount lobbyists raised for the DCCC during the entire 2016 election cycle. In all, the DCCC reported raising $31 million in the first quarter of 2017. Since the election, the question of whether Democrats should embrace or spurn business interests has been a point of contention in the lingering feud between the party’s centrist officials, most of whom backed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who challenged the former secretary of state for the Democratic nomination. Last year, the Democratic National Committee ended its ban on lobbyist donations, which was put in place by former President Barack Obama. The decision angered many Sanders voters, who saw it as a move to boost Clinton’s fundraising in the primary race. In the wake of Clinton’s loss to Trump, progressives have pushed the party once again to reject lobbyist cash. Although the DCCC never prohibited lobbyist donations, the committee reported only about $100,000 in funds bundled by lobbyists in all of 2015 and 2016, according to a MapLight review of campaign finance records. Three of the lobbyists who have been collecting checks for the DCCC were major Clinton donors and fundraisers -- accounting for about $1.7 million in donations to the Clinton campaign and its joint fundraising account with the DNC and state parties. Some of their clients could have interests in legislative measures before the House of Representatives. Tony Podesta, who founded the Podesta Group lobbying firm, has raised $131,000 for the DCCC and donated $5,000 to the committee so far this year. His client list includes Walmart, Wells Fargo, as well as defense contractors Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. Trump and House Republicans have promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed after the 2008 financial crisis -- and House Democratic votes could be crucial to any repeal effort. Lobbying disclosures show Podesta’s firm has lobbied for Wells Fargo on “financial services regulation. The Podesta Group also lobbied on Dodd-Frank for the BMO Financial Corporation and the Investment Company Institute, a trade association representing the mutual fund industry. Trump is expected to seek Democratic House votes for measures to lower the corporate tax rate. Federal records show that in 2016, Podesta lobbied for Credit Suisse Securities, Oracle and Wal-Mart on the issue of “corporate tax reform.” Democrats have called for an investigation into the Trump administration’s links to Russia’s government. Podesta was hired to lobby for Sberbank, a Russian state-owned bank, during the 2016 election. He has also registered to lobby for at least six foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Podesta bundled $450,000 for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2016. His brother, John, was a former White House chief of staff for President Bill Clinton and chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Steve Elmendorf, who has raised $55,000 for the DCCC, leads the lobbying and public relations firm Subject Matter. His firm has lobbied on Dodd-Frank implementation for clients that include Goldman Sachs, MetLife and at least three financial industry trade associations. One of Elmendorf’s clients, CIT Group, recently gave Steven Mnuchin an $11 million payout upon his being appointed Treasury Secretary by Trump. Elmendorf also recently lobbied for General Electric and News Corporation on the issue of corporate tax policy. Congress is now considering legislation to strengthen airline passenger rights, after a senior citizen was bloodied, knocked semi-conscious and forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight to make room for a company employee. The efforts could face opposition from the industry trade group Airlines for America, another Elmendorf client. "We helped America's airline industry connect with policymakers," his firm’s website boasts. Another lobbyist, Vincent Roberti, Sr., has raised more than $88,000 for the DCCC year. He, too, has lobbied for Airlines for America. In recent months, Roberti has also lobbied on behalf of Citigroup, Pfizer, Boeing and AT&T. Unlike his colleagues, David Thomas, a partner at Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas, didn’t collect money for Clinton’s 2016 committees. He’s been an active fundraiser for the DCCC this year, though, raising almost $106,000. Thomas has lobbied for Chevron, Humana, and United Technologies Corporation. In 2011, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported that New Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Lujan planned to decline donations from lobbyists. Lujan, who currently chairs the DCCC, quickly reversed course. The DCCC and the lobbyists raising money for the committee did not respond to requests for comment. This story is a collaboration between International Business Times' David Sirota and MapLight's Andrew Perez.
