Rep. David Mack told several hundred people gathered at a rally Monday in North Charleston that unionizing workers at the plant in his district would be good for South Carolina’s economy. Mack says people will spend more money if they have more take-home wages in their pockets. Nearly 3,000 South Carolina Boeing employees vote Wednesday on whether or not to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Monday’s rally took place about a mile from the Chicago-based company’s facilities. The global aviation company came to South Carolina in part because the state has a minuscule union presence and state politicians and business leaders have for decades preached that unions hurt the workforce, not help it. ___ 7:45 a.m. Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers and union members are holding a rally in support of collective bargaining rights. Boeing workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are rallying Monday at the Crowne Plaza Charleston Airport Hotel in North Charleston.

(AP) — Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers gathered Monday to hear from union leaders why they should vote to organize in a state where union membership is the lowest in the country. Workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for an hour rallied at a hotel just a mile from Boeing’s North Charleston operation where, on Wednesday, nearly 3,000 workers are set to vote on whether to form a union and be represented by the Machinists. Organizers, community leaders and members of other unions voiced messages of support to the few hundred workers gathered in a large conference room. Ned Blevins, an Orthodox priest from Knoxville, Tennessee, even told attendees they would be “doing God’s work” both in standing up to company bosses and in fighting for their rights to unionize. Boeing employs a total of about 8,000 workers in North Charleston, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner. Engineers at the 100,000-square-foot center work on everything from electromagnetics and advanced aircraft production to chemical technology. Their work is used not only for the company’s commercial airliners but in defense and aerospace applications.

The Machinists petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a vote nearly two years ago but called it off after organizers said they’d been threatened during home visits to plant employees. The union has had members in the Charleston area before, winning the right to represent workers at Vought Aircraft Industries in 2007, a plant that Boeing later bought. Less than two years later, plant workers voted overwhelmingly against union representation. The global aviation company came to South Carolina in part because the state has a minuscule union presence. For decades, state politicians and business leaders have preached that unions hurt the workforce, not help it. During Gov. Nikki Haley’s first year in office, the National Labor Relations Board went to court to block Boeing from making its Dreamliner jet at a new North Charleston factory, saying Chicago-based Boeing built the South Carolina plant in retaliation for past union strikes at the company’s Washington state operations. The NLRB officially dropped its high-profile case later after the Machinists union in Washington approved a 4-year contract extension with Boeing and agreed to withdraw its charge that the company violated federal labor laws. Under the deal, Boeing promised to build the new version of its 737 airplane in Washington state. South Carolina is a right to work state, meaning workers can’t be compelled to join unions, even if the organizations represent them. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state’s union membership — 1.6 percent — is the lowest in the country. But some of Boeing’s South Carolina workforce was previously represented by unions in other places. On Monday, mechanic Steve Winckles said he was a stop steward while working at an airport in New York and doesn’t buy management’s argument that union representation could actually mean more conflict. “I think we need some stability,” he said. “It’s time.” ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

This week, Boeing workers in South Carolina will vote whether to unionize. Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images You can't drive anywhere in Charleston without being reminded of the upcoming vote at Boeing. On Wednesday, about 3,000 workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will decide whether they want to join the International Association of Machinists, or IAM. The state has the lowest union membership rate in the country. Around Charleston, Boeing has billboards, T-shirts and ads criticizing the IAM. And the union is countering with its own rallies and ads. Business Boeing To Start Trump Era With New Wave Of Downsizing State leaders have long fought efforts to unionize, arguing it damages South Carolina's competitiveness. In 2011, Boeing moved some assembly of its 787 Dreamliner plane from a union plant in Everett, Wash., to South Carolina. The National Labor Relations Board alleged the company's move was partially to retaliate against Boeing's Washington workers after they struck for higher pay and a better contract. But the charge was eventually dropped. At a recent union meeting near the plant in North Charleston, several workers are grabbing pizza and soda. Union organizer Mike Evans compares salaries at different Boeing sites, 24 of which the IAM represents. "I know what my members are getting paid up in Everett and in St. Louis and in Hunstville, Ala.," Evans says. "Is this good enough for you guys, or do you guys want a change?" According to the company, the pay varies by location. Trump's Presidency Poses Potential Threat To Labor Unions Joan Robinson-Berry leads Boeing's local operation. It's one of the biggest private employers in the Charleston area and is in line with average hourly wages in the area. "Most communities are paid to market," Robinson-Berry says. "Whether you're in a union or not, you're paid to market." Article continues after sponsorship It is cheaper for Boeing to build planes in South Carolina. In 2015, workers tried to organize, but the union canceled the vote citing confusion among workers. Robinson-Berry says the union is bad for business. "Our story is always consistent," she says. "We think this is a facility where we don't need a union. And our direct relationship with our employees to continue to grow this wonderful campus is our vision." South Carolina has enjoyed a manufacturing renaissance. Politicians don't just market the state as pro-business and non-union. During the 2015 campaign to unionize Boeing, the governor at the time, Nikki Haley, was featured in an anti-union radio ad. Lee Adler, with Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, says if workers organize at Boeing this year, it would be a big deal. "It would be as dramatic a private-sector union win as has occurred in the last decade," he says, "and would be a very, very inspirational moment for organized labor that's having a very tough time right now." Labor Unions Appear Set For More State-Level Defeats In 2017 It's a tough time especially in the Southeast, where many states have right-to-work laws that don't require workers to join labor unions or pay dues to keep a job. While overall union membership is down, there have been some gains. In the last few years, auto workers at plants in Tennessee and Alabama have organized. For Boeing employee Chris Jones, this vote has been a long time in the making. He's been working toward this week's vote for six years. "If we go to a vote, and if we lose, I'm OK with that because at least we got a say in it," he says. "It's overwhelmingly obvious that we've never had a voice." unions Boeing South Carolina Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business Documents show safety issues led to major fine for Boeing MONDAY, FEB. 13, 2017, 1:04 P.M. Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS SEATTLE – Newly released documents show that Boeing paid $12 million in late 2015 to settle Federal Aviation Administration investigations into safety issues. Though it was revealed in 2015 that Boeing paid the settlement, documents The Seattle Times obtained this month reveal the investigations came after a pattern of ignored procedures created quality issues on the production lines of Boeing and its suppliers. The FAA found that Boeing repeatedly failed to follow protocols designed to guard against production errors that put safety at risk. Some paperwork was falsified in that it was signed off as completed and checked when they were not. Other work was done without authorization. Some of the errors in manufacturing passed right through the system to airplanes in service. Boeing officials say they are committed to quality and safety. “None of these matters involved immediate safety of flight,” said Boeing spokesman Doug Alder. In one case, Air Canada crews in January discovered a puddle of fuel that had leaked from an engine pylon of the airline’s first 787 Dreamliner after it landed at an unnamed airport. Leaking fuel around a hot engine is a fire hazard. The FAA found that Boeing had noted the leak nine months earlier, before it delivered the plane, and had supposedly reworked the pylon to fix the problem. A mechanic and a quality- control inspector signed off on the rework as completed, but the FAA noted that “did not represent work performed.” Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the incident was one of “the typical types of issues that arise when introducing a new aircraft type.” In January 2015, a mechanic questioned by an FAA investigator admitted to falsely entering data about what tools he uses for inspections for seven or eight years. Capt. John Cox, a veteran pilot and founder of Washington, D.C.-based aviation safety consultancy Safety Operating Systems, said that admission is more startling than the errors themselves. “If the culture is, `We’ve got to get it out the door,’ and we start creating workarounds and normalized deviations from required procedures, that’s a culture that it is far more likely to experience serious safety issues,” he said. Adler, the Boeing spokesman, said many of the FAA documents reflect that the company has made a number of substantial improvements to its compliance systems following the investigations. “Boeing has worked with the FAA and invested significant resources to implement these improvements . including enhancing management oversight and accountability,” Alder said.

Though it was revealed in 2015 that Boeing paid the settlement, documents The Seattle Times (http://bit.ly/2kCOnyi) obtained this month reveal the investigations came after a pattern of ignored procedures created quality issues on the production lines of Boeing and its suppliers. The FAA found that Boeing repeatedly failed to follow protocols designed to guard against production errors that put safety at risk. Some paperwork was falsified in that it was signed off as completed and checked when they were not. Other work was done without authorization. Some of the errors in manufacturing passed right through the system to airplanes in service. Boeing officials say they are committed to quality and safety. "None of these matters involved immediate safety of flight," said Boeing spokesman Doug Alder. In one case, Air Canada crews in January discovered a puddle of fuel that had leaked from an engine pylon of the airline's first 787 Dreamliner after it landed at an unnamed airport. Leaking fuel around a hot engine is a fire hazard. The FAA found that Boeing had noted the leak nine months earlier, before it delivered the plane, and had supposedly reworked the pylon to fix the problem. A mechanic and a quality- control inspector signed off on the rework as completed, but the FAA noted that "did not represent work performed." Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the incident was one of "the typical types of issues that arise when introducing a new aircraft type." In January 2015, a mechanic questioned by an FAA investigator admitted to falsely entering data about what tools he uses for inspections for seven or eight years. Capt. John Cox, a veteran pilot and founder of Washington, D.C.-based aviation safety consultancy Safety Operating Systems, said that admission is more startling than the errors themselves. "If the culture is, 'We've got to get it out the door,' and we start creating workarounds and normalized deviations from required procedures, that's a culture that it is far more likely to experience serious safety issues," he said. Adler, the Boeing spokesman, said many of the FAA documents reflect that the company has made a number of substantial improvements to its compliance systems following the investigations. "Boeing has worked with the FAA and invested significant resources to implement these improvements . including enhancing management oversight and accountability," Alder said. ___ Information from: The Seattle Times, http://www.seattletimes.com Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Emirates Airline President Tim Clark said he is looking at buying smaller single-aisle jets, better known for tighter cabins and fewer amenities, rather than its opulent airliners with showers and walkup bars. Clark, longtime president of the world's largest international airline, told CNN's Richard Quest there are three different studies on his desk today. Over the next 18 months the airline will decide between adding the smaller aircraft like the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320, combining that with a deal for smaller twin-aisle jets, or continuing to only buy twin-aisle aircraft. Buying a new fleet of small single-aisle jets would be a radical departure for the Dubai-based airline. Emirates today relies solely on double-deck Airbus A380 superjumbo jets and Boeing 777s that seat from 266 all the way up to 615 passengers. It is the largest operator in the world for both. Related: The world's shortest superjumbo flight It's been more than 20 years since the airline last flew a single-aisle jet in its fleet and Emirates' strategy shift may set up a cut-throat competition between Boeing and Airbus, the two biggest airplane makers. Emirates uses its advantageous geography on the north side of the Arabian peninsula to reach billions of people within an eight hour flight. Its strategy is designed to connect two distant points on the planet using a single stop in Dubai, but its massive jets aren't right for every route. The airline in the coming years is plotting a move to a sprawling new airport, Dubai World Central, from its home at Dubai Internationa. Clark said the greater number of runways and gates means it could serve smaller cities. Related: Dubai airport widens gap over London's Heathrow Airport But before a decision is made, Emirates must first weather a brewing storm in the global economy and declining per passenger profit. Falling oil prices have been a boon for travelers seeking lower fares, but "we are notorious in our business of racing to the bottom whenever there is some advantage given to us and this is no exception," he said. "The last three of four years as the oil prices come off, we have reduced our fares to point of...stupidity in my view. That has affected our bottom line," said Clark. "We have a difficult time in global economics. We have a difficult time in global geopolitics and there is a degree of volatility out there." Emirates already has tens of billions of dollars of aircraft on order with both the Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in Europe, but it has slowed down its plans for buying more. The three options on Clark's desk again delays a decision on whether or not to buy Boeing 787s or Airbus A350s. Emirates canceled an order for 70 A350s in 2014 and recently deferred a batch of superjumbo A380s to 2018 and 2019. Related: Airbus isn't giving up on its A380 superjumbo "When the time is right we will decide," said Clark. "But so far, we are just biding our time to see which way it all pans out." At at a time when Middle East carriers are looking to curry favor with the Trump administration to ensure they continue to be allowed access to U.S. airports, Emirates' decision on big airplane purchases from the U.S. or Europe could have a political tinge. Related: Trump faces delicate balancing act between U.S. and foreign airlines U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines, have urged the State Department to review a treaty that allows the airlines of the U.S. and the home countries of fast-growing Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways unfettered access to each other's airports. As the trio has expanded in the U.S., that has drawn claims of illegal subsidies for the foreign airlines. It's a claim the state-supported trio denies. President Trump signaled in a meeting February 9 with airline CEOs that the administration will work to protect U.S. carriers from foreign competition, but has not specified how. Sean Spicer, White House Press Secretary, has also indicated that preserving manufacturing jobs like those at Boeing is a driving force behind the administration's thinking.

SEATTLE - Though Boeing paid $12 million in late 2015 to settle more than a dozen Federal Aviation Administration investigations, details of the problems found by the safety agency were not disclosed at the time. Documents obtained this month by The Seattle Times through a Freedom of Information Act request show the cases revealed a disquieting pattern of falsified paperwork and ignored procedures that created quality issues on the production lines of Boeing and its suppliers. The FAA found that Boeing repeatedly failed to follow protocols designed to guard against production errors that put safety at risk. Some tasks were signed off as completed and checked when they were not. Other work was done without authorization. The result was multiple errors in manufacturing, some of which passed right through the system to airplanes in service. Boeing also failed to take corrective action in a timely way after issues were discovered, the FAA found. In one case, Air Canada ground crews in January 2015 discovered a 3-foot-wide puddle of fuel that had leaked from an engine pylon of the airline's first 787 Dreamliner after it landed at an unnamed airport. Leaking fuel around a hot engine is a fire hazard. An FAA investigation revealed that Boeing had noted the leak nine months earlier, before it delivered the plane, and had supposedly reworked the pylon at the Everett plant to fix the problem. A mechanic and a quality-control inspector signed off on the rework as completed. But as the FAA noted, this "did not represent work performed." In other words, the repair work hadn't been done. Even after this instance of leaking fuel discovered on a jet carrying passengers, Boeing's actions to prevent such an error from happening again were "unsatisfactory," the FAA found. The FAA investigations also reached down into Boeing's supply chain, where a more egregious violation was noted. In January 2015, a mechanic rigging a large 777 cargo door at a Boeing supplier was questioned about his work by an FAA investigator. The mechanic acknowledged that "he does not use the inspection tools required and enters false inspection data on the work order." "He admitted to falsely entering the data for approximately 7-8 years," the FAA letter of investigation states. Capt. John Cox, a veteran pilot and founder of Washington, D.C.-based aviation safety consultancy Safety Operating Systems, said this startling admission worried him far more than any of the inadvertent mistakes listed in the FAA investigation. "When you have a deliberate act, and a culture that condones such a deliberate act, that is of much greater concern from a safety standpoint," Cox said. "If the culture is, 'We've got to get it out the door,' and we start creating workarounds and normalized deviations from required procedures, that's a culture that is far more likely to experience serious safety issues." Corrective action In addition to the relatively light fine in 2015, Boeing committed as part of the settlement to improve its internal quality oversight and management procedures. The FAA also put Boeing on probation for five years, subject to $24 million in additional penalties if it fails to carry through on those improvements. However, this is not the first time the FAA has found Boeing's manufacturing controls wanting. An intensive FAA audit in 2000 found "systemic" failures in the jetmaker's quality control processes -- chiefly inadequate inspection and deviance from required manufacturing procedures. That earlier investigation shook up the company's relations with the FAA and prompted Boeing to add hundreds of full-time quality inspectors. Seventeen years after that audit, the 2015 FAA settlement represents a new shake-up as some of the same issues resurface. Responding to Seattle Times questions, Boeing defended its broad commitment to quality and safety, and offered specific responses to some of the incidents detailed in the reports. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said, "None of these matters involved immediate safety of flight." He added that the settlement "reflects the FAA's recognition that (Boeing) has made a number of substantial improvements to its quality and compliance systems" following the investigations. "Boeing has worked with the FAA and invested significant resources to implement these improvements ... including enhancing management oversight and accountability," Alder said. As for the fuel-leak incident on the Air Canada 787, Alder said a subsequent audit determined that "this was an isolated event," and the company took "immediate corrective action" against both the Boeing mechanic and the Boeing inspector involved. Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said the incident was one of "the typical types of issues that arise when introducing a new aircraft type." Regarding the falsified supplier data in the rigging of 777 cargo doors, Alder said that after this incident, all 777 large cargo doors manufactured by that supplier were re-checked and met specifications. He added that Boeing's standard tests would in any case have detected any non-conformance in the doors before delivery. Nevertheless, he said the supplier's senior leadership had to present to Boeing a detailed plan to make sure it wouldn't happen again, and the mechanic who had been falsifying data was retrained. Other failures in quality workmanship cited by the FAA included: * After an FAA audit of 787 production processes found loose nuts incorrectly installed without a locking safety wire, Boeing's corrective action was found "insufficient to prevent further occurrences." Subsequently, airlines found heavy fuel leaks on 787s in passenger service, due to lock wire being either missing or installed backward. The FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive warning airlines the situation was "unsafe" and ordering immediate inspection of the same fuel connections on all 787s to prevent possible fuel fires. Following that directive, airlines found five more 787s with the faulty fuel couplings. New instructions, more training Boeing says it has revised work instructions and employee training "to prevent this from happening again." * The wrong tool was used to rig a 777 passenger door, and was then discovered left inside the door after a flight. And another tool was found post-flight left inside the leading edge of a 777 wing. Boeing says it has changed procedures so that employees are required to check out and check in tools, and some are decorated with bright paint or with streamers "to increase tool visibility." * Wiring bundles "on numerous aircraft at numerous station locations within the aircraft" had wires that were excessively taut, or bent too acutely, or riding over one another with crossovers unprotected, or installed without sufficient clearance. Poorly installed wiring can lead to electrical shorts. * Composites were cooked at too high a temperature at Boeing's advanced composites center on Marginal Way. * Tubing was not installed per the engineering drawing in 777s. * Decompression panels in the cargo bay of a 787 were improperly installed. A constant thread throughout the catalog of concerns in the investigation documents is that Boeing production workers and quality inspectors signed off on work that had not been done. Rules were also violated through lack of a required paper trail. Every step in the building of an airplane is supposed to be copiously documented, checked and rechecked. Yet the FAA found that parts and assemblies were removed and reworked, then reinstalled "without documentation or quality authorization," the investigations showed. A culture of safety The FAA now has fewer on-site quality inspectors than it did 17 years ago and relies on Boeing to follow precise procedural checks to assure airplane safety. The safety agency's main role is to check that Boeing sticks to the required quality assurance processes. Under the settlement, Boeing must provide the names and addresses of individual employees found to have falsely stamped any work, so the FAA could potentially initiate criminal prosecutions of such employees -- though that has never actually happened at Boeing. The settlement also addresses weaknesses in Boeing's supply chain. Boeing agreed to audit by last month a minimum percentage of its parts suppliers -- the percentage was redacted in the documents the FAA provided -- to determine if any are "accepting work that is not complete." As part of the settlement, the FAA said it agreed to limit the fine to $12 million only because of Boeing's "current and planned remedial efforts." Capt. Cox said he generally has a high regard for Boeing's commitment to safety and its system of repeated independent checks and so was surprised to hear of crucial details overlooked and failures passing through unnoticed. "First the worker and then a quality-assurance inspector both failing to address an issue such as a proper lockwire installation, this is not the Boeing way of doing business I've been familiar with -- which is a culture of safety, a culture of procedural compliance," he said. Given the millions of individual tasks that go into building each of the roughly 10,0000 Boeing aircraft now safely flying around the world, Cox said "it's pretty self-evident that they have good solid procedures." Still, he added, "they are not perfect." "This audit found weaknesses and gives them the opportunity to improve. It sounds like the FAA did their job." - The Seattle Times Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

Over the next 18 months the airline will decide between adding the smaller aircraft like the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320, combining that with a deal for smaller twin-aisle jets, or continuing to only buy twin-aisle aircraft. Buying a new fleet of small single-aisle jets would be a radical departure for the Dubai-based airline. Emirates today relies solely on double-deck Airbus A380 superjumbo jets and Boeing 777s that seat from 266 all the way up to 615 passengers. It is the largest operator in the world for both. It's been more than 20 years since the airline last flew a single-aisle jet in its fleet and Emirates' strategy shift may set up a cut-throat competition between Boeing and Airbus, the two biggest airplane makers. Emirates uses its advantageous geography on the north side of the Arabian peninsula to reach billions of people within an eight hour flight. Its strategy is designed to connect two distant points on the planet using a single stop in Dubai, but its massive jets aren't right for every route. The airline in the coming years is plotting a move to a sprawling new airport, Dubai World Central, from its home at Dubai Internationa. Clark said the greater number of runways and gates means it could serve smaller cities. But before a decision is made, Emirates must first weather a brewing storm in the global economy and declining per passenger profit. Falling oil prices have been a boon for travelers seeking lower fares, but "we are notorious in our business of racing to the bottom whenever there is some advantage given to us and this is no exception," he said. "The last three of four years as the oil prices come off, we have reduced our fares to point of...stupidity in my view. That has affected our bottom line," said Clark. "We have a difficult time in global economics. We have a difficult time in global geopolitics and there is a degree of volatility out there." Emirates already has tens of billions of dollars of aircraft on order with both the Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in Europe, but it has slowed down its plans for buying more. The three options on Clark's desk again delays a decision on whether or not to buy Boeing 787s or Airbus A350s. Emirates canceled an order for 70 A350s in 2014 and recently deferred a batch of superjumbo A380s to 2018 and 2019. "When the time is right we will decide," said Clark. "But so far, we are just biding our time to see which way it all pans out." At at a time when Middle East carriers are looking to curry favor with the Trump administration to ensure they continue to be allowed access to U.S. airports, Emirates' decision on big airplane purchases from the U.S. or Europe could have a political tinge. U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines, have urged the State Department to review a treaty that allows the airlines of the U.S. and the home countries of fast-growing Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways unfettered access to each other's airports. As the trio has expanded in the U.S., that has drawn claims of illegal subsidies for the foreign airlines. It's a claim the state-supported trio denies. President Trump signaled in a meeting February 9 with airline CEOs that the administration will work to protect U.S. carriers from foreign competition, but has not specified how. Sean Spicer, White House Press Secretary, has also indicated that preserving manufacturing jobs like those at Boeing is a driving force behind the administration's thinking.

Richards/AFP/Getty Images Two 787 Dreamliner aircraft are seen at the Boeing production facilities in 2012 in North Charleston, S.C. This week, Boeing workers in South Carolina will vote whether to unionize. Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images You can't drive anywhere in Charleston without being reminded of the upcoming vote at Boeing. On Wednesday, about 3,000 workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant will decide whether they want to join the International Association of Machinists, or IAM. The state has the lowest union membership rate in the country. Around Charleston, Boeing has billboards, T-shirts and ads criticizing the IAM. And the union is countering with its own rallies and ads. Business Boeing To Start Trump Era With New Wave Of Downsizing State leaders have long fought efforts to unionize, arguing it damages South Carolina's competitiveness. In 2011, Boeing moved some assembly of its 787 Dreamliner plane from a union plant in Everett, Wash., to South Carolina. The National Labor Relations Board alleged the company's move was partially to retaliate against Boeing's Washington workers after they struck for higher pay and a better contract. But the charge was eventually dropped. At a recent union meeting near the plant in North Charleston, several workers are grabbing pizza and soda. Union organizer Mike Evans compares salaries at different Boeing sites, 24 of which the IAM represents. "I know what my members are getting paid up in Everett and in St. Louis and in Hunstville, Ala.," Evans says. "Is this good enough for you guys, or do you guys want a change?" According to the company, the pay varies by location. Trump's Presidency Poses Potential Threat To Labor Unions Joan Robinson-Berry leads Boeing's local operation. It's one of the biggest private employers in the Charleston area and is in line with average hourly wages in the area. "Most communities are paid to market," Robinson-Berry says. "Whether you're in a union or not, you're paid to market." Article continues after sponsorship It is cheaper for Boeing to build planes in South Carolina. In 2015, workers tried to organize, but the union canceled the vote citing confusion among workers. Robinson-Berry says the union is bad for business. "Our story is always consistent," she says. "We think this is a facility where we don't need a union. And our direct relationship with our employees to continue to grow this wonderful campus is our vision." South Carolina has enjoyed a manufacturing renaissance. Politicians don't just market the state as pro-business and non-union. During the 2015 campaign to unionize Boeing, the governor at the time, Nikki Haley, was featured in an anti-union radio ad. Lee Adler, with Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, says if workers organize at Boeing this year, it would be a big deal. "It would be as dramatic a private-sector union win as has occurred in the last decade," he says, "and would be a very, very inspirational moment for organized labor that's having a very tough time right now." Labor Unions Appear Set For More State-Level Defeats In 2017 It's a tough time especially in the Southeast, where many states have right-to-work laws that don't require workers to join labor unions or pay dues to keep a job. While overall union membership is down, there have been some gains. In the last few years, auto workers at plants in Tennessee and Alabama have organized. For Boeing employee Chris Jones, this vote has been a long time in the making. He's been working toward this week's vote for six years. "If we go to a vote, and if we lose, I'm OK with that because at least we got a say in it," he says. "It's overwhelmingly obvious that we've never had a voice." unions Boeing South Carolina Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only

Emirates Airline President Tim Clark said he is looking at buying smaller single-aisle jets, better known for tighter cabins and fewer amenities, rather than its opulent airliners with showers and walkup bars.

REUTERS/Randall Hill/File Photo 10/10 By Alwyn Scott and Harriet McLeod | NEW YORK/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. NEW YORK/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. Boeing Co faces its first union vote on Wednesday at its aircraft factory in South Carolina, a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The world's largest planemaker is running a hardball campaign against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which is trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. "It would be a major, major win for the machinists if they got this," said Arthur Schwartz, an independent consultant who worked in labor relations at General Motors Co for two decades and does not represent either side. Opposition is strong in South Carolina, which is one of 28 states that does not require workers to join a union, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is the highest with 23.6 percent. The IAM canceled a voted at the Boeing plant in April 2015 after it claimed there was "political interference" from state officials and "misinformation" spread among workers. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. Boeing told Reuters in an emailed statement that in the current campaign it has hired the same lawyer who helped it defend against the IAM previously. Videos and posts on Boeing's web and social media sites portray the IAM as a "divisive" force that fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers into strikes. In one video on Boeing's site a production manager at Boeing South Carolina describes the tension and lost income from striking twice while he worked as a union machinist in Renton, Washington. "There was times where I wondered where I was going to be able to feed my kid," said the manager, Daniel Mihalic, over ominous music. "Please vote 'no' on February 15." Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent. The company said factory officials were unavailable for comment because "their time is committed to ensuring our teammates understand the voting process, the realities of union representation and the advantages of a nonunion environment." Boeing's videos are being aired on local TV stations - including during the Super Bowl - and also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, said in an interview. When the IAM filed for a vote with the National Labor Relations Board last month, Slater and others said, a display of diapers and clothing appeared in a break room. "The goods on display would cost your family $800," a sign said. "You have better things to do with your money than pay union dues." Slater said workers want higher wages and more certainty about their shifts, which change often. The IAM said hourly workers in South Carolina earn about 36 percent less than their counterparts in Washington. "We're tired of the back-and-forth, the constant inundation of the anti-union rhetoric," Slater said. "We're just ready to vote." STANDARD PLAY BOOK Boeing's campaign follows the usual "union avoidance" play book used by many manufacturers, labor experts said. That contrasts with the relationship Detroit automakers and the United Auto Workers union have forged. After years of struggle, the companies decided bad union relations were unproductive, former labor negotiators for Ford Motor Co and GM said. "Ford was the last to get organized of the Big Three, but we were the first to understand that we had a business partner in the UAW and we were going to work with them. We're not going to fight them," said Marty Mulloy, who served for nine years as Ford's vice president of labor affairs, retiring in 2013. Ford found negative campaigns did not work, he said, and would not use one today. "My experience has been working collaboratively with unions yields better results," Mulloy said. Going negative "just takes the animosity to another level. You take it from, 'I disagree with you on principle,' to 'I'm going to hire some people to try to discredit you and your institution.'" Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, which represents more than 35,000 union workers at Boeing in Washington state, said members are sending videos and posting words of support on Boeing's South Carolina Facebook page. But they have not paid much attention to Boeing's counter campaign, having seen such tactics before. "Personally, I hate seeing this in any anti-union campaign," he said. "I like people having a free choice on what they want to do, being able to ask questions and not seeing intimidation."

It took awhile for a coalition of supporters of the House GOP plan to crop up — and since then it’s taken a little bit longer to get a fuller rundown of the group’s membership. But wait no more: Morning Tax has 21 of the American Made Coalition’s current roster of around 25 members — and growing, according to coalition officials. Those 21: Blue Diamond Growers, Boeing, Caterpillar, Celanese, Celgene, Cook Medical, CoorsTek, Dow Chemical, Eli Lilly, General Electric, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, McIlhenny, Merck, Oracle, Pfizer, Qualcomm, Raytheon, S&P Global, United Technologies Corporation, Varian Medical Systems. Story Continued Below There’s definitely some capital-E exporters in that group, like GE, Boeing and Caterpillar, that would certainly benefit from the House’s border adjustment policy that would exempt exports from taxation. But there are also some lesser-known exporters, too, like Blue Diamond — think California almonds. And there’s Pfizer, which became perhaps the poster child for why the federal government needed to do more to stop corporate inversions, and which saw its merger with Allergan scuttled by the Treasury’s so-called “serial inverter” rules. Proponents of the House GOP plan say it would take away the incentive for those offshore deals. “Our coalition members represent exporters and importers, both small and large companies stretched across nearly every sector of the economy,” said John Gentzel, a spokesman for the group. WELCOME TO A NEW WEEK, and we’d like to wish a happy birthday to Toddler Tax, who turned two over the weekend, and to Brother Tax, who’s celebrating a slightly larger number than that today. On this day in 2004, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced it had found a white dwarf star that doubled as a diamond that weighs 10 billion trillion trillion carats — named Lucy, after The Beatles’ song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” What’s going on out there? Email: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, cwilhelm@politico.com. Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @colinwilhelm, @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax. DRIVING MONDAY: The Senate is expected to confirm Steven Mnuchin, formerly of Goldman Sachs and a producer of dozens of movies, to be Treasury secretary on Monday evening. The Wall Street Journal notes that Mnuchin having to wait more than three weeks into President Donald Trump’s term for confirmation, and the expected narrow margin in the Senate, could put him behind the eight-ball a bit, with the National Economic Council’s Gary Cohn playing “an increasingly influential role.” (More on Cohn below.) A SWISS MISS: Swiss voters were having none of a proposal to revamp how the country taxes corporations on Sunday, in what our European colleague Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli called an unexpected outcome. The proposed new regime would have brought a country not exactly known for financial transparency more in line with global norms, by getting rid of a perk for multinationals that gave them incentives for making their money elsewhere and still headquartering in Switzerland. But three in five Swiss voters rejected the plan, which some on the left thought was still tilted too much toward business and would leave the country strapped for revenue. So what are the Swiss to do now? Apparently, there’s not much of a Plan B. The Wall Street Journal: “Swiss finance minister Ueli Maurer said at a press conference Sunday that Switzerland is committed to changing its corporate tax system but that there isn’t much wiggle room to revise the plan that was voted down. He said it was unlikely now that a new program will be in place by January 2019, which is when the tax overhaul was slated to go into effect.” NAVIGATING THE BAT: David Perdue, a former retail executive, has certainly been among the more strident critics among Senate Republicans of the House’s tax reform plan and especially its border adjustment framework. But like a fair number of Georgia Republicans before him, Perdue is also a big fan of the FairTax, a version of which he introduced in his first 10 days in the Senate. What’s interesting there is that the FairTax, which would junk all current federal taxes in place of a national sales tax, also uses a border adjustment. Megan Whittemore, a spokeswoman for Perdue, said the two situations weren’t really comparable, telling Morning Tax that the FairTax “would be an entirely new tax system that eliminates personal, corporate, and payroll taxes altogether. The current tax rewrite before Congress adds a new layer of tax complexity on top of the existing system as opposed to a simplification of the whole thing.” But Kyle Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation wasn’t buying that argument, saying the border adjustment served basically the same function in both plans. Perdue wrote last week that the House plan would lead to lower economic growth and higher price tags for consumers. But Pomerleau, whose group has had some nice things to say about the House plan and the border adjustment framework, told Morning Tax in an email that “the economics are the same, so most of his criticisms apply to the FairTax as well.” WHAT ABOUT THE HOUSE? The Republican Study Committee, the large group of House conservatives, isn’t close to reaching a consensus on border adjustability, Bloomberg BNA’s Aaron Lorenzo reports. Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), the group’s chairman, said “it’s probably the most all-over-the-map discussion we had” at a meeting in New York last week. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) is himself an RSC member. THE DOOR REVOLVES: Rep. Tom Price’s departure from Congress to take over as Health and Human Services secretary is just the latest personnel move at the House Ways and Means Committee — at a time when the panel is seeking once-in-a-generation type goals, Pro Tax’s Brian Faler reports. There are already three GOP tax writers in the House (Sam Johnson, Lynn Jenkins and Kristi Noem) who have announced they won’t be coming back after this Congress, and more departures could be on the way. The downsides of having new members on the committee when chasing tax reform seem pretty clear, but Brian writes there are potential upsides as well — like newer members being more flexible, or having different perspectives. Also of note: The House GOP steering committee will meet Tuesday to decide Price’s replacement. Rep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.) has been among the names discussed for that opening. ABOUT THAT REPATRIATION: It’s hard to escape that Cohn is getting a lot of press these days. Bloomberg recently examined Cohn’s lead role in crafting Trump’s tax plan, which is expected in the next couple weeks. Cohn has suggested using a lower tax rate on offshore corporate profits to help pay for Trump’s infrastructure ambitions. For whatever it’s worth, Stat News noted recently that the pharmaceutical industry didn’t exactly follow through on its vow to create American jobs through the repatriation holiday enacted during the George W. Bush administration. Pharma did the opposite, actually, according to a report from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations back when former Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) was heading the panel. The findings included this tally from Pfizer: $35.5 billion repatriated, $13 billion in increased payouts to executives and almost 12,000 jobs lost over three years. RECONCILING WHAT? Stan Collender, the former longtime budget aide in the House and Senate, doesn’t see good tidings coming out of the House and Senate’s plans to use budget reconciliation to quash Obamacare and overhaul the tax code. In short, Collender writes at Forbes that Republicans are already facing a time crunch — they’ve got around three months to finish off their Affordable Care Act work, or the timeline starts to crumble. INTERNATIONAL UPDATE BAD TIDINGS AT MOSSACK FONSECA: Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca, the founding lawyers of the firm at the center of the Panama Papers, are being detained in Panama after being indicted on money-laundering charges, Reuters reports. Panama’s attorney general said that the authorities’ investigation “allegedly identifies the Panamanian firm as a criminal organization that is dedicated to hiding assets or money from suspicious origins.” STATE NEWS GETTING SERIOUS: It’s not just about the wine in Sonoma County, Calif. The Santa Rosa Press-Democrat reports that voters in the county are grappling with how to vote on a “cannabis business tax” to help ease the cost of implementing legal pot. “An approved tax, at the proposed initial rates would generate $6.3 million a year from cannabis businesses outside city limits. County officials say the funding is critical to usher the pot industry out of the legal shadows,” Guy Kovner reports.

USA TODAY NETWORK United Airlines said it's investigating after one of its pilots took to a plane’s intercom system this past Saturday with a bizarre rant that spooked passengers and touched on Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and her own divorce. The pilot boarded the plane dressed in street clothes, and her “long, bizarre speech” spooked more than a dozen passengers into leaving the aircraft, The Washington Post reports. United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobart confirmed to The Associated Press the pilot wasn't in uniform when she boarded the plane Saturday. He said the carrier brought in a replacement pilot for the Austin-to-San Francisco flight, which ultimately was delayed by about two hours. Passengers on the flight shared details of the unusual incident on social media, posting commentary and even video of the pilot talking to passengers over the intercom system.

It just really sort of went downhill from there and didn't make a lot of sense to any of us," O'Neal added. The Austin American-Statesmen cited a YouTube video of the incident – since removed – that the paper said showed some of the pilot's rant. In that video, the American-Statesman quoted the pilot as trying to reassure passengers by saying: "Don't worry, I'm going to let my co-pilot fly [the plane]. He's a man.” So, y'all.

He said the company would launch an investigation and discuss the matter with the pilot. “We hold our employees to the highest standards and have replaced this pilot with a new one to operate the flight, which has since departed from Austin,” the airline said in a formal statement. “We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.” TWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky Photo tour: Planespotting at San Francisco International (SFO) IN PICTURES: United Airlines launches San Francisco-Singapore nonstops FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn United Airlines launches San Francisco-Singapore nonstops  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

(AP) — Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers and union members are holding a rally in support of collective bargaining rights in the state where union membership is the lowest in the country. Boeing workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are holding a rally Monday at the Crowne Plaza Charleston Airport Hotel in North Charleston. Organizers are expected to speak, as are members of the community who support the effort. The rally is happening a mile from Boeing’s North Charleston operation, where nearly 3,000 workers vote Wednesday on whether to form a union and be represented by the Machinists. Federal News Radio conducted an exclusive data center survey to assess how agencies are storing data. Download the results. Boeing employs a total of about 8,000 workers in North Charleston, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner. Engineers at the 100,000-square-foot center work on everything from electromagnetics and advanced aircraft production to chemical technology. Their work is used not only for the company’s commercial airliners but in defense and aerospace applications. Advertisement The Machinists petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a vote nearly two years ago but called it off after organizers said they’d been threatened during home visits to plant employees. The union has had members in the Charleston area before, winning the right to represent workers at Vought Aircraft Industries in 2007, a plant that Boeing later bought. Less than two years later, plant workers voted against union representation. The global aviation company came to South Carolina in part because the state has a minuscule union presence. For decades, state politicians and business leaders have preached that unions hurt the workforce, not help it. South Carolina is a right to work state, meaning workers can’t be compelled to join unions, even if the organizations represent them. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state’s union membership — 1.6 percent — is the lowest in the country. Boeing has headquarters in Chicago. ___ Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP .

Continue Reading Below The world's largest planemaker is running a hardball campaign against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which is trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. "It would be a major, major win for the machinists if they got this," said Arthur Schwartz, an independent consultant who worked in labor relations at General Motors Co for two decades and does not represent either side. Opposition is strong in South Carolina, which is one of 28 states that does not require workers to join a union, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is the highest with 23.6 percent. The IAM canceled a voted at the Boeing plant in April 2015 after it claimed there was "political interference" from state officials and "misinformation" spread among workers. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. Boeing told Reuters in an emailed statement that in the current campaign it has hired the same lawyer who helped it defend against the IAM previously.

Wall St Extends Record Run as 'Trump Trade' Reignites Auto CEOs Want Trump to Order Review of 2025 Fuel Rules Trump Says 'Big-League' Tax Reform Details Coming in Weeks Videos and posts on Boeing's web and social media sites portray the IAM as a "divisive" force that fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers into strikes. In one video on Boeing's site a production manager at Boeing South Carolina describes the tension and lost income from striking twice while he worked as a union machinist in Renton, Washington. "There was times where I wondered where I was going to be able to feed my kid," said the manager, Daniel Mihalic, over ominous music. "Please vote 'no' on February 15." Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent. The company said factory officials were unavailable for comment because "their time is committed to ensuring our teammates understand the voting process, the realities of union representation and the advantages of a nonunion environment." Boeing's videos are being aired on local TV stations - including during the Super Bowl - and also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, said in an interview. When the IAM filed for a vote with the National Labor Relations Board last month, Slater and others said, a display of diapers and clothing appeared in a break room. "The goods on display would cost your family $800," a sign said. "You have better things to do with your money than pay union dues." Slater said workers want higher wages and more certainty about their shifts, which change often. The IAM said hourly workers in South Carolina earn about 36 percent less than their counterparts in Washington. "We're tired of the back-and-forth, the constant inundation of the anti-union rhetoric," Slater said. "We're just ready to vote."   STANDARD PLAY BOOK Boeing's campaign follows the usual "union avoidance" play book used by many manufacturers, labor experts said. That contrasts with the relationship Detroit automakers and the United Auto Workers union have forged. After years of struggle, the companies decided bad union relations were unproductive, former labor negotiators for Ford Motor Co and GM said. "Ford was the last to get organized of the Big Three, but we were the first to understand that we had a business partner in the UAW and we were going to work with them. We're not going to fight them," said Marty Mulloy, who served for nine years as Ford's vice president of labor affairs, retiring in 2013. Ford found negative campaigns did not work, he said, and would not use one today. "My experience has been working collaboratively with unions yields better results," Mulloy said. Going negative "just takes the animosity to another level. You take it from, 'I disagree with you on principle,' to 'I'm going to hire some people to try to discredit you and your institution.'" Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, which represents more than 35,000 union workers at Boeing in Washington state, said members are sending videos and posting words of support on Boeing's South Carolina Facebook page. But they have not paid much attention to Boeing's counter campaign, having seen such tactics before. "Personally, I hate seeing this in any anti-union campaign," he said. "I like people having a free choice on what they want to do, being able to ask questions and not seeing intimidation."

(AP) — Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers gathered Monday to hear from union leaders why they should vote to organize in a state where union membership is the lowest in the country. Workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for an hour rallied at a hotel just a mile from Boeing's North Charleston operation where, on Wednesday, nearly 3,000 workers are set to vote on whether to form a union and be represented by the Machinists. Organizers, community leaders and members of other unions voiced messages of support to the few hundred workers gathered in a large conference room. Ned Blevins, an Orthodox priest from Knoxville, Tennessee, even told attendees they would be "doing God's work" both in standing up to company bosses and in fighting for their rights to unionize. Boeing employs a total of about 8,000 workers in North Charleston, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner. Engineers at the 100,000-square-foot center work on everything from electromagnetics and advanced aircraft production to chemical technology. Their work is used not only for the company's commercial airliners but in defense and aerospace applications. The Machinists petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a vote nearly two years ago but called it off after organizers said they'd been threatened during home visits to plant employees. The union has had members in the Charleston area before, winning the right to represent workers at Vought Aircraft Industries in 2007, a plant that Boeing later bought. Less than two years later, plant workers voted overwhelmingly against union representation. The global aviation company came to South Carolina in part because the state has a minuscule union presence. For decades, state politicians and business leaders have preached that unions hurt the workforce, not help it. During Gov. Nikki Haley's first year in office, the National Labor Relations Board went to court to block Boeing from making its Dreamliner jet at a new North Charleston factory, saying Chicago-based Boeing built the South Carolina plant in retaliation for past union strikes at the company's Washington state operations. The NLRB officially dropped its high-profile case later after the Machinists union in Washington approved a 4-year contract extension with Boeing and agreed to withdraw its charge that the company violated federal labor laws. Under the deal, Boeing promised to build the new version of its 737 airplane in Washington state. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

South Carolina is a right to work state, meaning workers can't be compelled to join unions, even if the organizations represent them. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state's union membership — 1.6 percent — is the lowest in the country. But some of Boeing's South Carolina workforce was previously represented by unions in other places. On Monday, mechanic Steve Winckles said he was a stop steward while working at an airport in New York and doesn't buy management's argument that union representation could actually mean more conflict.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives During Gov. Nikki Haley's first year in office, the National Labor Relations Board went to court to block Boeing from making its Dreamliner jet at a new North Charleston factory, saying Chicago-based Boeing built the South Carolina plant in retaliation for past union strikes at the company's Washington state operations. The NLRB officially dropped its high-profile case later after the Machinists union in Washington approved a 4-year contract extension with Boeing and agreed to withdraw its charge that the company violated federal labor laws. Under the deal, Boeing promised to build the new version of its 737 airplane in Washington state. South Carolina is a right to work state, meaning workers can't be compelled to join unions, even if the organizations represent them. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state's union membership — 1.6 percent — is the lowest in the country. But some of Boeing's South Carolina workforce was previously represented by unions in other places. On Monday, mechanic Steve Winckles said he was a stop steward while working at an airport in New York and doesn't buy management's argument that union representation could actually mean more conflict.

(AP) - Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers and union members are holding a rally in support of collective bargaining rights in the state where union membership is the lowest in the country. Boeing workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers are holding a rally Monday at the Crowne Plaza Charleston Airport Hotel in North Charleston. Organizers are expected to speak, as are members of the community who support the effort. The rally is happening a mile from Boeing's North Charleston operation, where nearly 3,000 workers vote Wednesday on whether to form a union and be represented by the Machinists. Boeing employs a total of about 8,000 workers in North Charleston, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner. Engineers at the 100,000-square-foot center work on everything from electromagnetics and advanced aircraft production to chemical technology. Their work is used not only for the company's commercial airliners but in defense and aerospace applications. The Machinists petitioned the National Labor Relations Board for a vote nearly two years ago but called it off after organizers said they'd been threatened during home visits to plant employees.

Buy Now DREW NASH, TIMES-NEWS Photos Burt Berlin shot in Seattle during the early 90s are displayed in his home at Bridgeview Estates in Twin Falls in this Jan. 30 photo. TWIN FALLS — Burt Berlin is still chasing the perfect light. Berlin hasn’t put down his camera since retiring from Boeing as design engineer in 1983. He designed jet engines and worked on the design of the first commercial jet airplane. “I never hesitated when I quit Boeing,” he said. “I went downtown and bought lenses.” At age 93, Berlin still hikes to capture moments in nature. When he lived in the Seattle-area, he spent his days backpacking, climbing and salmon fishing. He always carried a folding camera in his backpack. His traveling partner these days is his niece Penny Earl. Berlin and Earl visited Castle Rocks State Park in late January for a few days photographing the landscape and animals. Earl was in Almo to check in and care for her mother. “I hitched a ride,” Berlin said. “I got quite a bit at Castle Rocks in the snow.” The two saw a flock of turkeys and showed off some shots Jan. 30 that they captured over their three-day weekend. Other photographs Berlin took covered his walls. Many of them were of urban landscapes — a broken mannequin, reflections of buildings in water puddles and the back of a homeless man sleeping in a doorway — a far different scene from the turkeys trotting through snow. Berlin’s urban work is on display through March 4 at the Twin Falls Center for the Arts. His exhibit, “Then and Now, Back Alley Soul,” features film photographs of the alleys, fire escapes, building architecture and graffiti of Seattle’s Skid Row in 1994. The year-long project required him to blend in and gain the trust of the poor and homeless who lived downtown. “He had to go into disguise so they’d accept him,” Earl said. Berlin grew a beard and often left the camera at home. A framed picture of Berlin’s before-and-after transformation hangs on the wall of his apartment at Bridgeview Estates. One shows him with a beard and the other pictures him shaved. Sometimes, Berlin simply mingled with street people while they leaned against dumpsters, not talking, just hanging out. A strategy to gain trust and study the light. It didn’t always work. Once, he got slammed against a wall. “They just noticed I wasn’t one of them,” he said. He even had to jump on a passing truck to avoid another altercation. Berlin’s Skid Row exhibit has also been on display at the Mercerview Island Gallery in Mercer Island, Wash; Benham Studio Gallery in Seattle and the Salt Lake City Museum of Art. “The stories behind his photographs were very interesting,” said Carolyn White, executive director of the Magic Valley Arts Council. “During the era when he took the photographs it was rather unique. There were artists that lived in these Skid Row apartments, and he captured a lot of that art on film. He photographed the alleys in a really unique and interesting way. It emphasized the art that was there and a little bit of that lifestyle and that gritty Skid Row atmosphere.” At least once, that grittiest came straight to Berlin. While working on his project, he met a man named Tom. “He came to me and asked me what I was doing,” Berlin said. “He shook his head and told me to stay away from Third Avenue.” Berlin and Tom became good friends, and Berlin even hired Tom to do some work on his cabin. One time he allowed Tom to stay at his house while he went away for Christmas vacation. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Berlin said he woke Tom’s friend and told him to leave. But when he told Tom to leave, too, he refused. That’s when Berlin called the police. It was the last time he ever saw Tom. Originally from the Minidoka area, Berlin moved back to the Magic Valley eight months ago. For the past 64 years he lived on Mercer Island outside of Seattle. “I hit 93 years old and time came to come home,” he said. “All of my family is down in this country. I sent out an S.O.S., and a big truck came and picked me up.” Berlin’s work can also be found on cards sold at the Tracy General Store in Almo. He has a series of photos that feature climbers at Castle Rocks State Park and City of Rocks National Reserve. In Seattle, he used to sell photos of the city skyline and other nature shots. One of the framed photos in his home is of a snowy egret at Lake Walcott. “It was always exciting to have uncle Burt come visit,” Earl said. “I’d go with him and learned a lot from him. It’s fun to watch him work. He knows his stuff. He’s got a lot of talent.” Earl also knows cameras and used to work at the Camera Center in Twin Falls. She recently retired as the executive director of the Twin Falls Housing Authority, so lately, she has more time to spend with her uncle. His return to Idaho has been good for her: “Since he’s been here, he’s got me re-inspired.” +7 Southern Idaho Local News Gallery: Burt Berlin, photographer Feb 7, 2017 0 See the photos Berlin’s images will also be on display Friday and Saturday at Bridgeview Estates.

Home India news Showdown of America First versus Made-in-India looms at Aero India 2017 Showdown of America First versus Made-in-India looms at Aero India 2017 Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. promised to build plants in India if the world’s biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before President Donald Trump’s America First call. By: Bloomberg | Published: February 13, 2017 12:58 PM RDO-Embraer AEW&CS (Air-Borne Early Warning and Control System) aircraft on a sortie during a rehersal ahead of AERO INDIA 2017 at Yelahanka air base in Bengaluru on Sunday. PTI Photo Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. promised to build plants in India if the world’s biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before President Donald Trump’s America First call. This week will be a test for that promise as the biggest U.S. defense contractors, Russia’s MiG Corp., and Europe’s Airbus SE line up to display their wares at an air show in Bengaluru in southern India. Even as they compete for deals, they could find themselves torn between Trump’s push for companies to keep jobs in the U.S. — he has singled out a number of multinational firms on Twitter for public criticism — and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own program that seeks to tie military contracts to some of the manufacturing being done in India. “All of us in Washington are guessing where Trump is going to land on these issues,” said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. “He has certainly been very clear in his tweets and direct outreach to American companies that he wants to try to ensure that people don’t move production facilities and try to retain jobs in the U.S.” India’s Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will use the airshow to outline Modi’s plans to boost the domestic defense industry by giving contracts to local companies, as well as asking foreign manufacturers to tie up with Indian firms, according to people familiar with the plan who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Modi’s promise to shell out $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, submarines, howitzers and helmets to modernize his armed forces came with one call — Make in India. Sensing an opportunity, local conglomerates Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. have expanded more into the defense sector and formed joint ventures with international manufacturers. India, which has traditionally relied on Russia and the former Soviet Union for fighter jets, is increasingly warming to the U.S. In his first phone conversation with Parrikar, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis committed to build upon the “tremendous progress in bilateral defense cooperation made in recent years,” a Pentagon spokesman said last week. Watch this also: Modi’s domestic manufacturing program is a centerpiece of his economic policy that seeks to boost manufacturing to 25 percent of gross domestic product by 2022 from 18 percent now, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. French Deal Lockheed Martin offered to make its F-16 fighter jet in India, after India scrapped an initial tender with Paris-based Dassault Aviation SA for 126 planes. India later decided to directly buy just 36 fighter jets from the French government. That still leaves the country short of planes, meaning potential deals worth billions of dollars are on offer. Trump’s administration will want to take a fresh look at some of Lockheed’s proposals, including plans to build the F-16 in India, the company said. All previous orders from India have created jobs for Boeing in the U.S., Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said in an interview. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Boeing as well as Sweden’s Saab AB are offering to shift some production to India as they seek to win contracts. Boeing and Lockheed have also been on the receiving end of Trump’s criticism in recent times. “The politics of it looks bad, in terms of the appearance back in the U.S. — especially when he’s talking about an America First campaign,” said Anit Mukherjee, a former Indian Army major and an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with the Make in India thing — which in itself is a big question mark — then perhaps he might intervene on that.” U.S.-India defense ties have grown in recent years, in part as India’s neighbor China has increased its military clout in the region. India has also sought to diversify its sources of arms imports from a Cold War-era reliance on Russian weapons. The potential for U.S. companies to win business by manufacturing “not so state-of-the-art” equipment in India could be a trade off for Trump, said Amit Cowshish, a former financial adviser to India’s defense ministry and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Indian Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. Trump’s protectionist rhetoric so far seems to be aimed at products consumed in the U.S. and not at jobs created overseas to support a foreign market, said New Delhi-based Ankur Gupta, vice president for aerospace and defense at Ernst & Young. Still, “he’s completely unpredictable on this,” said Mukherjee from RSIS, referring to possible Trump intervention over foreign manufacturing by U.S. firms. “It has a potential to create problems. I’m sure it will be discussed between Indian and U.S. officials.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

File/Grace Beahm/Staff web only top story What you need to know about the Boeing vote in South Carolina By David Wren David Wren Feb 11, 2017 Updated Feb 13, 2017 (…) Buy Now Boeing Co. production workers in North Charleston voted Wednesday on whether they want to join the International Association of Machinists. File/Grace Beahm/Staff Hourly production workers at Boeing Co.'s 787 Dreamliner plant and other facilities in North Charleston will vote Wednesday on whether they want to be represented by the International Association of Machinists union. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions: Who conducts the election? Representatives from the National Labor Relations Board will conduct the election and count the ballots. Boeing and the IAM are allowed to observe the election as it takes place. Is voting mandatory? No. Will the union or Boeing know how someone voted? No, the election is conducted by a secret ballot. How is a winner determined? The winner must receive at least one more vote than the loser. What if a vote is challenged? Either side can challenge an employee's vote by stating the challenge to an NLRB official at the time the vote is taking place. Challenged votes are placed in an envelope and are not counted with other ballots. If the number of challenged votes would not make a difference in the outcome of the election, they are not included in the results. What would prompt a challenge? Usually an ineligible employee trying to cast a ballot. When will a winner be announced? Wednesday, after the votes have been counted. What happens if the IAM wins the election? The union will begin holding meetings and conducting surveys of workers to determine the key issues they want to address in a contract. Representatives from the IAM and Boeing will then negotiate a contract that must be ratified by a majority of union members. Contracts typically cover issues such as wages, hours and overtime, work breaks, seniority and grievance procedures. How long does that process take? Usually about six months. How long does the contract last? Typically between three and five years. Who would be covered under the contract? The contract would be specific to non-management, production workers at Boeing's North Charleston facilities. It would not cover IAM workers at other facilities. What happens in the interim between a union election and contract ratification? The status quo exists and Boeing cannot make arbitrary or wholesale changes to such things as scheduling, pay or benefits. Can union officials enter Boeing property before a contract is ratified? No, unless they are invited onto the property by Boeing. If the union wins the election, do workers have to join? No. South Carolina is a right-to-work state, which means employees cannot be forced to join a collective bargaining unit. If eligible workers don't join the union, will they still be covered by the contract that's negotiated? Yes. Reach David Wren at 843-937-5550 and follow him on Twitter @David_Wren_. More information IAM showdown at Boeing's North Charleston plant not necessarily a harbinger of S.C. union activity It's being billed as the biggest test for organized labor in South Carolina since textile mills dominated the Palmetto State's economy decades ago.

The Executive Forum on Bermuda Captive Insurance Solutions will visit Chicago March 7 and Boston March 9, offering insurance buyers, risk managers and financial executives an opportunity to learn more about captive insurance and the benefits Bermuda offers as a blue-chip international financial centre. Captive insurance, or self-insurance, allows global corporations a cost-effective way to efficiently manage today’s complex risks, including healthcare and cyber risks, as well as enterprise risk management. “I’m delighted to have as many captive industry partners and their clients involved in helping promote our captive insurance sector,” said BDA Business Development Manager Jereme Ramsay. “We have a very busy schedule in both cities, with two main forums for company executives, along with six mini-forums for brokers, and we’re also hosting a special healthcare-related presentation and networking reception in Boston—all over a three-day period.” The forums are scheduled for 8:30–11:30am both days and will feature two sessions: the first, Captive Solutions & Strategies, explains what a captive insurer is, how to structure a captive, key reasons to set up a captive, along with common risks insured, citing several case studies. A second session focuses on regulatory, tax and legal frameworks, and includes two case studies presented by law firm Baker McKenzie and US manufacturing multinational Boeing. Participants in BDA’s Chicago and Boston captive insurance forums [top, from left]: GM’s Al Gier, Janita Burke of Estera, Richard Daley of JLT, Rick Irvine of PwC, Leslie Robinson of BMA, Tom Kelly of KPMG; [bottom, from left]: Adam Miholic of Marsh, Jamie Sewell of Boeing, Dennis Silvia of Cedar Consulting, Bob Spencer of Baker McKenzie, Nick Warren of Willis Towers Watson, and Michael Serricchio of Marsh “I’m pleased to take part in this forum to help highlight the many advantages of Bermuda as a captive domicile,” said Jamie Sewell, Chicago-based Manager for Risk Management & Insurance for Boeing. “We chose Bermuda specifically for our captive because it’s a respected, well-regulated jurisdiction and its insurance and reinsurance sectors are world-renowned.” Bermuda’s captive insurance market is the global leader, with close to 800 companies generating more than $55 billion in annual gross written premiums. The presence of commercial insurance and reinsurance companies on the island allows captive owners and operators to access open-market underwriting capacity not found in other captive domiciles, making Bermuda a one-stop-shop. Notably, captives are also increasingly popular tools for wealth preservation and succession planning for HNWIs and family offices. Ramsay said the US remains Bermuda’s greatest source of captives—generating most new formations in recent years. “With increasing competition in the captive space, especially with the rise of pop-up domiciles in the US, we feel it’s more critical than ever to promote Bermuda’s value as a top-tier jurisdiction and highlight our robust re/insurance market,” he noted. “The heightened involvement and support by industry speaks to the collaborative efforts of the BDA, our regulator and private sector to maintain Bermuda’s leading position as the domicile of choice for captive insurance business.” Industry speakers include Boeing’s Sewell; Al Gier, Global Director of Corporate Risk Management & Insurance for General Motors, who also serves as President of the Bermuda Captive Owners Association [BCOA]; Richard Daley, President of JLT Insurance Management, Bermuda; Robert Spencer, former chief financial officer for Baker McKenzie in Chicago; and Leslie Robinson, Assistant Director of Licensing & Authorisations for the Bermuda Monetary Authority [BMA]. Other participating firms include: Cedar Consulting of Bermuda, Estera Services [Bermuda], Marsh, KPMG Bermuda, Marsh, PwC Bermuda and Willis Towers Watson Management. “The forum is a great opportunity for insurance brokers and risk managers situated in Boston and Chicago to learn about the benefits of managing risk through captives in Bermuda directly from key industry panellists and captive owners,” noted speaker Janita Burke, of Estera. “Attendees will learn about Bermuda’s ability to offer diverse solutions to challenging and complex risk strategies and why Bermuda as a domicile has become the global leader in captive insurance.” There is no cost to attend the half-day sessions; registration can be done here for Chicago and here for Boston. The dedicated evening healthcare event is being held in Boston as the city is a key market for Bermuda’s captive insurance and re/insurance for the healthcare sector, serving major hospital and long-term care chains, physicians groups and research laboratories.

Wednesday’s vote comes two years after a planned vote on unionization, which was called off by the union just days beforehand. Officials from the National Labor Relations Board will conduct an election Wednesday while Boeing and IAM representatives observe. South Carolina has the lowest rate of unionization, with 1.6 percent of workers belonging to a union. North Carolina is the second lowest state, with a rate of 3.0 percent. (RELATED: Union Membership Continues To Decline) Trump is expected to visit Friday in order to congratulate his pick to serve as U.N. ambassador, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and to visit the Boeing plant in North Charleston. The Boeing unionization vote is viewed by many as the largest test for organized labor in South Carolina in decades. The Dreamliner has turned into a profitable venture for the company, after a decade of losses. Air carriers around the world are placing orders with Boeing for the wide-bodied 787. Singapore Air Lines recently purchased 39 additional planes, a contract worth $13.8 billion. During the campaign, Trump blasted Boeing for plans to build a factory in China. While the plant was intended to paint planes that were bound for Southeast Asia, Trump mentioned the company numerous times, asserting the plant would cost American jobs. The world’s largest airplane manufacturer is careful to keep a healthy relationship with Southeast Asia because of region’s expanding markets and increasing demands for wide-bodied long haul planes. “Notice: Expect VIP movement February 17, 2017 in the vicinity of Charleston, SC,” said a Federal Aviation Administration advisory released Sunday.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    At their post-Civil War apogee, 19th-century Republicans were the party of activist government, using protectionism to pick commercial winners and promising wondrous benefits from government's deft interventions in economic life. Today, a Republican administration promises that wisely wielded Washington power can rearrange commercial activities in ways superior to those produced by private-sector calculations in free market transactions. According to the Financial Times, which interviewed him, Peter Navarro, head of the president's National Trade Council, says an administration priority is "unwinding and repatriating the international supply chains on which many U.S. multinational companies rely." This will make life interesting for, among many others, America's third and 24th largest corporations, Apple and Boeing. The tiny print on the back of iPhones accurately says it is "assembled," not manufactured, in China. The American Enterprise Institute's James Pethokoukis notes that parts come from South Korea, Japan, Italy, Taiwan, Germany and the United States. Components of Boeing airliners' wings come from Japan, South Korea and Australia; horizontal stabilizers and center fuselages from Italy; cargo access doors from Sweden; passenger entry doors from France; landing gear doors from Canada; engines and landing gear from Britain. Navarro's "unwinding and repatriating" is, to say no more, part of an improbable project: making American greater by making Apple, Boeing and many other corporations much less efficient and less competitive. This will further slow economic growth, making even more unattainable the 4 percent (more than double the economy's average growth this century) or higher growth that the administration says will enable it to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure (including a $15 billion or so wall on the Mexican border, begun after nearly a decade of net negative immigration from Mexico), while substantially increasing military spending, leaving entitlements unreformed and delivering enormous tax cuts. Cuts that, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (co-chaired by Republican Mitch Daniels and Democrat Leon Panetta, both former directors of the Office of Management and Budget), will reduce revenues by $5.8 trillion over 10 years. This, as the Congressional Budget Office projects that even without any of the administration's proposed spending spree and tax cuts, under current law the national debt would increase by $9.4 trillion. Speaking of supply chains: In her book "The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy," Georgetown University's Pietra Rivoli recounts a conversation with a man from Shanghai who said that if she would come to China he would help her see various places involved in producing the inexpensive T-shirts exported to America. She would see where the yarn is spun, the fabric is knit and the shirts are sewn. Asked if she could see where the cotton is grown, the man from China said he could not show her that because the cotton probably is grown in "Teksa." Rivoli spun a globe around to China and asked him to point to Teksa. "He took the globe and spun it back around the other way. 'Here, I think it is grown here.' I followed his finger. Patrick was pointing at Texas." Today's Republican administration promises protection against the destruction of American jobs by the Chinese, Mexicans and other foreigners. The really prolific destroyers are: Americans. As Reason's John Tamny says, Americans streaming movies from Netflix (based in Los Gatos, Calif.) erase American jobs in movie theaters and DVD rental stores. Americans buying books from Seattle-based Amazon have caused many American bookstores to do what Borders' (400 stores, 11,000 employees) did: disappear. Americans using San Francisco-based Uber are destroying many taxi drivers' jobs. Evidently our protectors in the administration must believe this: The destruction of American jobs because Americans buy goods or services of some American companies rather than those of other American companies is benign. But the destruction of American jobs because Americans buy goods or services of foreign companies is intolerable. An administration confident about conducting interventions in the economy should demonstrate care when bandying numbers. But in defending the sensible idea of reducing government regulation of the financial sector, Gary Cohn, director of the president's National Economic Council, said this would save "literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year." Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers notes the implausibility: "Total bank profits last year were about $170 billion." Deregulation will more than double profits? As today's Republicans celebrate a protectionist administration that is confident that Washington's superior wisdom can improve upon the market's allocation of economic resources, Democrats must resent Republican plagiarism. Who will protect Americans from their protectors? George F. Will is one of today's most recognized writers, with more than 450 newspapers, a Newsweek column, and his appearances as a political commentator on Fox news.

Henry McMaster. File/Mic Smith/AP top story Palmetto Politics: S.C. politicians, parties near silent on North Charleston Boeing union vote Schuyler Kropf, Schuyler Kropf Emma Dumain Emma Dumain Feb 12, 2017 Updated Feb 12, 2017 (…) Mic Smith New South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster. File/Mic Smith/AP Union-busting rhetoric used to be easy chatter coming from South Carolina conservative politicos, especially former Gov. Nikki Haley. But on the eve of Wednesday's vote to unionize the Boeing plant in North Charleston, the microphone seems to be comparatively dead. Gov. Henry McMaster issued a statement to Palmetto Politics Friday saying he opposed the International Association of Machinists union organizing here. But his comment was subdued. “South Carolina is great because South Carolinians are great — all of them," he said. "The Boeing Company recognized that and that’s why they invested so heavily in our State’s future. There is no reason to put anyone in between the remarkable men and women who work there, on the floor and in the offices, and this exemplary company." U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-1st District, also took the quiet path.  “The answer to that question will ultimately be decided by the employees of Boeing in North Charleston and therefore, at one level, that’s an answer I’d never presume to give," he said. Sanford did say that as governor, he saw how being a right-to-work state helped in competition versus other states. Matt Moore, S.C. GOP chairman, also said there's “nothing planned” by the party tied to the vote. Even the pro-labor, South Carolina Democratic Party is standing on the sidelines. "The South Carolina Democratic Party itself has not played a role in the effort at Boeing," said state party spokesman Matthew Ellison. "But many active Democrats are highly involved," he said. "The Democratic Party supports unions and believes they have been great champions in building a strong and vibrant middle class." Wednesday's balloting will be the biggest organized labor vote South Carolina has seen in years, with about 3,100 workers eligible. Henry McMaster: #scisgoingstraighttothetop Nikki Haley had "It's a great day in South Carolina." Donald Trump said "Make America Great Again." And now Gov. Henry McMaster is floating #scisgoingstraighttothetop as a hashtag motto. The newly installed governor used the "straight-to-the-top" reference on his Facebook page this week in connection to a photograph in which he posed alongside members of the Greer Chamber of Commerce. It's too early to say if the seven-word, 25-letter hash tag will gain a following. McMaster press secretary Brian Symmes said the motto is likely to be used again, though there are no immediate plans to do so. "Anyone who has heard the governor talk about South Carolina’s great potential has heard him say we’re headed straight to the top,” Symmes said. State GOP chair candidate courting Charleston The only announced candidate looking to follow retiring S.C. Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore will make his pitch to Charleston Republicans on Monday. Drew McKissick will speak at the Charleston County GOP monthly meeting at 7 p.m. at North Charleston City Hall. While several potential candidates are looking at running, McKissick is the only one actively campaigning for the spot that will be settled at the May 13 state party convention in Columbia. Moore announced last week he would not seek a third term. Locally, Charleston County GOP Chairman Larry Kobrovsky intends to seek a second term at the April 20th county convention. New Fritz Hollings book The University of South Carolina Press has published what's being billed as the first scholarly account of former governor and senator Fritz Hollings' career as South Carolina came of age in the 1960s. "New Politics in the Old South - Ernest F. Hollings in the Civil Rights Era" is authored by David T. Ballantyne. "Throughout his career Hollings was renowned for his willingness to voice unpleasant truths, as when he called for the peaceful acceptance of racial desegregation at Clemson University in 1963 and acknowledged the existence of widespread poverty and malnutrition in South Carolina in 1969," the press notes say. Ballantyne, a lecturer in American history at Keele University in the United Kingdom, focuses on Hollings's career as a moderate-to-liberal Southern Democrat who served during an upheaval in Southern politics following World War II. Hollings served as governor from 1959 to 1963, and as a U.S. Senator from 1966-2005. The book runs 208 pages and lists at a hardcover price of $34.99.

These tax cuts, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (co-chaired by Republican Mitch Daniels and Democrat Leon Panetta, both former directors of the Office of Management and Budget), will reduce revenues by $5.8 trillion over 10 years. This, as the Congressional Budget Office projects that even without any of the administration’s proposed spending spree and tax cuts, under current law the national debt would increase by $9.4 trillion. Speaking of supply chains: In her book “The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy,” Georgetown University’s Pietra Rivoli recounts a conversation with a man from Shanghai who said that if she would come to China he would help her see various places involved in producing the inexpensive T-shirts exported to America. She would see where the yarn is spun, the fabric is knit and the shirts are sewn. Asked if she could see where the cotton is grown, the man from China said he could not show her that because the cotton probably is grown in “Teksa.” Rivoli spun a globe around to China and asked him to point to Teksa. “He took the globe and spun it back around the other way. ‘Here, I think it is grown here.’ I followed his finger. Patrick was pointing at Texas.” Today’s Republican administration promises protection against the destruction of American jobs by the Chinese, Mexicans and other foreigners. The really prolific destroyers are: Americans. As Reason’s John Tamny says, Americans streaming movies from Netflix (based in Los Gatos, Calif.) erase American jobs in movie theaters and DVD rental stores. Americans buying books from Seattle-based Amazon have caused many American bookstores to do what Borders’ (400 stores, 11,000 employees) did: disappear. Americans using San Francisco-based Uber are destroying many taxi drivers’ jobs. Evidently our protectors in the administration must believe this: The destruction of American jobs because Americans buy goods or services of some American companies rather than those of other American companies is benign. But the destruction of American jobs because Americans buy goods or services of foreign companies is intolerable. An administration confident about conducting interventions in the economy should demonstrate care when bandying numbers. But in defending the sensible idea of reducing government regulation of the financial sector, Gary Cohn, director of the president’s National Economic Council, said this would save “literally hundreds of billions of dollars of regulatory costs every year.” Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers notes the implausibility: “Total bank profits last year were about $170 billion.” Deregulation will more than double profits? As today’s Republicans celebrate a protectionist administration that is confident that Washington’s superior wisdom can improve upon the market’s allocation of economic resources, Democrats must resent Republican plagiarism.

With the Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) technology, Apache can control the sensory payloads of of Gray Eagle and Army shadow drones.  Boeing was awarded the $24 million contract for expanding the helicopter’s MUM-T capabilities, set to become a part of all Apache configurations. © AP Photo/ Ahn Young-joon South Korea Finalizes Deployment of 36 Newest Apache Helicopters Crews are able to pursue and engage speedy targets from long distances using the drones’ sensors and the attack helicopter’s powerful weaponry. Last year Apache Program Manager Col. Jeff Hager told Scout Warrior in an interview, "Now before the unit even deploys out of the Forward Arming Refueling Point, or FARP, they can actually bring up the UAS (drone) feed, look through the sensors and see the target they are going to attack up to 50 or 60 miles away," adding that the sensors also enable crews to make en-route adjustments if necessary. Hager continued, "They have full situational awareness on that target as they fly inbound and do not lose any data on that target on the way…They don’t go into a situation where they are surprised." The Army established the first MUM-T squadron in March 2015, with the 1/501st Aviation Battalion of the 1st Armoured Division’s Combat Aviation Brigade based in Fort Bliss, Texas renamed as the 3rd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment. This development signaled the debut of a tactical common datalink with the RQ-7B Shadow made by Textron Systems that accompany the Apaches, helping to bolster the service’s scout capabilities.  © Flickr/ Gonzalo Alonso Pentagon Awards Boeing Contract to Boost Apache Combat Copter Capabilities Lt Col RJ Garcia said at the time, "It's an improved capability that supports soldiers on the ground as they execute the various missions that we assign them…Nothing is stove-piped now. We now have the ability to share across multiple levels." Currently pilots flying Apaches in Afghanistan are using an upgraded AH-64E-model which utilizes advanced avionics and communications technology, a hardier 7016 engine and composite rotor blades, giving the helicopter expanded performance and speed. The AH-64E model has the ability to move large amounts of fuel and ammunition in what’s called "high-hot" conditions, withstanding temperatures 95 degrees or higher and altitudes of 6,000 feet. It can also reach speeds of 164 knots, 20 knots faster than the “D” model that preceded it.

Tarun Shukla Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defence, Space and Security. Bengaluru: US aircraft maker Boeing Co. last week launched Boeing Defence India, a local unit aimed to support the company’s growth in the country. Pratyush Kumar, president of Boeing India, will lead the new unit. This is the fourth such global unit for Boeing, after Australia, the UK and Saudi Arabia. In an interview, Leanne Caret, president and chief executive officer of Boeing Defence, Space and Security says the new unit will expand the firm’s footprint in India with a long-term bet on the country. Boeing also does not rule out inorganic growth in India by acquiring firms that may give it technical advantage. Edited excerpts: What is the reason for establishing this new India unit? The establishment of Boeing Defence India is really the next step in our evolution here. We clearly have had a strong partnership (for ) over 75 years, starting in the commercial spectrum and over the last 20 years, we have continued to have more and more defence products and most recently, we have had some really great partnerships with P-8s, Chinook Apache and C-17. But as we look to the future, there is such an incredible talent base here in India and there is real opportunity to use it as a core part of our ecosystem. Boeing Defence India is literally a localized operating company that would report into me; that has responsibilities for defence products and services that we provide through our full spectrum in Boeing Defence and this allows us to take advantage of our global reach but do it in a way we can leverage local talent with a goal to have greater than 95% of our staff to be local hires and then, have key components from engineering all the way through manufacturing, fabrication, final assembly test, all the way up to the life cycle support. Pratt (Pratyush Kumar) will have the operating authority that he needs to really run the business. It’s going to put us on a growth path to continue not only to grow our business but, more importantly, continuing to have those enduring relationships with customers here so that we meet their needs. What was the trigger to establish this? The real reason any company is successful is that you have enduring customer relationships and you really do leverage the power of the enterprise but you also bring it together and you put forward solutions that are aligned to customers’ need and what you tend to find over time is that sometimes, a tendency to do everything from the US and when you have countries such as India which have strong national interest, who clearly have enduring relationships with the US, that its just (an) opportunity to make it more local. And so, about a year and a half ago, we started thinking about what this would look like and how we could go make it happen. Boeing Defence Australia was our first, then we migrated with Boeing Defence UK and then we started Saudi Arabia and now Boeing Defence India. Can you give an example of what this will change when you already have an office and employees in India ? Today, in many cases, you could view this as a facilitator role, the way we have been operating. So, Pratt has had responsibility in terms of all of our customers in the country, he has been the lead on helping us bring in folks from the US helping sell products and services, clearly, addressing customer needs and having reach back. What we are doing is, we are giving him a local team who will now start taking on those responsibilities themselves. They will still have the reach back to the States if needed but they are going to start becoming self-sufficient and more autonomous and with that comes operating responsibility. So, just like any of my other business, they own the customer satisfaction and the performance and as we move forward, for instance, with Make in India— this is a huge initiative that the nation has—we believe that Boeing has a great opportunity to bring an indigenous ecosystem that’s going to allow us to design, build and field aircraft such as fighters in the future and that activity will all report into Pratt. Currently, your sourcing stands at about $500 million from India, which is almost what Airbus does. How will this grow? Our goal is to continue on this trajectory in a way which brings productivity to Boeing (and) at the same time, creates requisite manufacturing base in the country—so, it kind of plays into Make in India; so, it’s a win-win for both. With that, you will continue evolution in terms of engineering presence, manufacturing presence, the deepening of our supply chain. What more can we see in manufacturing and how will India move up in that value chain? My vision is that you will see full-up final assembly at some point here, depending on what the nation wants to do in terms of product and service that they want to buy. You are already seeing us build Apache fuselages and those aren’t just for Indian Air Force, that’s for our Apache products that are going around the globe. So, you are going to continue to see an expansion and evolution of that. What kind of business are you looking from India? You had offered the F-18s. (There is an) RFI (request for information) right now from the Navy, we will be responding with what we believe is the appropriate configuration and we will let government work through the (process) and as and when RFP (request for proposal) gets released, we will respond appropriately that time. Our vision for the future is extremely bold but it is entirely doable. How do you see India US-defence ties under the Trump administration? I am very optimistic. Already in the weeks since our President has been elected, he has come and restated the enduring partnership between India and the United States. I am very positive, this is good for India and it’s a great partnership with the US. Over a 5-10 year time frame, how would you envision Boeing in India? Do you plan to acquire any firms here to grow? I won’t put specific targets; my expectation is, by putting t his framework in place and having local presence and having folks here, we will have that local decision making, not only are we going to grow our engineering and manufacturing capacity, but if there is an opportunity where we can enter markets and acquire technical advantages, we will continue to assess that, but that is part of running the business.

Tarun Shukla A file photo of the Aero Show in Bengaluru. This year’s edition is expected to be the largest in recent times. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint New Delhi: The 11th edition of the Aero India air show which starts in Bengaluru on Tuesday is expected to be one of the largest in recent years, with a focus on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India initiative. Around 270 Indian and 279 foreign firms are slated to participate in the event where some major companies, including Airbus and Boeing Co, are expected to sign deals under the Make in India banner. “It is expected that two lakh business visitors will attend the show. The gross area (of the show) has also increased from 2,50,000 sq. m to 2,60,000 sq. m,” the ministry of defence said in a statement. Defence minister Manohar Parrikar is likely to inaugurate the Bengaluru air show. Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint While Modi had inaugurated the previous Bengaluru air show in 2015, defence minister Manohar Parrikar is likely to open it this year as the event coincides with election activity in several states. The highlight of the show at the city’s Yelahanka Air Force Station will be fighter jets that make up a large part of the 72 aircraft being showcased. Among these will be Rafale fighter jets made by French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation SA. India bought 36 of these aircraft for an estimated $8.9 billion last year in a deal that has been negotiated several times over the years. Dassault Aviation said three fighter jets will participate—one single-seat Rafale C and two of the two-seat Rafale B. Rafale planes have been used by the French armed forces in combat operations for more than a decade. They entered service with the French Navy in 2004 and the Air Force in 2006. Some of the 152 planes delivered so far have been used in combat in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali, Iraq and Syria. Dassault’s Rafale fighter jet. Photo: Reuters India had started hunting for multi-role fighter jets in 2007 but later decided to scrap that tender, instead announcing that it would buy Rafale jets from France under a government-to-government deal agreed during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Paris in 2015. The combat aircraft—delivery of which is expected to begin in September 2019 and be completed by April, 2022—come equipped with state-of-the-art missiles such as Meteor and Scalp, according to the defence ministry. With the air-to-air Meteor missiles, the Indian Air Force will be able to hit targets as distant as 150km, compared with the 80km it was so far capable of targeting. Scalp, an air-to-ground cruise missile with a range in excess of 300km, will also give IAF an edge over adversaries. We are not ruling out India acquisitions: Boeing’s Leanne Caret “Demonstrating Rafale’s capabilities in Aero India reaffirms our total commitment to India’s sovereignty. We have had a long standing relationship with Indian Air Force and industry and, thanks to the unmatched capabilities of the Rafale and to our full involvement in the innovative approach of the “Make in India” initiative, we are entirely dedicated to partner India in meeting its strategic defence and economic needs,” Eric Trappier, chairman and chief executive of Dassault Aviation said in a statement. The Russian Sukhoi 30MKI, Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), Advanced Jet Trainers (AJT) Hawks are also likely to be present at the show. The F-16 fighter jet of Lockheed Martin. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint But all eyes will be on American F-16s and Swedish Saab fighter jet Gripen E and its naval variant Gripen Maritime. Both companies are vying to bag the next multi-billion order from India under the so-called strategic partnership model according to which the manufacturer will be asked to set up an assembly line in India. Airbus said it will showcase its H130 chopper ambulance on static display. “The future of Indian aerospace and defence industry rests on the realization of the ‘Make in India’ vision. I look forward to having conversations around the topic at Aero India,” said Pierre de Bausset, president and managing director at Airbus India. Tata Motors’s Vernon Noronha on the firm’s defence manufacturing strategy “We have partnered with Tata and Mahindra and are working with a host of other companies to script ‘Make in India’ success stories,” he added. The firm said it procures about $500 million (about Rs3,400 crore) worth of products from India annually from around 45 suppliers, generating local employment for more than 6,000 people. The Tata Group said all its key firms will participate in the event, including Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Advanced Materials Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Titan Co. Ltd, Tata Steel (Specialty Steel business in Europe), TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd and Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division. The case for a single, merged air show The five-day show will have exhibitors from the US, France, UK, Russia, Israel, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Ukraine, Singapore, Sweden, Spain, South Africa, Italy, the UAE, South Korea, Hong Kong, the Czech Republic, Canada, Australia, Poland and Greece. Indian Air Force’s Sarang Team,the Surya Kiran Team, the Scandinavian Air Show Team from Sweden and the Evolvkos Aerobatic Team from the UK will perform aerobatics at the show. Aero India, which began in 1996, has become one of the largest air shows in Asia. This show is followed by one in Abu Dhabi and most international players move on to showcase their military ware there over the weekend.

BA stock has increased over 30% in just 5 months, a run that has significantly outpaced other defense stocks over that period. While there has been some good news of late — including higher expectations for overall growth since the election — there also have been several developments that have raised questions about the future of Boeing stock. Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr Competition is tough and it’s getting tougher. Orders have slowed, with output of the 777 being cut ahead of the release of the 777x. Earnings growth has been impressive, but beyond 2017, that growth may get more difficult for BA stock. Boeing stock hardly is expensive, to be sure. BA trades at 18x the midpoint of 2017 earnings guidance — and closer to 13x the company’s anticipated free cash flow. Meanwhile, Boeing continues to outpace rival Airbus Group SE (OTCMKTS:EADSY) in orders and deliveries. But more competition is coming, and external and political pressures could rattle Boeing stock over the next few quarters. Why Boeing Stock Could Hit Some Turbulence The biggest near-term question for BA stock is whether it has simply flown too far, too fast. Boeing shares have more than quadrupled over the last eight years. Over that period, BA has outperformed other major defense stocks, including Airbus, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) and Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN). The run includes 17% gains since the election, better performance than all peers but General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD). To be sure, Boeing has performed well since the financial crisis: 2010 Core (i.e., non-GAAP) earnings-per-share was $4.45; the midpoint of 2017 guidance is for $9.20 per share. At that level, BA would more than double EPS in seven years — an average growth rate of 11%. The problem is that BA should be growing earnings in an improving global economy. While the company is considered a defense stock as well, only ~30% of sales come from its Defense, Space & Security segment. Two-thirds of revenue come from commercial airplanes. And in that business, there’s reason to expect a slowdown in growth as soon as the second half of this year. 2016 orders were at the company’s lowest level since 2010. “Book to bill” — the ratio of orders to shipments — hasn’t been this low since 2004. In the near-term, there’s a possibility that the sentiment could reverse toward Boeing stock simply due to valuation and growth stocks. And there are some catalysts on the horizon that could bring those concerns to the forefront. Longer-Term Questions for BA Stock Boeing already has seen first-hand the potential for politics having an impact on defense stocks. A simple Tweet from then-President-elect Trump in December that criticized the cost of the Boeing-made Air Force One led BA stock down over a percentage point. A month later, another Tweet criticizing Lockheed’s F-35 — and raising the possibility of a replacement with Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet — sent LMT stock down, and Boeing stock up.

(IW 500/9) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (IW 500/25) promised to build plants in India if the world’s biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before President Donald Trump’s America First call. This week will be a test for that promise as the biggest U.S. defense contractors, Russia’s MiG Corp., and Europe’s Airbus SE line up to display their wares at an air show in Bengaluru in southern India. Even as they compete for deals, they could find themselves torn between Trump’s push for companies to keep jobs in the U.S. -- he has singled out a number of multinational firms on Twitter for public criticism -- and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own program that seeks to tie military contracts to some of the manufacturing being done in India. Popular Now Leaders Must Have 'Strategic Intelligence' How to Build More Impactful Centers of Excellence Is Quality a Result or a System? "All of us in Washington are guessing where Trump is going to land on these issues," said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "He has certainly been very clear in his tweets and direct outreach to American companies that he wants to try to ensure that people don’t move production facilities and try to retain jobs in the U.S." India’s Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar will use the airshow to outline Modi’s plans to boost the domestic defense industry by giving contracts to local companies, as well as asking foreign manufacturers to tie up with Indian firms, according to people familiar with the plan who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. "America First"and "Made in India" head for a showdown at air show https://t.co/ty9bvwufF8 pic.twitter.com/3pth4xQFL1 — Bloomberg (@business) February 13, 2017 Modi’s promise to shell out $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, submarines, howitzers and helmets to modernize his armed forces came with one call -- Make in India. Sensing an opportunity, local conglomerates Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. have expanded more into the defense sector and formed joint ventures with international manufacturers. India, which has traditionally relied on Russia and the former Soviet Union for fighter jets, is increasingly warming to the U.S. In his first phone conversation with Parrikar, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis committed to build upon the “tremendous progress in bilateral defense cooperation made in recent years,” a Pentagon spokesman said last week. Modi’s domestic manufacturing program is a centerpiece of his economic policy that seeks to boost manufacturing to 25% of gross domestic product by 2022 from 18% now, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. Lockheed Martin offered to make its F-16 fighter jet in India, after India scrapped an initial tender with Paris-based Dassault Aviation SA for 126 planes. India later decided to directly buy just 36 fighter jets from the French government. That still leaves the country short of planes, meaning potential deals worth billions of dollars are on offer. Trump’s administration will want to take a fresh look at some of Lockheed’s proposals, including plans to build the F-16 in India, the company said. All previous orders from India have created jobs for Boeing in the U.S., Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said in an interview. The Chicago-based manufacturer sees no conflict between Trump’s ‘America First’ and Modi’s ‘Make in India’ calls, Kumar said separately on Monday in Bengaluru, adding the company is looking to sell locally made F/A-18 jets in the country. Making fighter jets in India is viable with an order of 100 aircraft, he said. Boeing is looking forward to Indian Navy’s interest in buying 57 combat planes that can operate from aircraft carriers, he added. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Boeing as well as Sweden’s Saab AB are offering to shift some production to India as they seek to win contracts. Boeing and Lockheed have also been on the receiving end of Trump’s criticism in recent times. "The politics of it looks bad, in terms of the appearance back in the U.S. -- especially when he’s talking about an America First campaign," said Anit Mukherjee, a former Indian Army major and an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. "If companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with the Make in India thing -- which in itself is a big question mark -- then perhaps he might intervene on that." U.S.-India defense ties have grown in recent years, in part as India’s neighbor China has increased its military clout in the region. India has also sought to diversify its sources of arms imports from a Cold War-era reliance on Russian weapons. Saab CEO Hakan Buskhe said Monday that he sees a possible order for more than 100 Gripen fighters from India. The potential for U.S. companies to win business by manufacturing "not so state-of-the-art" equipment in India could be a trade off for Trump, said Amit Cowshish, a former financial adviser to India’s defense ministry and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Indian Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. Trump’s protectionist rhetoric so far seems to be aimed at products consumed in the U.S. and not at jobs created overseas to support a foreign market, said New Delhi-based Ankur Gupta, vice president for aerospace and defense at Ernst & Young. Still, "he’s completely unpredictable on this," said Mukherjee from RSIS, referring to possible Trump intervention over foreign manufacturing by U.S. firms. "It has a potential to create problems. I’m sure it will be discussed between Indian and U.S. officials." By Anurag Kotoky, Iain Marlow and N. C. Bipindra Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:30 PM, February 13, 2017 Updated: 8:10 AM, February 14, 2017 NEW YORK/NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. - Boeing Co faces its first union vote on Wednesday at its aircraft factory in South Carolina, a high-profile test for organized labor in the nation's most strongly anti-union state. The world's largest planemaker is running a hardball campaign against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which is trying to organize about 3,000 workers at one of two plants where Boeing makes 787 Dreamliners. The other, in Washington state, has long been unionized by the IAM. "It would be a major, major win for the machinists if they got this," said Arthur Schwartz, an independent consultant who worked in labor relations at General Motors Co for two decades and does not represent either side. Opposition is strong in South Carolina, which is one of 28 states that does not require workers to join a union, and has the lowest proportion of union workers, at 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. New York is the highest with 23.6 percent. The IAM canceled a voted at the Boeing plant in April 2015 after it claimed there was "political interference" from state officials and "misinformation" spread among workers. Former Governor Nikki Haley, who is now U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was among those who voiced strong opposition to the union in 2015. Boeing told Reuters in an emailed statement that in the current campaign it has hired the same lawyer who helped it defend against the IAM previously. Videos and posts on Boeing's web and social media sites portray the IAM as a "divisive" force that fights with management, makes promises it cannot keep and leads workers into strikes. In one video on Boeing's site a production manager at Boeing South Carolina describes the tension and lost income from striking twice while he worked as a union machinist in Renton, Washington. "There was times where I wondered where I was going to be able to feed my kid," said the manager, Daniel Mihalic, over ominous music. "Please vote 'no' on February 15." Boeing invested $750 million to build the South Carolina factory after a costly machinists strike in 2008 that shut down production in Washington. It spent $1 billion more to expand aircraft engine casing and interiors production. Its employment in the state peaked at 8,400 in 2014 and has since fallen by 10 percent. The company said factory officials were unavailable for comment because "their time is committed to ensuring our teammates understand the voting process, the realities of union representation and the advantages of a nonunion environment." Boeing's videos are being aired on local TV stations - including during the Super Bowl - and also shown in break rooms at the plant, mechanic Elliott Slater, 57, who supports the union, said in an interview. When the IAM filed for a vote with the National Labor Relations Board last month, Slater and others said, a display of diapers and clothing appeared in a break room. "The goods on display would cost your family $800," a sign said. "You have better things to do with your money than pay union dues." Slater said workers want higher wages and more certainty about their shifts, which change often. The IAM said hourly workers in South Carolina earn about 36 percent less than their counterparts in Washington. "We're tired of the back-and-forth, the constant inundation of the anti-union rhetoric," Slater said. "We're just ready to vote." STANDARD PLAY BOOK Boeing's campaign follows the usual "union avoidance" play book used by many manufacturers, labor experts said. That contrasts with the relationship Detroit automakers and the United Auto Workers union have forged. After years of struggle, the companies decided bad union relations were unproductive, former labor negotiators for Ford Motor Co and GM said. "Ford was the last to get organized of the Big Three, but we were the first to understand that we had a business partner in the UAW and we were going to work with them. We're not going to fight them," said Marty Mulloy, who served for nine years as Ford's vice president of labor affairs, retiring in 2013. Ford found negative campaigns did not work, he said, and would not use one today. "My experience has been working collaboratively with unions yields better results," Mulloy said. Going negative "just takes the animosity to another level. You take it from, 'I disagree with you on principle,' to 'I'm going to hire some people to try to discredit you and your institution.'" Jon Holden, president of IAM District 751, which represents more than 35,000 union workers at Boeing in Washington state, said members are sending videos and posting words of support on Boeing's South Carolina Facebook page. But they have not paid much attention to Boeing's counter campaign, having seen such tactics before. "Personally, I hate seeing this in any anti-union campaign," he said. "I like people having a free choice on what they want to do, being able to ask questions and not seeing intimidation."

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here By Anurag Kotoky, Iain Marlow and N. C. Bipindra Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. promised to build plants in India if the world’s biggest arms importer chose their fighter jets and weapons. That was before President Donald Trump’s America First call. This week will be a test for that promise as the biggest US defense contractors, Russia’s MiG Corp., and Europe’s Airbus SE line up to display their wares at an air show in Bengaluru in southern India. Even as they compete for deals, they could find themselves torn between Trump’s push for companies to keep jobs in the US -- he has singled out a number of multinational firms on Twitter for public criticism -- and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own program that seeks to tie military contracts to some of the manufacturing being done in India. "All of us in Washington are guessing where Trump is going to land on these issues," said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "He has certainly been very clear in his tweets and direct outreach to American companies that he wants to try to ensure that people don’t move production facilities and try to retain jobs in the U.S." India’s Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will use the airshow to outline Modi’s plans to boost the domestic defense industry by giving contracts to local companies, as well as asking foreign manufacturers to tie up with Indian firms, according to people familiar with the plan who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Modi’s promise to shell out $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, submarines, howitzers and helmets to modernize his armed forces came with one call -- Make in India. Sensing an opportunity, local conglomerates Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. have expanded more into the defense sector and formed joint ventures with international manufacturers. India, which has traditionally relied on Russia and the former Soviet Union for fighter jets, is increasingly warming to the US. In his first phone conversation with Parrikar, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis committed to build upon the "tremendous progress in bilateral defense cooperation made in recent years," a Pentagon spokesman said last week. Modi’s domestic manufacturing program is a centerpiece of his economic policy that seeks to boost manufacturing to 25 percent of gross domestic product by 2022 from 18 percent now, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. French Deal Lockheed Martin offered to make its F-16 fighter jet in India, after India scrapped an initial tender with Paris-based Dassault Aviation SA for 126 planes. India later decided to directly buy just 36 fighter jets from the French government. That still leaves the country short of planes, meaning potential deals worth billions of dollars are on offer. Trump’s administration will want to take a fresh look at some of Lockheed’s proposals, including plans to build the F-16 in India, the company said. All previous orders from India have created jobs for Boeing in the US, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said in an interview. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Boeing as well as Sweden’s Saab AB are offering to shift some production to India as they seek to win contracts. Boeing and Lockheed have also been on the receiving end of Trump’s criticism in recent times. "The politics of it looks bad, in terms of the appearance back in the U.S. -- especially when he’s talking about an America First campaign," said Anit Mukherjee, a former Indian Army major and an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. "If companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with the Make in India thing -- which in itself is a big question mark -- then perhaps he might intervene on that." U.S.-India defense ties have grown in recent years, in part as India’s neighbor China has increased its military clout in the region. India has also sought to diversify its sources of arms imports from a Cold War-era reliance on Russian weapons. The potential for U.S. companies to win business by manufacturing "not so state-of-the-art" equipment in India could be a trade off for Trump, said Amit Cowshish, a former financial adviser to India’s defense ministry and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Indian Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. Trump’s protectionist rhetoric so far seems to be aimed at products consumed in the U.S. and not at jobs created overseas to support a foreign market, said New Delhi-based Ankur Gupta, vice president for aerospace and defense at Ernst & Young. Still, "he’s completely unpredictable on this," said Mukherjee from RSIS, referring to possible Trump intervention over foreign manufacturing by U.S. firms. "It has a potential to create problems. I’m sure it will be discussed between Indian and U.S. officials." Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now! FROM AROUND THE WEB Want to post your ad?

The government said it has earmarked about N5.8billion for the runway project. This was as an estimated N1.1billion is being spent to fix the Kaduna Airport slated to serve as an alternate airport for all Abuja-bound flights during the six weeks the Abuja airport would be shut. The decision to divert flights to Kaduna airline has however not gone down well with foreign airlines operating into the Abuja airport. Three of the airlines, Lufthansa, British Airways, and South African Airways have all expressed their decision not to fly into the Kaduna airport, citing logistics and safety concerns as reasons. And there are indications that in the weeks ahead many more foreign airlines may pull out of the arrangement. But some observers believes the development present  great opportunity to three local airlines operating schedule flights into Kaduna airport, namely Arik Air, Aero Contractors, and Azman Air. The closure of the Abuja runway no doubt has serious safety, security and cost implications and local and international passengers will have to face the great inconvenience of travelling by road from Kaduna to Abuja amidst several security uncertainties. Airlines, service providers, employees and the national economy will all be negatively impacted by the closure. It is estimated that about N2billion would be lost for the six weeks the Abuja airport would be shut. But industry analysts say the exit of the foreign airlines from the route opens an opportunity for local airlines to boost their revenue or income, if only they know what to do. How did we get here? The Abuja Runway was originally meant to last for 20 years. However, on the balance of probability of the fact that it was underutilised judging from the number of landings on  it, its utilisation was further stretched by an additional 14 years leading to the current deplorable condition and the attendant grave safety implications as evidenced by several near fatal incidents that have occurred as a result of the bad condition of the runway. President of the Aviation Round Table (ART), Mr. Gabriel Olowo, said the rot in infrastructure at Abuja airport could only have happened due to the fact that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), which is responsible for conducting safety oversight of the sector, was docile and failed completely in ensuring that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) religiously complies with the Runway Maintenance Programme for NAIA, which is an operational safety requirement. “The failure of FAAN to strictly follow the Runway Maintenance Programme and conduct regular repairs and rehabilitation as at when due coupled with the lethargic oversight of NCAA have effectively contributed to the situation where it is today,” he said. About Kaduna airport The Kaduna airport is located 22 kilometers northwest of the city of Kaduna. Its 3,000meters and 9,843 fet runway is made from asphalt.  Kaduna Airport no doubt has recorded two major accidents. But the two accidents recorded in 1995 and 2010 were related to flaws on the airport runway, even though the Federal Government had since fixed the runway to be able to cope with local and international flight. The first accident involved a Nigeria Airways Flight 357. On November 13 1995, the Boeing 737-2F9 Nigerian Airways flight, during its second leg of the flight from Jos to Kaduna, over ran the runway at Kaduna Airport, leading to a fire incident that destroyed the aircraft. All 14 crewmembers survived, while 11 of the 124 passengers died. Similarly, on August 20, 2010, Chanchangi Airlines Flight 334, operated by Boeing 737-200 5N-BIF struck the localizer antenna and landed short of the runway. Several passengers were slightly injured and the aircraft was substantially damaged. Chanchangi Airlines thereafter suspended its operations into Kaduna airport following the accident. But things are said to have improved in the recent past and the Kaduna airport runway and other infrastructure have witnessed an upgrade that can allow it serve as alternate to Abuja airport. What some stakeholders say The decision to shut down the Abuja airport and divert flights to Kaduna has indeed divided key stakeholders in the industry, especially Nigerians along lines of those in support of and those against the decision. For instance, Managing director of Centurion Securities, Group Capt. John Ojikutu (Retd) faults the use of Kaduna Airport and suggested the Minna Airport would have been better. Said Ojikutu, “Must we divert Abuja traffic to Kaduna? Why can’t the Minna Airport serve the purpose for the local flights? After all it is closer to Abuja than Kaduna. The runway (Minna) will still accommodate aircraft whose takeoff and landing runs are within 1000 to 2000 metres.” Ojikutu said that the choice of Kaduna for air traffic diversion was one that was bound to  scare most of the foreign airlines away. “While the domestic airlines may find Kaduna airport convenient, the current security threats in that state may not make the airport attractive to the foreign airlines particularly those from the EU and US. “For them to want to use Kaduna for foreign airlines, I have my doubts that the airlines will go there for security reasons,” he said. Also speaking, the chairman, governing board of the Nigerian Aviation Safety Initiative (NASI), Capt. Dung Pam, said Kaduna Airport does not have the capacity to cope with the anticipated traffic. “It is going to be a serious dislocation of the nexus of our air travel system. Every major airport in the country connects to Abuja and Lagos. So, to have that place completely shut down for six weeks will be a huge blow to the travelling public,” he said. Opportunity for local airlines But what analysts agreed to, is that the closure provides an opportunity for local airlines operators to take advantage of the situation by increasing their flights into Kaduna from Lagos and other major cities around the country and making more revenue. Until recently, there were 14 international airlines operating about 70 weekly flights to Abuja. With the withdrawal of Emirates, Delta and Kenya Airways from the route, the weekly flights by the remaining airlines will now be about 55 flights weekly. President of ART, Mr. Gabriel Olowo, said assuming that each inbound and outbound flight has 100 passengers, conservatively there would be 5,500 passengers inbound and 5, 500 as outbound or 11,000 passengers to and from Abuja via Kaduna weekly or about 1600 inbound, and outbound passengers daily. He explained that conservatively, these would require about 20 flights from our domestic airlines if they would be encouraged and reasonably develop capacity to take advantage of this opportunity which the closure of Abuja is likely to create for them. Moreover, the closure will give local helicopter operators an opportunity to operate commuter services between Abuja and Kaduna. Local airlines can also sign code-sharing agreements with foreign airlines, which could allow them airlift passengers drooped at the Lagos airport on behalf of the foreign airlines. Already, Arik Air has announced it has such a partnership with Emirates. It behooves on the other airlines like Aero, Dana, Azman, Medview, First Nation and Air Peace to reach out to the foreign airlines that fly into the Abuja route to sign similar deals with them. Future plans  FAAN should ensure that it develops a Runway Maintenance Programme (RMP) approved by NCAA if none is currently available. NCAA on the other hand must through regular oversight, ensure FAAN’s compliance with approved Runway Maintenance Programme. Furthermore, the Runway Maintenance Programme must be factored on periodic number of landings rather than on the age of the runway. Finally, Periodic Runway Maintenance Programme would make repairs  and maintenance possible if the Runway Maintenance Programme is regularly implemented. Furthermore, government needs to ensure that movement and facilitation of passengers between Abuja and Kaduna is clear and unambiguous in the interest of safety and security. The protection of airline officials and their assets should equally be a top priority. Moreover, the huge funds currently being committed into other sectors all in the name of using Kaduna Airport as an alternative could have been saved and better utilized in the aviation sector if only those responsible for maintaining the runway had been more proactive from the outset. A), and Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) to the tune of over N47billion. But for 2017, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), says airlines would be subjected to more stringent and periodic financial audit. The trend marks a huge departure from previous regulatory functions of the NCAA which was focused predominately on the safety operations of the airlines, their crew and the airports. “We will increase our safety oversight to sustain zero accident in the aviation sector. We are reviewing and strengthening economic regulations and airline operational books are to be sighted with increased regularity and appropriate sanctions will be applied,” said Director General of the NCCA, Captain. Muhtar Usman in a release made available to Daily Sun. The new policy makes it mandatory for airlines to allow the NCAA inspect their financial books to ascertain that airlines were run in line with best practices as it concerns accountability. “We will move to ensure airlines’ compliance with Nigerian civil aviation regulations, all outstanding debts must be paid, while passenger comfort will remain paramount to us,” he added. Usman said at present, the NCAA was engaged in robust regulation,proficient safety oversight, increased surveillance on all certificate holders in the industry, daily ramp inspection, and spot check inspection on maintenance facilities all geared at zero accident rates in the industry. Dana Air, Meridiana partner on Italy-Nigeria route Meridiana Fly, Italy’s fastest growing airline, is partnering Dana Air and Dre Aviation of Ghana to launch flight operations from Italy into Ghana and Nigeria. Speaking to newsmen in Lagos, Dre Aviation’s Mr. Paul Bassam Saade, said, “a prudent approach was taken by Meridiana when entering these highly competitive markets, but we have demonstrated stable operations and a growing commercial presence for them in West Africa and they are pleased with the results. “Supported by Ghana’s first affiliated global aviation advisory firm, Dre Aviation, and one of Nigeria’s leading airlines, Dana Air, Meridiana Fly entered into the West African market with an iconic Boeing 767-300 series aircraft, and a superior on-time performance rate of 99.5 per cent,” he added.   Saade reaffirmed the airline’s commitment to the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets by confirming both routes in its summer schedule for 2017. Commenting further, Saade said, “the airline would be rescheduling its flight times, which now means a late evening departure from Lagos which arrives in Italy’s Milan Malpensa Airport early the next day, allowing Nigerian passengers to onward connect onto Meridiana services into Europe and beyond. “This is a compelling proposition as the fares are much cheaper than other carriers into Europe and offers a real alternative for the travelling public. Our fares start at $350 all in for a one way ticket into Europe,”  he added.  He noted that more frequencies will be added in due course and that Dre Aviation is ramping up the market initiative for the carrier in both Ghana and Nigeria. He said with a record 4.5 million passengers flown in the last eight years of its operation, Dana Air is providing key operational staff to the Nigeria operations. He lauded Dana Air’s safety and technical capabilities, which have seen it currently operating over 27 daily flights from Lagos to Abuja, Port Harcourt, Uyo and Owerri. “The airline is reputed for its superior on-time performance, world-class in-flight service and customer service,” he said. ‎ Medview seeks better cooperation with immigration, airlines Managing Director/CEO of Medview Airlines Limited, Alhaji Muneer Bankole, is seeking greater collaboration between airlines and the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) to ease passenger movements at international airports in the country. Bankole who spoke in Lagos at a send-off ceremony organised for the outgoing Officer-in-Charge of NIS at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, Mrs. Chizoba Adaeze Dibi described both NIS and local airlines as ambassadors or mirror that projects the culture and values of the country to visitors or foreigners, adding that there was need for both establishments to always work together. “From whatever point of entry, immigration represents the image of the country and as local carriers, there is no day or week or month that we also don’t fly and we also represent the Nigerian brand,” said Bankole. “The relationship between airlines and immigration is therefore one that should be seen as mutually beneficial and we will always ensure it remains so,” he added. In her speech, Mrs. Dibi, who has been moved to head the Edo State Command of the NIS, thanked airlines, officials of the immigration, customs, police, banks and Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) for their cooperation in easing her work during her tenure at the Lagos airport. She listed some of her achievements to include boosting the welfare of immigration officers, the speedy facilitation of international passengers at immigration counters, as well as bringing to an end the abuses of Nigerian passengers by some foreign airlines. Mrs. Dibi said the Lagos Airport command of the NIS was recently singled out for commendation by the Comptroller for Immigration owing to improvements in service delivery at immigration counters to passengers coming in and leaving ‎the country. “During my stay, services improved and everyone that uses the Lagos airport can attest to this. I thank everyone that assisted me to bring about those positive changes,” she added.  Share How I cure baldness using these natural techniques. Read story 23 yrs boy started importation with N10,450.

That was before President Donald Trump’s America First call. This week will be a test for that promise as the biggest U.S. defense contractors, Russia’s MiG Corp., and Europe’s Airbus SE line up to display their wares at an air show in Bengaluru in southern India. Even as they compete for deals, they could find themselves torn between Trump’s push for companies to keep jobs in the U.S. -- he has singled out a number of multinational firms on Twitter for public criticism -- and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s own program that seeks to tie military contracts to some of the manufacturing being done in India. "All of us in Washington are guessing where Trump is going to land on these issues," said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. "He has certainly been very clear in his tweets and direct outreach to American companies that he wants to try to ensure that people don’t move production facilities and try to retain jobs in the U.S." India’s Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar will use the airshow to outline Modi’s plans to boost the domestic defense industry by giving contracts to local companies, as well as asking foreign manufacturers to tie up with Indian firms, according to people familiar with the plan who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Modi’s promise to shell out $250 billion in the coming years on fighter jets, submarines, howitzers and helmets to modernize his armed forces came with one call -- Make in India. Sensing an opportunity, local conglomerates Tata Group, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Ltd. have expanded more into the defense sector and formed joint ventures with international manufacturers. India, which has traditionally relied on Russia and the former Soviet Union for fighter jets, is increasingly warming to the U.S. In his first phone conversation with Parrikar, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis committed to build upon the “tremendous progress in bilateral defense cooperation made in recent years,” a Pentagon spokesman said last week. Modi’s domestic manufacturing program is a centerpiece of his economic policy that seeks to boost manufacturing to 25 percent of gross domestic product by 2022 from 18 percent now, and aims to avoid dependence on foreign equipment, particularly in times of war. French Deal Lockheed Martin offered to make its F-16 fighter jet in India, after India scrapped an initial tender with Paris-based Dassault Aviation SA for 126 planes. India later decided to directly buy just 36 fighter jets from the French government. That still leaves the country short of planes, meaning potential deals worth billions of dollars are on offer. Trump’s administration will want to take a fresh look at some of Lockheed’s proposals, including plans to build the F-16 in India, the company said. All previous orders from India have created jobs for Boeing in the U.S., Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said in an interview. The Chicago-based manufacturer sees no conflict between Trump’s ‘America First’ and Modi’s ‘Make in India’ calls, Kumar said separately on Monday in Bengaluru, adding the company is looking to sell locally made F/A-18 jets in the country. Making fighter jets in India is viable with an order of 100 aircraft, he said. Boeing is looking forward to Indian Navy’s interest in buying 57 combat planes that can operate from aircraft carriers, he added. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Boeing as well as Sweden’s Saab AB are offering to shift some production to India as they seek to win contracts. Boeing and Lockheed have also been on the receiving end of Trump’s criticism in recent times. To read about the Trump administration ordering F-35s, click here.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies. "If companies like Lockheed and Boeing go ahead with the Make in India thing -- which in itself is a big question mark -- then perhaps he might intervene on that." U.S.-India defense ties have grown in recent years, in part as India’s neighbor China has increased its military clout in the region. India has also sought to diversify its sources of arms imports from a Cold War-era reliance on Russian weapons. Saab CEO Hakan Buskhe said Monday that he sees a possible order for more than 100 Gripen fighters from India. The potential for U.S. companies to win business by manufacturing "not so state-of-the-art" equipment in India could be a trade off for Trump, said Amit Cowshish, a former financial adviser to India’s defense ministry and a fellow with the New Delhi-based Indian Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. Trump’s protectionist rhetoric so far seems to be aimed at products consumed in the U.S. and not at jobs created overseas to support a foreign market, said New Delhi-based Ankur Gupta, vice president for aerospace and defense at Ernst & Young. Still, "he’s completely unpredictable on this," said Mukherjee from RSIS, referring to possible Trump intervention over foreign manufacturing by U.S. firms. "It has a potential to create problems. I’m sure it will be discussed between Indian and U.S. officials." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Boeing hopes to sell more military jets through its new unit in India.

The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the US$500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, said the Boeing India president Pratyush Kumar. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru this week. Mr Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support US exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said. Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe’s Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world’s largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but the prime minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Industry sources say US manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the "Made in India" policy with the US president Donald Trump’s "America First" rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Mr Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the US. Boeing’s Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. Lockheed Martin said last week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Mr Trump’s administration might want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including an approximately $2.5bn contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Mr Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India. * Reuters Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Sydney Airport profits rise amid concerns over new city passenger hub Air France-KLM finds unexpected lift as profit beats forecasts Boeing and Airbus jetliner demand to fall but military aircraft to cushion blow India and Russia close in on helicopter manufacturing deal MOST VIEWED Business | All Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer Mubadala Investment Company set for next step on integration path Toyota recalls thousands of hydrogen-powered Mirais Dubai Land Department to introduce standard property lease form Property broker Asteco expects Abu Dhabi rents to fall Defence sector in focus ahead of Idex and Navdex in Abu Dhabi next week Five do’s and don’ts for Apple’s next iPhone Dubai landlord living overseas needs to evict tenant who hasn’t paid rent for six months Boeing and Airbus jetliner demand to fall but military aircraft to cushion blow RAK Ceramics’ profit hit amid building activity slowdown More Most Viewed UAE ambassador dies of injuries sustained in Afghanistan terror attack Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer UAE weather: heavy rain expected as unstable conditions persist Mubadala Investment Company set for next step on integration path Parents, not schools, are struggling Sheikh Mohammed attends ceremony; Sheikh Mansour chairs Mubadala meeting - in pictures Anniesa Hasibuan’s hijabs fit for royalty at New York Fashion Week The end of the two-state solution - killed off by Trump and Netanyahu Rouhani meets rulers of Oman and Kuwait to reduce Iran-GCC tensions What La La Land tells us about Abu Dhabi More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Rouhani meets rulers of Oman and Kuwait to reduce Iran-GCC tensions Property broker Asteco expects Abu Dhabi rents to fall About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Korea missile was posted on Facebook by Mar-a-Lago guests. Sean Gallagher - Feb 13, 2017 10:45 pm UTC Enlarge Screengrab via YouTube reader comments 440 Share this story This weekend, as news of a ballistic missile launch by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) reached President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, President Trump got on his phone, and Abe consulted with staff. This didn't happen behind closed doors, however; it took place as members of Trump's Mar-A-Lago Club watched on in the resort's dining room. One club member even posed for photos with Trump's aide-de-camp—the Air Force major carrying the president's "nuclear football"—and posted pics of the scrum around Trump's table on Facebook. Trump is comfortable conducting business over a meal. Last month, Trump approved a raid by US Navy SEALs in Yemen on an Al Qaeda compound not after a briefing in the White House situation room but rather over dinner with senior officials. These and other details of how the new president and his administration operate suggest that despite hitting Hillary Clinton hard for her security foibles, the Trump White House is not big on operational security (opsec). President Trump may not be making phone calls on his old, vulnerable Android device, but he keeps it close at hand. He regularly posts to Twitter from his Samsung phone based on his Twitter metadata. And we know he's using an unsecured Android device because the secure one he's been issued wouldn’t even allow Twitter to be installed. That mobile device is a highly modified Android-based phone from the Defense Information Systems Agency's DOD Mobile Classified Capability (DMCC) program. Trump was given a phone issued to President Barack Obama to replace his "Obamaberry"—a prototype from the DMCC's Top Secret-level product development. Unlike the Secret-classified device already being issued more widely by DISA—a customized Samsung phone—the presidential droid is apparently based on the Boeing Black, according to Defense One's Patrick Tucker. Only a few of the phones were issued by DISA. President Obama got one, and NSA/ US Cyber Command chief Admiral Michael Rogers got one as well. But the presidential Black connects exclusively to a secured, dedicated virtual network for voice and data calls, and it runs a very limited number of applications—all of them communication-focused. It can't even make direct outgoing calls; all calls would be routed through the White House Communications Agency's virtual switchboard. When President Obama made the first post to the @POTUS account in May of 2015, the New York Times reported that he borrowed a staff member's iPhone. So in order to post his Twitter missives, Trump has to either have someone else do it for him or carry his unsecured Android device with him—which he apparently does constantly based on his Twitter metadata. It's not even clear that Trump carries anything but his own Android device when he's at his Mar-A-Lago home. Enlarge / In this photo taken by Mar-A-Lago Club member Richard DeAgazio (which he posted to Facebook), President Trump is on the phone discussing the North Korean missile launch on Saturday, February 11. Most senior executives, including the president, typically have secure compartmented information facilities (SCIFs) installed in their residences. President Obama traveled with a portable SCIF—a tent designed for taking secure calls. Such setups include white noise generators and Faraday-cage walls that contain electromagnetic radiation from communications devices. It’s not known if Trump has one of these tents set up in his Mar-A-Lago home. But he took the call about the North Korean ballistic missile launch on an open terrace, surrounded by club members. While that's a sort of white noise generator on its own, this setup is not exactly the kind the White House security team would prefer. It would have been the job of the White House's chief information security officer to try to get President Trump to comply with proper operational security practices. But Cory Louie, who was appointed to that position by President Obama in 2015, was apparently pushed out earlier this month. The overall federal CISO, Greg Touhill, resigned in January. Since they were both Obama appointees, the exits are not out of the ordinary—but no one has been selected to fill their positions. Additionally, there's been no announced candidate for the role of federal chief information officer—a job Trump may choose not to continue. Aside from the standard information security concerns, however, there are other major worries about the Trump administration's security profile. Former NSA analyst and Observer columnist John Schindler reported recently that a Pentagon official said, "Since January 20, we’ve assumed that the Kremlin has ears inside the [White House Situation Room]." Schindler suggested that intelligence officials may be holding back sensitive information from the White House because of concerns that the White House—and National Security Advisor Michael Flynn in particular—have perhaps too much of a cozy relationship with the Russian government. And if that's the case, then taking a sensitive call on an open terrace surrounded by the public may be the least of the Trump administration's opsec concerns.

The Governors' Wind & Solar Energy Coalition is seeking increased federal funding to modernize local power grids and boost clean energy research, according to a letter submitted to the White House Monday. The group is also calling for legislation to promote offshore wind farms and efforts to streamline the permitting process for wind and solar projects. The message is the latest indication that Trump's criticism of renewable energy puts him at odds with much of corporate America and members of his own party. Since he was elected, Republican governors in Ohio, Illinois and Michigan signed legislation backing wind and solar. Last month, more than 600 U.S. companies issued a statement urging Trump not to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, saying it will generate trillions of dollars in investments. PHARMACEUTICALS Lawmakers are questioning price of drug Marathon Pharmaceuticals' pricing of a drug to treat genetic muscle deterioration in about 15,000 Americans, mostly boys, is raising concerns in Congress where lawmakers repeatedly have challenged drug companies. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., complained on Monday that Marathon Pharmaceuticals plans to charge $89,000 a year for a drug that is widely available abroad for about $1,000 a year. The two lawmakers said they believe Marathon is abusing a program that grants companies seven years of market exclusivity to encourage research into new treatments for rare diseases. They said the program was not intended to provide companies lucrative exclusivity rights for drugs that have been available for decades. "We urge you to significantly lower your price for this drug before it goes on the market next month," the lawmakers wrote. RETAIL Sears, Kmart drop some Trump products Sears and Kmart have evicted "a very small number" of Trump-branded items from their online stores, but won't specify how many and emphasize that hundreds of products are still available through their third-party online marketplaces. It's another sign of how companies are trying to tread a careful line, after President Donald Trump rebuked Nordstrom publicly on his Twitter account for deciding to stop selling his daughter Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories line. A social media campaign called "Grab Your Wallet" has urged a boycott of stores that stock Ivanka Trump or Donald Trump products, which also include Amazon and Dillard's. AVIATION Boeing workers rally ahead of union vote Two days before South Carolina Boeing employees vote on whether to join a union, workers gathered Monday to hear from union leaders why they should vote to organize in a state where union membership is the lowest in the country. Workers and members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers for an hour rallied at a hotel just a mile from Boeing's North Charleston operation where, on Wednesday, nearly 3,000 workers are set to vote on whether to form a union and be represented by the Machinists. Organizers, community leaders and members of other unions voiced messages of support to the few hundred workers gathered in a large conference room. Boeing employs a total of about 8,000 workers in North Charleston, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner. Communication Verizon returns to the unlimited data game Verizon, a longtime holdout, has joined other carriers in offering an unlimited data plan. AT&T only lets customers sign up for unlimited plans when they also subscribe to DirecTV, which AT&T owns. But its prices are similar to Verizon's for a family; Verizon is cheaper for an individual.As recently as January, the company's CFO said unlimited plans were "not something we feel the need to do" even though rivals had made inroads against Verizon by offering them. It has been trying to push longtime customers off its old unlimited plans, which it killed in 2012, with rate hikes.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Disappointment: Trump rumored to be preparing to resurrect the Ex-Im Bank posted at 9:21 am on February 13, 2017 by Jazz Shaw Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES I probably should have held on to a bit more of my innate cynicism following the swearing-in of the 45th president. Coming from a business background as he does, plenty of conservatives were rightly nervous about some of the potential big government tendencies which Donald Trump might exhibit upon taking office. If the latest rumors are true, some of those fears may be coming to fruition in the next few weeks. After a long and ultimately successful battle by conservatives, the Export-Import Bank was essentially placed on life support last year. The institution still exists, but lacking a sufficient number of members to achieve a quorum it has been powerless to do much of anything of late. All that may be about to change. The word on the hill is that Donald Trump has been listening to some voices among the Democrats and has been “convinced” that the bank should resume operations. (Government Executive) Long criticized by Republicans as an agency dispensing “corporate welfare,” the Export-Import Bank on Thursday got some good news after two senators reported that President Trump is abandoning his campaign-trail position that the bank must die. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., announced that Trump “agreed with her on the need to get the Export-Import Bank up and running and said he will soon nominate someone to serve on the Export-Import Bank Board.” The five-member board has been below quorum for a year because former Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., had blocked consideration of all of President Obama’s nominees to the bank. You may recall that on the campaign trail Donald Trump stated unequivocally that he was an opponent of the bank’s continued operation. And that wasn’t just a campaign promise made to win votes. As recently as December he was still saying that the banks days were probably numbered. So why the change now? As you might have been able to guess, Boeing likely played a large part in the decision. Current reports indicate that Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp was whispering in Trump’s ear but he was also in talks with executives from Boeing. As we’ve long known, the airline giant is one of the largest beneficiaries of the bank’s peculiar form of corporate welfare. Coming from a big business background and being used to making deals of this magnitude, we probably shouldn’t be terribly surprised if Boeing found someone able to speak a common language with the president and convince him that the art of the deal should go their way this time. While perhaps not the end of the world this is still seriously disappointing. But at the same time, let’s be honest here. Nobody in conservative circles was 100% convinced that a run for the presidency was suddenly going to take one of the most successful capitalists in the country and completely convert him to the frequently difficult doctrine of fiscal conservatism. As I’ve said ever since he won the nomination, if Trump were to take office we would be getting a significantly better deal than anything we could’ve expected from Hillary Clinton. But at the same time, there were going to be disappointments. The most we can do now is try to cheer on the president when he brings some victories across the finish line and hope that Congress will rein him in when he wanders astray in this fashion. In this case it wouldn’t take much. We managed to block Obama’s nominees to the Ex-Im board and the same could be done to Trump. It would be politically embarrassing, but the White House is no stranger to that feeling at this point.

Photos of the day 02/15 SUBSCRIBE The SpaceX Falcon 9 makes its way into the port of Los Angeles in mid-January for the company's first launch since a fireball engulfed a similar rocket on a Florida launch pad more than five months ago. Chuck Bennett/The Daily Breeze/AP/File | Caption Loading... Lonnie Shekhtman Staff | @LonnieShekhtman February 13, 2017 —The NASA Kennedy Space Center launch pad from which Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin blasted off to the moon has sat dormant for years. In a few days, its next chapter will begin. On Sunday, SpaceX, an aerospace company based in Hawthorne, Calif. that rents the historic Launch Complex 39A from NASA, tested the engines of its Falcon 9 rocket there in preparation to deliver supplies and science experiments to the International Space Station (ISS) on February 18. This will be the company’s 10th cargo trip to the ISS under its contract with NASA, according to Space.com, and its first launch from 39A in Florida. “Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A,” SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk posted on Instagram Sunday, alongside a photo of the rocket. “This is the same launch pad used by the Saturn V rocket that first took people to the moon in 1969. We are honored to be allowed to use it,” Mr. Musk wrote. SpaceX signed a 20-year lease to take over the pad in 2014 and has spent the ensuing years fixing it up. NASA stopped using the launch pad in 2011, when its 30-year-old space shuttle program was shut down after Atlantis, one of five NASA space shuttles of that era, blasted off from 39A toward the ISS in the last-ever US shuttle mission. Throughout the decades-long shuttle program, NASA’s spacecraft – Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour – carried people into orbit, launched and maintained satellites, and made it possible for humans to build the space station. The 18-year-old international science laboratory orbits 240 miles above Earth. Infographic Space Race, The Sequel: Who is exploring the cosmos today? And starting Saturday, SpaceX will use the site to launch cargo in the Dragon capsule aboard its Falcon 9 rocket. The company hopes to use the Florida launch pad to send humans to the ISS in about a year. “That is a big deal. It’s absolutely symbolic we are launching from there,” former NASA launch director Bob Sieck told the Orlando Sentinel on February 8. Since shutting down its space shuttle program, NASA has relied on the Russian space fleet and, increasingly, on the private space industry to step in to fill the void in space exploration and to make it more affordable. In addition to SpaceX, NASA has contracted with Orbital ATK, an aerospace and defense contractor based in Dulles, Va., and with Colorado-based aerospace company Sierra Nevada Corporation, to deliver cargo to the ISS for years to come. The agency also is relying on SpaceX and Boeing to start delivering astronauts to space as soon as possible, though both companies are facing technical delays. SpaceX, following a rocket explosion in September, has pushed back human flight to the ISS from this year to 2018. Boeing has, too. Though the delays are necessary to ensure astronaut safety, they put pressure on NASA because of the high cost of sending astronauts to the space station. The agency pays $82 million to the Russian space agency for each seat it reserves aboard Russia’s Soyuz rocket, the only one capable of ferrying people to space for now. According to recent estimates by NASA, seats aboard SpaceX and Boeing rockets could cost a comparatively cheap $58 million each. "Given the delays in initiating a US capacity to transport crew to the ISS, NASA has extended its contract with the Russian Space Agency for astronaut transportation through 2018 at an additional cost of $490 million,” wrote NASA's Office of Inspector General in a September audit. “If the Commercial Crew Program experiences additional delays, NASA may need to buy additional seats from Russia to ensure a continued US presence on the ISS.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

The agency is working with Boeing to build the Space Launch System rocket, which is expected to carry astronauts into deep space one day. It is scheduled to take its first test flight in fall of 2018, when it will to launch from Kennedy’s Launch Complex 39B, a site located down the street from SpaceX’s historic launch pad.  [Editor's Note: This article was updated with more accurate information about SpaceX's plans for the launch pad 39A.] What'd we miss?

OMG Digital, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 4 Shares SHARE TWEET EMAIL By: Philip Etemesi | 2 Day(s) ago There is a KQ plane that is just lying around at Bole Airport in Ethiopia. In fact, it’s been there for the past 28 years. The Kenya Airways plane, a Boeing 707-315B has been collecting rust in Ethiopia but for a justifiable reason. This is a photo of the plane. Image: John Kamau/Twitter According to a report on the Aviation Safety net database platform, the plane is damaged beyond repair hence it’s irredeemable. What really happened? Almost three decades ago, the plane was forced to return to Addis Ababa shortly after take-off because its landing gear failed to retract. The brakes of the plane then malfunctioned after touchdown causing the Boeing to skid past the wet runway. The plane had a total of 66 passengers at the time but fortunately, no one was injured. I can guess what lives in there right now. Meanwhile, would you return Kes. 1 million if found lost? This Ethiopian Airline cabin crew did! 0 I like this post 4 Shares SHARE TWEET EMAIL Comments Related Stories These Lovely Photos Of Ex-President Mahama Chilling In Kenya Will Give You Vacation Goals Surprise!!!

Rolls-Royce will have to write down the value of its currency hedges to reflect the plummet in sterling (Source: Getty) Rebecca Smith Rolls-Royce is braced to report a record annual loss tomorrow as the aero-engine firm absorbs the effect of its £671m settlement with regulators for past bribery and corruption. It is also battling a weaker pound. City analysts have forecast that Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners, could report a pre-tax loss topping £4bn, after sterling’s plummet against the dollar and the £671m fine. The fall of sterling since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in June last year has meant Rolls-Royce will have to write down the value of its $35bn hedge book by more than £3bn. It's a non-cash writedown. Read more: Shares in Rolls-Royce have surged after bribery deal and profit boost The fall in underlying profit will also have been affected by the swap from Rolls-Royce's Trent 700 engine to the Trent 7000, as Airbus winds down production of the A330 plane (which the Trent 700 engine was most often used on). But the picture should be one of improvement, after the company has reeled off a string of profit warnings in recent years. Consensus is that underlying profits for 2016 were £687m, a drop from £1.4bn in 2015, but they are expecting this to bounce back this year, up to £861m. Analyst consensus is for underlying revenue to be £13.5bn. Last month, the firm said that “early indications are that the Group has had a good finish to the year with both profit and, in particular, cash expected to be ahead of expectations”. In January, Rolls-Royce agreed a £671m penalty with authorities in the UK, US and Brazil to settle corruption charges, with the UK share - £497m – the largest imposed on a firm for criminal behaviour. While it will pay the fines over five years, the firm will book the total in this week's accounts. Warren East has been trying to bolster the engine-maker since replacing John Rishton as chief executive in 2015, at a time when revenues dropped for the first time in 10 years. He cut the dividend pay-out for shareholders for the first time in 24 years last year. Read more: Rolls-Royce to pay £671m to settle corruption probes Investors will also be expecting an update on the firm’s transformation programme launched by East in November 2015. At the time, Rolls-Royce said it expected savings of £150m-£200m by 2017 through reducing management as well as cutting internal processes and bureaucracy. More recently it has said the cost savings will be at the top end of the target range and savings for 2016 should be around £50m. Rolls-Royce declined to comment ahead of its results.

A Boeing Co. 777 due to depart the American city at 9am on Feb. 2 was held up by a mechanical issue requiring the replacement of a minor hydraulic component, Emirates says. While the part was sourced from Delta’s local engineering office and installed on the plane, a senior manager at the US carrier’s Atlanta base later ordered that it be removed, it claims. “It is sad, in our view, that any airline would deny such standard technical assistance to another carrier based on orders from headquarters that had nothing to do with maintenance or cost, but seem clearly to have been intended to inflict harm on the airline and its customers,” Emirates said in an email. Delta shares parts with other airlines whenever possible through an industry agreement and doesn’t withhold them from any particular carrier, Delta spokesman Michael Thomas said. The item in question was the last spare of its kind in Delta’s Seattle inventory, and company policy requires that it keep the last one on hand in case Delta needs it, Thomas said. “Having the right spare parts in the right places and in ample quantity is critical to ensuring a reliable airline operation for our customers,” Thomas said. Gulf dispute Delta, together with American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc., is embroiled in a long-running dispute with the three main Gulf carriers after urging the federal government to block their growth on the grounds that they received illegal aid payments — a suggestion that Emirates, Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways all reject. The issue may be reignited after US airline representatives met with Donald Trump Thursday, with the president telling them they faced “big league” competition, much of it “subsidised by governments.” Qatar Air Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker branded Delta “wicked” last year after the Doha-based carrier’s first flight to Atlanta with the Airbus Group SE A380 superjumbo was directed to a remote gate at the world’s busiest airport, leaving elderly and infirm passengers to disembark via temporary stairs rather than through the usual air-bridge. At the time, Delta said Qatar Airways was late in trying to secure gates for the A380 flight, which require special gates because of the jet’s size. Delta attempted to accommodate Qatar’s flight, despite the carrier’s tardiness, while making sure it could accommodate its own schedule, a company spokeswoman said in June. Card payment In the incident this month, Emirates said Delta had refused a credit-card payment for the spare and ordered a local engineering provider to remove it from the 777. Code-share partner Alaska Airlines Inc. eventually came to the rescue by providing the part, leaving the flight to depart 6 hours and 24 minutes late. “Despite this incident, Emirates will continue to render such technical support to other carriers, including Delta, irrespective of whether we agree or disagree with their policy views,” the Gulf company said. Thomas, the Delta spokesman, said it wasn’t immediately clear Thursday why the company originally allowed Emirates to use the part before calling it back.

Much of that criticism was sharpest in the West. (How Hwee Young/EPA) Related Stories Could the oilsands really be phased out? Here are the possibilities Keystone XL could be the final pipeline Canada's oilpatch needs Overseas markets exist for Canada's oil, but how to deliver? 'Light at the end of the tunnel:' Oilfield companies in Nisku see reason for optimism The federal government's $372-million loan to Bombardier this week attracted widespread criticism across the country. But it's an easy target in the West in particular — like shooting a basketball into a swimming pool. It's little surprise that critics pounced immediately, particularly those looking to make political hay. 'Now that things are going significantly better for Bombardier, a lot of people are saying, 'Wait a minute, why did you just do this?' - Martha Hall Findlay, Canada West Foundation Those people unhappy with the federal government's decision point to the repeated bailouts Bombardier has received, saying it amounts to the government picking winners and losers, and a wasted opportunity to spend the money elsewhere in the economy. Some of the company's supporters are also disappointed and say the cash infusion comes too little, too late, since Bombardier asked for $1 billion US about a year ago when its financial health was in a critical state. Federal government to give $372.5M in loans to Bombardier Federal loan to Bombardier not enough, say critics​ For some in Alberta, the interest-free deal summoned up always-simmering feelings of Western alienation, the long-standing narrative that Ottawa favours central Canada and repeatedly turns its back on the West, leaving the four provinces in the later time zones to fend for themselves.  While the deal is easy to criticize, experts say there is no evidence the West is being left behind and the Western alienation argument detracts from a more important debate about the need for an industrial strategy in Canada. A subsidy-heavy industry This isn't the first time the federal government has given financial assistance to Bombardier — and it probably won't be the last. Not only is the Montreal-based manufacturer a large company providing well-paying jobs, it also produces a high-value product that is exported around the world. And Bombardier plays in an industry littered with government incentives. Companies like U.S.-based Boeing, Brazil's Embraer and France's Airbus all get government support, according to Karl Moore, with McGill University's Desautels Faculty of Management. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, Bombardier President and CEO Alain Bellemare and Transport Minister Marc Garneau are shown at Tuesday's announcement of the $372.5-million loan. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press) The money and subsidies from the Quebec and Canadian governments help level the playing field for Bombardier in a globally competitive industry. "They all have government support. So if you want to play in the big leagues in this industry, different from many industries, you need government support," Moore said. Brazil launches WTO complaint against Canada over Bombardier aid The government assistance is not only necessary, he said, but appropriate. "Bombardier is probably Canada's greatest global competitor in terms of the number of jobs and the sure fact that it exports the vast majority of its products outside of Canada." Oilpatch gets its own help That argument doesn't fly as well out West, where many would like nothing better to see Bombardier cut off, left to sink or swim on its own. Bombardier's last plea for assistance in late 2015 came in the middle of a severe downturn in the oilpatch, when tens of thousands of workers were losing their jobs, companies were going belly up, and the provincial economies of Saskatchewan and Alberta fell into recession. That's why Alberta politicians, like former Conservative MP Jason Kenney and Wildrose Leader Brian Jean, were quick to criticize the Bombardier loan this week, suggesting Ottawa is disrespecting those suffering in the West. But there lies a fault in stoking this alienation fire because Ottawa has given the oilpatch plenty during the oil-price collapse. One year ago, Scott Darling was in the midst of layoffs at his small oilfield-service company in Red Deer, Alta. He was abundantly clear at the time about not wanting a bailout, like Bombardier or Air Canada have received in the past. Rather he wanted the federal government to approve a new export pipeline. A new pipe wouldn't immediately help his company, but it would benefit the industry if producers could fetch a higher return for the oil they pump out of the ground. Justin Trudeau and his government signed off on two major pipelines, Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain and Enbridge's Line 3, which will pump nearly a million more barrels of oil a day from Alberta's oilsands. (Nati Harnik/Associated Press) Fast forward to today: the federal government has approved two major export pipelines and the revival of Keystone XL south of the border could translate into three conduits for shipping oil out of Canada. That's more than the oilpatch was expecting. "The prime minister's announcement of support for two of the pipelines took a lot of the sting out of that argument," says Ian Lee, of Carleton University's Sprott School of Business.  "The criticism now has been muted. It's not as strong as it would have been three or six months ago, if those intervening acts had not occurred." Oilpatch players seek federal approval for investment fund to kick-start slumping industry The federal government has also enhanced employment insurance benefits for some regions in the West and decided in its last budget to delay a campaign promise to "phase out subsidies to the fossil fuel industry over the medium-term" because of the plunge in oil prices. The oil industry contributes significantly to the Canadian economy and, in return, has received a variety of considerable subsidies. While pipeline approvals don't cost the government any money, the Liberals may take a hit in terms of political capital in other parts of the country, as the decision didn't sit will with those who favour protecting the environment over further fossil-fuel development.  Martha Hall Findlay says the loan to Bombardier is "bad politics"1:59 Ditching the one-off bailouts Critics question how and why the federal government makes decisions about which companies are winners and which losers. Are some industries more important than others? Martha Hall Findlay — the former Toronto Liberal MP who now serves as president of the Canada West Foundation, a Calgary-based think-tank — describes the Bombardier deal as reactive, squeaky-wheel politics, saying an agreement like this only encourages frustration by other industries and regions. It doesn't help that Bombardier is no longer in dire straits and expects to make between $530 million and $630 million US next year, before taxes and interest. "Now that things are going significantly better for Bombardier, a lot of people are saying, 'Wait a minute, why did you just do this?'" she said. Hall Findlay says it's fine to help make a particular industry, like aerospace or agri-food, a priority, but there should be a long-term game plan when it comes to the private sector. "No matter where you are, I think the question ends up being, why are we doing this one-off stuff all the time?" The federal government's actions as they relate to the oilpatch make sense in that regard, as the prime minister has made it clear he wants a healthy oil-and-gas sector now to help finance the country's shift toward renewable energy over the next few decades. It's unclear where the Bombardier deal fits into an existing strategy, which is perhaps why people were so quick to criticize.  "It's easy to get angry. I don't think it is particularly constructive," says Hall Findlay. "Let's figure out how to do this ahead of time and really determine what that industrial strategy should look like."

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos News A 51st state, called Liberty, would have political clout and an ag-based economy SUNDAY, FEB. 12, 2017, 4:30 A.M. By Pia Hallenberg piah@spokesman.com(509) 459-5427 The State of Liberty would be comprised of the 20 counties of Eastern Washington knotted by conservative politics, wide-open landscapes and a shared reliance on natural resources and government services. Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS The state song of “Liberty” Related topics Doug Clark: “Liberty” deserves a new state song, and I’m happy to oblige It’s easy to dismiss House Joint Memorial 4000 with an eye roll and a “here we go again.” The measure proposes to split Washington in half and create a new state called Liberty. Similar legislation proposed in 1915, 1985, 1991, 2005 and 2015 never gained much traction. But does this year of political upheaval and civil unrest portend a different outcome? Supporters of Liberty aren’t the type to back down. “Broadcasting live from the capital of free Washington, and the future capital of the State of Liberty, Spokane Valley,” is how 51st state champion Rep. Matt Shea often introduces his podcasts. “We are making this real.” Agriculture would be a mainstay of the economy of the 51st state, “Liberty.” (Colin Mulvany / The Spokesman-Review) He boasts that the new state would “rival Texas in prosperity” and lead to lower taxes. The west side of Washington, he warns, will turn into its own “socialist utopia” and collapse without the rugged mindset and agricultural backbone of Eastern Washington. Anyone who’s visited both sides of the Cascade Mountains notices the difference in politics, economy, climate and traffic. One is the Evergreen State. The other could be coined the Sagebrush State. The question of splitting the state has always boiled down to whether the eastern half could prosper without the financial support of Seattle. Supporters are confident and point to a region rich in agriculture and electricity. Opponents say Liberty would suffer without the taxes generated by some of the world’s best companies such as Microsoft, Boeing and Amazon. Liberty would have great colleges and hospitals, both public and private. But the 51st state would be landlocked without easy access to the shipping docks of Seattle, though it would have Columbia and Snake River ports that link to Portland and the Pacific. And though Liberty would have far fewer people, it would gain national political clout and rival or surpass many other Western states in population and wealth. It would be larger than Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas. It would continue to capture billions of federal dollars to clean up the Hanford nuclear site. While Shea advocates making Spokane Valley the new state capital, others aren’t so sure. “I think it should be in Moses Lake,” said Spokane Valley Councilman Ed Pace, who is so excited about the formation of Liberty that he’s asked the Spokane Valley City Council to take a stand on it. Carol Paul, the Lincoln County GOP chairman and another supporter of the 51st State, said one problem with Washington is that Olympia is physically too far away for many residents, and ideologically out of touch with most of the state. “The capital should be in Moses Lake, Ephrata or Ellensburg,” Paul said. “The capital should be accessible and centrally located.” Spokane is not be in the initial running for capital, perhaps leading to the city’s cool reception to Liberty.Spokane City Council President Ben Stuckart likened the idea of secession to shooting oneself in the foot. The main industries in Liberty would be agriculture, manufacturing, education, trade, and government infrastructure and services. In 2014, for instance, the value of the apple industry was almost $3 billion, according to the Washington Apple Commission’s Todd Fryhover. “We employ over 55,000 people during peak season,” Fryhover said. He added that there clearly is a disconnect between the east and the west sides of the Cascades, but would prefer another solution than secession. “We do great things over here but we probably don’t sing our own praises enough,” Fryhover said. “We don’t go over to the west side and educate people on where our food comes from.” So, would Liberty be a prosperous state? “It’s tough to say if a new state would have a viable economy,” said Jamie Rossman, a policy adviser for the Washington state Department of Commerce. Liberty’s economy would depend heavily on exports, but would also retain a much lower cost of living, compared to the west side. “It wouldn’t have a major port, which can be a problem when you depend on export,” Rossman said. “But there are so many other factors to take into consideration like education and infrastructure.” Eastsiders often complain that they pay taxes to Olympia, but get little back because of spending on Seattle-area freeways and Olympia bureaucracy. According to a 2012 study by an Evergreen State College research team,King County produces 42 percent of the state’s tax revenues – but receives less than 26 percent back in the form of state benefits. That’s a return of 62 cents on the dollar. Spokane County receives more back than it pays in: $1.35 for every dollar, according to the study. Rural Ferry County gets $3.16 back for every dollar it sends to Olympia. The numbers – and recent election results – suggest Liberty is about ideology more so than cherry picking parts of the state to make a stronger economy. Paul said she’s tired of what she calls “Western Washington’s harebrained ideas.” “A benefit would be that we can govern ourselves, instead of being governed by initiatives instigated by anyone who can get enough signatures on a petition,” Paul said, “and make it sound like a good idea while hiding the snake in the grass.” Pace said it’s a good exercise in evaluating how the state is governed now and what could change. He’d like for the cities to have more freedom when it comes to economic development. “I’d like for us to have a business climate that’s more like Idaho,” Pace said. “Idaho has a lower B&O tax and a lower minimum wage. If we had a 51st state we could create an environment that’s better for business.” Pace said maybe the question isn’t how Liberty would pay for a service level akin to Washington’s, but which services could be narrowed. “What would it look like to have a state that lives within its means; that’s what we should look at,” Pace said. Rep. Bob McCaslin, Jr., R-Spokane Valley, is one of the co-sponsors of the measure. At a GOP town hall meeting in Spokane Valley two weeks ago, McCaslin said he co-sponsored House Joint Memorial 4000 in memory of his dad, longtime state senator Bob McCaslin Sr., who really believed in the idea. “I like that the bill has started a conversation,” McCaslin said, “and brought some different people together.” So does Liberty have a chance this year? “Absolutely not,” McCaslin said. “It doesn’t have a chance.” Published: Feb. 12, 2017, 4:30 a.m.  Tags: 51st state, Liberty, Matt Shea Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Lockwood , Robbie Neiswanger This article was published February 12, 2017 at 5:21 a.m. PHOTO BY AP / REBECCA BLACKWELL Cars leave the General Motors assembly plant in Villa de Reyes, Mexico, last month. Automakers have joined with retailers to oppose a tax on goods imported to the United States. Comments (4) aAFont Size Michael Pakko, chief economist at the Institute for Economic Advancement at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman of Hot Springs U.S. Rep. Steve Womack of Rogers Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon WASHINGTON -- A U.S. House Republican proposal that would tax retailers for the products they import and sell in the United States is still in the early stages. But the idea of a border adjustment tax as part of a broader tax package has retailers like Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dillard's Inc. concerned enough to band together to fend off what they believe would have a significant impact on their bottom lines and their consumers. Americans for Affordable Products formed earlier this month to spotlight the potential of the proposal, which has raised plenty of questions even among Republicans in Congress. The Affordable Products group now boasts 150 members. And, although the retail industry has taken the lead in the lobbying efforts against a border tax, the coalition includes a wider scope of companies and organizations that could be affected by such a tax. Nike Inc., Target Corp., Best Buy, Walgreens Co. and J.C. Penney Co. are also among retailers that have signed on as part of the coalition. Industry groups like the National Retail Federation, the American Apparel & Footwear Association and the Retail Industry Leaders Association are participating as well. Other industry organizations and companies -- like the American International Automobile Dealers Association and Toyota Motor North America Inc. -- have also pledged their support. "No issue has galvanized the [retail] industry like this one has over the course of the last decade," said Brian Dodge, the senior executive vice president of public affairs with the Retail Industry Leaders Association. "We are hearing from companies who don't historically engage meaningfully in public policy who are asking who to talk to and how to communicate their concerns. "The industry is activating itself against this proposal in a way that I've never seen it done before." Economists and analysts believe retailers -- and other importers in industries like oil, energy and automotive -- have reason to be concerned as Republicans contemplate sweeping changes. A border adjustment tax is part of a broader tax change plan that is being discussed by House Republicans, although no bill has been drafted. At the core of the proposal is a plan to change and lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Michael Pakko, chief economist at the Institute for Economic Advancement at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, said change is needed. Corporate tax changes also have the support of retailers who have the "highest corporate tax rates of any industry," according to the National Retail Federation. But the industry is not in favor of a 20 percent tax on imports -- the so-called border adjustment -- that is being mentioned to offset the lost revenue from a lower corporate tax rate. If enacted, estimates indicate that would generate more than $1 trillion over the next decade. "On the surface, it appears to be a tool for managing or manipulating trade in a sense that it would tax imports and leave exports untaxed," Pakko said. "In that sense, it encourages exports and discourages imports, and serves as sort of a trade barrier. At least, on the surface." Pakko also said, in theory, a relative status quo would remain for businesses under the proposal because the dollar would strengthen, lowering the cost of imported products. Companies that export items would benefit from lower taxes while their products would be more expensive overseas. Proponents of the House Republican proposal -- which include General Electric, the Boeing Co. and other members of the recently formed American Made Coalition -- believe the plan will level the playing field, helping U.S. manufacturers compete with products made overseas. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said in a statement that the main goal of the tax change blueprint is to "improve the lives of all Americans." "That's why we are working to ensure that our tax code no longer favors Chinese steel over American steel, Mexican beef and autos over American beef and autos, and foreign oil over American oil," Brady said. "One of the best ways to protect the American dream is to tax imports and exports equally in our country. It's time to end the 'Made in America' export tax." But opponents argue that there's no guarantee that the playing field would be level with the border adjustment tax, which would lead to added costs for companies that import products. Edward Jones retail analyst Brian Yarbrough said if the dollar doesn't strengthen enough to offset the tax under the proposal, there's no doubt it would have an impact on retailers. "Bottom line, for most retailers that source foreign goods, it's going to be a negative impact," Yarbrough said. "How much is that negative impact? It depends on a lot of moving factors." Yarbrough said the tax burden would likely shift to consumers, resulting in price increases for goods like clothes, shoes, toys, gas and produce. According to the American Apparel & Footwear Association, 98.4 percent of the shoes and 97.3 percent of the clothes sold in the United States were imported in 2016. The National Retail Federation estimates that a border adjustment tax would cost American households up to $1,700 in the first year alone and could threaten millions of jobs. "It's absolutely damaging to the consumer," Yarbrough said. "At the end of the day you're basically shifting the tax burden from corporations to the consumer. Because now that the corporations are going to pay a lower tax rate, the companies that are impacted are most likely going to raise prices. The consumer is most likely not going to win in this environment." Members of the all-Republican Arkansas congressional delegation aren't rushing to support the proposal. "I'm still trying to learn more about it and understand it," said U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman of Hot Springs. "That's one that we're going to have to analyze a little bit more and get some more facts and data about." U.S. Rep. Steve Womack of Rogers said he wants to see a tax system that is "more simple and fair," and that lowers corporate tax rates, but he isn't sure whether the border adjustment tax should be included in the package. "I have some concerns about border adjustability because of the potential it has for raising consumer prices on a lot of things that American consumers use on a daily basis -- everything from gasoline to bananas," he said. The lawmaker said the law may have unintended consequences. "We've got to be very, very careful in our approach," Womack said. In a written statement, U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford of Jonesboro said it's premature to weigh in on the issue. "Until I at least see draft language for the border adjustment tax and the rest of the tax reform plan, it's purely speculative to render [judgment]. However, when we do have a plan to review, my bottom line will be whether or not the reform package will have a positive impact on economic growth and quality of life in the 1st District," he said. U.S. Rep. French Hill of Little Rock is undecided on the matter. "This is a complicated issue, and Congressman Hill is thoroughly reviewing and studying it before he makes a decision one way or another," said the lawmaker's spokesman, Mike Siegel. On the other side of the Capitol, U.S. Sen. John Boozman of Rogers is still studying the proposal. "He's been looking at it. He's heard from folks, and he does have some concerns, in terms of what he has learned about it so far," said the legislator's spokesman, Patrick Creamer. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Dardanelle also has reservations about the proposal. "Sen. Cotton is deeply concerned by the border-tax proposal. It could significantly increase the cost of groceries, clothing, toys and other items, and hurt Arkansas families trying to make ends meet. He will work with his colleagues to make sure that the final tax-cut package reflects the interests of hardworking Arkansans," said Caroline Rabbitt, the senator's spokesman. Wal-Mart officials declined to comment about the border adjustment tax and its potential impact on the company, but Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon was in Washington, D.C., earlier this month as part of President Donald Trump's business council. McMillon said in a statement after the meeting that job creation and the economy were part of the "constructive and candid" conversation. McMillon also said he was looking forward to continued discussions and that the retailer has long believed it was "always better to be engaged in trying to shape solutions than sitting on the sidelines." Economists and analysts believe that there won't be a change adopted anytime soon, but the stakes are high as businesses lobby on both sides of the issue. Kathy Deck, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Arkansas, said recently that if a border adjustment tax is enacted, it would present an enormous strategic challenge as well as a substantial shift for retailers and businesses like Wal-Mart. "We don't know what the final proposal will look like," Deck said. "But we do know it would cause companies to fundamentally rethink how they source, how they replenish and how they price."

However as a main goal of the GOP is to shift tax burden from rich to poor by using sale taxes to make up revenue loss from income tax cuts on higher incomes this border tax should delight true republicans .

And blow a hole in our debt that will dwarf even W's stupid policy. Good job GOP.

The public rebuke, which the White House later defended, called renewed attention to the potential tangle of business interests Trump brought with him on taking office last month. In a tweet posted moments after he wrapped up an address to U.S. law enforcement, Trump hit out at the high-end retailer for announcing last week it had decided to discontinue sales of Ivanka Trump’s fashion line due to poor sales. “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by Nordstrom,” Trump wrote. “She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” Since his surprise victory in the November presidential election, Trump has used his Twitter feed to lambast individual companies — from General Motors to Boeing — be it for off-shoring jobs or allegedly overcharging the federal government for aircraft. But the latest tweet was different in that it sought to defend part of Trump’s family business empire, which critics have said could be a source of profound conflicts of interest for the White House. Trump made sure to give his message on Ivanka maximum reach by posting it both on his personal handle @realDonaldTrump and on the official account of the U.S. presidency @POTUS. Since his November victory, Trump has touted an effort to remove himself from running his business empire, transferring corporate control to his sons. But he has resisted divesting, as a government ethics watchdog had called on him to do. Critics say the Trump businesses still pose a significant ethical quandary. Further playing into the running debate, Pentagon officials said Wednesday they were looking to rent space in Trump Tower, Trump’s flagship Manhattan luxury building, to accommodate equipment and staff who accompany the president during his stays there. That came on the heels of a lawsuit filed by Melania Trump in New York, which claimed that damaging rumors reported by a British tabloid had interfered with her “unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to earn millions of dollars due to her raised profile as first lady. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday defended Trump’s Nordstrom tweet, saying the president was standing up for a family member. “There’s clearly efforts to undermine that name based on her father’s issues or particular policies,” Spicer told reporters. “For someone to take out their concern of the policies against a family member of his is simply not acceptable and he has every right to speak out about it.” Nordstrom responded on Wednesday, reiterating that its decision to drop the Ivanka Trump line was made purely on business grounds. “Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,” the company said in a statement, adding that it had “a great relationship” with Ivanka Trump’s business. Nordstrom is one of several U.S. businesses that has faced boycott calls for its association with the Trump brand. It is among the firms targeted in a “Grab Your Wallet” campaign launched by anti-Trump activists in protest at the Republican billionaire’s agenda. The campaign on Wednesday was still targeting other retailers such as Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Dillard’s for carrying Ivanka Trump products. A sign of the fine line that firms are treading in the current political era, others such as PepsiCo. and Budweiser have faced a backlash from the opposite camp after moves deemed critical of the Trump administration. Richard Briffault, an expert in government ethics at Columbia Law School, said Trump’s use of the presidential bully pulpit to defend his daughter’s business “was inconsistent with any notion of the ethical obligations of a public official.” “What this suggests is that he hasn’t fully internalized the consequence of being the most important public official in the country,” Briffault said. Since a 1989 executive order, federal officials have been barred from using public office for private gain, Briffault said, adding that any public criticism from a sitting president could be interpreted as an attempt to influence that company’s business decisions. “It gives the appearance that he is using his position to promote the business interests of a close relative,” said Briffault. Unlike other companies he has attacked on Twitter, including Lockheed, Boeing and Ford, which saw their share prices suffer following criticism from Trump, Nordstrom’s stock finished up more than 4.0 percent on Wednesday. The news of Trump’s remarks preceded a report from The New York Times on Wednesday, which said TJX Companies, the parent of clothing retailers TJ Maxx and Marshalls, had told employees to discard all Ivanka Trump promotional signs and not to display her clothing separately.

News Business Business News UK faces dramatic cyber-security skills 'cliff edge' and is chronically under prepared for hacker attacks, study finds The study finds that only 12 per cent of the UK workforce is under the age of 35 and 53 per cent is over the age of 45 Josie Cox Business Editor Tuesday 14 February 2017 07:45 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Tuesday’s survey follows a string of similar warnings and a slew of high-profile cyber-attacks that have cost companies both in terms of money and reputation Reuters A global survey of almost 20,000 security professionals across banks, governments and multinationals concludes that Britain is facing a cyber-security skills “cliff edge” and that companies are “chronically” underprepared for attacks.  The survey, conducted by (ISC)² – a non-profit organisation that aims to educate people about the risks of being online – shows that the UK workforce is getting older which is exacerbating an already gaping cyber-security skills rift.  Only 12 per cent of the workforce is under the age of 35 and 53 per cent is over the age of 45, the study finds.  Read more Russian hackers 'threaten UK's national security', GCHQ chief warns A mere 6 per cent of UK companies are recruiting graduates who would have the potential to plug the gap, and 66 per cent already face a cyber-security skills squeeze due to being unable to find qualified personnel.  The data also suggest that employers are largely refusing to hire and train inexperienced recruits. A whopping 93 per cent of UK companies that responded to the survey said that previous cyber-security experience is an important factor in their hiring decisions. The findings indicate that the skills deficit is already having an effect on British businesses.   Close to half of the UK companies questioned said that the shortfall of cyber-security personnel is having a significant impact on their customers. A similar proportion said that it is already causing security breaches.   “Industry is experiencing a talent shortfall because employers are too focused on recruiting people with existing cyber-security experience,” said Lucy Chaplin, a manager within KPMG’s financial services technology risk consulting group, commenting on the survey.  “[It] is like complaining that there’s a shortage of pilots but refusing to hire anyone who is not already an experienced pilot.”  Read more British teenagers to be taught 'cyber curriculum' to defend UK Trump fires White House staffer who ensures he does not get hacked Millions of Xbox and PlayStation users' personal data has been stolen A cyber-security skills gap is threatening UK companies Rob Partridge, head of BT’s Security Academy, said that “the findings confirm that graduates are being overlooked for cyber-security roles and it is now an economic and security imperative that we change this trend”. Tuesday’s survey follows a string of similar warnings and a slew of high-profile cyber-attacks that have cost companies both in terms of money and reputation.  Last month, a survey by job site Indeed showed that the chasm between supply and demand for cyber-security expertise is widening at an alarming rate.  Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 4/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

By NigamArora Trading Deck columnist (Corrects story originally published Feb. 13, 2017, to say that Japan, China and South Korea have trade surpluses, not deficits, with the U.S.) Donald Trump has accused countries including China and Japan of manipulating their currencies and running large trade surpluses with the U.S. Investors in Asia were on edge leading into the meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump late last week. The economic policies of Abe, known as Abenomics, rely in part on a weak Japanese yen and exports to the U.S. There is a clear conflict between Abenomics and Trump's policies. The news was that the meeting between Abe and Trump ended with handshakes, hugs, golf and a statement by Trump that he supports Japan “100%.” But the real news here is that there was no mention of a weak yen and Japan running a trade surplus, creating, of course, a deficit for the U.S. Trump vs Abe There is a clear conflict between Abenomics and Trump's policies. In 2016, Japan ran a $68.9 billion trade surplus with the U.S., ranking second after China. So it appears that Abenomics has triumphed over Trump's policies. Trump might have been influenced by geopolitical considerations to forgo the flashpoint of a weak yen and a trade deficit for the U.S. While Trump and Abe were meeting, North Korea challenged them by launching a ballistic missile in the Sea of Japan. Markets are responding. This shift in Trump's policies is good for U.S. stocks, good for Japanese and Asian stocks, good for the dollar, and bad for gold and silver. The reaction in U.S. stocks is best illustrated in the annotated chart of Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.52%  futures. Please click here for the annotated chart of DJIA futures. The initial reaction is selling pressure on the yen and buying pressure in all four benchmark U.S. stock ETFs, S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.52% Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +0.59% Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, +0.59% and Small-Cap ETF IWN, +0.34% Another initial reaction is that the “smart money” all over the world is selling gold. In the U.S. selling pressure can be seen in the gold ETF GLD, +0.44% silver ETF SLV, +0.18% gold miner ETF GDX, +0.04% junior gold miner ETF GDXJ, -0.69% and leveraged gold miner ETF NUGT, -0.24% And buying is seen in inverse leveraged gold miner ETF DUST, +0.19% It is noteworthy that export-dependent stocks that have been at risk due to Trump's policies are now less at risk. Those include Apple AAPL, +0.36% Boeing BA, +0.47% Broadcom AVGO, +0.32%   International Business Machines IBM, +0.86% 3M MMM, +0.71% Nike NKE, +0.34% Nvidia NVDA, +0.20%  and Wynn Resorts WYNN, +2.16%   The South Korean market would usually have been expected to fall today, but selling has been contained on optimism over a shift in Trump’s policy. South Korea also runs a large trade surplus with the U.S. Of interest here are the Korea ETF EWY, +1.14%  and Korea Fund KF, +0.29% What to do now This is a positive development for the long run. Consider holding good long-term positions. However, Trump is unpredictable, and the U.S. market is overbought. For this reason, it is prudent to patiently wait for a pullback to start any new positions.

A Muslim ban was placed on seven countries with no history of attacks in America. A law that helped save the economy after the 2008 stock market crash is being revoked, allowing Wall Street to resume the activities that caused the recession. America’s allies are distancing themselves. More and more of President Donald Trump’s debatably unqualified and very conservative cabinet picks are being confirmed by slim margins. For many Americans, the confirmations of Betsy DeVos as education secretary, Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Stephen Bannon as chief strategist have tested their faith in those whom President Trump appoints to influential positions. Uniquely in the executive branch, Trump’s economic advisory council is filled with successful business leaders, many of whom have previously expressed more moderate or liberal views. However, several of the members have faced backlash for their association with the controversial president, including Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla. Movements such as #deleteUber have generated significant social media activity and active boycotts. Although the hashtag originally stemmed from legitimate gripes with how Uber mishandled the immigration ban by capitalizing on the JFK taxi embargo, the hashtag has since warped into primarily berating Kalanick for being a member of Trump’s economic advisory council. The increasing disapproval of the CEO both within and outside the company and protests at Uber headquarters have cumulated in Kalanick announcing that he had stepped down from his presidential advisory role. Musk has also faced criticism for also being on the president’s council, with many people announcing the cancellations of their Tesla orders. Both have been widely accused of “working for Trump.” However, being on the advisory council does not mean that its members are enabling or working for the president. It simply suggests that they are advising him in areas in which he is not well versed. What the first 20 or so days have demonstrated thus far is that Trump strongly trusts and follows what his advisors say. In defense of not stepping down from the board, Musk himself has noted that he is simply “trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction.” The opposition and fury directed at Kalanick and Musk, while understandable, is misguided and misses what is an important opportunity for notable companies and competent businesspeople to hold an audience with the president. It is vital now more than ever that Trump’s alt-right-oriented inner circle have a few moderating voices focused less on politics and more on science, technology and innovation. Demanding that those voices step down not only robs the president — and by extension, the American people — of diverse perspectives in the White House but also nudges our national leadership farther from the center. Filling an economic advisory board with prominent leaders from a wide range of businesses, from startups like Uber to established companies like Pepsi, shows the emphasis Trump places on the success of businesses in the U.S. Rather than admonishing Musk, we should encourage tech leaders to communicate with the president and express their pro-science, more moderate viewpoints. Ride-sharing policies aside, it is fairly hypocritical for the progressive left to direct their anger solely at the mid-sized tech companies who  have expressed more liberal viewpoints than many of the other companies who are tied to the advisory council. Although it is debatable that it is much more difficult to avoid  or threaten industry titans such as the Walt Disney Company, General Electric or Boeing, any movements against them have not gained much traction. Most of these companies have also been noticeably silent on the president’s recent policies. On the other hand, both SpaceX and Uber are part of 130 tech companies who have signed the amici curiae (friends of the court) brief that argues that  Trump’s immigration order is unconstitutional. Both Musk and Kalanick have also previously questioned Trump’s qualifications to serve as commander in chief and are good foils to older, more conservative companies. Musk has already made waves by requesting that the travel ban and climate be put on the council’s meeting agenda to be discussed first and foremost. If the past election cycle has taught the American people anything, the walls of our echo chambers have been built too high, and we are no longer listening to opposing views. We are so sealed off that contradicting viewpoints are completely unfathomable. Activists should not be berating those who are actively reaching across the aisle by calling them enablers but rather encouraging those with more opposing views to advise the president. As Musk tweeted, “how could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?” Related: elon musk, Opinions Post navigation ← Ramblin’ with: Carlos Benito A Tinder love story → User Guidelines Participation constitutes agreement to our User Guidelines, so please read them before commenting.

News Business Business News Brexit latest: Inflation forecast to hit 1.9 per cent on back of higher petrol prices In the Office for National Statistics' last report inflation in December came in at 1.6 per cent. Ben Chu @Benchu_ Monday 13 February 2017 16:50 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Petrol prices rose in January istock/ gremlin UK consumer price inflation is expected to jump to 1.9 per cent on Tuesday, its highest level since June 2014, as the slump in the pound since last June's Brexit referendum continues to feed through to the high street. In the Office for National Statistics' last report, inflation in December came in at 1.6 per cent year on year. On Tuesday, the consensus of City analysts is that it will report a 1.9 per cent figure for January, just below the Bank of England's official 2 per cent target. Heading up Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said half of the contribution to the rise in the annual rate of CPI would likely be from petrol and diesel prices, which rose by almost 3.5 per cent month on month in January, after registering a 2.5 per cent fall in January 2016. There would also be upward contributions to the overall rate, Mr Clarke predicted, from food and rail fares.  "We are in a rising inflation environment when there tend to be more upward surprises than downwards surprises," he added The Bank of England expects inflation to breach 2 per cent by the end of March and peak at 2.72 per cent in the first quarter of 2018, before gliding down to 2.4 per cent by the end of 2019. In its latest minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee said it was prepared to tolerate an overshoot of its target over its three-year forecast period in order to support growth as the economy slows over the next two years during the Brexit negotiations. But it added "some members" of the MPC are reaching the limits of their tolerance for inflation, implying that they could soon start voting for rate rises if inflationary pressures seem to be stronger than expected. Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 4/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Plan to swap 747-8 airliner for B-21 Raider proposed by defence analysts. By James Billington February 13, 2017 16:14 GMT Close Six terror attacks the Trump administration feel were ‘under-reported’ IBTimes UK Donald Trump may be looking to trade in his 747-8 Air Force One jet in favour of a stealth bomber as the President of the United States seeks alternative wings to fly his, so far turbulent, reign. The famous presidential Boeing 747-8 jet is overdue an upgrade and is being eyed up for retro-fitted military-grade defence features, which Trump has lambasted over the cost. For an aircraft that is coming to the end of its life anyway, a panel of aerospace and defence analysts have proposed ditching the 747 for a B-21 stealth bomber. As reported by Aviation Week, the proliferation of high-tech surface-to-air missiles by guerrilla groups is a significant threat to Air Force One, which is a "fat radar target" and will need to be modified to provide greater defence and communication systems. The Pentagon also wants the aircraft to be able to fly in the event of nuclear war, to withstand electromagnetic pulses. Donald Trump, when President-elect, took to Twitter to blast the building of new 747s, claiming the $4 billion cost was "out of control" and wanted to "cancel the order". But the penny-pinching President needn't fret. Cost management consultants Wright Williams & Kelly (WWK) produced their hypothetical report detailing how Trump could save money by avoiding modifying the 747-8 and instead opting for the Northrop Grumman B-21 stealth bomber, which would tick all these boxes when ready to fly. While the report cites a B-21, the analysis is based on the unclassified B-2, which is already in operation. "The B-21 has stealth built in, it's nuclear-rated and heavily shielded right off the bat. It's going to be terribly cramped but man, it would be a survivable platform, especially if operated in twos and threes," says Danny Lam, spokesperson for WWK. Air Force One, 747-8 passenger jet is in line for an upgrade. Getty Currently, Air Force One is capable of carrying around 70 passengers so questions over the issue of space inside the B-21 arise. However, WWK believe that the weapons bay could be stripped out and modified and if Trump's bomber is shadowed (at a safe distance) by two 737s – Boeing's smallest commercial jet, which have already been militarised by air forces – they would be able to carry White House personnel. "All the things the 747 will need, it's already been done on the 737," says Lam. "The one-time expense of militarising the 747 would be wasted on an aircraft that is likely to go out of production because of low sales. A 737-based aircraft would probably meet most of their needs and it'll be cheaper. We're still going to be flying 737s for at least 30 years." The Northrup Grumman B-21 Raider, due to go into service by the mid-2020's. US Air Force The radically designed B-21 Raider is based on the iconic, angular B-2, which was created in the late 1980s and introduced in 1997. The new B-21, which was shown off in 2016, takes its radar-dodging technology to the next level as enemy radars become more sophisticated. Touching down in such an aircraft would make for a typically Trumpian move which, ironically, wouldn't be stealthy at all. "Suppose you're a little power who wants to take out the president of the US with a surprise attack. The deterrent effect of showing up in a very, very well-protected, heavily-armed aircraft with multiple planes might make you think twice," claimed WWK. Now you see him, now you don't. Could President Trump switch Air Force One for a stealth bomber?Getty Images However, despite claims of saving money and making an impression to other world leaders, the estimated deployment date for the B-21 bomber is expected by around 2024, so even if this fairly wild plan did come to fruition, Trump may not even be in office see take-off it anyway. So he might just have to learn to put up with those rough hand towels on-board Air Force One instead. More from IBTimes UK Technology Russian spies in the White House?

Sasikala's pick EPS to be TN CM India's navy is in the hunt for a new foreign fighter jet after rejecting an indigenously made aircraft as too heavy, the latest sign of the struggle to get Asian militaries to buy locally to grow their defence industries. The navy last month invited manufacturers to pitch for 57 planes for its aircraft carriers, a multi-billion dollar order the government had hoped would go to the state-run producers of India's Tejas, a combat aircraft 33 years in the making. India, South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian buyers are expected to intensify efforts this year to develop indigenous warplanes, military officials said, due to anxieties that the United States may be less engaged in the region under President Donald Trump. But their hopes of manufacturing state-of-the-art warplanes could still be decades away as countries need more time to master the technology, experts said. "It's been long on ambition short on success," Richard A. Bitzinger, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said of the drive. © REUTERS/Stringer/Files An Indian Navy soldier holds an Indian national flag during a dress rehearsal ahead of Navy Day celebrations in Mumbai "These things are being done because of techno-nationalism. They are done because these countries perceive of themselves as rising powers." As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make-in-India" campaign, scientists will showcase the Tejas warplane at an air show opening in Bengaluru on Tuesday. But the jet remains a work in progress, with only three in service with the air force. South Korea, supported by Indonesia, has multi-billion dollar plans to develop a twin-engined KF-X fighter jet, while Taiwan said this month it plans to build 66 jet trainer aircraft that could eventually help it manufacture a combat plane. Chang Yeoung-keun, an adviser on the KF-X fighter jet project and a professor at Korea Aerospace University, said full development of the plane and its technologies will take decades. "South Korea needs to develop core technologies of the jets, not just shells," he said. "I am sceptical. South Korea may be able to develop core technology in 30 to 40 years, but they have to develop them in 10 years, with current fighter jets ageing."

Instead, it suffered years of delay with scientists trying to build the world's most modern light combat aircraft from scratch, including the engine. In December, the navy chief, Admiral Sunil Lanba, said the sea version of the plane was "not up to the mark" and it could not take off from an aircraft carrier once weapons were loaded. A source in the navy said that the plane for years has failed flight tests when taking off from a 200-metre carrier deck with weapons on board. That prompted the navy to issue a request last month for information for a foreign fighter to fill the gap, the first stage in a long procurement process. Boeing Co has pitched its F-A/18 Hornet, that the U.S. navy flies from its carriers, to the Indian defence ministry, including an offer to build it locally. Sweden's Saab AB said on Friday it will offer the naval version of its Gripen fighter to the Indian navy. India's top defence scientists said they were disappointed by the navy's decision and that fighter aircraft development was a challenge everywhere, including with the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35. "Look at the F-35, with all the might of the multinational effort, is still evolving," said a source in the aeronautical development agency which is spearheading the LCA effort.

The navy last month invited manufacturers to pitch for 57 planes for its aircraft carriers, a multibillion dollar order the government had hoped would go to the state-run producers of India’s Tejas, a combat aircraft 33 years in the making. India, South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian buyers are expected to intensify efforts this year to develop indigenous warplanes, military officials said, due to anxieties that the United States may be less engaged in the region under President Donald Trump. But their hopes of manufacturing state-of-the-art warplanes could still be decades away as countries need more time to master the technology, experts said. “It’s been long on ambition short on success,” Richard A. Bitzinger, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said of the drive. “These things are being done because of techno-nationalism. They are done because these countries perceive of themselves as rising powers.” As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make-in-India” campaign, scientists will showcase the Tejas warplane at an air show opening in Bengaluru on today. But the jet remains a work in progress, with only three in service with the air force. South Korea, supported by Indonesia, has multibillion dollar plans to develop a twin-engined KF-X fighter jet, while Taiwan said this month it plans to build 66 jet trainer aircraft that could eventually help it manufacture a combat plane. Chang Yeoung-keun, an adviser on the KF-X fighter jet project and a professor at Korea Aerospace University, said full development of the plane and its technologies will take decades. “South Korea needs to develop core technologies of the jets, not just shells,” he said. “I am sceptical. South Korea may be able to develop core technology in 30 to 40 years, but they have to develop them in 10 years, with current fighter jets ageing.”   India’s struggle Cleared by the government in 1983, the Indian plane was meant to be the backbone of the air force due for induction in 1994. Instead, it suffered years of delay with scientists trying to build the world’s most modern light combat aircraft from scratch, including the engine.

News Business Business News New British-made car could hit roads in the spirit of discontinued Land Rover Defender The last classic Land Rover Defender, known the world over and with famous fans including the Queen, rolled off the production line in January last year after almost seven decades Josie Cox Business Editor Monday 13 February 2017 14:30 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Ineos is looking at a major diversification from its current portfolio The UK could soon be getting a new home-grown car. Just over a year after Britain’s iconic Land Rover Defender went out of production, billionaire Jim Ratcliffe – the founder of chemicals giant Ineos – is drawing up plans to fill that 4x4-shaped gap in the UK’s car market. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Tom Crotty, a director at Ineos, said that Mr Ratcliffe was planning to create a vehicle that “shares the spirit of” the Defender but is not exactly the same as it. Read more After almost 70 years, it’s the end of the road for the Land Rover Def “It is Jim’s brainchild,” Mr Crotty told the programme. “He had a passion for this type of vehicle, he sees the opportunity.” The company is aiming to build the off-roader in post-Brexit Britain. Before it was discontinued, about 15,000 to 20,000 Defenders were being made annually, according to Mr Crotty. Ineos, a company with a turnover of approximately $40bn (£32bn), would be looking to produce a similar number of cars, he said. The last classic Land Rover Defender, known the world over and with fans including the Queen, rolled off the production line in January last year after almost seven decades of manufacture. Read more Nissan Brexit deal could lead to 'colossal bill for the taxpayer' Brexit: Minister refuses to say how Government persuaded Nissan Number of cars built in Britain hits 17-year high The rugged car was originally intended for agricultural use, and became particularly popular with the military and explorers. But in more recent decades it also became the car of choice for celebrities and anyone with a passion for sturdy, reliable automobiles. More than two million Defenders have been sold since 1948 when, because of steel shortages after the war, aluminium was used for most of the body panels. For Ineos, a move into car production would mark a major diversification from its current portfolio.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 4/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The investigation comes after online fashion retailer Asos was accused last year of exploitative working practises with staff reportedly unable to take regular water and toilet breaks for fears of missing targets. The company denied those allegations.

Tesco 8/32 Tobacco giant Imperial Brands scraps chief executive pay rise - Thursday January 26 The chief executive of Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes, is unlikely to get a pay rise this year in what seems to be another battle over boardroom greed.

ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads READ MORE Link between high executive pay and performance ‘negligible’ A new pay policy that would have had the effect of taking Ms Cooper’s remuneration to £8.5m in 2017 was expected to be put to a shareholders’ vote on 1 February.

In her speech in London on Tuesday, Ms May confirmed that Britain will leave the EU’s single market to regain control of immigration policy and said that she wants to renegotiate the UK’s customs agreement and seek a transition period to phase in changes all while remaining a “best friend” to the bloc.

Travel News & Advice What it's like to work in the world's most remote café - in Antarctica Joel Witwer reflects on six months living in the frozen south Kashmira Gander @kashmiragander Monday 13 February 2017 13:30 GMT Click to follow The Independent Travel Joel Witwer lived and worked at the McMurdo base for an Antarctic summer VichoT/iStock When travel junkie Joel Witwer scored a job at a cafeteria on Antarctica, he couldn’t believe his luck.  Witwer had been determined to visit every continent before he reached 30. Antarctica struck him as harsh, desolate and hostile to human life - and it only made him more desperate to visit.  “It’s the most isolated continent in the world, with zero permanent residents,” Witwer told The Independent. “It was a place I had no reason to be, but one I so desperately wanted to experience. It was never intended to sustain human life – so to be there for a season, to live in those conditions, felt like I’d got the chance to be the sort of pioneer or explorer I’ve read so many stories about. Dramatic pictures of the Antarctic go on show 13 show all Dramatic pictures of the Antarctic go on show 1/13 Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 2/13 "This is one of those moments - one of my absolute favourites in 25 years of wildlife photography. I had found a parent standing with its chick, when its partner came over and started to feed the chick regurgitated krill. They were stood like that for only a few seconds, and though I managed to take several pictures, this was the one where the chick looked right at me." Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 3/13 Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 4/13 "I took this in the Russian Arctic from a Russian helicopter on a trip to the North Pole. Polar bears' favourite prey are Ring Seals. I love photographing polar bears - they're beautiful animals, and they have a huge variety of behaviour, from hunting, to being incredibly gentle with their cubs. Here, I like the simple graphic image of blood against snow - though it's a shot which people either love or hate." Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 5/13 "That's the Hubbard Glacier in Alaska in July. There are people in a boat in front of the glacier - I wanted to give some scale of this huge wall of ice. The detail of the ice is amazing; its colour is exactly as it appeared in real life. The intense blue comes from older ice which has had the air compressed out of it." Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 6/13 "This won me a prize at the International Photographer of the Year awards. It's of people standing on the Ross Ice Shelf, which is the world's largest ice shelf - bigger than France! Shackleton and Scott both had to cross in on their way to the South Pole." Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 7/13 "This is a volcano call Tyatya, part of a chain of active volcanoes in the Kuril Islands, between Kamchatka in Russia and Hokkaido in Japan. It's a somma volcano, so it has a new cone rising up from the middle of the collapsed one. I felt the stunning clouds at the top made for a dramatic shot." Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 8/13 "This is the actual North Pole. Whereas the South Pole is on land, the North Pole is situated in a frozen sea, which has different ice thickness throughout the year. In this instance, I visited on a Russian icebreaker called Kapitan Khlebnikov. I spend between about six to eight months per year out of the country on expeditions like this." Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 9/13 "There is a famous photograph by Herbert Ponting, who took incredible pictures on Scott's expedition a hundred years ago, which is very similar to this shot. In fact, I saw this hole in the ice, and remembered his picture. In the end, I waited and waited and waited, and eventually an Emperor Penguin toddled over on his own, allowing me to get a couple of shots. That's the thing with wildlife photography, you have to be very patient. Sometimes for weeks!" Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 10/13 "This is one of my favourite photographs. It was taken on "50 Years of Victory", which is the largest nuclear icebreaker in the world. The bear is standing stock still; it was tracking a seal, which had just disappeared under the ice, and he's waiting for it to reappear. I just love the patterns in the snow, and the contrast of all the colours. It also sums up polar bears: living in an incredibly hostile environment, but perfectly adapated to it." Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 11/13 "These are Adélie Penguins in the Antarctic Ross Sea. So many people have commented to me that it looks like a diorama in a museum with penguins superimposed on top of it, but it is real. A lot of things had to come together to make this picture work - I needed the light, the colony of penguins, and the weather conditions in the background. They're very characterful birds, these penguins, and I think it shows." Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 12/13 Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood 13/13 "Me with my camera, a Canon 1DS III." Taken from Cold Places by Sue Flood Now 28 and working as a photographer for an international aid organisation in Niamey, Niger, Witwer was born in the US, but grew up in Ireland and has been travelling for most of his adult life.  As he neared the age of 27, he’d already lived in Europe, visited Asia and was about to start studying abroad in New Zealand. But he realised he was quickly nearing his deadline to reach the world’s most inhospitable continent.   Read more Huge crack in the Antarctic grows by six miles UK Antarctic base to go into shutdown because of huge crack in ice 5 facts about the man who led the first expedition to the South Pole Then he stumbled upon the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) at McMurdo, one of the nation’s research stations in the Great White South. After scoring a job at the cafeteria there, Witwer swapped the comfort of suburban Rochester, New York, to live in a dorm for six months with scientists and contractors, whose jobs ranged between everything from carpentry to fire-fighting. In September 2015, he landed on the icy tundra via a military Boeing C-17.  For the first handful of weeks, the sun only set for a few hours a day. But by December - the Antarctic summer - the sun stopped going down all together. Nothing could prepare Witwer for what he described as the “sheer whiteness of the place”. “I lived in the northern US for many years so I was used to snow, but not flat fields of white as far as the eye can see. Jagged white peaks lined the horizon. Everything was greyscale. Stepping off that plane for the first time felt like stepping onto a different planet. I was not prepared for the enormity of it all.” What he had feared most, however, was the sense of isolation.  “The base is home to about 1,000 people during the summer months, but knowing there is no other form of civilisation close by can be daunting,” Witwer said.  Joel Witwer in his extreme cold weather gear (Joel Witwer) “This is something they address during the job interview, as it is never ideal for someone to have to leave the ice before the end of their contract.” To ensure Witwer and his colleagues would be up to the challenge of six months in Antarctica, his employers stressed that normal comforts – like nipping away for a weekend break – would be impossible. McMurdo would be everything they knew for 24 weeks.  However, as Witwer settled in, he was surprised to find he didn’t feel lonely. “There was this awareness that we were isolated from the veins of humanity,” he says, “but the community down there is close-knit and looks after each other. You are not alone.”  Read more Airline pilot reveals what frightens him most about flying Working six days a week for 10 hours a day, as he was obliged to do, helped. And he didn’t exactly have to deal with the same kind of hardships suffered by polar explorers like Ernest Shackleton. His spare time was divided between the gym, two pubs and the coffee house at the base. Volunteers would also organise activities including language lessons, CrossFit sessions, and snowmobile excursions to ice caves. And each year, McMurdo residents hold an “IceStock” music festival, where bands that formed earlier in the season get to play to a captive audience. Plus, Witwer was fortunate enough to be there in summer. The temperature hovered around the 0C mark, and, according to him, “it was at times warmer than Rochester”. The USAP also provides everyone on base with extreme cold weather gear. “I imagine a winter contract would be much more challenging both mentally and physically,” he said. “The McMurdo population plunges to around 200 during the winter and the cold is much more bitter, with regular, raging storms.” As the months rolled on, Witwer says it became clear to him that Antarctica attracts a certain type of adventurer: “They are avid travellers looking to buck convention.” He said there was an even split between men and women and that most tended to be in their thirties. “A lot of them will work hard over the length of their contract, save up all their money, and then spend the off-season travelling the world.  Read more What it's like to be a tour guide in Afghanistan “They like to dream big and aren’t afraid to think outside of what mainstream culture tells us to do. I used to think of myself as rather adventurous and creative until I met these people. Now I realise I’m only getting started.” But Witwer says he would recommend visiting Antarctica to anyone for the “sheer, vast freedom” of a continent unmarred by human presence.  “When you are in the middle of it, the continent seems endless in every direction,” he said. “It is easy to forget that life outside exists. But, for me, it’s the thrilling combination of fear and beauty that elevates the place.” For travellers planning on heading there, Witwer urges they do so responsibly. “With the growing interest in Antarctic tourism comes the growing human impact on the continent,” he added. “Consider how your presence there will impact the environment. Find a company that will allow you to explore the wonders there in a responsible way that preserves it for those who follow.” More about: Travel Antarctica Adventure holidays Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Photo -PTI   Sharelines India navy spurns homemade warplane, latest blow to Asia push for self reliance #India navy spurns homemade #warplane, latest blow to Asia push for self reliance Bengaluru/New Delhi: India's navy is in the hunt for a new foreign fighter jet after rejecting an indigenously made aircraft as too heavy, the latest sign of the struggle to get Asian militaries to buy locally to grow their defence industries. The navy last month invited manufacturers to pitch for 57 planes for its aircraft carriers, a multi-billion dollar order the government had hoped would go to the state-run producers of India's Tejas, a combat aircraft 33 years in the making. India, South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian buyers are expected to intensify efforts this year to develop indigenous warplanes, military officials said, due to anxieties that the United States may be less engaged in the region under President Donald Trump. But their hopes of manufacturing state-of-the-art warplanes could still be decades away as countries need more time to master the technology, experts said. "It's been long on ambition short on success," Richard A. Bitzinger, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said of the drive. "These things are being done because of techno-nationalism. They are done because these countries perceive of themselves as rising powers." As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make-in-India" campaign, scientists will showcase the Tejas warplane at an air show opening in Bengaluru on Tuesday. But the jet remains a work in progress, with only three in service with the air force. South Korea, supported by Indonesia, has multi-billion dollar plans to develop a twin-engined KF-X fighter jet, while Taiwan said this month it plans to build 66 jet trainer aircraft that could eventually help it manufacture a combat plane. Chang Yeoung-keun, an adviser on the KF-X fighter jet project and a professor at Korea Aerospace University, said full development of the plane and its technologies will take decades. "South Korea needs to develop core technologies of the jets, not just shells," he said. "I am sceptical. South Korea may be able to develop core technology in 30 to 40 years, but they have to develop them in 10 years, with current fighter jets ageing." Cleared by the government in 1983, the Indian plane was meant to be the backbone of the air force due for induction in 1994. Instead, it suffered years of delay with scientists trying to build the world's most modern light combat aircraft from scratch, including the engine. In December, the navy chief, Admiral Sunil Lanba, said the sea version of the plane was "not up to the mark" and it could not take off from an aircraft carrier once weapons were loaded. A source in the navy said that the plane for years has failed flight tests when taking off from a 200-metre carrier deck with weapons on board. That prompted the navy to issue a request last month for information for a foreign fighter to fill the gap, the first stage in a long procurement process. Boeing Co has pitched its F-A/18 Hornet, that the US navy flies from its carriers, to the Indian defence ministry, including an offer to build it locally. Sweden's Saab AB said on Friday it will offer the naval version of its Gripen fighter to the Indian navy. India's top defence scientists said they were disappointed by the navy's decision and that fighter aircraft development was a challenge everywhere, including with the US Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35. "Look at the F-35, with all the might of the multinational effort, is still evolving," said a source in the aeronautical development agency which is spearheading the LCA effort.

The navy last month invited manufacturers to pitch for 57 planes for its aircraft carriers, a multi-billion dollar order the government had hoped would go to the state-run producers of India's Tejas, a combat aircraft 33 years in the making. India, South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian buyers are expected to intensify efforts this year to develop indigenous warplanes, military officials said, due to anxieties that the United States may be less engaged in the region under President Donald Trump. But their hopes of manufacturing state-of-the-art warplanes could still be decades away as countries need more time to master the technology, experts said. "It's been long on ambition short on success," Richard A. Bitzinger, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said of the drive. "These things are being done because of techno-nationalism. They are done because these countries perceive of themselves as rising powers." As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make-in-India" campaign, scientists will showcase the Tejas warplane at an air show opening in Bengaluru on Tuesday. But the jet remains a work in progress, with only three in service with the air force. South Korea, supported by Indonesia, has multi-billion dollar plans to develop a twin-engined KF-X fighter jet, while Taiwan said this month it plans to build 66 jet trainer aircraft that could eventually help it manufacture a combat plane. Chang Yeoung-keun, an adviser on the KF-X fighter jet project and a professor at Korea Aerospace University, said full development of the plane and its technologies will take decades. "South Korea needs to develop core technologies of the jets, not just shells," he said. "I am sceptical. South Korea may be able to develop core technology in 30 to 40 years, but they have to develop them in 10 years, with current fighter jets ageing." INDIA'S STRUGGLE Cleared by the government in 1983, the Indian plane was meant to be the backbone of the air force due for induction in 1994. Instead, it suffered years of delay with scientists trying to build the world's most modern light combat aircraft from scratch, including the engine. In December, the navy chief, Admiral Sunil Lanba, said the sea version of the plane was "not up to the mark" and it could not take off from an aircraft carrier once weapons were loaded. A source in the navy said that the plane for years has failed flight tests when taking off from a 200-metre carrier deck with weapons on board. That prompted the navy to issue a request last month for information for a foreign fighter to fill the gap, the first stage in a long procurement process. Boeing Co has pitched its F-A/18 Hornet, that the U.S. navy flies from its carriers, to the Indian defence ministry, including an offer to build it locally. Sweden's Saab AB said on Friday it will offer the naval version of its Gripen fighter to the Indian navy. India's top defence scientists said they were disappointed by the navy's decision and that fighter aircraft development was a challenge everywhere, including with the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35. "Look at the F-35, with all the might of the multinational effort, is still evolving," said a source in the aeronautical development agency which is spearheading the LCA effort.

More from Most Innovative Companies Why Chobani Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Why Related Companies Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Why The Home Depot Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Why Resy Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Claire Dodson 02.13.17 6:00 AM Target The idea of a massive store that looks the same in every region is a thing of the past, at least for Target. In its place is a highly curated version tailored for dense urban areas. "How do we keep our store experience relevant?" asks Mark Schindele, Target’s SVP of properties. "We customize, we evolve, and we understand our guests." In 2017, Target will roll out 28 new flexible-format stores, double the number it opened in 2016. The company’s first small-store effort, City Target, which launched in six locations in 2012, averaged about 100,000 square feet, still too big a footprint for major cities. The company faced a challenge: how to condense even more while providing customers with a total Target experience. Flex formats shrink the size to as little as 12,000 square feet and tailor merchandise to specific neighborhoods. They also dropped the special moniker: All Targets, regardless of the size or shape, would be known as Target. Target will roll out 28 new flexible-format stores in 2017.[Illustration: Laura Breiling] Manhattan got its first flex-format Target in October, in the Tribeca neighborhood, which has been flooded with stylish young families. The two-story outpost emphasizes apparel, toddler, and baby sections. (It’s also the only Target so far to include a Chobani yogurt café in place of the now-standard Starbucks.) Target, which once stood for consistency and endless choice, now wants to be adaptable, streamlined, and quick—the company can research a new site and have doors open within a year. "We look at what needs aren’t being met by a neighborhood," Schindele says. "And then we meet them." Milestones: Target recently hired former Walmart exec Shekar Natarajan to fill the new role of SVP of network planning and operational design. He is tasked with harnessing tech to speed up Target’s supply chain. Challenges: Walmart attempted a similar curated-retail experiment with its Express stores but couldn’t nail the formula. It closed 102 of its smaller format locations in 2016. Buzz: Positive Moleskine's celebrated Timepage calendar app will work in conjunction with a new physical planner set to be released in 2017.[Photo: Celine Grouard for Fast Company] Moleskine The success of Moleskine’s classic notebooks in a digital age has been compared to the resurgence of vinyl records or Polaroid cameras. But Moleskine knows that its future hinges on its ability to work in tandem with digital technology. A year ago, Moleskine released its Smart Writing Set, a pen and notebook that converts handwritten notes seamlessly from the page to an app. The company is now taking that idea a step further, leveraging its celebrated Timepage calendar app to work in conjunction with a new physical planner set to be released in 2017. Users can take a snapshot of the day’s to-dos, which the software will recognize and integrate with Timepage. Eventually, the tech could operate like the Smart Writing Set. "We don’t see analog and digital as antagonistic dimensions in the lives of real people," says CEO Arrigo Berni. To that end, Moleskine continues to ramp up its physical presence. In addition to opening 40 new retail stores by the end of 2018, the company is working on building out its Moleskine Cafés, which it built in Milan in 2016 and in the Geneva airport in 2015. Inspired by the café littéraires of the 17th century, these storefronts are part art gallery and part meeting space, and they also sell Moleskine products. In addition, Moleskine is expanding the company’s limited-edition notebook selection, which features characters from Hello Kitty, Harry Potter, Marvel and DC, Game of Thrones, Toy Story, and more. Moleskine, being Moleskine, manages to give them a chic spin. "There’s an emphasis on design and creativity with everything we do," Berni says. "As a brand, we stand for the possibility of expressing yourself in all different forms." Milestones: Belgian vehicle importer D’Ieteren acquired Moleskine in 2016, giving it a new valuation of almost $600 million. Challenges: The brand will have to preserve its creative cachet as it grows so that it doesn’t lose its cult following—as when Starbucks lost the coffee diehards. Buzz: Positive Nokia Milestones: The Nokia brand is returning to phones after being licensed to HMD Global. The $26 Nokia 150 has a monthlong battery and doesn’t look too far off from the Nokia you loved in the mid-aughts. Challenges: Nokia/HMD is entering into an especially crowded Android marketplace, where many companies don’t ever reach profitability. In addition, the Google Play Store is currently not available in China, which is the new Nokia 6 smartphone’s first market. Buzz: Negative Nestlé Milestones: Scientists at Nestlé figured out how to cut sugar in choc-olate by 40%, by making it dissolve quicker to trick the taste buds. Products will roll out in 2018, with gradually reduced sugar so consumers don’t no­­tice a difference. Challenges: Eighty-three percent of Nestlé’s revenue comes from its slow-growing food and beverage divisions, compared to rival Unilever’s 43% in those sectors. Buzz: Positive First Solar Milestones: The solar energy systems maker is accelerating production of its cost-efficient Series 6 module by a year (it will begin in 2018) and scrapping a planned Series 5 edition. Challenges: The move is part of a restructuring that laid off more than 25% of its workforce in an effort to better compete in an overstocked market and recoup lost profits. Buzz: Neutral Blippar Milestones: Augmented-reality pioneer Blippar has added real-time recognition to its app, letting users scan more than 70,000 faces and pull up related info. It’s like Shazam for public figures. Challenges: Blippar must contend with heightened competition from open-AR apps like Vuforia Studio Enterprise, which simplifies AR for businesses. Buzz: Positive Zaha Hadid Architects is set to build the world’s first all-wood stadium.[Photo: courtesy of MIR] Zaha Hadid Architects Milestones: The London-based architecture firm is set to build the world’s first all-wood stadium for the Forest Green Rovers soccer team in Stroud, England. The sustainable structure will have the lowest amount of embodied carbon of any stadium worldwide. Challenges: Principal Patrik Schumacher recently came under fire for calling for the privatization of public spaces. The firm condemned the remarks, saying they were not consistent with the late Zaha Hadid’s way of thinking. Buzz: Negative Boeing Milestones: Boeing has reorganized its military and commercial support into a new unit, Boeing Global Services, and has hired former GE Aviation exec Kevin McAllister to lead its commercial airline business. Challenges: In December, Donald Trump tweeted that the order for Boeing’s new Air Force One should be canceled due to what he claimed was a $4 billion cost, causing its stock to slip 1.6%. Buzz: Neutral McDonald’s Milestones: McDonald’s is selling its operations in China to state-owned Citic. The move allows McDonald’s to reap franchise fees while Citic uses its expertise to better target Chinese customers. Challenges: The cost of labor is going up, and the chain’s revenue is still struggling to recover after drops in 2014 and 2015. It’s hard to keep McDonald’s franchisees happy when innovations like new digital kiosks come with a price tag of nearly $60,000 apiece. Buzz: Neutral Rent the Runway Milestones: In December, the clothing rental company raised a $60 million round of funding and became profitable with $100 million in 2016 revenue. It also launched its first flagship store in New York: 5,000 square feet with personal stylists and store associates who tap into user data to personalize the shopping experience. Challenges: Rent the Runway has partnered with Neiman Marcus to open RTR boutiques inside its department stores, which could be risky with Neiman Marcus’s recent revenue struggles, down 4.1% in 2016’s fourth quarter.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 13 February 2017 | MYT 4:18 PM Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business Speaking up: It was not clear what kinds of protectionist measures – whether tariffs or other actions – concerned Amazon the most, or from which countries Amazon saw the greatest risk. — Bloomberg Amazon.com Inc warned that government actions to bolster domestic companies against foreign competition could hurt its business, in a possible reference to US President Donald Trump's "America First" agenda.  In a routine description of regulatory risks in its 2016 annual filing, the world's largest online retailer said "trade and protectionist measures" might hinder its ability to grow.  That language has not appeared in Amazon's warning about government regulation in at least the past five annual filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Seattle-based company has cited trade protection in those filings as a risk to its international sales and operations specifically.  The new Republican president has made job creation a cornerstone of his policies, threatening to impose tariffs on imports so companies produce and hire within the United States. Republicans in Congress also have a plan to target imports while excluding export revenue from US corporate income tax, known as a border adjustment tax.  The proposal in the US House of Representatives has divided corporate America. Major exporters like Boeing Co have thrown their weight behind it, but a retail association has said it would raise prices for shoppers.  It was not clear what kinds of protectionist measures – whether tariffs or other actions – concerned Amazon the most, or from which countries Amazon saw the greatest risk.  Amazon so far has declined to comment on Republican lawmakers' border tax plan. It declined comment on the new language in its annual filing, which appeared under the header, "Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavourable Changes Could Harm Our Business."

The navy last month invited manufacturers to pitch for 57 planes for its aircraft carriers, a multi-billion dollar order the government had hoped would go to the state-run producers of India's Tejas, a combat aircraft 33 years in the making. India, South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian buyers are expected to intensify efforts this year to develop indigenous warplanes, military officials said, due to anxieties that the United States may be less engaged in the region under President Donald Trump. But their hopes of manufacturing state-of-the-art warplanes could still be decades away as countries need more time to master the technology, experts said. "It's been long on ambition short on success," Richard A. Bitzinger, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said of the drive. "These things are being done because of techno-nationalism. They are done because these countries perceive of themselves as rising powers." As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make-in-India" campaign, scientists will showcase the Tejas warplane at an air show opening in Bengaluru on Tuesday. But the jet remains a work in progress, with only three in service with the air force. South Korea, supported by Indonesia, has multi-billion dollar plans to develop a twin-engined KF-X fighter jet, while Taiwan said this month it plans to build 66 jet trainer aircraft that could eventually help it manufacture a combat plane. Chang Yeoung-keun, an adviser on the KF-X fighter jet project and a professor at Korea Aerospace University, said full development of the plane and its technologies will take decades. "South Korea needs to develop core technologies of the jets, not just shells," he said. "I am sceptical. South Korea may be able to develop core technology in 30 to 40 years, but they have to develop them in 10 years, with current fighter jets ageing." INDIA'S STRUGGLE Cleared by the government in 1983, the Indian plane was meant to be the backbone of the air force due for induction in 1994. Instead, it suffered years of delay with scientists trying to build the world's most modern light combat aircraft from scratch, including the engine. In December, the navy chief, Admiral Sunil Lanba, said the sea version of the plane was "not up to the mark" and it could not take off from an aircraft carrier once weapons were loaded. A source in the navy said that the plane for years has failed flight tests when taking off from a 200-metre carrier deck with weapons on board. That prompted the navy to issue a request last month for information for a foreign fighter to fill the gap, the first stage in a long procurement process. Boeing Co has pitched its F-A/18 Hornet, that the U.S. navy flies from its carriers, to the Indian defence ministry, including an offer to build it locally. Sweden's Saab AB said on Friday it will offer the naval version of its Gripen fighter to the Indian navy. India's top defence scientists said they were disappointed by the navy's decision and that fighter aircraft development was a challenge everywhere, including with the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35. "Look at the F-35, with all the might of the multinational effort, is still evolving," said a source in the aeronautical development agency which is spearheading the LCA effort. "There are no shortcuts."

'IAF is expanding at a rapid pace' Beware India's enemies! 'IAF is expanding at a rapid pace' February 13, 2017 11:59 IST 'Modernisation will bolster our capabilities to counter military challenges in the future.' Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa speaks to BharatShakti.in Editor-in-Chief Nitin Gokhale. IMAGE: Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa before his solo MiG-21 flight, January 13, 2017. It is rare for an air chief to fly solo and the flight highlighted the air chief marshal's courage and impressive flying skills. The biennial Aero India Show 2017 will begin at Bengaluru on Tuesday, February 14. The Indian Air Force is one of the prime movers of the show along with other ministry of defence organisations. BharatShakti.in Editor-in-Chief and long-standing Rediff.com columnist Nitin A Gokhale spoke to Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa about his priorities for the IAF in coming years. The Chief of the Air Staff, in his first interview since taking over on December 31, discusses the emerging geopolitical situation in the sub-continent, the IAF's search for a 5th Generation aircraft, its plans for force accretion, more drones and many other issues that are his and the air force's challenge, everyday. The air chief's solo MiG-21 flight What are your top priorities, as air chief? The foremost priority of the IAF is to maintain combat readiness and military professionalism to fight and defeat any external threat. Our networked operations and progress in network centric operations will ensure that the Indian skies are under continuous surveillance and the challenges of the growing sub-conventional aerial threats are also effectively neutralised. Enhancing security of our air bases and installations to thwart a possible 'Pathankot type fidayeen attack' and furthering our combat potential not only by operationalising our planned inductions but also through indigenisation and training will continue to remain our focus areas. The aim is to ensure that the IAF is always prepared to undertake operations across the entire spectrum of war and also conduct humanitarian and disaster relief operations to aid the civil authorities. It is also our endeavour to progressively increase our combat inventory with indigenous equipment to achieve complete self-reliance.

Photograph: PTI   The IAF's fighter squadron strength is depleting faster than it can be replenished. What are the plans to expand the force to a size required for the threat perception that India has? The IAF is undertaking its modernisation plan with an aim to build up the authorised squadron strength of combat aircraft at the earliest. Modernisation plans are being executed with a two pronged objective of induction of state-of-art fighter aircraft and upgradation of existing fighter fleet to ensure their operational relevance in the light of rapid technological advancement in the field of defence equipment. Induction of fighters include the LCA, MK1A, Rafale and the balance of contracted Su-30 MKI aircraft. Further, suitable fighter aircraft are also planned to be inducted through the 'Make in India' route. Comprehensive upgrade of the Mirage 2000, MiG-29 and Jaguar fleet is under progress and the IAF is in discussion with HAL and OEM to define the contours of the Su-30 MKI enhancement programme. Induction of new aircraft along with an upgrade of the existing fleet will give the IAF an edge over its adversaries. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor is apparently a reality now. How does it affect the security calculus? Is the threat of a two front war a reality now? Is the IAF prepared to meet that challenge? The CPEC is an emerging contentious issue and has the potential of leveraging a collusive military threat. Geo-strategic alignment of nations would require to be factored in our plans. We have optimised own force application plans with existing resources to protect our national interests. With the implementation of our acquisition plans, this capability will systematically improve. Our operational plans are continuously reviewed to factor any emerging challenges in the changing threat scenario. Modernisation plans would bolster our capabilities to counter the military challenges in the future.

Photograph: Staff Sergeant Joshua Turner/US Air Force   What is the schedule for the induction of the Rafale, the Tejas Mk1 and the MK 1A? Induction of the Rafale aircraft will commence in September 2019 and is expected to be completed by April 2022. Induction of Tejas aircraft in the Initial Operational Clearance configuration is under progress. This will be followed by induction of the Tejas in Final Operational Clearance configuration and Tejas Mk-1A aircraft. It is expected that the induction of the Tejas will be completed by 2025-2026. What is the status of India's partnership for a 5th Generation Fighter Aircraft? The Indian version of the FGFA called the Prospective Multirole Fighter is being jointly designed and developed by India and Russia. HAL from the Indian side and Rosoboronexport from Russia are designated as the lead agencies. At present, the research and development contract is under finalisation. The government has formed a committee for comprehensive review of the PMF project. The case will be further processed after the committee submits its report to the MoD. The Americans have offered to manufacture the F-16s and F/A-18s in India. Sweden's Saab has offered the Gripen. What does the air force think is the best suitable option? Single or twin engine? The future requirement of fighter aircraft projected by the IAF is to ensure that we maintain an optimum ratio of Light, Medium and Heavy class of combat aircraft. There is also a requirement to maintain an optimum mix of single and twin engine aircraft. Based on the inputs given by the IAF, the government is preparing a roadmap for induction of fighter aircraft in the IAF. All future inductions in IAF will be in accordance with this roadmap. SAAB, Lockheed Martin and Boeing have expressed their interest in setting up manufacturing facilities for fighter aircraft under the 'Make in India' initiative. The government is finalising the policy for selection of a strategic partner. Suitable fighter aircraft to be manufactured in India through 'Make in India' will be selected thereafter. IMAGE: An IAF helicopter seen during rescue operations after the 2015 Nepal earthquake   Please give us an update on the IAF helicopter fleet. The requirements are both diverse and large in numbers. Which are the models being considered for induction and how many? The IAF's medium lift helicopter fleet has undergone a major transformation with induction of Mi-17 V5 helicopters. Additional Mi-17 V5 helicopters are planned to be inducted in the near future. A contract has been signed for the procurement of Apache attack helicopters and Chinook heavy lift helicopters. Induction of these will boost the IAF's offensive and heavy heli-lift capabilities. Induction of the ALH Mk-III and ALH Mk IV and Weapon System Integrate of helicopters is under progress. Ten LSP light combat helicopters are also being procured from HAL. In order to address the light utility helicopter fleet requirements, a case is under progress for the procurement of Kamov 226T helicopters from Russia under an inter-governmental agreement through a joint venture. Subsequently, based on the progress of the indigenous light utility helicopter, being designed and developed by HAL, the balance requirement of helicopters in the light utility category will be progressed. Both these helicopters are planned to replace the Cheetah and Chetak fleets. IMAGE: The Harop, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries, is the IAF's first combat UAV for offensive strikes   What about the UAVs and armed UAVs? Any new inductions being planned by the IAF? The IAF modernisation plans factor in the sustained growth of remotely piloted aircraft fleet. The IAF has a requirement of high altitude long endurance (HALE) and medium altitude long endurance (MALE) class of RPAs along with requirement of combat UAVs/armed RPAs. The IAF is processing a case for procurement of MALE UAVs from Indian companies through the 'Make in India' route. The UAVs are proposed to be developed and manufactured by Indian industry under an appropriate category of the DPP like 'Buy & Make (Indian).' Besides, the IAF is in the process of upgrading its existing UAV fleet by procuring a number of modern systems. Also, Rustom-2 -- an indigenous MALE RPA being developed by DRDO -- has recently carried out its maiden flight. Rustom-2 is also planned to be inducted in the IAF. We are participating in activities towards the design and development of Ghatak, an indigenous unmanned combat aerial vehicle. What is the IAF doing to replenish/augment air defence systems? The IAF is in the process of a comprehensive makeover of its air defence system. The new generation air fefence radars are being inducted at a brisk pace. Medium power radars, Rohini radars and low level light weight radars have already been inducted in the IAF. The low level transportable radars are in the process of induction. Apart from the two aerostat systems already inducted, request for information has been sought for procurement of additional systems. The indigenous Akash missile system has already been inducted and a case for some more such squadrons is under process. Procurement of very short range air defence systems for the IAF and Indian Army, under the 'Buy & Make' category is being processed by the army. The induction of SPYDER QRSAM has commenced and the MRSAMs will commence shortly. Also, RFP for the S-400 triumph air defence system is under process. Close in weapon systems are also planned to be inducted through the 'Make in India' route. Apart from procurement of radars and weapon systems, the IAF is networking all its air defence assets on a common grid through the integrated air command and control system. The IACCS is the backbone of the IAF's network centric warfare capability which provides a fused air situation picture based on the inputs from a network of ground based sensors. The integration of AWACS and IACCS strengthens both detection and control capabilities and reduces sensor to shooter time. IMAGE: Avani Chaturvedi, Bhawana Kanth and Mohana Singh, the IAF's first women fighter pilots, with Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.   The man behind the machine is the most important imperative in a battlefield. What measures need to be undertaken to attract the best talent to the IAF? The IAF is expanding at a fast pace with the induction of sophisticated and state of the art systems planned in the next 5 to 10 years. To exploit these systems, there is a requirement for qualified human resources. The IAF has a specialised cell which looks after induction of officers and a similar one established for recruitment of airmen. The personnel in the cell are tasked to create awareness through publicity and motivational lecture tours to various establishments, to highlight the requirements of the IAF and make efforts to attract the youth to join our elite force. They are doing a good job and we are getting more qualified and talented youth volunteering to join. This process is continuous and done all year round. The selection processes at our recruitment boards are continuously updated and made contemporary. The officer cadets who are being selected to undergo training at the NDA will graduate with a BTech degree from this year onward. This firm education base should help them in meeting the challenges of handling the machines/ combat assets driven by the very latest technologies. There is a lot of debate on creating a post of permanent Chairman Chiefs of Staff Committee and even a CDS. How does the IAF view the issue? The creation of a Permanent Chairman COSC/CDS is an ongoing process and has been supported by the three services. The issue is under consideration by the political leadership. IMAGE: IAF lady officers make a mark at the Republic Day parade, January 26, 2016.   Social media and its use/misuse by service personnel is creating a new challenge to the forces. How is the IAF dealing with it? The IAF has necessary guidelines regarding interaction of service personnel on social media. Moreover, all personnel are sensitised from time to time for strict compliance of the guidelines. The CAS online forum has been established over our intranet architecture in which grievances of any personnel are directly routed. I explain the organisational stand point and redress their grievances immediately. This system is working well. This system also helps me in understanding the environment and any problem that arises is flagged for preventive action by the IAF at the earliest. MUST READ IAF features in the RELATED LINKS below.

Mr Singh wants to increase flights from India to Dubai by 50 per cent – to 15 flights a day within a few months from its current 10 daily flights. "Now there are negotiations going on between the UAE and India to increase some of the flying rights between the two countries and we expect that will happen very soon," he said. "We already have the landing slots in the airport in Dubai and take-off positions and so on, so as soon as the bilaterals are done we’ll be able to [start the new flights]," he said, adding that the rights should take about two to three months to come through. The company is planning to launch flights to Sharjah this year, although a date has not yet been fixed, Mr Singh said. Muscat in Oman is another Arabian Gulf destination it plans to start flying to. "We’ve focused in the Middle East in a significant way," he said. The company had just four flights into Dubai before he took over in 2015, he said. "Our focus is really on profit­ability. We are not in this just to go on increasing market share. India has a lot of unmet demand in certain segments for the Middle East. There are a lot of Indians living and working there and increasingly a large number of Indians who want to visit there for travel and tourism." Other airlines are also foc­using on meeting the travel demands of Indian passengers. Etihad Airways recently announced plans to launch a third daily flight between Abu Dhabi and Bangalore from next month. SpiceJet, which has 50 planes, last month unveiled a US$22 billion deal with Boeing for up to 205 planes. This marks a dramatic turn­around in fortunes from Decem­ber 2014, when SpiceJet’s fleet was grounded and hundreds of flights were cancelled, as the airline struggled with debts and huge losses. The consensus was that the carrier would go the way of Kingfisher Airlines, which halted operations in 2012 because of its fin­ancial woes. But then Mr Singh, the airline’s co-founder who sold off his stake in 2010, stepped in to save the carrier by buying a majority stake. Since then, the airline’s financial performance has improved substantially. "We’ve worked hard in the last two years to put things back in shape," said Mr Singh. The airline has had eight quarters of profit since the change in ownership. Lower oil prices have also helped the company’s bottom line. Mr Singh said he "rejigged" the airline’s network to "ensure that we are flying only the more profitable routes". It shut down some destinations in India and abroad, including Kathmandu and Guangzhou in China, and changed the timings of some of its flights. The "threat of an increase in the price of oil" is a major concern for the carrier and the industry at the moment, Mr Singh said. India has a population of more than 1.2 billion, but only a small proportion of Indians travel by air, so carriers have huge scope for growth in the market as the economy expands, incomes rise and air travel becomes more affordable. "We expect that there will be great growth in the years to come," said Mr Singh. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Sydney Airport profits rise amid concerns over new city passenger hub Air France-KLM finds unexpected lift as profit beats forecasts Boeing and Airbus jetliner demand to fall but military aircraft to cushion blow India and Russia close in on helicopter manufacturing deal MOST VIEWED Business | All Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer Mubadala Investment Company set for next step on integration path Toyota recalls thousands of hydrogen-powered Mirais Dubai Land Department to introduce standard property lease form Property broker Asteco expects Abu Dhabi rents to fall Defence sector in focus ahead of Idex and Navdex in Abu Dhabi next week Five do’s and don’ts for Apple’s next iPhone Dubai landlord living overseas needs to evict tenant who hasn’t paid rent for six months Boeing and Airbus jetliner demand to fall but military aircraft to cushion blow RAK Ceramics’ profit hit amid building activity slowdown More Most Viewed UAE ambassador dies of injuries sustained in Afghanistan terror attack Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer UAE weather: heavy rain expected as unstable conditions persist Mubadala Investment Company set for next step on integration path Parents, not schools, are struggling Sheikh Mohammed attends ceremony; Sheikh Mansour chairs Mubadala meeting - in pictures Anniesa Hasibuan’s hijabs fit for royalty at New York Fashion Week The end of the two-state solution - killed off by Trump and Netanyahu Rouhani meets rulers of Oman and Kuwait to reduce Iran-GCC tensions What La La Land tells us about Abu Dhabi More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Dubai to launch driverless flying cars by this summer Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Rouhani meets rulers of Oman and Kuwait to reduce Iran-GCC tensions Property broker Asteco expects Abu Dhabi rents to fall About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Renewed hopes about the US government applying policies to boost growth and inflation, after President Donald Trump promised a "phenomenal" tax reform, was behind dollar's strength. The American currency advance was uneven across the board, with the Pound and the Aussie the most reluctant to give up. The EUR on the other hand, is among the most vulnerable, given the ongoing political woes in the region, with upcoming elections in Germany and France, a possible referendum in Italy, and Greece's bailout on "shaky ground," according to the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The week with probably start in slow motion, with no major data scheduled in Europe and America. That said, political headlines could continue to affect currencies one way or the other. From a technical point of view, the EUR/USD pair´s daily chart shows that, after reaching the 50% retracement of the November/January decline, the pair is back below the 38.2% retracement of the same decline and poised to test the next Fibonacci support at 1.0565. Technical indicators in the mentioned time frame head sharply lower within negative territory, whilst the price is below its 20 and 100 DMAs, this last with a strong downward slope around 1.0700. In the shorter term, and according to the 4 hours chart, technical readings also favor the downside, as a bearish 20 SMA kept capping the upside, currently around 1.0660, whilst the Momentum indicator turned south after failing to overcome its mid-line, and the RSI indicator consolidates around 38. Support levels: 1.0620 1.0590 1.0565 Resistance levels: 1.0660 1.0710 1.0750 USD/JPY The USD/JPY pair closed the week with modest gains around 113.20, down on Friday after failing to regain the 114.00 level. Risk appetite was not enough to fuel the pair, with bulls probably disappointed by the outcome of the Abe-Trump meeting, as both leaders shook hands and praise one another, but said nothing about a possible trade deal or on how the relationship between the two countries will continue. Despite Wall Street closed at record highs for a second consecutive day on hopes for an upcoming tax cut and recovering US Treasury yields, the USD/JPY pair closed the week with a lower low and a lower high, somehow suggesting that yen's rally is not yet over. Risk aversion may re-surge with the weekly opening, as over the weekend, North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile, triggering condemnatory comments from both, Abe and Trump, with the first saying that missile tests "can absolutely not be tolerated." Technically, the daily chart shows that the pair was unable to break below a bullish 100 DMA, currently at 111.85, while the 38.2% retracement of the latest bullish run stands at 111.95, providing a major support for the upcoming days. In the same chart, however, technical indicators have lost upward strength right below their mid-lines, and the RSI is slowly turning south, leaning the scale towards the downside. In the 4 hours chart, the price is struggling with a bearish 100 SMA, while the RSI indicator pulled back from overbought readings, now heading lower around 54, whilst the Momentum indicator maintains its bullish strength near overbought readings. Support levels: 112.85 112.40 111.90 Resistance levels: 113.60 114.00 114.55 GBP/USD The GBP/USD pair closed the week flat a few pips below the 1.2500 threshold, hit by dollar's strength by the end of the week and in spite of strong UK data. Industrial and manufacturing production more than doubled expectations in December, with the first up 1.1% and the second 2.1% when compared to the previous month. The year-on-year figures came in at 4.3% and 4.0% respectively, while previous month's reading were revised higher. Also, the goods trade balance for the same month showed a deficit of £-10.89B, better than the expected £-11.500B or previous £-11.55B, whilst the NIESR GDP estimate for the three months to January came in at 0.7%, beating expectations and above previous. Adding strong macroeconomic figures to the Brexit bill passing smooth through the Parliament, seems Pound's declines are set to be limited. Technically, the daily chart shows that the pair is right below a bullish 20 DMA, whilst technical indicators head modestly lower within neutral territory. The chart also shows that the pair bounced strongly from the 38.2% retracement of its latest bullish run at 1.2430 a key support for the upcoming days. In the 4 hours chart, the price is trading below horizontal moving averages, with the 200 EMA a few pips above the mentioned Fibonacci support, while technical indicators are also standing within neutral readings, with a modest bearish potential. Support levels: 1.2470 1.2430 1.2390 Resistance levels: 1.2535 1.2585 1.2620 GOLD Gold prices extended their gains this past week, with spot reaching a fresh three-month high of $1,244.67 a troy ounce, to close the week at 1,234.01, down on Thursday amid re-surging risk appetite. Despite broad dollar's strength, demand for gold remained high, amid reduced hopes of three rate hikes coming from the FED this year, with speculators foreseeing the most, two hikes one in June and one in December. Gold prices will depend much on the upcoming Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen semi-annual testimony before congress, with a hawkish stance probably taking gold down. From a technical point of view, the upside is still favored given that in the daily chart, the price is well above a bullish 20 DMA that crossed above a bearish 100 DMA, whilst technical indicators have advanced within positive territory, with the Momentum indicator heading north at fresh monthly highs. In the 4 hours chart, however, the price is right below a horizontal 20 SMA, the Momentum indicator retreats from its 100 level within bearish territory, whilst the RSI indicator lacks strength around 55, suggesting a break above Friday's high of 1,237.10 is required to confirm further gains. Support levels: 1,230.00 1,219.40 1,210.10 Resistance levels: 1,237.10 1,244.70 1,255.15 WTI CRUDE West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures advanced for a second consecutive day, with the commodity setting a couple of cents above 53.00. WTI set a daily high of $53.20 a barrel, still underpinned by Wednesday's news, showing an unexpected draw in US gasoline stockpiles that suggest rising demand for the commodity. Despite a large build in crude inventories, the commodity advanced for a second consecutive day, although the price continues developing within the range set mid December. Technically, the daily chart shows that the price is now around a flat 20 SMA, whilst technical indicators have turned flat around their mid-lines, indicating a limited upward scope. In the 4 hours chart, the price advanced beyond a still bearish 20 SMA, but is currently struggling with the 100 and 200 SMAs, both flat, whilst the Momentum indicator heads higher above its 100 level and the RSI remains flat around 54, in line with the longer term view. Support levels: 52.50 51.80 51.10 Resistance levels: 53.20 53.65 54.20 DJIA US equities extended their Thursday's rally, with all of the three major indexes closing the day at all-time highs. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 96 points or 0.48% to end at 20,269.37, while the S&P gained 0.36% to 2,316.10. The Nasdaq Composite settled at 5,734.13, up by 18 points. Stocks rallied on Trump's promises of an upcoming tax reform, and a recovery in oil prices that lifted the energy sector. Within the Dow, Caterpillar led gainers, up by 2.50%, followed by NIKE that added 1.65% and Boeing, up by 1.19%. On the losing side, Coca-Cola topped losers' list, down 1.62%, followed by Wal-Mart Stores that shed 1.53%. From a technical point of view, the upside is favored given that in the daily chart the Dow is well above a modestly bullish 20 SMA, whilst the RSI indicator heads higher around 70, with the Momentum indicator, however, diverging, neutral around its 100 line. In the 4 hours chart, the bias is firmly bullish with the index well above a bullish 20 SMA, the Momentum indicator heading north near overbought readings and the RSI hovering around 72. Support levels: 20,228 20,157 20,090 Resistance levels: 20,297 20,350 20,415 FTSE 100 London shares got a boost from China last Friday as a better-than-expected trade surplus in the country sent mining-related equities higher, helping the FTSE 100 to add 29 points and close at 7,258.75. A weaker Pound also lifted the mood among local traders. Rio Tinto was the best performer, up 5.63%, followed by Antofagasta that gained 4.65% and Anglo American that added 4.40%. Reckitt Benckiser was the worst performer, down 2.96%, followed by Royal Bank of Scotland that lost 1.80%. The index closed at its highest in three weeks, and technical readings in the daily chart support additional gains, given that the benchmark has extended above a still flat 20 SMA, but indicators maintain bullish slopes within positive territory. In the 4 hours chart, the 20 SMA advanced to converge with the 100 SMA at 7,208, providing a strong dynamic support, while the RSI indicator consolidates at 71 and the Momentum indicator turned higher within positive territory, in line with the longer term perspective. Support levels: 7,208 7,163 7,128 Resistance levels: 7,275 7,326 7,354 DAX European equities closed marginally higher on Friday, with the German DAX finishing at 11,666.97, up 24 points. Despite staring the day with a strong footing, shares failed to extend the risk-appetite rally triggered by the US president on Thursday, but remained afloat on strong earnings reports released earlier in the week, and positive trade data coming from China. In Germany, banks were among the worst performers, with Commerzbank down 2.37%, leading losers' list, and Deutsche Bank down 1.35%. ThyssenKrupp was the best performer by adding 2.35%, followed by Heidelberg Cement that closed 1.58% higher. Technically, the pair presents a modest upward potential in the daily chart, as it´s just holding at the upper end of its latest range, and a few points above a flat 20 SMA, whilst technical indicator in the mentioned time frame barely aim higher within neutral territory. In the 4 hours chart, the index settled above all of its moving averages, but the 20 and 100 SMAs lack clear directional strength, whilst technical indicators have turned lower within positive territory, limiting chances of a steeper recovery as long as the benchmark is unable to advance beyond 11,720, Friday's high and the immediate resistance. Support levels: 11,605 11,545 11,498 Resistance levels: 11,720 11,794 11,845   About the Author HY Markets More from HY Markets: Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (16 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (15 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (14 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (10 February 2017) Foreign Exchange Market Commentary (09 February 2017) Latest in Technical Analysis Feb 16 09:22 GMT - EUR/USD Continues Rebound On Thurs...

Since millions looked on in awe as Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the moon, pop culture has reflected a boundless fascination with space, the final frontier. Now, Harper Voyager and Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex are offering the chance to get up close and personal to the past, current and future of space.

Science fiction and science fact have been in partnership for a long time, and I can’t think there’s a fan of either that wouldn’t be delighted with the opportunity to win this experience.” The Ultimate “Out Of This World” Sweepstakes is sponsored by HarperCollins Publishers, 195 Broadway, New York, NY 10007.

That list's proper name is the Commercial Solutions for Classified Program and was created because the US government used to spend years building a secure suite of products before releasing them to government users. That approach would leave workers wielding out-of-date technology, which didn't exactly help US government workers to become efficient. The list therefore offers products that, when used in concert with others on the list, can be assembled into acceptably secure "capability packages". The NSA's added the Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book to the list, all running Windows 10. The Surface Pro also makes it when running Windows 8.1 Microsoft's the only laptop and desktop OS vendor on the list, but is hardly alone on the list for mobile devices. Apple, LG and Samsung devices all make it, as do Blackberry OS 10.3 and the Boeing/Blackberry “Black” Android collaboration. The rest of the list covers all manner of enterprise hardware and software and offers a who's-who of big-name tech vendors. Microsoft's singular inclusion for PCs is therefore good news for Surface and Windows 10, until President Trump worries about the price of either. And maybe it's a warning, too, that it might not be a coincidence that you keep seeing a chap with a Surface in coffee shops, on the train, down at the supermarket … ® Tips and corrections 22 Comments More from The Register Strong non-backdoored encryption is vital – but the Feds should totally be able to crack it, say House committees We want to have our cake and stuff our faces with it 65 Comments White House flushes away court-ordered decryption like it was a stinky dead goldfish Forthcoming legislation looks dead in the water 24 Comments Judge orders FBI to reveal whether White House launched 'Tor pedo' torpedo exploits Alleged Playpen perverts win a concession 22 Comments Cops hate encryption but the NSA loves it when you use PGP Usenix Enigma It lights you up like a Vegas casino, says compsci boffin 151 Comments White House to bung electric car industry $4.5bn in loans Before you buy that Tesla though… 30 Comments White House report cautiously optimistic about job-killing AI Drivers and cashiers, it's time to look for a different line of work 39 Comments Whitepapers Nimble Storage Vision Drives to Leadership Position in Gartner Magic Quadrant Pioneering the use of predictive analytics and machine learning capabilities across the infrastructure stack.

(Post Today photo) - + A group of Thai Airways International (THAI) employees have called on Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to exercise his power under Section 44 to probe the national carrier's procurement contracts to see if any were tainted by graft. About 200 members of the so-called THAI Employees Fighting Corruption group gathered at the airline's operations building to demand the probe be formed by invoking Section 44 of the interim charter. Nares Puengyam, the group's representative, said Section 44 would enable the premier to set up a special committee to investigate all procurement contracts secured by the airline for any irregularities. Any such irregularities would constitute policy-oriented corruption, which must be dealt with, according to the group. The move follows a scandal in which Rolls-Royce admitted to paying bribes to Thai agents or officials to sell engines to THAI between 1991 and 2005. Mr Nares said the airline decided to lower the age of its fleet, forcing the carrier to acquire up to 75 new aircraft valued at over 400 billion baht in two lots between 2011 and 2022. The planned acquisition was incorporated into the company's restructuring masterplan back in 2009. The acquisition plan meant that almost 50 planes would need to be replaced ahead of time. THAI's fleet is comprised of both Airbus and Boeing aircraft. Its Airbus planes have an average 20-year lifespan before they need to be replaced while Boeing's lifespan is 25 years. Any incumbent executives of the company who sat on the restructuring master plan committee from 2009 and 2011 must resign to face up to their responsibility for what the group said was the airline's ongoing losses and accumulated debts. At least one executive on the current board assumed a role in the master plan committee, according to the group. Mr Nares added the group would discuss the issue with THAI's labour union and ask the government and anti-graft agencies to scrutinise the national carrier's balance sheet. The group also plans to petition the Prime Minister's Office, the National Anti-Corruption Commission and the Office of the Auditor General to examine the company's finances to see if its accounts had been embellished.

President Donald Trump’s habit of using Twitter to criticize or praise individual companies for perceived opposition to or support of his policies is not just weighing on shares. Quotes in the article Rexnord Corp RXN ▲ 22.44 +0.04 +0.18% Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU ▲ 11.52 +0.10 +0.88% SPX Corp SPXC ▲ 25.00 +0.17 +0.68% United Technologies Corp UTX ▲ 111.91 +1.00 +0.90% The president’s unprecedented communication style has introduced a new dynamic to markets and affected the implied credit risk for individual companies, for better or worse, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. “This latest dynamic in presidential communication introduces a new factor to the monitoring of daily credit risk,” said Jim Elder, director of corporate and financial institutions at S&P. As the chart below illustrates, Trump’s comments are affecting S&P’s probability of default, or PD, moving the needle in either a positive or negative direction.© Provided by Dow Jones & Company, Inc. In the case of United Technologies Corp.’s (UTX) air conditioning unit Carrier, a Trump tweet on Nov. 24 suggesting he was in talks with the company to keep 1,400 jobs in Indiana, caused the company’s one-year forward-looking probability of default, or PD, to fall 17.5% between Nov. 23 and Nov. 25. Such moves can impact the cost of its borrowing and the worth of its debt already in circulation. Then there was industrial company Rexnord Corp. (RXN) which was lambasted in a Dec. 3 tweet for its plan to move production of industrial bearings to a plant in Mexico from Indianapolis. Rexnord’s PD rose by 11.9% from Dec. 2 to Dec. 5. Toyoya Motor Corp. (JP:7203) was slammed Jan. 5 and threatened with a border tax for building Corollas in Mexico. The Japanese car maker’s PD increased by 26.2% between Jan. 4 and Jan. 6. “Seemingly learning from Toyota’s experiences, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU)drew Trump’s praise on Jan. 9 for planning to build a $1 billion plant in the U.S. and saw its PD drop by 15.3% between January 6-10,” said Elder. Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)drew Trump’s ire Dec. 22 for the price of its F-35 stealth fighter jet, sending its PD up 10.9% between Dec. 21 and Dec. 23. The good news is that fundamentals can still offset the impact of a Trump tweet. For example, a Dec. 6 tweet directed at Boeing Co. (BA) regarding an Air Force One contract sent its stock down 1% immediately after the tweet was published. But the stock recovered to close in the black by the end of day, largely because the company explained in a statement that it is “currently in contracts totaling approximately $170 million for the initial design and engineering work” needed before production—not the $4 billion dollar figure President Trump quoted. That is less than 0.2% of 2016 revenues, and was not viewed as representing a material increase in credit risk, which fell nearly 12% between Dec. 5-7. Then there was General Motors Co. (GM)tweeted at for producing the Chevy Cruze in Mexico. That news was outweighed by GM’s announcement of a big December sales jump. The company’s PD fell 17.9% between Jan. 2-4. On Jan. 9, Trump sent a positive tweet about Ford Motor Co. (F) for bringing 700 jobs to Michigan after canceling plans for a Mexico factory. That news was offset by Ford’s negative guidance on Jan. 10 for declines in per-share earnings in 2017 relative to 2016. That company’s PD rose 3.8% between Jan. 8-10. Perhaps the best example of a tweet failing to nail its target, one not mentioned in the S&P report, is Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) which Trump described as ‘Terrible!’ in a tweet this week for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s product line. The news sent the stock down about 1%, but it took just four minutes to bounce back and end the day up 3%. It extended those gains the following day and is up 2.9% on the week, outperforming the S&P 500 (SPX) , which is up 0.9%.

Children’s Ministry UVic plans to build $20-million heating plant Jack Knox: After a week in the sun, the flight from hell Jack Knox / Times Colonist February 12, 2017 06:00 AM  Times Colonist  A passenger checks his cellphone while boarding a flight. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File) Previous Next FILE - In this Thursday, Oct. 31, 201 file photo, a passenger checks his cell phone while boarding a flight, in Boston. The Federal Communications Commission might be ready to permit cellphone calls in flight. Old concerns about electronics being a danger to airplane navigation have been debunked. And carriers could make some extra cash charging passengers to call a loved one from 35,000 feet. But that extra money might not be worth the backlash from fliers who view overly-chatty neighbors as another inconvenience to go along with smaller seats and stuffed overhead bins. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File) Climbed on a passenger jet the other day, which is what you do for penance after a week in the sun. The ordeal was pretty much as anticipated. The pleasant woman in the next seat smiled and introduced herself by saying “I have bronchitis” (I’m not making this up), while the children seated behind me behaved exactly as any preschooler trapped in place for five hours would be expected to behave. The flight itself was as turbulent as a Sean Spicer news conference. Every now and then a carry-on bag the size of a small East German automobile would tumble out of an overhead bin and brain someone into unconsciousness, making other passengers envious. For those who didn’t download their own entertainment, the in-flight movie was a documentary (Pulp Friction: The Crofton Mill Strike of 1970), though it’s impossible to say whether it was as fascinating as it sounds, as the picture quality was reminiscent of that of the first moon landing, breaking up worse than Brad and Angelina. Likewise, the audio system featured a selection of music channels with names like Easy Listening Favourites and Lite Country Classics, though only two — Medication Time and Stranded Elevator Purgatory — sounded like anything other than a man being murdered by chainsaw at the bottom of a deep, deep well. Some passengers had picked up a tummy bug on vacation, so the washroom lineup resembled a Costco checkout on a rainy Sunday afternoon, though Costco shoppers don’t have to worry about crawling into the lap of an aisle-seat stranger to allow the flight attendant’s cart to squeeze past like an ambulance threading its way through the Colwood Crawl. The cart allows people who just spent a week or two becoming addicted to cheap liquor by the pool to eagerly guzzle drinks sold at a markup that would make a loan shark turn pink at the ears from embarrassment. Ditto for food priced 10 times what the airline paid for it when Canada’s troops left Afghanistan. (No freebies on this flight; some carriers now charge passengers for the kind of meal that would start a prison riot.) To repeat, all this was expected, and would have been endurable were it not for one thing: the seats. Unless you’re one of those who sprawl smugly/guiltily at the front of the plane as the rest of us shuffle toward the sheep pens, your seat is going to be cramped. We all know this. But there is cramped, and then there’s cramped. On this plane, I couldn’t even untie my shoes. Battery chickens get more elbow room. Barely tilting forward, I could use the seat back in front of me as a chin rest and read the phone of the woman in the row ahead of that (she’s having an affair!). The bigger you were, the grimmer it got. A towering man was basically trapped in the fetal position, knees to nostrils, for the entire journey. He appeared to have been baled up by a garbage compactor. For all I know, it might be permanent. The seat squeeze is not new, but it is getting worse. Airlines are carrying more passengers, meaning fewer opportunities to stretch into vacant seats. Carriers keep finding ways — such as installing thinner, less comfortable cushions — to shoehorn in more chairs. In 2015, Fortune magazine reported the average seat pitch — the space between the back of one seat and the back of another — had shrunk to 31 inches from 35 in a generation. Some were as tight as 28. Seat widths withered, too. The Wall Street Journal reported that by 2012, more than two-thirds of Boeing 777s were delivered with rows 10 seats abreast, up from the standard nine. We also learned last year that new Boeing 737 economy seats, patterned after office furniture, will take tight confines into account — things like not having to bend over to plug in electronics, as the outlets will be over the tray. Oh good, not being able to bend over is now part of the design. The congestion causes conflict. Note that in 2014, a United jet made an unscheduled landing after a passenger’s use of a Knee Defender — a device that prevents the person in front of you from leaning back — led to an in-flight fight. Air Canada and WestJet have banned the gizmos, though many passengers now deem it socially unacceptable to recline your seat, as it is impossible to do so without ramming a tray into the gut of the person behind you. OK, I should not complain. I got a week in the sun, was nice and rested up for last week’s snow dump. Moaning about the airplane seats seems churlish, like berating Noah for the tiny staterooms on the ark. So I’ll stop whining, just as soon as the feeling returns to my legs. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

RELATED ARTICLES U.S. agents, advocacy groups differ on alien sweep Surgery at hand for tot blocked by travel ban JUPITER, Fla. -- President Donald Trump spent Saturday morning golfing with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he hosts his first foreign leader at his winter estate in Palm Beach, Fla. While in Florida, Trump sent out a series of tweets regarding policy issues like his promised construction of a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump's weekend of meetings, dinners and golf with Abe comes after a rocky diplomatic start that included contentious phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia. The president and first lady Melania Trump hosted a delegation dinner with Abe and his wife Saturday night at his Mar-a-Lago estate. At the dinner, Trump said the Abe visit had been "very, very good" and that he and the Japanese leader "got to know each other very, very well" over their two days together. [PRESIDENT TRUMP: Timeline, appointments, executive orders + guide to actions in first 100 days] Trump and Abe, both frequent golfers, left Mar-a-Lago early Saturday and headed north to one of Trump's golf courses in Jupiter, Fla., where they were joined by professional golfer Ernie Els. Reporters and photographers from both countries, who were held in a room with blacked-out windows, did not catch a glimpse of the pair as they played. But Trump later posted a photo on social media of them giving each other a high-five on the golf course and tweeted, "Having a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States!" The pair also paid a visit to another nearby Trump property: the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Abe had joked at a joint news conference Friday at the White House that he was looking forward to playing golf with Trump, even though, he claimed, he's not nearly as good on the links. He said he planned to use the time to discuss the future of the world, the Pacific region and U.S.-Japanese relations. In a sign of unity, neither Japanese nor White House officials volunteered the pair's final score. The White House issued a statement after the pair returned saying the day was "both relaxing and productive" and that the two discussed "a wide range of subjects." As their husbands golfed, Melania Trump and Akie Abe toured the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in nearby Delray Beach. It was Melania Trump's first solo event as first lady. The women also had lunch together at Mar-a-Lago. The two couples touched down Friday afternoon in Florida and headed straight to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club, where they enjoyed a late dinner at its crowded patio restaurant. Paying members and club guests took in the scene and mingled with Trump and Abe into the night. Trump also was expected to tend to other business while in Florida: calling Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos as he continues conversations with foreign leaders. Trump and Abe appeared to have hit it off early, despite Trump's sometimes hostile rhetoric toward Japan on the campaign trail. Abe was the only world leader to meet with Trump before his inauguration, and Trump welcomed Abe to the White House with a hug. Trump and Abe have plenty to discuss, including the defense treaty between the nations and their trade relations. One of Trump's first actions as president was to withdraw the U.S. from a 12-nation, trans-Pacific trade agreement that was negotiated by President Barack Obama's administration and strongly supported by Tokyo. In other foreign-relations news, the Guardian newspaper reported Saturday that Trump's state visit to the U.K. will be postponed until sometime between late August and the end of September, and most likely occur when Parliament is in summer recess. The paper cited unidentified U.K. government officials. The report came after House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said Monday that he would veto any attempt to invite Trump to address Parliament. Bercow now faces a no-confidence motion. Bercow wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by email regarding the article in the Guardian. The speaker must be politically impartial, and once elected to the role is required to resign from his political party. 'price will come down' Also Saturday, Trump reiterated his promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico, vowing in a series of tweets to negotiate the costs of constructing it "way down," after a government analysis estimated the price at $21.6 billion. The Department of Homeland Security said last week that the wall would cost $21.6 billion and take 3½ years to construct. Reacting to the estimate, Trump tweeted: "I am reading that the great border wall will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the...design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come way down!" During his transition period before being sworn in as president, Trump spoke with executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to try to negotiate down the costs of the government's contracts to build new F-35 fighter jets and a modern Air Force One jumbo jet. After the discussions, both companies, highly dependent on government defense contracts, announced efforts to reduce costs on the programs. The border wall is a signature campaign promise of Trump's. He said on the campaign trail that it would cost about $8 billion. In another Saturday tweet, Trump said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to halt his executive order suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries had allowed a flood of refugees to pour into the country. "Our legal system is broken!" Trump wrote in a Twitter post. "So dangerous!" the president added. Trump cited a report in The Washington Times that asserted that 77 percent of the refugees who entered the United States since Judge James Robart of U.S. District Court in Seattle blocked the order on Feb. 3 had been from the seven "suspect countries." While the administration maintains that all options are on the table -- including a Supreme Court appeal -- Trump said Friday that he was considering signing a "brand new order" as early as Monday. Portions of Trump's tweets Saturday were sent in all-caps. transgender rights Separately, the Trump administration signaled Friday that it was changing course on the previous administration's efforts to expand transgender rights, submitting a legal brief withdrawing the government's objections to an injunction that had blocked guidance requiring that transgender students be allowed to use restrooms that match their gender identity. The move by the Justice Department does not immediately change the situation for the nation's public schools, as a federal judge already had put a temporary hold on the guidance as a lawsuit by a dozen states moved through the courts. But it signals that the Trump administration will take a different approach on transgender rights, which many conservatives thought went too far under Obama. And how the administration decides to proceed on the particular issue of transgender students and restroom use would affect several other cases in which students are challenging their school districts' policies, including one involving Virginia student Gavin Grimm, which is scheduled to be heard by the Supreme Court later this spring. The brief, filed in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, came as part of a long-running suit by 12 states opposed to Education Department guidance issued last year directing the nation's public schools to allow transgender students to use the restrooms of their choice. The Obama administration took the position that barring the students from restrooms that matched their gender identity was a violation of Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in public schools. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor had sided with the states and issued a temporary injunction blocking the guidance last year. The Obama administration appealed the decision and asked that the injunction apply only to those 12 states. Oral arguments in the case were scheduled for Tuesday in Austin. But the Justice Department and the suing states said in a joint brief Friday that they were withdrawing that request. The brief asked the court to cancel arguments, explaining that "the parties are currently considering how best to proceed in this appeal." The request was granted immediately, according to Equality Case Files, a nonprofit that provides legal updates on cases related to gay and transgender rights. The decision drew immediate criticism from gay- and transgender-rights groups. "Transgender students are entitled to the full protection of the United States Constitution and our federal nondiscrimination laws," Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. "It is heartbreaking and wrong that the agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws would instead work to subvert them for political interests."

Being born in Switzerland does not guarantee citizenship and non-Swiss residents must typically wait 12 years before applying. Tests and government interviews are also required, which can be expensive. The new proposal will allow third-generation immigrants to avoid some of that bureaucracy. It will directly affect those born in Switzerland, whose parents and grandparents also lived in the country permanently. Supporters of the plan to simplify the process argue that it is ridiculous to ask people who were born and have lived all their lives in Switzerland to prove that they are integrated. However opponents suggest that the measures could lead to further steps that will eventually allow all non-Swiss residents - 25% of the population - to gain easy citizenship. An opposition poster, which features a woman in a burka, suggests that the new proposal could lead to a so-called "Islamisation" of the country. The current vetting procedure, aimed at ensuring that new citizens are well integrated, includes interviews carried out by town councils. Questions put to interviewees can include requests to name local cheeses or mountains. Those in favour of maintaining the current system also argue that the strict vetting rules make it superior to the more anonymous systems in neighbouring France and Germany. Over the past 30 years, three previous attempts to relax the rules have been defeated. This time, opinion polls suggest the vote on Sunday will be close. Big cities back the idea, while more conservative rural areas oppose it.   Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 13:11 • 16/02 KitKat maker Nestle misses forecasts as profit falls 12:56 • 16/02 Government embarks on Clean Armenia project 12:48 • 16/02 Catholic Church paid A$276m to abuse victims in Australia 12:23 • 16/02 Turkish-Armenian photographer to open 2017 Nuremberg festival 11:54 • 16/02 Armenian cabinet approves date of Yerevan municipality election   11:42 • 16/02 Apple car tops consumer wish list for iPhone maker 11:26 • 16/02 'I have the utmost respect for her': Carlos Santana apologises after claiming Adele scooped Grammy because Beyonce is 'beautiful to look at but not a singer' 11:13 • 16/02 Armenian civil society concerned over OSCE mission’s possible closure 10:35 • 16/02 Armenian Caucus urges Trump to properly commemorate Genocide 10:11 • 16/02 FBI documents detail 1970 ‘racial discrimination’ by Trump 09:56 • 16/02 Verizon close to $250-350 m Yahoo deal 09:51 • 16/02 Nagorno-Karabakh reports more Azerbaijani ceasefire violations 09:42 • 16/02 Greece backs Karabakh settlement – ambassador 09:03 • 16/02 Azerbaijan unlikely to repeat April war scenario – Armenian analyst 08:30 • 16/02 Venezuela bans CNN after Iraq passport fraud report 08:13 • 16/02 Trump relaxes policy on Middle East two-state solution 19:47 • 15/02 Armenian-German economic forum presents Armenia’s economic environment to German companies 19:26 • 15/02 Kurdish conference takes place in Moscow 19:00 • 15/02 Lufthansa agrees pay deal with pilot union 18:14 • 15/02 Russia denies breaking treaty after alleged missile deployment 18:02 • 15/02 Armenia’s defense minister, Bulgarian ambassador discuss military cooperation 17:19 • 15/02 Eurovision 2017: Organising team quits en masse 16:44 • 15/02 Situation relatively calm in border zone – Defense Ministry spokesperson 16:30 • 15/02 Azerbaijan sends Talysh boys to slaughterhouse -

In spite of all the issues thrown up by the court case brought by the Campaign Against Arms Trade, the pressure will be on to maintain the export trade, with potential for many future arguments over human rights. There are both external and internal reasons why this is so, starting with the impact of Donald Trump. Because of Brexit, Theresa May is going to need Trump a lot more than he needs her, and this will almost certainly involve a continuing commitment to the US-led war against Islamic State, at a time when Trump plans to expand that war. For all the talk of isolationism there are clear signs of an increase in military adventurism. It is not just the appointment of senior ex-generals to head the Pentagon and department of homeland security and to the post of national security adviser: more significant still is the plan for a substantial increase in military spending, even if the US defence budget is already not far short of 45% of the world total. Trump is even prepared to increase the budget through deficit financing if necessary, and his recent visit to the Pentagon was a prelude to receiving new ideas for destroying Isis. One proposal is to deploy a reinforced brigade of more than 5,000 troops into Syria to aid the Kurds and other militias in the assault on the Isis HQ in Raqqa later in the year. As the war expands, May will be put under heavy pressure to ensure Britain takes a larger role. For all Trump’s emphasis on making America great again, it is still essential to avoid war in the Middle East being seen purely as a US venture. As the UK gets sucked in, the pressure on the defence budget will rise, making it even more necessary to have a vibrant arms industry made more robust through exports. The internal reasons have much more to do with the arms lobby and the famous revolving door. Of all the lobbies that assail parliamentarians, both government and opposition, the arms lobby is especially potent and pervasive. For giant companies such as BAE Systems (the world’s third largest after Lockheed Martin and Boeing), lobbying is a substantial transnational endeavour, with Britain just one part of a much wider target list. But for specialist UK-based companies, it is a more narrowly focused operation. In addition to direct lobbying of MPs and their advisers, by trade unions as well as the companies, there is the assiduous funding of thinktanks and university research, as well as support for conferences. The process even extends to the sponsoring of the Royal British Legion by Lockheed and BAE, perhaps with unconscious irony. Go to any major industry conference, frequently in luxury venues in nice warm places, and the evidence of industry influence will be there. In the main lobby or the largest hall will be a huge board with the logos of all the sponsors – often 20 or more – all helping to meet the costs. Coffee breaks, lunch and tea may well be sponsored by named companies, with the drinks reception and conference dinner providing much-sought-after exposure. Then there is the revolving door. At its most obvious it involves offering directorships to senior military figures and politicians. Retired generals, air marshals, admirals, cabinet ministers and permanent secretaries are all sought for board positions, with consultancies for those at a slightly lower level. Less obvious is the seeking of military personnel and civil servants involved specifically in weapons development and procurement. Any such person within five years or so of retirement will be thinking of the size of the pension that awaits. The prospect of doubling it for a couple of days’ work a week is certainly attractive, and this means that pre-retirement “cooperation” with future employers is thoroughly tempting. Beyond all this lies the one great advantage for the whole industry: patriotism. Any criticism is met with cries of “Appeasement!”, and it is here that the current era contrasts so well with the 1990s. Back then, in the bleak days of the peace dividend, there was hardly an enemy in sight: but now we have terrorists, Russia and potentially even China. Happy days are certainly here again.

In a routine description of regulatory risks in its 2016 annual filing, the world’s largest online retailer said “trade and protectionist measures” might hinder its ability to grow. That language has not appeared in Amazon’s warning about government regulation in at least the past five annual filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Seattle-based company has cited trade protection in those filings as a risk to its international sales and operations specifically. The new Republican president has made job creation a cornerstone of his policies, threatening to impose tariffs on imports so companies produce and hire within the United States. Republicans in Congress also have a plan to target imports while excluding export revenue from US corporate income tax, known as a border adjustment tax. The proposal in the US House of Representatives has divided corporate America. Major exporters like Boeing Co have thrown their weight behind it, but a retail association has said it would raise prices for shoppers. It was not clear what kinds of protectionist measures – whether tariffs or other actions – concerned Amazon the most, or from which countries Amazon saw the greatest risk. Amazon so far has declined to comment on Republican lawmakers’ border tax plan. It did not return requests for comment on the new language in its annual filing. The filing did not mention the change in leadership of the White House. The language appeared in its filing under the header, “Government Regulaton Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business.” Reuters Tags: Amazon, Amazon India, Amazon US, Donald Trump, executive order, Jeff Bezos Also read Amazon rolls out free smart-home consultations to kill the confusion behind home automation Snapchat owner will spend $1 billion over next 5 year for using Amazon Cloud Services X Recommended For You Amazon enters the meeting, video call, and messenger space with Chime China outnumbers other countries in terms of online shopping Snapchat owner will spend $1 billion over next 5 year for using Amazon Cloud Services Amazon rolls out free smart-home consultations to kill the confusion behind home automation Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

The president’s unprecedented communication style has introduced a new dynamic to markets and affected the implied credit risk for individual companies, for better or worse, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. “This latest dynamic in presidential communication introduces a new factor to the monitoring of daily credit risk,” said Jim Elder, director of corporate and financial institutions at S&P. As the chart below illustrates, Trump’s comments are affecting S&P’s probability of default, or PD, moving the needle in either a positive or negative direction. In the case of United Technologies Corp.’s UTX, +0.90%  air conditioning unit Carrier, a Trump tweet on Nov. 24 suggesting he was in talks with the company to keep 1,400 jobs in Indiana, caused the company’s one-year forward-looking probability of default, or PD, to fall 17.5% between Nov. 23 and Nov. 25. Such moves can impact the cost of its borrowing and the worth of its debt already in circulation. Then there was industrial company Rexnord Corp. RXN, +0.18% which was lambasted in a Dec. 3 tweet for its plan to move production of industrial bearings to a plant in Mexico from Indianapolis. Rexnord’s PD rose by 11.9% from Dec. 2 to Dec. 5. Toyoya Motor Corp. 7203, -0.52%  was slammed Jan. 5 and threatened with a border tax for building Corollas in Mexico. The Japanese car maker’s PD increased by 26.2% between Jan. 4 and Jan. 6. “Seemingly learning from Toyota’s experiences, Fiat Chrysler FCAU, +0.88% drew Trump’s praise on Jan. 9 for planning to build a $1 billion plant in the U.S. and saw its PD drop by 15.3% between January 6-10,” said Elder. Kellyanne Conway Accused of Ethics Violation(1:30) Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, has been accused of ethics violations for promoting Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka’s fashion line during a television interview on Thursday. Both the top Republican and Democrat on the House Oversight Committee wrote a letter to the Office of Government Ethics regarding her actions. Photo: Getty. Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +0.34% drew Trump’s ire Dec. 22 for the price of its F-35 stealth fighter jet, sending its PD up 10.9% between Dec. 21 and Dec. 23. The good news is that fundamentals can still offset the impact of a Trump tweet. For example, a Dec. 6 tweet directed at Boeing Co. BA, +0.47%  regarding an Air Force One contract sent its stock down 1% immediately after the tweet was published. But the stock recovered to close in the black by the end of day, largely because the company explained in a statement that it is “currently in contracts totaling approximately $170 million for the initial design and engineering work” needed before production—not the $4 billion dollar figure President Trump quoted. That is less than 0.2% of 2016 revenues, and was not viewed as representing a material increase in credit risk, which fell nearly 12% between Dec. 5-7. Then there was General Motors Co. GM, -0.43% tweeted at for producing the Chevy Cruze in Mexico. That news was outweighed by GM’s announcement of a big December sales jump. The company’s PD fell 17.9% between Jan. 2-4. On Jan. 9, Trump sent a positive tweet about Ford Motor Co. F, -0.16%  for bringing 700 jobs to Michigan after canceling plans for a Mexico factory. That news was offset by Ford’s negative guidance on Jan. 10 for declines in per-share earnings in 2017 relative to 2016. That company’s PD rose 3.8% between Jan. 8-10. Perhaps the best example of a tweet failing to nail its target, one not mentioned in the S&P report, is Nordstrom Inc. JWN, +1.50% which Trump described as ‘Terrible!’ in a tweet this week for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s product line. The news sent the stock down about 1%, but it took just four minutes to bounce back and end the day up 3%. It extended those gains the following day and is up 2.9% on the week, outperforming the S&P 500 SPX, +0.50%  , which is up 0.9%. Don’t miss: Nordstrom recovers from Trump’s ‘Terrible!’ tweet in just 4 minutes See also: Trump counselor Conway violates ethics laws, congressional leaders say “We will continue to watch these indicators to see whether short-term risk dislocation leads to longer-term fundamental shifts in risk for firms and industries due to new regulations,” said Elder.

By Philip Rucker / The Washington Post President Donald Trump vowed in a pair of tweets Saturday morning to negotiate the costs of constructing a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border “way down,” after a government analysis estimated the price at a whopping $21.6 billion. An internal report prepared by the Department of Homeland Security and reviewed by Reuters this past week estimated that the wall would cost $21.6 billion and take 3½ years to construct. DHS spokesman David Lapan told The Washington Post on Saturday that the department is still developing cost estimates and that “any such document is deliberative and pre-decisional.” Reacting to the estimate, Trump tweeted: “I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the…design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN!” I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2017 ...design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2017 Trump sent his tweets from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where he and first lady Melania are hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. During his transition period before being sworn in as president, Trump spoke with executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to try to negotiate down the costs of the government’s contracts to build new F-35 fighter jets and a modern Air Force One jumbo jet. After the discussions, both companies, highly dependent on government defense contracts, announced efforts to reduce costs on the programs. The border wall is a signature campaign promise of Trump’s. He said on the campaign trail that it would cost only about $8 billion, but that seems to have been an unreasonably low estimate. Trump prides himself on his negotiating abilities. As a real estate developer, he famously squeezed contractors for profits, yet still often experienced massive cost overruns. Government contracting is more prescribed than in the private sector, of course, and involves an open bidding process.

Charles Mudede New Affordable Rental Building With 108 Units Receives Applications from Nearly 2,100 Households: Apparently Seattle's housing market, which is often said to be determined by the noble economical laws of supply and demand, is not interested in the huge demand for affordable housing. The market is only interested in supplying the city with what it already has plenty of, market-rate units. If you have the money, you have the freedom to choose where you want to live (lots to pick from). But if you don't, if you want a place that will not make you rent burdened, you are condemned to a lottery, such as the one that was held for a new South Seattle building that's offering rents that range from about $470 to $1,150 per month. If you win, you and your family get to live in a nice place near the Othello light-rail station. If you don't, you are a loser! Seattle Times has all the depressing details of this lottery and our housing crisis. It's hard to understand how we can be a sanctuary city without affordable housing. The market will not fix this morally significant problem. The city's government must intervene, must do something about the housing crisis. A Honduran Family Crossed the US Border into British Columbia Because of Trump: The family (Juan, Carmen, and their 11-year-old son) left Honduras two years ago, made it through Guatemala and Mexico, and settled in the US. Things were fine until Trump came into power. Fearing separation, incarceration, and deportation, the family crossed one more border and entered Canada two weeks ago. “My work friends, a lot of them said they were going to come to Canada,” a said Juan to the Vancouver Sun. The Washington Post also reports that there has been a surge of asylum seekers crossing into Canada from Minnesota, a state with a large Muslim population from one of Trump's banned countries, Somalia. The Washington Post: "For the 70 previous years there was about 50 [crossings] annually. In 2016, 300 asylum seekers crossed into Manitoba. In the first week of February, as many as 30 people crossed over." Lastly, the New York Times reports that more and more migrants from Latin America are settling in Mexico. The US is no longer the dream destination. A Driver Is Suspected of a Hit-and-Run on I-5: Before sunrise on Sunday, a pickup truck crashed into a car, which then rolled and split into two. The driver of the pickup split from the scene, drove to 50th Street and 2nd Avenue Northeast, and, not knowing if life was lost in the car that was hit (it wasn't), abandoned the pickup truck and ran into the night.

Home Industry Maini Group of Reva electric car fame to supply landing gear, breaking systems to France’s Safran for A350s Maini Group of Reva electric car fame to supply landing gear, breaking systems to France’s Safran for A350s The Bengaluru-based Maini Group of the Reva electric car fame, has entered into a five-year agreement with the French aviation components major Safran Group to supply various components for the landing gears and breaks for Airbus A350s. By: PTI | Mumbai | Published: February 13, 2017 8:19 PM Reva car (Reuters) The Bengaluru-based Maini Group of the Reva electric car fame, has entered into a five-year agreement with the French aviation components major Safran Group to supply various components for the landing gears and breaks for Airbus A350s. “We have entered into a five-year contract with the Safran Group of France for supplying the landing gears and breaks to A350 aircraft. Under the agreement, we will be supplying high-end machine components made of steel and titanium for its Airbus A350 programmes,” Naresh Paltam, chief executive for aerospace and defence business at Maini Group, told PTI from Bengaluru. He said the contract will be between Safran Landing Systems (formerly Messier-Bugatti-Dowty) which is the world leader in aircraft landing and braking systems and the group’s flagship Maini Precision Products. The companies will formally ink the agreement tomorrow at the Aero India which is beginning in Bengaluru. Citing confidentiality clause with the French partner, Paltam refused to share the deal details. He said while this is the first order from Safran Landing Systems, the Maini Group has been working with the 17.4-billion euros French Group for the past many years supplying aircraft engine parts and mainframes to the Paris and Euronext stock exchanges-listed group. The diversified Maini Group, which is credited for building the country’s first electric car Reva in the early part of the last decade which was later sold to the Mahindra group, has entered the aviation business in 2005 and has been since then supplying engine parts, mainframe parts and landing gears & breaking system components to a clutch of aviation OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). You May Also Want To Watch: Paltam said 10 percent of the Rs 600-crore topline of last year, came from aviation business and that with this deal he expects to see a major spike in this. “I see our aviation revenue growing by 25-30 per cent with the Safran deal.” It has been supplying engine parts to Safran for use in Boeing and Airbus aircraft, while it has also been supplying airframe components to Marshall of Britain and the American company Magellan for many years now. Paltam also said the company will be putting up an Rs 8-crore dedicated 60,000-sqft aerospace facility by August at Bommasandra near Bengaluru for this. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Home India news Blow to self reliance: Indian Navy rejects indigenously developed Tejas for being too heavy, wants foreign fighter jets Blow to self reliance: Indian Navy rejects indigenously developed Tejas for being too heavy, wants foreign fighter jets India's navy is in the hunt for a new foreign fighter jet after rejecting an indigenously made aircraft as too heavy, the latest sign of the struggle to get Asian militaries to buy locally to grow their defence industries. By: Reuters | Bengaluru/new Delhi | Published: February 13, 2017 4:33 PM But their hopes of manufacturing state-of-the-art warplanes could still be decades away as countries need more time to master the technology, experts said. (tejas.gov.in) India’s navy is in the hunt for a new foreign fighter jet after rejecting an indigenously made aircraft as too heavy, the latest sign of the struggle to get Asian militaries to buy locally to grow their defence industries. The navy last month invited manufacturers to pitch for 57 planes for its aircraft carriers, a multi-billion dollar order the government had hoped would go to the state-run producers of India’s Tejas, a combat aircraft 33 years in the making. India, South Korea, Taiwan and other Asian buyers are expected to intensify efforts this year to develop indigenous warplanes, military officials said, due to anxieties that the United States may be less engaged in the region under President Donald Trump. But their hopes of manufacturing state-of-the-art warplanes could still be decades away as countries need more time to master the technology, experts said. “It’s been long on ambition short on success,” Richard A. Bitzinger, senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said of the drive. “These things are being done because of techno-nationalism. They are done because these countries perceive of themselves as rising powers.” As part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make-in-India” campaign, scientists will showcase the Tejas warplane at an air show opening in Bengaluru on Tuesday. But the jet remains a work in progress, with only three in service with the air force. Watch This Also: South Korea, supported by Indonesia, has multi-billion dollar plans to develop a twin-engined KF-X fighter jet, while Taiwan said this month it plans to build 66 jet trainer aircraft that could eventually help it manufacture a combat plane. Chang Yeoung-keun, an adviser on the KF-X fighter jet project and a professor at Korea Aerospace University, said full development of the plane and its technologies will take decades. “South Korea needs to develop core technologies of the jets, not just shells,” he said. “I am sceptical. South Korea may be able to develop core technology in 30 to 40 years, but they have to develop them in 10 years, with current fighter jets ageing.” INDIA’S STRUGGLE Cleared by the government in 1983, the Indian plane was meant to be the backbone of the air force due for induction in 1994. Instead, it suffered years of delay with scientists trying to build the world’s most modern light combat aircraft from scratch, including the engine. In December, the navy chief, Admiral Sunil Lanba, said the sea version of the plane was “not up to the mark” and it could not take off from an aircraft carrier once weapons were loaded. A source in the navy said that the plane for years has failed flight tests when taking off from a 200-metre carrier deck with weapons on board. That prompted the navy to issue a request last month for information for a foreign fighter to fill the gap, the first stage in a long procurement process. Boeing Co has pitched its F-A/18 Hornet, that the U.S. navy flies from its carriers, to the Indian defence ministry, including an offer to build it locally. Sweden’s Saab AB said on Friday it will offer the naval version of its Gripen fighter to the Indian navy. India’s top defence scientists said they were disappointed by the navy’s decision and that fighter aircraft development was a challenge everywhere, including with the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35. “Look at the F-35, with all the might of the multinational effort, is still evolving,” said a source in the aeronautical development agency which is spearheading the LCA effort. “There are no shortcuts.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Speaking at a news conference, Director of the Caucasus Institute Alexander Iskandaryan noted that the country “can accept” Armenian citizens whenever it wishes to but at other times prohibit the entry of even minors who turn out to have an Armenian surname. “That’s Azerbaijan’s propagandistic program, which is aimed at contributing to changes in the country’s image. The program is rather helpless, in my view, as what is going on is but a sign of weakness,” he said. Narek Minasyan, another analyst also attending the news conference, said he sees an increasing urgency to revise Armenia’s position on Nagorno-Karabakh. Noting that the situation on the frontline was relatively calm after the April blitzkrieg, the expert meantime called attention to Azerbaijan’s increased activity on the frontline since late December. “On the one hand, today we have practically non-functioning agreements – such as the one reached in Vienna – and on the other hand, we observe intensive violations of the ceasefire regime. If we try to evaluate the situation, we will see that Azerbaijan is pushing the process into a deadlock,” he added.   Commenting on the scheduled talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers, the expert said he thinks that Armenia should give clear signals to Azerbaijan that it may revise the negotiation process in case the country holds on to its non-constructive conduct. “The necessity of revising Armenia’s position has been gaining urgency over the recent month, as we see a wide range of factors, particularly Azerbaijan’s non-constructive position on the battlefront,” he added.   Hakob Aslanyan Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 13:11 • 16/02 KitKat maker Nestle misses forecasts as profit falls 12:56 • 16/02 Government embarks on Clean Armenia project 12:48 • 16/02 Catholic Church paid A$276m to abuse victims in Australia 12:23 • 16/02 Turkish-Armenian photographer to open 2017 Nuremberg festival 11:54 • 16/02 Armenian cabinet approves date of Yerevan municipality election   11:42 • 16/02 Apple car tops consumer wish list for iPhone maker 11:26 • 16/02 'I have the utmost respect for her': Carlos Santana apologises after claiming Adele scooped Grammy because Beyonce is 'beautiful to look at but not a singer' 11:13 • 16/02 Armenian civil society concerned over OSCE mission’s possible closure 10:35 • 16/02 Armenian Caucus urges Trump to properly commemorate Genocide 10:11 • 16/02 FBI documents detail 1970 ‘racial discrimination’ by Trump 09:56 • 16/02 Verizon close to $250-350 m Yahoo deal 09:51 • 16/02 Nagorno-Karabakh reports more Azerbaijani ceasefire violations 09:42 • 16/02 Greece backs Karabakh settlement – ambassador 09:03 • 16/02 Azerbaijan unlikely to repeat April war scenario – Armenian analyst 08:30 • 16/02 Venezuela bans CNN after Iraq passport fraud report 08:13 • 16/02 Trump relaxes policy on Middle East two-state solution 19:47 • 15/02 Armenian-German economic forum presents Armenia’s economic environment to German companies 19:26 • 15/02 Kurdish conference takes place in Moscow 19:00 • 15/02 Lufthansa agrees pay deal with pilot union 18:14 • 15/02 Russia denies breaking treaty after alleged missile deployment 18:02 • 15/02 Armenia’s defense minister, Bulgarian ambassador discuss military cooperation 17:19 • 15/02 Eurovision 2017: Organising team quits en masse 16:44 • 15/02 Situation relatively calm in border zone – Defense Ministry spokesperson 16:30 • 15/02 Azerbaijan sends Talysh boys to slaughterhouse -

The Merlin 1D engines on the rocket’s first stage were programmed to fire for about three-and-a-half seconds, reaching full power with around 1.7 million pounds of thrust as the Falcon 9 booster remained affixed to the seaside launch complex. Onlookers at Kennedy Space Center reported visible venting of super-chilled liquid oxygen vapors from the rocket leading up to the static fire test, then a white cloud of rocket exhaust rushing out of the north side of the launch pad as the Merlin engines ignited at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT). SpaceX confirmed a few minutes later that the static fire was successfully completed, and engineers are reviewing data collected during the test. Sensors in each engine were to measure many performance parameters during the brief ignition at the launch pad. Hold-down restraints kept the rocket on the ground. The hotfire test marked the first time a rocket ignited at pad 39A since July 8, 2011, when the final space shuttle mission blasted off there. The launch complex sat dormant for three years until SpaceX signed a 20-year lease to take over the pad in 2014. The milestone static fire test is a major step leading to SpaceX’s first-ever launch from pad 39A scheduled for next Saturday, Feb. 18, with a Dragon supply ship carrying 5,266 pounds (2,389 kilograms) of equipment and experiments to the International Space Station. If the rocket takes off Feb. 18, the Dragon spacecraft will reach the research lab in orbit Feb. 20. It will be SpaceX’s first resupply launch to the space station since last July, before a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the Complex 40 launch pad at nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The explosion grounded the Falcon 9 rocket for the rest of 2016, and left Complex 40 with significant damage requiring repairs. Preparations at pad 39A took on a feverish pace in the months since the Sept. 1 explosion at pad 40, which sits on Air Force property a few miles south of pad 39A. The crucial static fire test doubled as a check of the rocket’s readiness for flight and the function of the launch pad’s fueling, telemetry and water deluge systems, all of which were overhauled by SpaceX in recent months. With the test completed, ground crews will lower the rocket and attach the Dragon cargo freighter for launch next weekend. Hans Koenigsmann, SpaceX’s vice president of flight reliability, said Wednesday that testing of the new ground systems at 39A was nearly complete, allowing managers to move ahead with rollout of the rocket. “This is a huge pad,” Koenigsmann said. “The runs from the LOX (liquid oxygen) farm and the fuel farm down to the launch head are huge. The transporter-erector is huge. It’s like one-and-a-half million pounds of steel, and (it has) so much technology because this thing controls all the interfaces (with the rocket).” The transporter-erector will carry rockets from the hangar up the incline to the pad, then lift the vehicles vertical. The rocket carrier was observed vertical at pad 39A in the last few weeks during testing. “There was nothing in particular that gave us a hard time,” Koenigsmann told reporters Wednesday during the Federal Aviation Administration’s 20th Annual Commercial Space Transportation Conference in Washington. “It’s more like this whole thing was a huge effort, and at the end of it you want to test and test things again to make sure that they’re ready to go.” SpaceX resumed launches Jan. 14 with a successful Falcon 9 mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, but the company’s return-to-flight in Florida has been paced by the construction at pad 39A. NASA launched 12 Saturn 5 rockets from pad 39A during the Apollo moon program — including Apollo 11 — and 82 shuttle flights departed from the seaside launch complex. But NASA decided it no longer needed pad 39A after the shuttle’s retirement. Nearby launch pad 39B, previously built for Apollo and shuttle flights, will be home to NASA’s Space Launch System, a government-owned heavy-lift rocket that will launch astronaut crews on deep space expeditions. SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk shared this image of the Falcon 9 rocket on launch pad 39A Friday on Instagram. Credit: Elon Musk/SpaceX The concrete foundation of pad 39A dates back to the Apollo era of the 1960s, while the 347-foot-tall (106-meter) fixed service structure and lightning tower were emplaced before the first shuttle launch. “It gives me a little bit of chills when I walk out there and see stuff that’s left over from Apollo,” Koenigsmann said. Since SpaceX took over, changes to pad 39A have included the construction of the new rocket hangar outside the south gate to the facility, where space shuttles and Saturn 5 moon rockets arrived on top of tracked crawler-transporters after rollout from the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building. The hangar can accommodate five Falcon 9 rocket cores at a time, according to SpaceX. Other additions include the installation of RP-1 kerosene fuel tanks and the construction of the massive transporter-erector, which is sized to accommodate SpaceX’s powerful triple-body Falcon Heavy rocket when it debuts later this year. “The transporter-erector is big enough to do Falcon Heavy. We can launch Falcon 9 with it in the center, of course, but the Falcon Heavy drives the size of it,” Koenigsmann said. “You can see … It’s bigger than the one we used to have.” The facility’s water system has also been refurbished to provide acoustic and heat protection to the pad deck during liftoffs, and the water tower at the northeast perimeter of the pad has been repainted, now emblazoned with the SpaceX logo. Later this year, SpaceX plans to add an access arm to pad 39A’s fixed service structure for astronaut crews to board a human-rated version of the Dragon spacecraft beginning in 2018. SpaceX and Boeing have contracts with NASA to develop commercial spaceships to rotate crews between Earth and the space station. SpaceX officials intend to base crewed launches and Falcon Heavy missions from pad 39A, and flights for the U.S. military and some commercial missions will be launched from pad 40 a few miles to the south. Pad 40 should be ready for launches again in a few months after ground teams finish clean-up and repairs following the explosion of a Falcon 9 booster there in September. SpaceX said the construction crew working at pad 39A will move over to pad 40 in the coming weeks. A firm timetable for pad 40’s availability for launches will be better known once repairs begin, but the facility could be ready by the middle of the year, officials said. SpaceX aims to launch once every two weeks after pad 39A is inaugurated later this month, continuing with the deployment of an EchoStar communications satellite in early March, then the launch of an SES telecom payload aboard a previously-flown first stage booster later in March.

The device was described as a "surface-to-surface medium-to-long-range ballistic missile", the Korean state news agency KCNA reported. South Korea's defence ministry called it an armed provocation to test the response of US President Donald Trump. North Korea's latest ballistic missile test has been widely condemned. The US, Japan and South Korea have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the incident. KCNA reported that the test of the Pukguksong-2 missile, a new type of strategic weapon said to be capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, was overseen by leader Kim Jong-un. It added that the missile was fired at a high angle in consideration of neighbouring countries. The rocket used a solid-fuel engine, the report said, which gives ballistic rockets greater power and range. South Korea military experts said the rocket had been launched by a "cold-eject" system, which uses compressed gas for its initial thrust, a system employed for submarine-launched missiles. The report also said that Kim Jong-un "expressed great satisfaction" over the test launch, which it said "adds to the tremendous might of the country". South Korea and US officials said the missile flew east towards the Sea of Japan for about 500km (300 miles). The missile reached an altitude of about 550km (350 miles), the South Korean military said. Experts suggest the tests are programmed for shorter distances to avoid a missile landing on Japan. This was the latest in a series of tests in the past year, including North Korea's fifth of a nuclear device. The launch took place at 07:55 local time (22:55 GMT Saturday) from the Panghyon air base in North Pyongan province on the west side of the Korean peninsula. United Nations resolutions forbid North Korea from carrying out ballistic missile tests - part of wider efforts to prevent it becoming a fully nuclear-armed power.  foreign ministry said that "North Korea's repeated provocations show the Kim Jong-un regime's nature of irrationality, maniacally obsessed in its nuclear and missile development".   Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 13:11 • 16/02 KitKat maker Nestle misses forecasts as profit falls 12:56 • 16/02 Government embarks on Clean Armenia project 12:48 • 16/02 Catholic Church paid A$276m to abuse victims in Australia 12:23 • 16/02 Turkish-Armenian photographer to open 2017 Nuremberg festival 11:54 • 16/02 Armenian cabinet approves date of Yerevan municipality election   11:42 • 16/02 Apple car tops consumer wish list for iPhone maker 11:26 • 16/02 'I have the utmost respect for her': Carlos Santana apologises after claiming Adele scooped Grammy because Beyonce is 'beautiful to look at but not a singer' 11:13 • 16/02 Armenian civil society concerned over OSCE mission’s possible closure 10:35 • 16/02 Armenian Caucus urges Trump to properly commemorate Genocide 10:11 • 16/02 FBI documents detail 1970 ‘racial discrimination’ by Trump 09:56 • 16/02 Verizon close to $250-350 m Yahoo deal 09:51 • 16/02 Nagorno-Karabakh reports more Azerbaijani ceasefire violations 09:42 • 16/02 Greece backs Karabakh settlement – ambassador 09:03 • 16/02 Azerbaijan unlikely to repeat April war scenario – Armenian analyst 08:30 • 16/02 Venezuela bans CNN after Iraq passport fraud report 08:13 • 16/02 Trump relaxes policy on Middle East two-state solution 19:47 • 15/02 Armenian-German economic forum presents Armenia’s economic environment to German companies 19:26 • 15/02 Kurdish conference takes place in Moscow 19:00 • 15/02 Lufthansa agrees pay deal with pilot union 18:14 • 15/02 Russia denies breaking treaty after alleged missile deployment 18:02 • 15/02 Armenia’s defense minister, Bulgarian ambassador discuss military cooperation 17:19 • 15/02 Eurovision 2017: Organising team quits en masse 16:44 • 15/02 Situation relatively calm in border zone – Defense Ministry spokesperson 16:30 • 15/02 Azerbaijan sends Talysh boys to slaughterhouse -

For the Apec Business Advisory Council (ABAC), this is even more starkly true. As the region’s businesses face an unprecedented assault from an “America First” President flirting with trade war, so their mettle will be tested on how clearly and persuasively they can challenge the chilling localist and protectionist winds that have been strongly stirred in the US. The first test, as senior officials gather in Nha Trang in southern Vietnam for two weeks work on the year’s agenda and priorities, will be to gauge how the changes wrought by Trump will affect the meetings. Will senior US officials arrive and sit like Easter Island statues because their scripts have yet to be written, or will US seats be filled by officials too junior to contribute meaningfully? Will US seats be left vacant? I am sure many officials from other parts of the Apec region will want to plunge into the year’s work programme as if nothing has happened. Those dismayed by US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be exploring whether and how the remaining 11 can “go it alone”. Those wilfully excluded from the TPP, in particular China, are likely to be pressing for progress on other regional integration initiatives, like the ambitious Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP). Those that are most vulnerable to the peccadillos of an “America First” administration – clearly Mexico and Canada – may be rolling up their sleeves to build stronger links to other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. The most profound uncertainty must be over whether the US will simply disengage from the strongly multilateral processes embedded in Apec. Trump has made it clear that he plans to exploit the US’s unique size and strength to prioritise bilateral negotiations where US corporate and economic interests can be most effectively exerted. If this remains true, then the traditional leadership role US officials have played in pursuing region-wide liberalisation might quickly collapse – not just in Apec, but also in groupings like the G20. There are other economies in the region committed to championing meaningful integration, including in the politically sensitive and difficult areas of regulatory change and structural reform behind borders – but whether they have the heft of the US is another matter. For the business leaders in ABAC, the uncertainties of 2017 are particularly acute. First, two of the US’s three ABAC members are new, and it is anyone’s guess what mandate they will arrive with. Many US companies have warmed strongly to Trump, whatever the eccentricities of his personality, fired by the prospect of big tax cuts, simplification of regulations, and big infrastructure spending. For the business leaders in ABAC, the uncertainties of 2017 are particularly acute No matter how powerfully US companies have benefitted from the trade and investment liberalisation of the past five decades, some may see little downside in a president who is fighting to keep foreigners out of the US market, and using the US’s market might to cudgel better bilateral deals out of the region’s weaker trading partners. While the long term harm of such tactics might be large, in particular strengthening the regional standing of a slowly liberalising China, the short term gains might be too mouth-watering for corporate America to resist. No wonder the US stock market is at record high levels. A second major challenge for ABAC this year will be in style and format. In past years the pattern of engagement in providing advice to Apec leaders has been carefully and diplomatically structured. At the year’s first ABAC meeting – that is in Bangkok next week – the year’s priorities and work plan are laid out and the year’s deliverables agreed to. At ABAC2 in April, members report back on progress, and at ABAC3 in July, finished reports are tabled, and the content of a neatly bound Report to Leaders will be agreed upon. At the year’s final meeting, ABAC members meet directly with leaders, and leave behind their neatly bound report. Questions are carefully prepared and scripted and assigned to different ABAC members. It is all diplomatically civil, polite and formulaic. What do you think a President Trump (assuming he attended the meeting) would make of such a carefully scripted engagement? For that matter, what would the Philippines leader Duterte make of it? In short, ABAC members need to plan for an unstructured roller-coaster ride of a discussion. From my point of view, this feels like a potentially good move, but the challenge of delivering the business community’s key messages clearly and forcefully will be formidable in the face of Trump’s scatological Twitterisms. For a template, we may do well to learn from Trump’s new Strategic and Policy Forum, composed of some of America’s top business leaders, which met for the first time with him just over a week ago. Their responsibility is to provide views “in a frank, non-bureaucratic and non-partisan manner” on how government policy impacts economic growth, job creation and productivity. So far, even though Uber’s Travis Kalanick has already resigned in protest over Trump’s attempt at an Islamic travel ban, the response has been positive. Even Boeing’s Dennis Mullenburg, hit by a presidential tweet on the high cost of a new Air Force One, has praised Trump for tweeting, saying he appreciated the “direct engagement”. Lockheed Martin, tweet-slapped for the cost of its F-35 fighter jets, also seems to be enjoying the close contact. As one analyst noted: “When was the last time that Lockheed Martin had three meetings in two months with a president?” Vietnam’s ABAC chair has rolled out 2017 themes and priorities around “Creating New Dynamism, Fostering shared future”, built on integration, “sustainable, innovative and inclusive growth”, encouraging SMEs, enhancing food security and promoting climate smart agriculture. Yawn. I wonder what Trump would tweet to that? For ABAC and Apec, the year ahead looks likely to be a roller coaster. If we aim to retain influence, then messaging on behalf of business is going to need to be sharper and more pertinent to the current very challenging business environment. That might even involve tweeting, heaven forefend.

File image of US president Donald Trump. AP "I am reading that the great border WALL will cost more than the government originally thought, but I have not gotten involved in the design or negotiations yet. When I do, just like with the F-35 FighterJet or the Air Force One Program, price will come WAY DOWN!" EFE news quoted Trump as saying in a tweet. The Twitter post about the wall was the President's first since 26 January, when he reiterated that Mexico should pay for the barrier considering the US's large trade deficits with its southern neighbour stemming from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which he has repeatedly criticised as a one-sided deal. Trump, who says the wall is necessary to thwart illegal immigration, also has accused Mexico of not doing enough to prevent undocumented migrants from crossing the border. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who has vowed that his country will never pay for the wall, cancelled a scheduled visit to the US amid the flap, although he and Trump spoke by phone on 27 January and agreed not to publicly discuss funding for the border barrier. The speaker of the US House of Representatives, Republican Paul Ryan, pledged in late January that the GOP-controlled Congress would approve funds for the wall and estimated it would cost between $13 billion and $15 billion. But analysts at Bernstein, a research and brokerage firm, have put the wall's price tag at as high as $25 billion, or double the cost of a new highway linking the US's east and west coasts. Since his surprise victory in the 8 November elections, the former real-estate mogul has secured commitments from Lockheed Martin and Boeing to lower the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programme and Air Force One programme, respectively. He had criticised the costs of those programmes and threatened to cancel the orders. #Donald trump#Newstracker#United states of america#Us president donald trump#Usa#White house Also See Donald Trump's travel ban: Hundreds of undocumented immigrants arrested in US Impeachment of Donald Trump?
