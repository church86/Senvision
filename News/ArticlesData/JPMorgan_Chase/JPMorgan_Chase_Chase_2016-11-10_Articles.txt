"Following" : "Follow"}} November 11, 2016 12:44pm   Comments Share: Related ADM Choose Your News: Earnings, Fed, Oil, And Retail Sales Highlight Busy Day 18 Stocks Moving In Monday's Pre-Market Session Shares of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) were down 7 percent after JPMorgan downgraded it to Underweight, citing Donald Trump’s surprise victory could have significant implications for the agriculture sector. “[T]he full impact of the Presidential election result is hard to quantify at this point; however, we believe that the risks to US agriculture are now skewed to the downside,” analyst Ann Duignan wrote in a note. Duigan believes a strong U.S. dollar versus South American currencies would weigh on Ag services and may reduce the competitiveness of U.S. exports. In addition, the competition for North American exports may increase earlier in 2017 as Brazilian farmers have been planting the 2016/2017 crop at a faster pace. The analyst also noted that corn processing could be hurt by a weaker Mexican peso. Further, weaker economic growth could negatively impact exports into Mexico, which is the third largest export market for US agriculture. “[T]he value of ADM’s ethanol dry mill assets could be reduced given heightened risks to demand (domestically and in terms of exports), this could negatively impact ADM’s ability to sell the dry mill assets in the near term,” Duigan highlighted. Meanwhile, the expiry of biodiesel tax incentive at the end of 2016 may weigh on soybean crush margins into 2017. The company expects up to $50 million negative impact on EBIT. Duigan also cut the price target by $6 to $36 on the shares, which lost 5.2 percent in the last two days. The analyst expects the stock to be under continued pressure as the impact of actual policy starts to weigh on the company’s core businesses.

By: Reuters | Published:November 11, 2016 7:41 am A person familiar with Trump’s personnel efforts said the transition team’s list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. (Source: File/AP) JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon did not support Republican Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, yet some Trump advisers want America’s most famous banker to become Treasury Secretary to calm nerves on Wall Street. A member of Trump’s transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is traveling outside the United States, could not be reached. Trump’s close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive. A person familiar with Trump’s personnel efforts said the transition team’s list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump. Trump’s controversial rhetoric and behavior during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization. Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry “got away with murder” and would not be let off the hook. Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House. At an event on Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Trump could be good for the economy and Dimon would be an excellent choice for Treasury Secretary, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Trump’s advisers would get “the best and brightest” to run the economy. Hensarling’s office indicated in a statement that he did not want the job. “Serving in his Cabinet is not something I’ve indicated an interest in and it’s not something I am pursuing,” the statement said. He said he looked forward to working in Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations on Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has been floated as a possible candidate for roles like Treasury Secretary in the past. However, resentment toward bankers following the 2007-2009 financial crisis made his candidacy much less likely, as did JPMorgan-specific scandals related to a costly derivatives trade and bad mortgages. A $13 billion mortgage settlement JPMorgan reached with the federal government in 2013 prompted Trump then to call Dimon “the worst banker in the United States.” However, Dimon has managed to retain a reputation within the banking industry as a distinguished leader, in part by the way he handled those scandals and the way he talks about JPMorgan’s role in society as the largest U.S. bank. For instance, Dimon decided to have JPMorgan make big investments in Detroit, calling it a civic duty to turn around an economically challenged city. His memos, speeches and letters to shareholders are often sprinkled with patriotic language. “America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done,” the 60-year-old chairman and CEO said in a memo to JPMorgan Chase employees following Tuesday’s election. “No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy.” However, Dimon has said as recently as September that he would not want a role as Treasury Secretary. If he holds to that, it could put him and JPMorgan in an awkward position. Saying “no” to a presidential request to join the cabinet is unusual, and the bank would then be overseen by appointees from an administration Dimon rejected. Even so, his associates do not expect Dimon to say “yes.” Dimon has said his determination to act would make it hard to make political compromises. Talking before an audience in September, he said the only job in government he would want is the one Trump is about to get. “I would love to be president of the United States of America,” Dimon told the Economic Club of Washington. “Until Donald Trump got to where he was, they said you’ll never see a rich businessman who’s never been in politics be president. I clearly was wrong about that.” Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaIndore Patna Express derails: Worst train accident in years kills 121; fractured rail likely cause IndiaPM Modi attacks Mamata Banerjee: 'Those who looted poor's chit fund money are raising finger at me' IndiaIndore Patna Express derailed: Make train journeys safe, PM Modi tells railway officials IndiaMy religion is nobody else's business, says CJI T S Thakur BusinessCentre-state stalemate over GST jurisdiction continues EntertainmentRajinikanth's 2.0 first look launch: I am the villain and Akshay is the hero, says Rajini EntertainmentAamir Khan attends Geeta Phogat's wedding, says Dangal is her gift, see inside pics EntertainmentBigg Boss 10 evicted contestant Karan feels Bani is highly misunderstood EntertainmentRajinikanth’s 2.0 first look launch: Akshay Kumar is up for battle of the year Must Read SportsIndia late show undoes England's defiance in Vizag SportsPV Sindhu wins China Open Series SportsSindhu 3rd Indian to win China Open: Twitter reacts TechnologyApple iPhone 8 to Samsung Galaxy S8: Top smartphones rumoured to launch with bezel-less design TechnologyBeware: WhatsApp group video-calling invite is a scam!

A member of Trump's transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is traveling outside the United States, could not be reached. Trump's close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive. A person familiar with Trump's personnel efforts said the transition team's list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump. Trump's controversial rhetoric and behavior during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization. Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry "got away with murder" and would not be let off the hook. Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House. At an event on Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Trump could be good for the economy and Dimon would be an excellent choice for Treasury Secretary, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Trump's advisers would get "the best and brightest" to run the economy. Hensarling's office indicated in a statement that he did not want the job. "Serving in his Cabinet is not something I've indicated an interest in and it's not something I am pursuing," the statement said. He said he looked forward to working in Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations on Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has been floated as a possible candidate for roles like Treasury Secretary in the past. However, resentment toward bankers following the 2007-2009 financial crisis made his candidacy much less likely, as did JPMorgan-specific scandals related to a costly derivatives trade and bad mortgages. A $13 billion mortgage settlement JPMorgan reached with the federal government in 2013 prompted Trump then to call Dimon "the worst banker in the United States."

A member of Trump's transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is travelling outside the United States, could not be reached. Trump's close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive. A person familiar with Trump's personnel efforts said the transition team's list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump. Trump's controversial rhetoric and behaviour during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization. Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry "got away with murder" and would not be let off the hook. Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House. At an event on Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Trump could be good for the economy and Dimon would be an excellent choice for Treasury Secretary, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Trump's advisers would get "the best and brightest" to run the economy. Hensarling's office indicated in a statement that he did not want the job. “Serving in his Cabinet is not something I’ve indicated an interest in and it’s not something I am pursuing," the statement said. He said he looked forward to working in Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations on Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has been floated as a possible candidate for roles like Treasury Secretary in the past. However, resentment toward bankers following the 2007-2009 financial crisis made his candidacy much less likely, as did JPMorgan-specific scandals related to a costly derivatives trade and bad mortgages. A $13 billion mortgage settlement JPMorgan reached with the federal government in 2013 prompted Trump then to call Dimon "the worst banker in the United States." However, Dimon has managed to retain a reputation within the banking industry as a distinguished leader, in part by the way he handled those scandals and the way he talks about JPMorgan's role in society as the largest U.S. bank. For instance, Dimon decided to have JPMorgan make big investments in Detroit, calling it a civic duty to turn around an economically challenged city. His memos, speeches and letters to shareholders are often sprinkled with patriotic language. "America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done," the 60-year-old chairman and CEO said in a memo to JPMorgan Chase employees following Tuesday's election. "No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy." However, Dimon has said as recently as September that he would not want a role as Treasury Secretary. If he holds to that, it could put him and JPMorgan in an awkward position. Saying "no" to a presidential request to join the cabinet is unusual, and the bank would then be overseen by appointees from an administration Dimon rejected. Even so, his associates do not expect Dimon to say "yes." Dimon has said his determination to act would make it hard to make political compromises. Talking before an audience in September, he said the only job in government he would want is the one Trump is about to get. "I would love to be president of the United States of America," Dimon told the Economic Club of Washington. "Until Donald Trump got to where he was, they said you'll never see a rich businessman who's never been in politics be president. I clearly was wrong about that."

Ricardo Hill, 38, was arrested last month in Florida and charged in a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan with conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. A federal magistrate granted Hill's release on Thursday on a $75,000 bond following a court appearance in Manhattan, court records show. A lawyer for Hill declined to comment. Hill, a resident of Brandon, Florida, is one of nine people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. According to court papers, the charges stemmed from Hill's employment as a finance support manager and business development consultant for an unlicensed bitcoin exchange called Coin.mx. Prosecutors have said Coin.mx was operated by another Florida man, Anthony Murgio, and owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of orchestrating a massive hacking scheme involving JPMorgan and other companies. Prosecutors contend Shalon along with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, and an American, Joshua Samuel Aaron, ran a criminal enterprise that hacked into a dozen companies' networks, stealing the personal information of over 100 million customers. While Hill and Murgio were not accused of roles in the hacking offenses, prosecutors said they committed crimes linked to the operation of Coin.mx, which exchanged millions of dollars of the virtual currency bitcoin for customers. The complaint against Hill said that he and others profited from numerous bitcoin transactions conducted on behalf of victims of schemes involving ransomware, which locks up computer systems and then demands payments to remove the restriction. To date, two individuals have pleaded guilty in connection with the Coin.mx case. Murgio and two other men have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled to face trial in February. Shalon and Orenstein pleaded not guilty following their extradition from Israel in June. Aaron is currently in Russia. The case is U.S. v. Hill, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-mj-6437.

Women in Banking: Goldman's New Partners; America's Gender Divide By Tanaya Macheel November 10, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related Q&A with Sallie Krawcheck The Circuit: The 'Daughters of Banking' Community Banker of the Year: Heritage Oaks' Simone Lagomarsino What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking Goldwomen: Women comprise 23% (19 out of 84) of Goldman Sachs’ latest class of partners. Goldman says that is the highest proportion and greatest number of female partners of any class ever. Among those selected were: Kathryn Koch, global head of client portfolio management for Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s equities business, and Kim Posnett, global co-head of internet investment banking. Goldman would not disclose how many partners it has overall or how many of them are women. But it is a privileged club: a Goldman partnership, considered one of Wall Street’s highest honors, typically comes with a $950,000 salary, a cut of a special bonus pool and the opportunity to invest in private funds. The selection process hasn't changed much in the past few decades, according to Edith Cooper, global chief of human capital management. The evaluation is based on how individuals are performing and what their potential for leadership is. Cooper, a newcomer to our Most Powerful Women in Finance list, is vice chair of the partnership committee, which selects the partners from among Goldman’s managing directors. Confidence Matters: For Thasunda Duckett, the new chief executive of JPMorgan Chase’s Consumer Bank, there is no typical day. The few constants are that she aims to see her four kids in the morning before the workday begins, tries to talk to employees at all levels of the business and spends a lot of time mentoring others. “I think it's beautiful to be me, to be a woman, to be black, to be born in New York and raised in Texas, because that is who I am,” she says. “I tell women or other minorities to be confident in who you are and know that you do belong … don’t own someone else's bias and negativity. Don't subscribe to that. That's not who you are.” Duckett, a repeat honoree on our Women to Watch list, held several top mortgage-lending jobs at JPMorgan Chase before she was named CEO of its auto finance arm in early 2013 and of the consumer banking unit this September. One of the 50: Fortune named Synchrony Financial CEO Margaret Keane a 2016 Businessperson of the Year. There are six female CEOs in the 50-person ranking, which is based on company data, such as 12- and 36-month increases in profit, revenue, and stock price. Keane is also on our Most Powerful Women in Finance list, where she has appeared consistently since 2007. Economic Booster: How can a country work toward ensuring equal pay for men and women? Christine Lagarde has some suggestions. The International Monetary Fund managing director says developed countries, for example, can attack the problem by easing the tax burden on families’ second income earners, typically women, and single-parent households, also usually women in the low tax brackets. Yellen’s Next Steps: Donald Trump isn’t planning to urge Janet Yellen to resign as chair of the Federal Reserve before her current term expires in February 2018, according to one of his economic advisers. However, he might not nominate Yellen for a second term as chair. Yellen’s term as a member of the Board of Governors expires in January 2024. She could stay on as a governor until then, regardless of whether she remains chair, but the tendency in the past has been for governors to leave when their term as chair ends. Beyond Banking Senate Women: The number of women of color in the U.S. Senate quadrupled Tuesday. Three Democrats — Kamala Harris, California’s attorney general; Catherine Cortez Masto, of Nevada, and Tammy Duckworth, of Illinois — are the new additions. Previously, Mazie Hirono, a Japanese American who represents Hawaii, had been the only nonwhite female Senator. Hirono is also a Democrat. Great Divide: Whether you believe Hillary Clinton lost the race “because she’s a woman,” one thing is certain from Tuesday: the U.S. gender divide has been underestimated. “This was an election that showed how much we still talk past one another when we talk about gender. It made plain profound gaps in how men and women perceive one another’s lives and prerogatives,” writes Susan Chira at the New York Times. “The campaign became a battle of two caricatures: male chauvinist pig against scheming, dishonest woman. It exposed parallel universes. In one, women flooded social media with their memories of sexual assault after Mr. Trump was caught on tape boasting about forcing himself on women. In another, men dismissed the tape as locker room talk or were surprised at how many women told them such harassment was commonplace.” Don’t Be Sorry: Given the discussion about how women apologize too frequently, it’s notable that about 20 seconds into Clinton’s concession speech Wednesday, she said, “I’m sorry we did not win this election.” It’s rare for a presidential candidate to use that word in a concession speech. Other losing candidates — including Romney in 2012, McCain in 2008, Gore in 2000 and Dole in 1996 — began their speeches expressing disappointment at the outcome, but none have explicitly apologized for losing. Read Clinton’s full speech here. If you see some news that should be included here, email us.

NEW YORK CITY (dpa-AFX) - President-elect Donald Trump's team is reportedly considering to offer JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the post of the US Treasury Secretary. However, reports suggest that the JPMorgan chief has refused the offer and said he is not interested in the role. Dimon has several times in the past said that he would not be interested in the post, most recently in September. On Wednesday, Dimon sent a memo to JPMorgan staff calling them to come together for the nation after the 'most contentious elections' in the country. 'We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside. But that makes it more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together Americans from all walks of life. Recognizing that our diversity is a core strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve our most serious challenges,' it said.

A member of the US president-elect’s team contacted Mr Dimon, who is well-respected in the banking industry, about the job, Reuters said. Reports that Mr Trump’s advisers were considering the banking boss for the role were dismissed by a source close to the bank, who told The Telegraph that there was a “less than 1pc” chance of Mr Dimon becoming Treasury Secretary. Meanwhile, former congressional aide Jeb Hensarling was also reported to be considered as a candidate for Treasury Secretary. Mr Hensarling is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and has pursued top Republican priorities, such as rolling back the 2010 Dodd Frank law. Billionaire-turned-reality-television-star Mr Trump has no government experience and faces the challenge of reassuring investors by filling his administration with respected individuals. The tycoon stunned the world when he confounded pollsters to beat Hillary Clinton to the White House. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the Reuters report. It is not known how Mr Dimon responded to the Trump team’s request, the news agency said. Mr Dimon, 60, has been JPMorgan’s chief executive since 2005 and has previously been linked with government roles, although he has dismissed the idea of being Treasury Secretary a number of times, including most recently in a speech in Washington in September.  The bank boss has already told JPMorgan employees that they must respect the election of Mr Trump, who beat Mrs Clinton by running a hugely divisive campaign. In a memo to staff, Mr Dimon said: “We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around the world, and American citizens showed that deep desire for change in voting to elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States.” He added: “We need to listen to those voices.” Mr Dimon said earlier this year that he'd love to be president, but acknowledged that it was too hard to run, and "too late".   Follow Telegraph Business READ MORE ABOUT: US Election Banks and Finance Donald Trump Show more Business latest 20 Nov 2016, 6:06pm Sir Stelios's easyCoffee eyes expansion 20 Nov 2016, 6:02pm Hedge funds struggle to justify their vast fees in the wake of Trump's election 20 Nov 2016, 5:44pm Dividend worries hit troubled Mitie 20 Nov 2016, 5:42pm OPEC oil cut nears as battered Saudis bow to indomitable US shale  Premium 20 Nov 2016, 5:30pm Uranium: the unloved metal whose price is poised to go radioactive  01:21 20 Nov 2016, 5:18pm When is Black Friday 2016 and what are the best deals? 20 Nov 2016, 3:26pm British Wool: a thriving industry, thanks to running the last marketing board in the country 20 Nov 2016, 1:47pm TSB joins bidders for £16bn Bradford & Bingley loans 20 Nov 2016, 1:02pm China will not shut the door on globalisation, president Xi Jinping vows 00:28 20 Nov 2016, 11:05am Britain has an 'eye-wateringly large debt' and economy faces 'sharp challenge', Philip Hammond warns 20 Nov 2016, 10:52am BT boss: Openreach impasse is depriving economy of £6bn investment  20 Nov 2016, 6:00am Autumn Statement: what to expect from Chancellor Philip Hammond Premium 20 Nov 2016, 6:00am Paper cuts: inside regional papers' battle to survive 20 Nov 2016, 12:01am CBI calls for partnership with government after bruising EU campaign 19 Nov 2016, 8:10pm Tesco Towers: supermarket enters the fray with a radical new solution to the housing crisis 19 Nov 2016, 8:05pm Autumn Statement: fiscal watchdog to downgrade growth as Hammond announces infrastructure drive 19 Nov 2016, 8:00pm Football clubs 'vulnerable' after relying on TV rights 19 Nov 2016, 8:00pm Comment: The City gears up for the blockbuster $2 trillion listing of Saudi Aramco Ben Marlow Premium 19 Nov 2016, 7:50pm Trump casts a shadow over BAT's $47bn bid for Reynolds 19 Nov 2016, 7:50pm Industry bodies slam new business rates appeals system which could cost small firms £700m 19 Nov 2016, 7:45pm Powa payments under scrutiny If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2016

President-Elect Donald Trump’s advisers are considering JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon for Treasury secretary, CNBC reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. Dimon isn’t interested, one of the people told CNBC. The JPMorgan CEO said Wednesday that Trump’s surprise victory and the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union are signs of frustration with a lack of economic opportunity that shouldn’t be ignored. Dimon, 60, was one of the few Wall Street leaders to indicate a presidential preference when he said last month while discussing his hopes for the next president that “she reaches across the aisle.” Andrew Gray, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to comment on the CNBC report. A Trump campaign spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. During this year’s contentious U.S. campaign between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Dimon repeatedly emphasized the need for bipartisan collaboration. In 2012, he said he was still “barely” a Democrat and criticized the economic views of some politicians in the party. Even though Trump has spent months attacking bankers and investors as members of a criminal global elite, he’s relied on them for campaign support. Chief fundraiser Steven Mnuchin and Republican National Committee finance chairman Lew Eisenberg were both Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partners. The head of presidential appointments for his transition, William Hagerty IV, is a private equity executive.

Holmes Braddock Senior High School NJROTC color guard carry their flags during a Veterans day ceremony in Miami Beach, Florida, on Nov. 11, 2015. Stanley McChrystal is a Retired U.S. Army General and member of JPMorgan Chase’s Military and Veterans Affairs Executive Advisory Council Jamie Dimon is the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. We must find tangible ways to help them transition back to civilian life This Veterans Day marks a significant milestone for service men and women. Since 9/11, the American people have shown tremendous support for our troops, but those returning from service have faced challenges reintegrating, particularly in finding meaningful employment. After reaching a peak of more than 12% in 2011, unemployment rates for post-9/11 veterans are the lowest they’ve been in five years. Back then, roughly a third of recent veterans under the age of 25—men and women who volunteered right out of high school and gained extraordinary skills that our economy needed—found themselves without work. Times were challenging for them and for their families and communities, but also for businesses that were missing out on recruiting high-value, highly-skilled employees. Higher veteran employment rates are good news for the nearly 200,000 servicemembers who will return to civilian life this year. We have reason to celebrate this progress and should applaud both the private and public sector efforts that have had an impact on veterans. But the truth is that our work has only just begun. Veterans may have an easier time finding a job than they did five years ago, but many of them are not landing jobs that they feel meet their level of experience and expertise. In fact, half of veterans seem to be leaving their first jobs out of the military within a year. What’s more, a new study by the Center for a New American Security sponsored by JPMorgan Chase found that nearly 60% of veterans feel overqualified for the civilian jobs they’re offered. It’s not easy making the switch from the battleground to the business meeting, but the skills our veterans bring—integrity, diligence, commitment—are highly valued. Whether it’s government, finance, consulting or another field, getting the right people in the right roles is critical. Hiring veterans is good business because they deliver; engaging and retaining their talent is also great for business. That’s been proven true time and again at JPMorgan Chase. Five years ago, we took on what felt like at the time an unsurmountable goal—we joined 10 other companies to hire 100,000 veterans. The commitment came from the very top at JPMorgan Chase and sought the advisement of highly respected names in the veterans’ space. Today, the Veteran Jobs Mission has an expanded mission with more than 230 companies committed to hiring one million veterans, and more than 350,000 hires made since then. At JPMorgan Chase, we’ve hired more than 11,000 veterans in the past five years, including 2,000 to have been hired by the end of the year. Other public and private businesses, no matter how small, can do the same for veterans by seeking them out and hiring them. First Lady Michelle Obama said it best when we announced our new mission of hiring one million veterans, “Our veterans and military spouses are some of the most dynamic, dedicated, and highly skilled individuals in America.” She also acknowledged what many of us who have been hiring veterans already knew, that “these companies aren’t doing it just because it’s the right thing to do for our country,” she said. “They’re doing it because it’s the right thing to do for their bottom line.” We must recognize the unique skill sets that veterans bring to the workforce and help them translate that into success on the job. The traits they learn in the military lend themselves to a diverse range of positions in the private sector, including information technology, project management, leadership and more. Business leaders ought to continue investing not only in resources to help veterans with the often bumpy transition into the private sector but also to train managers to understand the unique talents and needs of veterans to help maximize their impact and effectiveness. That’s why JPMorgan Chase created a sponsorship program to support onboarding veteran employees that pair them up with veterans who have been in the firm for some time, to help them learn the ropes and feel more connected to a community. It is also why we began military internship and executive development programs which provide veterans insight and experience in different lines of work as well as an opportunity to build a support network that will help them learn and grow within the firm. Transition is not easy for anyone, especially coming out of the military to a civilian job, but if we provide the proper support, we have seen see a return on investment that has been well worth it. This Veterans Day, we recognize the sacrifices our men and women in uniform have made on behalf of us all. To best honor their service, we must find tangible ways to support our veterans as they transition back to civilian life.

 Trump is reportedly considering JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon for Treasury secretary Linette Lopez Nov. 10, 2016, 11:51 AM 47,903 facebook linkedin twitter email print Yuri Gripas/Reuters; Samantha Lee/Business Insider President-elect Donald Trump is considering offering the post of Treasury secretary to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, CNBC's Kate Kelly is reporting. A lifelong Democrat, Dimon supported Barack Obama in 2008 and during the aftermath of the financial crisis. As post-financial-crisis Dodd-Frank regulation started to make an impact on the American financial system, however, he became much more critical. On Wednesday, after Trump won Tuesday's presidential election, Dimon sent a memo to JPMorgan employees calling them to come together for the nation. He also made a subtle dig at Trump's stances on immigration and race. "We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside," the memo said. "But that makes it more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together Americans from all walks of life. Recognizing that our diversity is a core strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve our most serious challenges." JPMorgan declined comment to Business Insider about Trump's possible interest in Dimon as Treasury secretary. Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs official, is also reportedly in the running for the position. Dimon signaled at a JPMorgan conference last month that he expected Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the election. "I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle," he said. Trump has been critical of Dimon in the past too. In 2013 he raised an eye at the CEO for settling a civil-suits against the bank. "I don't believe in settling cases," Trump told Bloomberg. "I'm not Jamie Dimon, who pays $13 billion to settle a case and then pays $11 billion to settle a case and who I think is the worst banker in the United States." On the OTHER hand, Trump has praised Dimon in the past as well. Glad to see that Jamie Dimon passed yesterday's shareholder vote. The JP Morgan stock holders understand that a good CEO is worth keeping. — Donald J.

Reconstruction Proposals M&G High Income Investment Trust P.L.C. (the 'Company') has a fixed life and is due to wind up on 17 March 2017 (the 'Wind-Up Date').  Having taken independent advice from its financial adviser, Winterflood Securities Limited ('Winterflood'), the board of the Company (the 'Board') intends to put forward proposals for a reconstruction of the Company to coincide with the Wind-Up Date (the 'Proposals').  In the Company's annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 May 2016, the Board noted its intention to offer shareholders at least one option alongside the liquidation of the Company, which would allow a tax- efficient rollover for those wishing to continue with their investment. The Board also noted that it expected to consider both open-ended and closed-ended investment vehicles for this purpose. Open-ended investment companies rollover options The Board is pleased to have agreed with M&G Investments ('M&G'), that M&G will make available as rollover options the following open-ended investment companies it manages: 1. M&G Extra Income Fund, which has a high degree of overlap between the investment objectives and the underlying holdings of the Company and benefits from continuity of management as it is managed by the same portfolio manager, Richard Hughes, who is also responsible for managing the Company's assets.   This fund will be the default option for shareholders in the Company who do not choose one of the other alternative options; 2. M&G Strategic Corporate Bond Fund; and 3. M&G Dividend Fund. Closed-ended investment company rollover option  The Board, conscious that some shareholders may favour maintaining their investment in a closed-ended structure has, along with Winterflood, conducted an extensive review of potential closed-ended rollover options. The Board is pleased to announce that it has agreed heads of terms with the board of JPMorgan Elect plc ('JPMorgan Elect') for JPMorgan Elect to act as the closed-ended rollover option in connection with the Proposals.  JPMorgan Elect provides investors access to a number of different investment strategies, including one focussed on UK equity income, through a multi-share class structure and the Board believe this will appeal to the Company's shareholders and unitholders. JPMorgan Elect, which has total net assets of circa £290 million (as at 31 October 2016), has three share classes, and quarterly conversion between share classes is permitted.  The investment objectives of the three classes, which the Board considers to be comparable to the Company's overall investment objective, are set out below: * Managed Income - A growing income return with potential for long term capital growth by investing in equities, investment companies and fixed income securities. * Managed Growth - Long term capital growth from investing in a range of investment trusts and open-ended funds managed principally by JPMorgan Asset Management. * Managed Cash - Preservation of capital with a yield based on short term interest rates by investing in a range of liquidity funds and short dated AAA-rated UK or G7 government securities hedged into sterling. It is expected that each of JPMorgan Elect's share classes will be made available as rollover options for the Company's shareholders.  Each share class is listed separately and traded on the main market of the London Stock Exchange and JPMorgan Elect's shareholders are able to switch between the three share classes on a quarterly basis without incurring a liability to UK capital gains tax. Pursuant to the Proposals, which will be subject to approval by the Company's shareholders, the Company, through a scheme of reconstruction under section 110 of the Insolvency Act 1986, will be wound up voluntarily and its shareholders, in respect of their shares, will be offered a choice of the following: * A tax and cost efficient rollover into new shares or units, as the case may be, to be issued by: * M&G Extra Income Fund; and/or * M&G Strategic Corporate Bond Fund; and/or * M&G Dividend Fund; and/or * JPMorgan Elect plc; and/or * A cash exit at NAV less costs.

(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg) A trader walks past a campaign sign for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and U.S. Vice President-elect Mike Pence on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, Nov. 9. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg) EQUITIES Goldman and ‘Gandalf’ are bullish on U.S. stocks under Trump Add to ... Luke Kawa, Julie Verhage and Joanna Ossinger Bloomberg News Published Friday, Nov. 11, 2016 3:10PM EST Last updated Friday, Nov. 11, 2016 7:56PM EST Comments AA Who thinks President-Elect Trump will be good for U.S. stocks? Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and the JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist known as ‘Gandalf,’ to name one high-profile pair. A Goldman team led by Equity Strategist Benjamin Snider highlighted the potential for corporate tax reform as a major tailwind for the financial performance of Corporate America. “Each percentage point change in the effective U.S. corporate tax rate is worth about $1.50 of 2017 S&P 500 earnings per share [EPS],” the team writes. “A change in the effective tax rate to 20 per cent from the current 26 per cent would boost our EPS forecast by 8 per cent to $125.” This would represent year-over-year growth of 20 per cent, or double their current expectation. Appetite for U.S. stocks has been immense since the election. Two-day inflows into the SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund, the largest ETF by assets, hit their highest level in over a year on Thursday. After slumping as the election results started to roll in, the front-month S&P 500 futures contract jumped nearly 7 per cent from trough to peak on Wednesday. Another benefit to U.S. stocks that Goldman sees is an increase in buybacks, also linked to changing tax policy under Mr. Trump. Historically, when there is a repatriation tax holiday like the one Mr. Trump discussed on the campaign trail, firms have used cash brought back from oversees for share repurchases, which has been a huge source of net demand for stocks throughout this bull market. JPM Global Head of Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy Marko Kolanovic, meanwhile, has long disagreed with the overwhelming consensus that a Trump victory would be negative for markets. But the extent of investor enthusiasm since the election has caught the strategist off guard. “The previously quoted (though often overblown) risks of Trump’s presidency are now likely higher, not lower,” writes Mr. Kolanovic, who was likened to the Lord of the Rings wizard after his prescient calls on related to the Chinese devaluation of 2015. “While we think that Trump’s win is medium-term positive for equities, we are not fully out of the woods yet.” At this point, the markets appear to have been more fixated on the aspects of a Trump presidency that could be positive for growth, like new infrastructure spending and tax reform, than the potentially detrimental aspects, like limits on immigration and trade protectionism. “As we advocated in our previously published research: emerging market assets, Commodities, Gold and Value stocks should outperform, and USD, Bond proxies and Quality should underperform,” writes Mr. Kolanovic. “This long term trend, which is reinforced by Trump’s win, is ‘cautiously optimistic reflation,’ rather than a ‘full risk on’ and ‘hawkish Fed’ trade.” Goldman’s team added that the bond market selloff could limit the extent to which stocks rise due to the regime change. “Historically low rates lifted U.S. equity valuations to near-record highs, and if risk-free rates continue to rise they may result in lower equity valuations,” concludes Mr. Snider.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, a broader measure of the stock market, also eked out a gain, adding to a big rally the day before following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. The Nasdaq composite closed lower, weighed down by a slide in technology companies. Bond prices slumped again, sending yields higher. “You are seeing a massive swing out of cash and fixed-income and into equities to take advantage of this pro-growth cycle that the market believes we’re beginning,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. The Dow climbed 218.19 points, or 1.2 percent, to 18,807.88. That’s a gain of about 1 percent from the average’s previous record high set on Aug. 15. The S&P 500 index added 4.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,167.48. The Dow and S&P 500 index are on a four-day winning streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 42.28 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,208.80. Investors continued to make moves based on the bevy of possible policy changes that the Trump administration could implement once it takes over in January. Those include cutting taxes, increasing infrastructure spending and slashing government regulation of businesses. That’s particularly given a boost to financial, industrial and health care stocks, while prompting traders to sell consumer goods companies, utilities and phone companies. Investors have also continued to pull out of bonds in anticipation that Trump’s policies could usher in stronger economy and, possibly, higher inflation, both of which are bad for bonds. The sell-off in bonds continued Thursday, sending bond prices lower and kicking the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.15 percent, the highest it’s been since January, from 2.06 percent late Wednesday. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. Traders have been selling bonds more aggressively to hedge against the possibility that interest rates, which have been ultra-low for years, could rise steadily again under Trump’s administration. That scenario would favor banks and other financial companies, one reason why the sector continued to rally Thursday. Higher interest rates help banks earn more money from lending, and years of ultra-low rates have crimped profits at big banks. JPMorgan Chase led the 30 companies in the Dow, climbing $3.40, or 4.6 percent, to $76.65. It was followed by Goldman Sachs, which rose $8.24, or 4.3 percent, to $200.87. Wells Fargo gained $3.64, or 7.6 percent, to $51.63, while Discover Financial Services added $3.31, or 5.5 percent, to $63.60. Traders also bid up shares in Macy’s and Kohl’s after the companies reported their latest quarterly results. Macy’s rose $2.1, or 5.6 percent, to $40.53. Kohl’s was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $5.27, or 11.5 percent, to $50.97. Some big names in the technology sector closed lower. Netflix slumped $6.77, or 5.5 percent, to $115.42, while Amazon.com slid $29.50, or 3.8 percent, to $742.38. Microsoft fell $1.47, or 2.4 percent, to $58.70. Shares in several phone companies also slumped. AT&T lost 87 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $36.57, while Verizon slid $1.17, or 2.4 percent, to $46.69. The major stock indexes in Europe turned lower after an early rally. Germany’s DAX slid 0.1 percent, while the CAC-40 in France fell 0.3 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 1.2 percent. Optimism that Trump’s election will improve U.S.-Russia relations helped lift the Micex index in Moscow 0.9 percent. Markets in Asia fared better. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rocketed 6.7 percent after sliding more than 5 percent the day before. South Korea’s Kospi advanced 2.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.9 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 surged 3.3 percent. Crude oil prices declined. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $44.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 52 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $45.84 a barrel in London. Other energy futures also closed lower. Wholesale gasoline slid 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil fell a penny to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas lost 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.63 per 1,000 cubic feet. In metals trading, the price of gold fell $7.10 to $1,266.40 an ounce, while silver added 36 cents, or 2 percent, to $18.74 an ounce. Copper rose 9 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.55 a pound. In currency trading, the dollar continued to strengthen Thursday. The U.S. currency rose to 106.83 yen from 105.84 yen on Wednesday, while the euro slid to $1.0890 from $1.0930. The Mexican peso continued to weaken against the dollar. One dollar bought 20.61 pesos on Thursday, more than the 19.87 pesos it bought late Wednesday. Investors worry that Trump’s anti-immigration stance and intention to repeal a trade pact with Mexico could hurt that country’s economy.     Tags: percent, companies, while, cents, continued, index, Other stories from today: Rule would boost solar and wind energy on public lands Yahoo took its time investigating massive security breach Disney embraces streaming as ratings sag     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   If you are traveling for Thanksgiving, when is the best time to go?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon did not support Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign, yet some Trump advisers want America's most famous banker to become Treasury Secretary to calm nerves on Wall Street. A member of Trump's transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is traveling outside the United States, could not be reached. Trump's close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive. A person familiar with Trump's personnel efforts said the transition team's list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump. Trump's controversial rhetoric and behavior during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization. Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry "got away with murder" and would not be let off the hook. Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House. At an event on Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Trump could be good for the economy and Dimon would be an excellent choice for Treasury Secretary, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Trump's advisers would get "the best and brightest" to run the economy. Hensarling's office indicated in a statement that he did not want the job. "Serving in his Cabinet is not something I've indicated an interest in and it's not something I am pursuing," the statement said. He said he looked forward to working in Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations on Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has been floated as a possible candidate for roles like Treasury Secretary in the past. However, resentment toward bankers following the 2007-2009 financial crisis made his candidacy much less likely, as did JPMorgan-specific scandals related to a costly derivatives trade and bad mortgages. A $13 billion mortgage settlement JPMorgan reached with the federal government in 2013 prompted Trump then to call Dimon "the worst banker in the United States." However, Dimon has managed to retain a reputation within the banking industry as a distinguished leader, in part by the way he handled those scandals and the way he talks about JPMorgan's role in society as the largest U.S. bank. For instance, Dimon decided to have JPMorgan make big investments in Detroit, calling it a civic duty to turn around an economically challenged city. His memos, speeches and letters to shareholders are often sprinkled with patriotic language. "America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done," the 60-year-old chairman and CEO said in a memo to JPMorgan Chase employees following Tuesday's election. "No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy." However, Dimon has said as recently as September that he would not want a role as Treasury Secretary. If he holds to that, it could put him and JPMorgan in an awkward position. Saying "no" to a presidential request to join the cabinet is unusual, and the bank would then be overseen by appointees from an administration Dimon rejected. Even so, his associates do not expect Dimon to say "yes." Dimon has said his determination to act would make it hard to make political compromises. Talking before an audience in September, he said the only job in government he would want is the one Trump is about to get. "I would love to be president of the United States of America," Dimon told the Economic Club of Washington. "Until Donald Trump got to where he was, they said you'll never see a rich businessman who's never been in politics be president. I clearly was wrong about that." © 2016 Thomson/Reuters.

The only problem with this is Dimon really doesn’t want the job. He didn’t want it before the election, he doesn’t want it now. Is it possible Trump could appeal to Dimon’s sense of patriotism to get him to take the job? Sure. It’s tough when the call from a president-elect comes in. But don’t bet on it. A similar dynamic took place during George W. Bush’s presidency when the president asked then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson to serve at Treasury. Paulson initially said no. Then Bush pleaded with him when the financial crisis hit and he agreed. So it’s possible that right now, Dimon is a no. But these things can change with time and events. Story Continued Below Other scuttlebutt: Trump advisor Steve Mnuchin is also said to not really want the job. House Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling also got a mention for Treasury. He said this to POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “It’s nice to be mentioned, and I certainly want to help our new president make America stronger and more prosperous, but serving in his Cabinet is not something I’ve indicated an interest in and it’s not something I am pursuing. “I’ve got enough on my plate working for the great people of Texas and serving as chairman of the Financial Services Committee. The president-elect has said that repealing the Dodd-Frank Act is among his top priorities, and I look forward to working as his ally in the House to do just that and replace it with common sense reforms like those in the Financial CHOICE Act.” BANK STOCKS POP ON TRUMP HOPE — POLITICO’s Ben White: “Markets continued to defy grim predictions of a Donald Trump-induced selloff on Thursday, with the Dow soaring to new highs. The biggest winners in the post-election advance: Wall Street’s largest banks. Stocks in some of the biggest financial firms in the world including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are rocketing higher after Trump’s shocking win on hopes for a lighter regulatory hand and the big role that experienced Wall Street veterans could play in the new administration. “‘The pre-election narrative was wrong,’ said Christopher Whalen, head of research at Kroll Bond Rating Agency. ‘We all assumed we were entering an era of left-wing democracy. But now we have a pro-growth GOP president and a pro-growth GOP Congress and we have to completely reset the narrative.’” OUR FAV LINE — “[T]he relief on Wall Street suggests many believe the era of bankers as national villains is coming to an end. ‘It’s not just that there is now a Republican president, it’s that Republicans held the Senate and that’s quite important,’ said Michael Mayo, a veteran banking industry analyst now at CLSA. “As of Nov. 8th, the financial crisis is over. As of that day we go from bashing banks to using banks to help facilitate economic growth.” Read more. WHY BANKERS ARE PSYCHED — Here’s some of the language from the Trump transition web site: “Following the financial crisis, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, a sprawling and complex piece of legislation that has unleashed hundreds of new rules and several new bureaucratic agencies. The proponents of Dodd-Frank promised that it would lift our economy. Yet now, six years later, the American people remain stuck in the slowest, weakest, most tepid recovery since the Great Depression. … “The Dodd-Frank economy does not work for working people. Bureaucratic red tape and Washington mandates are not the answer. The Financial Services Policy Implementation team will be working to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation” Read more. BANKS SEE GOLD IN TRUMP — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida and Zachary Warmbrodt: “In the wake of … Trump’s stunning presidential win, banks are working on a game plan to confront an entirely new reality: They might actually get their way. While Trump bashed Wall Street throughout the campaign, the financial services industry is hoping his victory, coupled with a GOP-led Congress, could open a path forward to easing regulations. “‘To say the world has changed is an understatement,’ one bank lobbyist said. The defensive issues we were concerned about we can be less concerned about. And we can start thinking about, to some degree, an affirmative agenda. … We didn’t have a plan B, so now everyone’s got to come up with a plan B.’” Read more. ONE OTHER NOTE — A top DC hand emails: “There seems to be a glaring omission here. What about Trump's commitment to reinstate Glass Steagall? His base hates Wall Street. Cozying up to the big banks would be an interesting positioning for him.” HENSARLING: BYE BYE DODD-FRANK — From an interview in Morning Consult: “The president-elect has fortunately been outspoken — as I have been — on the need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank, so I’m very encouraged by that … I have had a number of meetings with his transition team on the issue. I know, personally, it is something that Vice President-elect [Mike] Pence is very enthusiastic about.” Read more. RESTOCK THE SWAMP? — Via POLITICO’s Isaac Arnsdorf: “So much for #DrainTheSwamp? Lobbyists are all over Donald Trump's transition team, according to an organization chart obtained by POLITICO that shows who's guiding the handover for various agencies. Cindy Hayden of tobacco company Altria is in charge of Homeland Security; Steve Hart, the chairman of Williams & Jensen, is in charge of Labor; Paul Atkins, though not a lobbyist, is CEO of advisory firm Patomak Global Partners and charged with independent financial agencies” Read more A BOON FOR K STREET — NYT’s Eric Lipton: “Trent Lott, the former Republican senator from Mississippi, had gleefully flown back from Florida, where he had been working for the campaign of Donald J. Trump. Now a powerful lobbyist, his phone had been buzzing nonstop and he was busy helping to organize a briefing Thursday morning for dozens of corporate clients. “He was not alone. The stunning surprise of the election, and the political chaos it created, is a boon for Washington’s lobbying corridor known as K Street. Corporate America is both excited and anxious about the prospect of Mr. Trump’s presidency, seeing great opportunity to shape the agenda after an extended period of frustration over gridlock in Congress” Read more.

Clearly aiming to provide Democrats with a path forward in the President-Elect Donald Trump era, the progressive hero Massachusetts senator lit into the president-elect with her typical force during a hastily arranged speech at the AFL-CIO on Thursday … but she also insisted that Americans pay attention to his populist message. “The feeling that the speech at the labor behemoth’s executive council meeting was designed to break from Clinton’s Democratic Party, however, was unavoidable: She didn’t mention Clinton once, despite supporting and campaigning for her in the general election. ‘This wasn’t a pretty election. In fact, it was ugly, and we should not sugarcoat the reason why,’ she said toward the beginning of her address. ‘Donald Trump ran a campaign that started with racial attacks and then rode the escalator down. He encouraged a toxic stew of hatred and fear. He attacked millions of Americans” Read more. TRUMP TO DUMP TPP — POLITICO’s Adam Behsudi and Nancy Cook: “Trump plans to move quickly to fulfill some of his most controversial campaign promises related to what he derided as ‘job-killing’ trade policies, according to an internal transition team document shared with POLITICO. Within the first 100 days, his administration will drop out of TPP, and 100 days after that it could withdraw from NAFTA unless certain demands are met .. “Other first-day business includes labeling China a currency manipulator — something the Obama administration avoided in its eight years, and teaming up the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to examine all major proposed foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies to ensure equal opportunities for American investors abroad” Read more. THE NEXT OMB DIRECTOR? — Via POLITICO’s daily transition news letter: “We're hearing that Eric Ueland, staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, is being considered to lead the Office of Management and Budget in a Trump White House. Ueland has been working on the Trump transition and his pick would likely garner respect from both parties on Capitol Hill. Ueland has spent some two decades in the Senate — starting as a young aide in the Senate Republican Policy Committee in 1989, and ultimately becoming chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) in 2005” WHAT NEXT FOR FIN REG UNDER TRUMP — Via BPC’s Justin Schardin: “As a candidate … Trump laid out few specific policy proposals on financial regulation, so it is difficult to know exactly what the future of financial regulation will be under the newly elected President Trump’s administration. Trump has made two specific financial regulatory policy proposals: a moratorium on new regulations, and the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall provisions … “Those two policies are in conflict with each other, at least in spirit. Trump has also argued that too much regulation is causing banks not to lend, and that as president he would ‘dismantle’ the Dodd-Frank Act.” Read more THIEL TO TRANSITION TEAM — Via Dan Primack: “Peter Thiel has agreed to join Donald Trump's presidential transition team, according to multiple sources close to the situation. Thiel, a venture capitalist and hedge fund manager who also serves on the board of directors at Facebook, has been Trump's most prominent Silicon Valley supporter, even speaking on his behalf at the Republican National Convention” Jeff Hauser, Director of the Revolving Door Project on Trump Treasury: “It now appears that Trump is seeking a diverse array of choices for Treasury — unlike Bush, he will consider what JP Morgan has to offer (Dimon) in addition to Goldman Sachs (Mnuchin).” TRUMP COULD PICK HENSARLING — WSJ’s Damian Paletta, Ryan Tracy and Michael Bender: “Aides to President-elect Donald Trump are considering Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) as a candidate for Treasury secretary, a pick that would bring an elected official with a free-market background and deep GOP ties into one of the cabinet’s most powerful posts, people familiar with the matter said. “Mr. Hensarling’s consideration shows the strong influence Vice President-elect Mike Pence has on key decisions. Messrs. Pence and Hensarling worked closely together in the House of Representatives, and their views on many financial issues are closely aligned.” Read more. … OR DIVERSIFY HIS PORTFOLIO — Reuters’ Dan Freed and David Henry: “JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon did not support Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign, yet some Trump advisers want America's most famous banker to become Treasury Secretary to calm nerves on Wall Street. “A member of Trump's transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.”Read more. DODD-FRANK UNDER FIRE — Bloomberg’s Jesse Hamilton and Elizabeth Dexheimer: “President-elect Donald Trump is translating some of his populist campaign rhetoric into policy statements, including the contention that the Dodd-Frank Act should be scrapped because it has made Wall Street banks an even bigger threat to the nation’s economy and working families. In addition to repealing Dodd-Frank, Trump’s transition website outlines several policies that will be familiar to those who followed his campaign, including calls for a moratorium on new rules so existing measures can be reviewed. It also broadly addressed a tax-code overhaul, saying Trump’s plan ‘can be summarized as lower, simpler, fairer, and pro-growth.’” Read more. TOOL OF THE TRADE [WAR] — NYT’s Keith Bradsher: “As president of the United States, Mr. Trump can use trade — a cornerstone of his populist rise — as a weapon, with the potential to drastically reshape the world’s two largest economies, as well as the companies, industries and workers who depend on their hundreds of billions of dollars in closely linked goods. But neither side may win. “Should Mr. Trump want to signal an aggressive stance quickly, he could move against imports of steel and aluminum from China. The Obama administration has been preparing to file a World Trade Organization case against China over claims that it subsidized aluminum exports.” Read more. TPP COUNTER MOVES FORWARD — FT’s Tom Mitchell, Shawn Donnan and Robin Harding: “Xi Jinping is rekindling efforts to promote a rival to the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in the wake of Donald Trump’s election victory, Chinese officials said on Thursday. “China’s efforts have been focused on wrapping up talks over a deal known as the ‘Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership’ with the 10 members of Asean and other countries including Australia and India.” Read more. RUSSIAN BANKS UNDER CYBER ATTACK — BBC News: “Five Russian banks have been under intermittent cyber-attack for two days, said the country's banking regulator. “The hackers behind the DDoS attacks are believed to have generated the huge amounts of data by taking over smart devices such as webcams and digital video recorders that use easy to guess passwords. Devices in the USA, India, Taiwan and Israel were all used in the attack, said the security firm.” Read more. ROUND THREE FOR GOOGLE — WSJ’s Natalia Drozdiak and Sam Schechner: “Google on Thursday fired off its response to the third set of formal charges issued by the European Commission, the bloc’s antitrust regulator — this time rebutting the EU’s allegations that the search giant abuses its dominance with its mobile operating service Android. “If the EU deems Google guilty, the regulator could impose hefty fines in each of the three cases and require that Google overhaul its operations in parts. But such a finding by the EU could also cause further damage for Google.” Read more.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      JPMorgan told investors the market will rally into early next year due to optimism about the Republican economic agenda, CNBC.com reported. "We interpret the U.S. election outcome with a Republican sweep as pro-growth for equities," strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note to clients Thursday. "Expectations of decreased regulation, favorable tax reform, increased fiscal spending and less congressional gridlock should drive stronger revenue growth and higher net income margins. Further, the removal of election uncertainty and some form of cash repatriation should result in increased investment activity," the note read. Lakos-Bujas cited how a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 15 percent or 20 percent versus the current effective rate of about 25 percent could add $10 to $15 in earnings per share to the S&P 500. As a result, he predicts the benchmark will rally to 2,300 "by early next year," representing 6 percent upside from Wednesday's close. "Trump administration reinforces the reflation trade that started post-Brexit. We expect reflation to support rotation from Low Vol stocks, the largest beneficiaries of falling yields in this cycle, into value and growth stocks," he wrote. The strategist said infrastructure spending is "high on Trump's agenda." Consequently, the largest beneficiaries will be domestic construction materials, metals, mining and transportation stocks. JPMorgan isn't alone in its enthusiasm for Trump's potential Veteran financial guru Larry Kudlow, who served as the Trump campaign's senior economic adviser, tells Newsmax TV that Trump will live up to his campaign vows to restore prosperity to all Americans and the nation we all love. "Donald Trump has a very strong economic growth message which is going to be great for the economy and for profits and for businesses large and small," Kudlow said Wednesday to Steve Malzberg on "America Talks Live." Kudlow, a Newsmax Finance Insider and CNBC senior contributor, said the billionaire real-estate tycoon was successful because he understands the dissatisfaction of "ordinary middle-class folk."  "With Mr. Trump you're going to have across the board tax cuts, you're going to end Obamacare, which is a prosperity killer and a healthcare killer, you're going to take the handcuffs off of energy, you're going to wall back all these regulations and you're going to stop the government from taking over the economy. That's a powerful message," Kudlow said. Trump "understood that they were angry and that the establishment in Washington and elsewhere was not delivering. He understood that they wanted change and he understood that they wanted to drain the swamp, get rid of the corruption, stop the corporate cronyism," Kudlow said. "He understood that instinctively and he knew that people were not willing to give up the American dream … I think it was effective and I think he hit it exactly right. He just understood the American people in a way that no other political figure has understood it." But the possibility of Trump slapping punitive tariffs on exports from some countries such as China has unnerved some investors.  "The markets are adjusting to a new reality and are giving Trump the benefit of doubt," Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of Sarhan Capital, told Reuters. "He does have some problems with immigration and with social issues, but his economic policies, at least in the short-term, are perceived to be stimulative and net good for the economy and that's why stocks are rallying."

Below is the performance of major assets, sectors and stocks during periods of rising inflation. You'll see why investors are crowding into copper and selling technology stocks this week, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average to record levels.

In the wake of Donald Trump's upset victory, advisors have floated the idea of naming Jamie Dimon as treasury secretary, according to two people familiar with the matter, but one of them added that the JPMorgan chief has said he would not be interested in the role. A Trump spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment, and a spokesman for Dimon declined to elaborate beyond his past remarks that he would not be interested. It was unclear who within Trump's circle of advisors raised the idea or who else might be under consideration for treasury secretary. Trump campaign finance chief Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs official, is reportedly considered to be the front runner. Dimon has suggested repeatedly, including in an interview at the Economic Club of Washington in September, that he would not be interested in becoming treasury secretary.   And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

(Mary Altaffer/AP) By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Published: November 10, 2016, 9:35 PM A   A Banks and other financial companies led U.S. stocks mostly higher Thursday, propelling the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, a broader measure of the stock market, also eked out a gain, adding to a big rally the day before following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. The Nasdaq composite closed lower, weighed down by a slide in technology companies. Bond prices slumped again, sending yields higher. “You are seeing a massive swing out of cash and fixed-income and into equities to take advantage of this pro-growth cycle that the market believes we’re beginning,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. The Dow climbed 218.19 points, or 1.2 percent, to 18,807.88. That’s a gain of about 1 percent from the average’s previous record high set on Aug. 15. The S&P 500 index added 4.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,167.48. The Dow and S&P 500 index are on a four-day winning streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 42.28 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,208.80. Investors continued to make moves based on the bevy of possible policy changes that the Trump administration could implement once it takes over in January. Those include cutting taxes, increasing infrastructure spending and slashing government regulation of businesses. That’s particularly given a boost to financial, industrial and health care stocks, while prompting traders to sell consumer goods companies, utilities and phone companies. Investors have also continued to pull out of bonds in anticipation that Trump’s policies could usher in stronger economy and, possibly, higher inflation, both of which are bad for bonds. The sell-off in bonds continued Thursday, sending bond prices lower and kicking the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.15 percent, the highest it’s been since January, from 2.06 percent late Wednesday. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. Traders have been selling bonds more aggressively to hedge against the possibility that interest rates, which have been ultra-low for years, could rise steadily again under Trump’s administration. That scenario would favor banks and other financial companies, one reason why the sector continued to rally Thursday. Higher interest rates help banks earn more money from lending, and years of ultra-low rates have crimped profits at big banks. JPMorgan Chase led the 30 companies in the Dow, climbing $3.40, or 4.6 percent, to $76.65. It was followed by Goldman Sachs, which rose $8.24, or 4.3 percent, to $200.87. Wells Fargo gained $3.64, or 7.6 percent, to $51.63, while Discover Financial Services added $3.31, or 5.5 percent, to $63.60. Traders also bid up shares in Macy’s and Kohl’s after the companies reported their latest quarterly results. Macy’s rose $2.1, or 5.6 percent, to $40.53. Kohl’s was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $5.27, or 11.5 percent, to $50.97. Some big names in the technology sector closed lower. Netflix slumped $6.77, or 5.5 percent, to $115.42, while Amazon.com slid $29.50, or 3.8 percent, to $742.38. Microsoft fell $1.47, or 2.4 percent, to $58.70. Shares in several phone companies also slumped. AT&T lost 87 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $36.57, while Verizon slid $1.17, or 2.4 percent, to $46.69. The major stock indexes in Europe turned lower after an early rally. Germany’s DAX slid 0.1 percent, while the CAC-40 in France fell 0.3 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 1.2 percent. Optimism that Trump’s election will improve U.S.-Russia relations helped lift the Micex index in Moscow 0.9 percent. Markets in Asia fared better. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rocketed 6.7 percent after sliding more than 5 percent the day before. South Korea’s Kospi advanced 2.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.9 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 surged 3.3 percent. Crude oil prices declined. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $44.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 52 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $45.84 a barrel in London. Other energy futures also closed lower. Wholesale gasoline slid 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil fell a penny to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas lost 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.63 per 1,000 cubic feet. In metals trading, the price of gold fell $7.10 to $1,266.40 an ounce, while silver added 36 cents, or 2 percent, to $18.74 an ounce. Copper rose 9 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.55 a pound. In currency trading, the dollar continued to strengthen Thursday. The U.S. currency rose to 106.83 yen from 105.84 yen on Wednesday, while the euro slid to $1.0890 from $1.0930. The Mexican peso continued to weaken against the dollar. One dollar bought 20.61 pesos on Thursday, more than the 19.87 pesos it bought late Wednesday. Investors worry that Trump’s anti-immigration stance and intention to repeal a trade pact with Mexico could hurt that country’s economy.

"I think it will be interesting to see over the next couple months, if we do see more of a sense of certainty, it could turn out to be a little bit better of a holiday then maybe initially thought," JPMorgan's Matt Boss said in an interview with CNBC's "Power Lunch." The retail sector rallied Thursday, with the S&P retail ETF (XRT) closing up almost 3 percent higher as some department store earnings came in. It was led by Kohl's, which ended more than 11 percent higher after it topped earnings expectations. Getty Images People carrying shopping bags walk along Fifth Avenue in New York. During the third quarter, the low-price department store recorded revenue of $4.327 billion, slightly above the Thomson Reuters estimate of $4.325 billion. Its adjusted earnings per share came in at 80 cents, easily topping expectations for 70 cents. Macy's, on the other hand, reported earnings that fell short of analysts' expectations. However, it raised its forecast for full-year comparable sales on owned and licensed items, saying they should decrease in the range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. That compares with its prior outlook of a 3 percent to 4 percent decline. "This was the week that people were concerned about in retail. The department stores is where there was the most negativity overall," Boss said. "The department stores, so far, have delivered." More importantly, there is a sense of optimism looking forward, he added. "The fourth quarter, the first quarter, you have easier compares and I think people are looking ahead to 2017 more so on the traffic aspect, and maybe we can see some more optimism." — CNBC's Krystina Gustafson contributed to this report.

Stocks are opening higher on Wall Street, Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, as the rebound in share prices around the world continued two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Associated Press   Trader Daniel Porin works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016. Stocks are moving solidly higher in midday trading on Wall Street following Donald Trump's upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election. Associated Press   By YURI KAGEYAMA     TOKYO -- Asian shares gave up early gains on Friday as expectations that Donald Trump's policies on trade might fuel inflation, pushing bond yields sharply higher. The dollar surged against the Japanese yen. KEEPING SCORE: Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.5 percent to 22,520.58 and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.8 percent to 1,986.11. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.7 percent to 17,456.35 after touching a half-year high in early trading as the yen fell against the dollar. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 edged up 0.2 percent to 5,340.00. Shares in Taiwan dropped 2.1 percent and in Indonesia they fell 2.8 percent. The Shanghai Composite was flat at 0.1 percent at 3,172.13. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.2 percent to a record high 18,807.88. The S&P 500 index added 0.2 percent to 2,167.48. The Dow and S&P 500 index are on a four-day winning streak. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent to 5,208.80. TRUMP HOPES: Investors are hopeful about some of the possible policy changes under the Trump administration, taking over in January, including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. An improved American economy is a certain boon to export-driven Asia. THE QUOTE: But some analysts urged caution on such optimism, while noting that U.S. markets' being closed later in the day for Veterans' Day may help ease some of the market swings. "Trump has not announced anything new so far, apart from reaffirming his priority to repeal and replace 'Obamacare' on top of implementing tax reforms," said Chang Wei Liang, Singapore Treasury Division at Mizuho Bank, referring to President Obama's health care program. BONDS: Investors have been pulling out of bonds in anticipation that Trump's policies could spur inflation and lead to higher interest rates, both of which are bad for bonds. The sell-off in bonds continued Thursday, sending bond prices lower and kicking the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.15 percent, the highest it's been since January, from 2.06 percent late Wednesday. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. Higher yields on bonds would help draw investors from equity markets, pulling prices lower. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 28 cents to $44.38 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 23 cents to $45.61 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The U.S. currency rose to 106.67 yen from 105.33 yen late Thursday in Asia. The euro slid to $1.0886 from $1.0945. ___ AP Business Writer Alex Veiga contributed to this report. ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Tweet This article filed under: News Nation/World Associated Press Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

KEEPING SCORE: France’s CAC 40 fell 0.7 per cent to 4,498, while Germany’s DAX was up 0.1 per cent at 10,641. Britain’s FTSE 100 shed 1 per cent to 6,761. U.S. shares appeared headed for a weaker open a day after the Dow hit a record high following a four-day streak of gains. Dow futures were down 0.3 per cent while S&P 500 futures shed 0.6 per cent. TRUMP HOPES: Investors are hopeful about some of the policy changes that may come when the Trump administration takes office in January, including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. An improved American economy is a certain boon to close trading partners in Europe and Asia. But some analysts urged caution, noting there was still little detail on what Trump wanted to do. THE QUOTE: “Trump has not announced anything new so far, apart from reaffirming his priority to repeal and replace ‘Obamacare’ on top of implementing tax reforms,” said Chang Wei Liang, Singapore Treasury Division at Mizuho Bank, referring to President Obama’s health care program.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Donald Trump reportedly considering JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon for treasury secretary In Politics by Jamie Peck / November 10, 2016 Share < br />this article: Follow @jamie_elizabeth On the campaign trail, Donald Trump occasionally took a page from the Bernie Sanders playbook by attacking Hillary Clinton for her ties to Wall Street. But he also promised to dismantle President Obama’s Wall Street reform law Dodd-Frank, making it hard to predict what he’d actually do. On Thursday news has come out that further undermines his pretensions to populism: Trump’s advisors are reportedly considering JP Morgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon for treasury secretary. According to CNBC, “two people familiar with the matter” say that “advisors have floated the idea of naming Jamie Dimon as treasury secretary,” although Dimon has said in the past that he would not be interested in the role. They hedged it by adding that the JPMorgan chief — who identifies as a Democrat — “has said he would not be interested in the role.” The actual frontrunner for the job is reportedly Trump campaign finance chief Steven Mnuchin, a former partner at Goldman Sachs. Real tough on bankers, him. Whether the job goes to Dimon, Mnuchin, or some other monstrous finance bro, it’s yet another sign Trump’s message of economic populism was illusory. Rather than planning to “take on the big banks,” Trump hopes his newfound status as POTUS will finally gain him entry into the elite financial circles that have scorned him as a huckster for his entire career. Unfortunately for him, that could be an uphill battle; Wall Street has been the Clintons’ domain for quite some time. My take: If President Trump (ew) ever does take on these fat cats, it will be because their desire to exclude him overcame the pull of their own material interests. “Revenge reform” might be an oxymoron, but I guess we should take it how we can get it.

 Donald Trump's win looks like good news for Wall Street — and bank stocks are flying high Portia Crowe Nov. 10, 2016, 2:56 PM 3,498 facebook linkedin twitter email print Stuart C. Wilson / Stringer / Getty Images US bank stocks were climbing for a second straight day Thursday following president-elect Donald Trump's electoral win. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo all ended the day in the green Thursday. Most were up by about 4%, while Wells Fargo closed up 7.4%. One major reason for the jump appears to be because Trump is expected to reduce regulation hampering bank profitability. His win could also lead to increased inflation pressures, indicating that the Federal Reserve could begin increasing its rate of interest rate hikes. Trading desks could also benefit from increased market volatility. There are, of course, some risks for the financial industry on the horizon, as KBW's Frederick Cannon and Brian Gardner highlighted in a recent note. Those include a US retrenchment from the global economy and trade agreements. Regional banks could perform better than the universal banks in the long-term because of the larger banks' international exposure. Citigroup, Bank of America, and JPMorgan, for example, have larger international lending portfolios and could be hurt by isolationism, the analysts wrote. Citigroup in particular is at risk from its large exposure to Mexico and other emerging markets, wrote KBW's Brian Kleinhanzl, noting that Citi generates 40% of its revenue from emerging markets. But, as the analysts point out, the near-term benefits appear clearer and more immediate than the risks. Reduced regulation? On the regulatory front, the market appears to be pricing in the fact that Trump's administration will introduce laxer rules. Trump has said he would "dismantle" the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, for example, and "massively" cut back on other regulation. He has also said that he disagrees with breaking up the big banks, according to Barclays' Jason Goldberg. This would be good news for banks. That said, neither KBW's nor Barclay's analysts believe the Dodd-Frank Act will ultimately be repealed. Barclays' Goldberg also does not believe that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be dismantled, as has also been suggested. The analysts over at Fitch wrote in a note Thursday that the elimination of the CFPB, if it were to happen, would be "unlikely to have a material impact for banks in the aggregate," noting that there has been little talk of repealing the Volcker Rule, specifically. Economic growth? For Goldberg, the main reason Trump's win could be a boon for the banks is if he has a positive impact on GDP growth. "While it's unclear the ultimate impact the new administration will have on GDP growth, it bears watching closely," Goldberg wrote. "Factors that could influence growth either way include increased infrastructure spending, reduced taxes, a potentially larger federal deficit, possibly higher interest rates/inflation and reduced global trade." And from Fitch: "Generally, US financial institutions' performance tends to be correlated with the overall US macroeconomic environment, particularly as it relates to economic growth. Judging by the campaign, the new administration's economic policy is likely to revolve around tax cuts, renegotiating trade agreements, de-regulation and higher infrastructure spending." Of course, there's a big "if" here. As Fitch's analysts wrote, "it remains to be seen the degree to which Trump will implement or be able to carry out his policy initiatives and the long-term effect policy changes will have on growth."

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Twtter The day after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Apple CEO Tim Cook sent an email to the 76,000 Apple employees in the United States, urging them to “move forward together” after an often contentious election.   He, along with other American CEOs, made the move to talk to employees either before or after Tuesday’s election.   Here’s Cook’s email, which was published by Buzzfeed:   “Team,   I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings.   We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.   While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.   I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious.   Let’s move forward — together!   Best, Tim”   Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, sent this email to his employees, according to Reuters:    “Dear colleagues,   We are going through a period of profound political and economic change around the world, and American citizens showed that deep desire for change in voting to elect Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. We have heard through democratic processes in both Europe and the United States the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face. We need to listen to those voices.   We have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside. But that makes it more important than ever to bind the wounds of our nation and to bring together Americans from all walks of life. Recognizing that our diversity is a core strength of our nation, we must all come together as fellow patriots to solve our most serious challenges.   Leaders from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors need to collaborate to find meaningful solutions that create economic growth and greater opportunity for all.   America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done. No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy.   J.P. Morgan Chase has a proud history of supporting our communities and our countries. Through your outstanding efforts, we have built a great company that will continue to thrive – as we continue to focus on helping to serve our clients and communities. We will also continue to help address the important public policy issues of the day and the underlying economic challenges throughout the world.   I’m optimistic about America’s future and the role our company will continue to play as we help the nation address our challenges and move forward together. Jamie”   Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz sent his employees an email prior to the election.     “Dear partners,   It's a rainy Sunday morning in Seattle, we've turned the clocks back an hour, and I'm enjoying a French Press of my favorite coffee, Aged Sumatra. I woke up this morning feeling a bit anxious about Tuesday's election. Regardless of the outcome, our nation will feel divided. Many Americans have allowed the vitriolic nature of the presidential campaign to ignite our differences and strip away our civility and dignity. In the process, we've lost faith in what we all know has always been true, the promise of America.   But you are the true promise of America.   My faith in you has me more optimistic than ever. Today, I'm not talking about our business or the Starbucks brand. I'm talking about you as a person. As a mother, a father, a daughter, a son, a sister, a brother, a neighbor, a citizen. I also am talking about we as people. We as Americans. And, I am talking about the people who have come before us, those who sacrificed so much to give us a better life than the lives they had. Each of us has a great responsibility to those who preceded us, as well as to "pay it forward" for the next generation. So what can we do? What will we do?   In the face of this epic, unseemly election and the concern we all share about the direction of our country and the lack of truth and void of leadership, we can still make a difference in the lives of the people we touch and influence every day. Kindness, compassion, empathy, and yes love is what we need. It is what we must display and share. We are all longing for a deeper sense of human connection and humanity because, when we are touched by it, it fills us up.   Start today by recognizing the power we have to walk in someone else's shoes, to demonstrate understanding, and to strip away the differences that divide us. Let's each embrace the universal virtues of respect and dignity, refusing to allow the hatred on cable news, the ugliness of our politics, and the lack of political role models for our kids to define us and to dictate how we treat each other. Rise above this moment to be the person that makes a positive difference in your neighborhood and community. Be the person who makes your family proud. Be the person who embodies the promise of America so others may see and feel the possibilities that come with being an American—today, tomorrow, and long after this Tuesday.   Like the drawing of so many faces with a single, unbroken line on this season's green unity cup, we are all connected.   On this Sunday, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, know that I send you my love and respect.   Proud, as always, to be your partner,   Howard” © 2016 Cox Media Group.

The bank yesterday began mailing letters to clients about the change being made to its retirement-account offering, posting the communication online this morning, according to a spokesman. JPMorgan is pushing ahead with the decision after the surprise results of the U.S. presidential election cast the Labor Department's new fiduciary rule into limbo. The wealth-management industry has spent months analyzing the Labor Department's 1,023-page fiduciary rule, which requires financial advisers to put their clients' interests ahead of their own when making recommendations for their retirement accounts. While some see potential for the regulation to be thrown out under a Donald Trump administration, for now at least, it's still on the books. "Our communications plans and client outreach efforts were planned months ago and we are operating under the current state of the rule," the spokesman said. Firms' compliance strategies largely have centered on whether or not to keep charging commissions for each transaction made within IRAs. The fiduciary rule seeks to prevent conflicts of interest where an adviser may make an investment recommendation that charges a higher commission for personal gain, eroding the client's savings. JPMorgan's clients may choose retirement accounts that are professionally managed under a fee-based arrangement, or a self-directed option that allows them to manage their own investment strategy, according to the communication posted online. Last month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Commonwealth Financial Network announced they were banning commission-based retirement accounts because of the DOL fiduciary rule. Other brokerage firms, including Morgan Stanley, have said they will continue to offer commission-based IRAs, using the regulation's best-interest contract exemption. Firms must begin implementing the new regulation in April and become fully compliant by January 2018. “Overall, these regulations were designed to help protect investors by ensuring that financial institutions act in their clients' best interests,” JPMorgan told its clients. 0 Comments What do you think?

Jayson Derrick , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} November 10, 2016 1:17pm   Comments Share: Related JPM Conference Calls And Profanity? Yes It's A Thing Investors Have Cast Their Ballots For Big Bank Stocks Wells Fargo: Dead Culture? (Seeking Alpha) According to a CNBC report, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon could be cleaning out his Manhattan office for a new office in Washington D.C. CNBC's sources have said President-elect Donald Trump and his team are eyeing Dimon to serve as treasury secretary, even though the executive said back in September he has no interest in accepting the job. "I think this would probably be a sigh of relief for Wall Street to know that Dimon was under consideration or that he was on a list because it's a more mainstream candidate coming from a president-elect who of course has embraced less traditional types of ideas for both his own staff and a potential cabinet," CNBC's Kate Kelly said. Other candidates the Trump campaign is believed to be targeting for treasury secretary include Steven Mnuchin who served as Trump's national finance chairman. What About Other Positions? According to Politico, the Trump campaign is also considering former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton for the role of secretary of state. Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), former National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley and former Sen. Jim Talent are being considered for the role of secretary of defense. Former mayor of New York City Ruddy Giuliani and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are in contention for the role as attorney general. Oil executive Forrest Lucas is a top contender for interior secretary. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross and the former CEO of Nucor Corp Dan DiMicco along with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee are being considered for commerce secretary.

While the Dow remains positive after reaching a new record intraday high in early trading, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has pulled back firmly into negative territory. Currently, the Dow is up 138.47 points or 0.7 percent at 18,728.16, while the Nasdaq is down 70.71 points or 1.4 percent at 5,180.37 and the S&P 500 is down 3.41 points or 0.2 percent at 2,159.85. The gain by the Dow is partly due to a significant advance by shares of drug giant Pfizer (PFE), which have jumped 4.4 percent. Pfizer has benefited from a report from Reuters indicating the company is evaluating a potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14 billion. Strong gains by IBM (IBM), General Electric (GE), and JPMorgan (JPM) have also contributed to the continued upward move by the Dow. The advance by JPMorgan (JPM) is indicative of strength throughout the financial sector amid optimism about reduced regulation under Trump. Reflecting the strength in the financial sector, the Dow Jones Banks Index is up by 3.4 percent and the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index is up by 3 percent. Steel, transportation, oil service, and biotechnology stocks are also adding to recent gains amid optimism they will benefit in the new Trump administration. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are posting steep losses on the day, weighing on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Gold stocks have also come under pressure, dragging the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index down by 5.5 percent. The weakness in the sector comes as the price of gold for December delivery is sliding $10.70 to $1,262.80 an ounce. Significant weakness is also visible among utilities stocks, which have fallen sharply along with treasuries following Trump's upset victory. Semiconductor, internet, and software stocks have also shown notable declines, reflecting overall weakness in the tech sector. On the U.S. economic front, the Labor Department released a report before the start of trading showing a bigger than expected drop in initial jobless claims in the week ended November 5th. The report said initial jobless claims fell to 254,000, a decrease of 11,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 265,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 263,000. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw substantial strength during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index soared by 6.7 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped by 1.9 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets moved to the downside over the course of the session. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index slumped by 1.2 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index dipped by 0.3 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries have climbed off their worst levels but continue to see modest weakness. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 1 basis point at 2.082 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business More Top Stories Fiat Chrysler Recalls Cars For Wiper, Fuel Leak Issues Stocks Move Modestly Lower Amid Quiet Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Dupont Will No Longer Contribute To Pensions Fitch Warns On Trump Trade Policies Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Taps Sessions As AG, Pompeo As CIA Director, Flynn As Security Advisor Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary U.S. Leading Economic Index Inches Higher For Second Straight Month Sen Sessions To Be Attorney General, Gen Flynn Touted As NSA: Reports CFO Shake-up For Actuant Ohio Congressman Challenges Nancy Pelosi For House Dem Leader Japanese Prime Minister Abe Says He Has Great Confidence In Trump Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Reportedly Picks Sen.

However, it would seem Trump's interest in Dimon fails to take into account the fact that Dimon has no interest in the role: One of the two sources told CNBC that Dimon "said he would not be interested," and Dimon himself has "suggested repeatedly" that he "would not be interested in becoming Treasury secretary." It's not yet apparent who else might be up for the job of Treasury secretary, though former Goldman Sachs official Steven Mnuchin is reportedly a top contender. CNBC was unable to immediately reach a Trump spokesperson for comment. Becca Stanek   Trump is reportedly considering JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon for Treasury secretary November 10, 2016 there's more to life than turkey Edit Here are the most popular Thanksgiving side dishes in every region of America 12:49 p.m. ET   Thanksgiving turkeys are fairly universal in America, but favorite side dishes vary a lot by region, FiveThirtyEight poll results reveal. The Northeast and Midwest opt for vegetables — squash and green beans, respectively — while the Southeast, the Great Lakes area, and Texas and its neighbors reach for various carbs. The West Coast is the big outlier, picking salad. Yes, salad. (FiveThirtyEight) Dessert preferences also vary by region. Everyone eats pumpkin pie, but you're more likely to find apple pie on the East Coast, cherry in the West and Midwest, and pecan and sweet potato in southern climes. Bonnie Kristian   Here are the most popular Thanksgiving side dishes in every region of America 12:49 p.m. Quotables Edit Priebus: 'I'm not going to rule out anything, but we're not going to have a registry based on a religion' 12:21 p.m. ET   Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus addressed in an interview Sunday confusion over whether President-elect Donald Trump is serious about creating a national registry of Muslims (or perhaps just Muslim immigrants) as he proposed on the campaign trail. "Look, I'm not going to rule out anything, but we're not going to have a registry based on a religion," Priebus said while speaking with NBC's Chuck Todd. He continued: "But what I think what we're trying to do is say that there are some people — certainly not all people — but there are some people that are radicalized. And there are some people that have to be prevented from coming into this country. And Donald Trump's position, President Trump's position, is consistent with bills in the House and the Senate that say the following: If you want to come from a place or an area around the world that harbors and trains terrorists, we have to temporarily suspend that operation until a better vetting system is put in place." [Priebus, via NBC] Watch Priebus' full comments below. Bonnie Kristian   Priebus: 'I'm not going to rule out anything, but we're not going to have a registry based on a religion' 12:21 p.m. This just in Edit German Chancellor Angela Merkel to pursue 4th term 12:01 p.m. ET   Carsten Koall/Getty Images German Chancellor Angela Merkel will formally announce on Sunday her decision to run for a fourth term in office. She indicated her intentions at a smaller meeting of leaders from her conservative party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Merkel, 62, has governed Germany since 2005 and remains popular despite gains by the populist Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) party in recent elections. Some 55 percent of Germans currently say they will vote for her. Germany has awaited for weeks Merkel's decision on whether to run, and the affirmative announcement will be received as a positive source of stability in Brexit-era Europe. Merkel represents "reliability in turbulent times because she holds society together and stands up to over-simplification," said the CDU's Julia Kloeckner. "She stands for moderation and centrism instead of cheap headlines." Bonnie Kristian   German Chancellor Angela Merkel to pursue 4th term 12:01 p.m. Trump Transition Edit Trump says Gen. James 'Mad Dog' Mattis is a 'very impressive' option for defense secretary 11:45 a.m. ET   President-elect Donald Trump indicated on Twitter Sunday morning that retired Marine Gen. James Mattis is a leading option for the Defense Department. Referencing this weekend's array of meetings with possible Cabinet nominees, Trump called Mattis "very impressive." General James "Mad Dog" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 With 44 years of service in the Marine Corps, Mattis was a combat commander in Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was praised for his role in Battle of Falluja. He generated controversy in 2005 by remarking, "It's fun to shoot some people," like those who abuse women in Afghanistan; and he considers Iran "the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East." For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress would have to waive a rule requiring seven years between an officer's retirement and acceptance of a civilian role; Mattis retired in 2013. The Week Staff   Trump says Gen. James 'Mad Dog' Mattis is a 'very impressive' option for defense secretary 11:45 a.m. live from new york Edit SNL critiques vacuous TV news shows with a clever Westworld twist 11:23 a.m. ET   NBC/Screenshot Saturday Night Live skewered vacuous TV news shows with a clever parody of HBO's epic robot drama Westworld. The skit begins normally enough on the set of Anderson Cooper 360, where Cooper and a variety of talking heads settle into a too-familiar routine. As Cooper announces a breaking news item about President-elect Donald Trump, his panelists weigh in: "Okay, you know what? This is not normal." "This is crazy!" "This isn't like [some other Trump scandal]." "This is when we in the media have to draw the line!" "Mmkay, can we just remember that most Americans voted for Trump?" "Actually, they didn't, Kayleigh!" The first time around, the answers come off as a standard SNL critique of cable news. But as Cooper shares each new story the analysis takes a repetitive turn. Watch the whole sketch below. Bonnie Kristian   SNL critiques vacuous TV news shows with a clever Westworld twist 11:23 a.m. chemical weapons Edit Aleppo bombardment included suspected chlorine gas attack 10:54 a.m. ET   George Ourfalian/Getty Images A new round of Russian and Syrian airstrikes this week that closed all hospitals, killed nearly 300 people, and injured almost 1,000 more in the besieged, rebel-held area of eastern Aleppo, Syria, is believed to have included a chlorine gas attack. The chemical weapon, dropped in a barrel bomb by a helicopter, is responsible for the death of a family of six, the Aleppo Media Center activist group reported. CNN was not able to independently verify the report, but a United Nations investigation in August found the Syrian government twice used chlorine gas as a weapon while Islamic State militants used mustard gas at least once. The United States condemned "in the strongest terms these horrific attacks" in a statement Saturday, and on Sunday, the Syrian government rejected a UN proposal for an Aleppo truce. Bonnie Kristian   Aleppo bombardment included suspected chlorine gas attack 10:54 a.m. hamiltongate Edit Pence says he wasn't offended by Hamilton message or boos: 'That's what freedom sounds like' 10:47 a.m. ET   Vice President-elect Mike Pence declined Sunday to join President-elect Donald Trump in his demand for an apology from the cast of the Broadway musical Hamilton, whose audience booed and cast admonished Vice President-elect Mike Pence when he attended a performance Friday night. "I wasn't offended by what was said," Pence told Fox News host Chris Wallace, calling the show "an incredible production" and "a real joy." As for the boos, he added, "that's what freedom sounds like." Pence went on to acknowledge the disappointment and anger of those who did not vote for his ticket, vowing the Trump administration will work for all Americans. Watch his full comments below. Bonnie Kristian Pence on being booed at Hamilton: "that's what freedom sounds like". That's the appropriate response. https://t.co/H0xN0cNqD1 — Tony Sinkewich (@bigTsink) November 20, 2016   Pence says he wasn't offended by Hamilton message or boos: 'That's what freedom sounds like' 10:47 a.m. See More Speed Reads More about The Week Subscribe Subscriber login Give a gift Back issues Classroom subscriptions Newsletters RSS Privacy policy Terms & conditions The Week UK Customer service Contact us Get 4 Risk-Free issues of The Week TRY IT OUT Subscribe Subscriber login Give a gift Back issues Classroom subscriptions Newsletters RSS Privacy policy Terms & conditions The Week UK Customer service Contact us Ad info

A Trump spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment, and a spokesman for Dimon declined to elaborate beyond his past remarks that he would not be interested. It was unclear who within Trump's circle of advisors raised the idea or who else might be under consideration for treasury secretary. Trump campaign finance chief Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs official, is reportedly considered to be the front runner. Dimon has suggested repeatedly, including in an interview at the Economic Club of Washington in September, that he would not be interested in becoming treasury secretary.

 The price of everything in America may be about to go up Bob Bryan Nov. 10, 2016, 9:54 AM 44,936 facebook linkedin twitter email print President-elect Donald Trump. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Wall Street analysts are trying to figure out just what the economy will look like under a President Donald Trump. And though many questions are still unanswered, they are nearly unanimous on one thing: Trump's policies will most likely bring about a significant uptick in inflation. In other words, the prices of everything in America may be about to increase because of heavy spending by the government on infrastructure, for example, and restrictions on trade and immigration. It was one of the dominant trades on Wall Street after Trump's surprise victory. Specifically, there was a "broad-based rise in inflation swaps" on Wednesday, according to Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at JPMorgan. A macro salesman put it more simply when asked what he was seeing early Wednesday: a "massive bid for inflation." "Donald Trump's platform has an inflationary bias: His fiscal policy is likely to be expansionary, and he leans toward protectionism, which is inflationary due to the effects of tariffs and curtailed immigration," Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS, wrote in a note to clients. Let's break that down in to its two constituent parts: increased government spending and trade barriers. Fiscal stimulus In the lead-up to the election, Trump's campaign laid out a plan for $1 trillion in public and private investment in infrastructure that would generate revenue through things such as toll roads and airports. According to analysts, the combination of a tight labor market and increased money supply in the economy would put pressure on prices. The US is already operating at near full employment, and Trump's commitment to tighten the borders and deport immigrants could potentially reduce the labor force further. "US fiscal stimulus (which is not currently built into our US or global outlook) would boost global demand," Kasman wrote. "With most of the benefits of this stimulus accruing to a US economy operating close to full employment, it would likely increase US and global inflation." Essentially, with wage pressures already rising in the economy — higher wages are thought to lead to businesses increasing prices — increased hiring for these projects would lead to broader price increases. Increase of trade barriers One of the key focuses in Trump's speech outlining his first 100 days was changing the way America trades with the rest of the world by "renegotiating" deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Analysts believe that these changes would most likely be protectionist and lead to inflation. Increasing trade barriers could include tariffs — taxes for importing or exporting goods — making it more expensive to import parts for goods. "Restrictive trade policies slow activity and boost inflation in early 2017 as a marked shift in public policy alters the landscape in a way that reduces the intensity of tradable activity while encouraging domestic production and consumption," said Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Barclays. Now President-elect Donald Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. REUTERS/Henry Romero As noted by the anonymous finance blogger Macro Man, the personal consumption expenditures price index for durable goods (anything that lasts more than two years, like cars or computers) peaked right before the passage of NAFTA and has been declining ever since. Thus a more protectionist trade agreement could lead to higher prices for those types of items. "Altering trade deals to get a 'better deal' for America is likely to increase inflation via reduced supply," wrote Kevin Gaynor and Sam Bonney, strategists at Nomura. "Reducing the labor force is aimed at increasing wages. Onshoring is aimed at increasing jobs and, presumably, real wages along with corporate costs." As with many of Trump's campaign promises, however, it's unclear the extent to which they would be carried out. "One thesis is immediate tariffs are a negative supply-side shock, lifting inflation and undermining growth," said Alan Ruskin at Deutsche Bank. "The open question is how far Trump embarks down this path, or whether he opens the door to pragmatic renegotiation of trade agreements that again has some parallels with the UK, albeit the US will be negotiating from a position of strength." Impact on the Fed The increased inflation pressures will have a widespread effect on consumers, businesses, and the Federal Reserve. For the Fed, it appears that the long-awaited inflation may lead it to increase its rate of interest rate hikes. "I would expect there to be more fiscal spending in the future that will accelerate any potential inflation in the system," Jerry Haworth, CEO of the London-based hedge fund 36 South Capital Advisors, told Business Insider's Ben Moshinsky. "The quicker inflation returns, the quicker interest rates may go up." Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen. AP/Evan Vucci The increase of interest rate hikes, however, could work one of two ways. On the one hand, inflation has been running well below the Fed's desired 2% target for years, so some inflation could help to reach its policy goals. Stable inflationary increases would allow the Fed to raise interest rates to a level that is more in line with the long-term norm, giving it room to drop rates when the next recession comes. On the other hand, inflation has naturally progressed at a rate closer to the 2% target, with core PCE slightly above 1.7% at its most recent reading, which is well above its 1.3% mark in December. Thus highly inflationary policies coupled with already progressing inflation could lead to a surge in price increases. This would put the Fed behind the curve — and, in the worst case, force it into a furious series of rate hikes from its current historically low rate, in turn dampening economic activity. Impact on businesses As with the Fed, there are two ways this could play out for the largest businesses in America. In the positive scenario, increased pricing power allows companies to pass along higher wages and input prices to consumers, maintaining margins and continuing strength in the corporate sector. In the negative scenario, the increased tariffs make life more expensive for companies and wages do not keep track with the rising costs, crushing margins. Additionally, those companies that do business outside of the country — roughly 33% of revenues for the S&P 500 come from overseas — could take a hit if the Fed raises rates, as a stronger dollar would hurt the value of revenue generated overseas. Impact on consumers As companies look to American workers to replace immigrants, and new fiscal stimulus jobs require more workers in an already tight labor market, wage pressures would likely increase. On the other hand, Trump's trade plans would also make purchasing goods more expensive, especially those shipped from overseas. Things like iPhones, cars, and even foods that are sourced from outside the US would become more expensive with higher tariffs. It's not all certain A few caveats here. For one, it is unknown how many of these promises Trump will actually keep. Even in his deficit hawks within his own party may not agree with the idea of large-scale fiscal stimulus. During President Barack Obama's term, many Republicans were against a stimulus package that was smaller than Trump's proposed one and that came in the depths of a recession, when stimulus is thought to be most effective. Additionally, Trump has laid out broad policy proposals but not finer details — especially on trade — so the exact nature of the president-elect's plan is unclear. As with many things over the coming months, we'll just have to wait and see.

He was pretty much working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when we met him. (Certainly a less elitist backstory to the accurate one: namely, that he was a private-school-educated City commodities trader.) But now, like some on-the-make media prick who always looks over your shoulder in case someone better comes along, Nigel has caught Donald Trump’s eye and walked off mid-conversation with us. As Alan Partridge almost said: “Don! Don! Don! Don! Don! Don! Don! DON!” In fact, it’s starting to feel like Nigel freeing us from the EU will turn out to be a classic early-21st-century “liberation” operation. There hasn’t been a “here’s your sovereignty – see ya!” like it since 2004, when coalition governor Paul Bremer handed over to the Iraqis, and promptly floored it to the airport. Nigel, aren’t you staying for the Brexit party? I think it’s going to get really lively! But Nigel has gone off to America, where he is rampant. Mr Big Stuff – who do you think you are? Let Nigel tell you who he thinks he is. “I’m the catalyst for the downfall of the Blairites, the Clintonites, the Bushites, and all these dreadful people who work hand in glove with Goldman Sachs and everybody else, who have made themselves rich, and ruined our countries,” Farage explained in a radio interview this week, about 10 minutes before JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon was touted as Trump’s Treasury pick. The 'special relationship' - in pictures Read more Anyway, Nigel can’t wait to tell you how yuge he is now. A man who failed to get elected to our parliament seven times is referring to the two-term president of the United States as “that Obama creature”. Sources are briefing he will be the go-between for Trump and Theresa May, though Number 10 denies a role. “If [Trump] did offer me a job,” Farage has said, “I would quite like to be his ambassador to the European Union.” And if none of these plays comes off, he can always link himself with a big-money move to LA Galaxy. In the meantime, he is styling himself as the Maggie to Donald’s Ronnie, even though you just know Trump is eventually going to do something far more humiliating to him than just invade Grenada without telling him. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nigel Farage: ‘I’ll tell Donald Trump not to touch Theresa May’ – audio Until then, Nigel is all dressed up and doing the town. Consider the advice he said he’d give Trump about meeting Theresa May: “Don’t touch her, for God’s sake!” Remember, girls: even when you’re the prime minister you haven’t escaped guys joking about you being sexually assaulted. You’ve dropped your trade briefing papers on the floor, Mrs May. While you’re down there … “If it comes to it,” Nigel went on, “I could be there as the responsible adult role, to make sure everything’s OK.” Wow. When Nigel said “I want my life back”, I’d assumed he meant spending sullen time with his family, not acting as the cockblock intern for the leader of the free pussy-grabbers. For all its comic grotesquery, of course, the Farage/Trump dynamic is an old tale: British politicians getting a massive hard-on for American ones. People derided Tony Blair as George W Bush’s poodle, and Nigel’s version of lapdogging is just a different take. Farage could literally curl up on Trump’s lap to stop him assaulting female premiers. If they widened his frottage-combating duties it could be a fulltime job – Trump will be in the presence of many females a day, and you have to remember he is a man whose sole, frequently stated reason for not coming on to his own daughter is the fact they’re related. So Farage could be kept in the Oval Office as an anti-grope Jeeves. And he’d be grateful. This week I saw a hilarious clip of Trump beckoning Farage out of a crowd – a bit like Courteney Cox in the Dancing in the Dark video – and Farage telling him obsequiously he was “handing over the mantle”. Aw, the look on his little face just for being noticed! It was like a wildlife documentary, where some weaker male in the pack defers to the alpha. Donald has had the sex Nigel only wishes he’d had. Still, if Nigel can’t have had it, he’s going to stand as near to someone who has as he’s allowed. Everything seems bigger in America – even bits of Nigel Farage. Like Trump, Nigel’s the sort of champion of ordinary people who looks like he’d privately scream for the sanitiser the minute he’d finished having to shake their hands. Tabloid editors used to have a nasty phrase for this shudder-inducing contact: “meet the readers”. It is possible Farage will be the most successful British politician in 30 years as well as a man of very small stature I detect the exact same discomfort in men such as Nigel and Donald. During the last general election campaign, I waited for hours in a Grimsby pub with Nigel’s supporters and canvassers for him to honour his planned appearance. But he blew them out to go and have lunch with reality star Joey Essex, who he’d already spent half the morning with. They were so disappointed, and I felt for them. The point of vignettes like this is to illustrate a simple truth: it is entirely possible for Nigel Farage to be the most successful British politician of the last 30 years as well as a man of very small stature. What that tells you about the state we’re in is up to you – I certainly wouldn’t wish to take Farage’s huge achievement from him. But once I’d watched him stand up his own crestfallen footsoldiers like that for some reality TV idiot (Essex, not Trump), I knew he was capable of standing them up in far bigger ways. Of course, he wasn’t my dog in the fight, and as a liberal-metropolitan-elite-whatever I don’t need him like his supporters really, really do. So I now have the luxury of being able to enjoy the show as Nigel attempts to have a second act with an American life. Character is destiny, and I can’t help suspecting that a Nigel Farage this unbound is going to make a fascinating mistake. It may not feel quite as fascinating to those he promised to help – but that’s showbiz, guys. What else did you think this was?

Ogg November 11, 2016 8:45 am EST Print Email Tweet The stock market was indicated to open a bit soft on Friday, but this is after two major reversal days after the Trump victory and the Dow hitting new all-time highs. Friday has equity market participation, but the bond market and banks are closed for Veterans Day. Investors have to act fast since the election, if they wanted to win off the stocks that benefit from Trump and they have seen that the stocks that would win under Clinton have been slaughtered. Even if investors are not that nimble and may have not yet acted, they are still likely looking for new ideas in a market where valuations are high and when interest rates are likely to rise. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and others cover stocks to sell or avoid. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Friday morning: Archer Daniels Midland Co. (NYSE: ADM) was downgraded to Underweight from an already cautious Neutral rating and the price target was cut to $36 from $42 (versus $45.18 close) at JPMorgan. ADM shares were indicated down 1% at $44.69 on Friday, with a consensus analyst target price of $45.80 and a 52-week range of $29.86 to $47.88. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Genworth Financial Inc. (NYSE: GNW) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Compass Point. Shares closed up 0.7% at $4.00 on Thursday and were indicated up 2% at $4.09 on Friday. Its consensus analyst price target was $4.75 and its 52-week trading range is $1.57 to $5.27. NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) was down 3% at $67.77 on Thursday ahead of earnings but was last seen up 13% at $76.65 on Friday’s early indications. Jefferies reiterated its Buy rating and raised its price target to $95 from $80, and it called the stock still its top pick with $5 in earnings per share power ahead. Barclays raised its rating to Equal Weight from Underweight as this growth story has kept getting away from the firm. Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) was up 0.3% at $94.96 ahead of earnings, and a slower departure of ESPN customers on earnings had shares indicated up 2% at $96.99 on Friday morning. Merrill Lynch reiterated its Buy rating and $125 price objective. Barclays raised its rating from Underweight to Equal Weight with an $89 price target, and Pivotal Research has downgraded it to Hold from Buy. SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ: SPWR) was downgraded to Neutral from Buy and the price target was slashed to $7 from $13 at UBS. The stock closed at $6.32 on Thursday, but this was a $7.35 stock before the unexpected Trump upset over Clinton. While these stocks have continued to move after the post-election rally, 24/7 Wall St. identified 11 of the top winners from the Trump victory and nine of the top losers from Clinton’s loss.

The company did not list any pricing information about the offering, but the sheer number of underwriters, as well as the company’s holdings, suggest that the offering will be huge. The company intends to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ATH. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, BMO Capital Markets, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital Markets, BNP Paribas, BTIG, Evercore ISI, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, UBS Investment Bank, Apollo Global Securities, Dowling & Partners, Keefe Bruyette & Woods, Lazard, Raymond James, Rothschild, Sandler O’Neil and Williams Capital Group. This leading retirement services company issues, reinsures and acquires retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. It generates attractive financial results for policyholders and shareholders by combining the two core competencies of (1) sourcing long-term, generally illiquid liabilities and (2) investing in a high-quality investment portfolio, which takes advantage of the illiquid nature of its liabilities. The company’s steady and significant base of earnings generates capital that it opportunistically invests across its business to source attractively priced liabilities and capitalize on opportunities. Athene’s differentiated investment strategy benefits from its strategic relationship with Apollo Global Management and its indirect subsidiary, Athene Asset Management (AAM). AAM provides a full suite of services for the investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisition asset diligence, and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. Athene’s relationship with Apollo and AAM also provides it with access to Apollo’s investment professionals across the world, as well as Apollo’s global asset management infrastructure that, as of June 30, 2016, supported more than $186 billion of assets under management across a broad array of asset classes. As of the end of June, the company had grown to $68.9 billion in investments, including related parties, $69.9 billion in invested assets and $84.3 billion of total assets. In the filing the company said: Our organic channels have provided deposits of $4.0 billion and $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3.9 billion, $2.9 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Withdrawals on our deferred annuities were $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $4.4 billion, $4.4 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Athene intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.

Frey, as chairwoman of the Frey Foundation board. She is the granddaughter of Edward and Frances Frey, the foundation's founders, whose portraits hang in the lobby of the foundation's offices at 40 Pearl Street NW.Jim Harger | Mlive Media Group  GRAND RAPIDS, MI – The Frey Foundation, which has poured millions into projects throughout western and northern Michigan, announced it has passed the leadership torch to the third generation. Mary Frey Bennett, the 44-year-old granddaughter of the foundation's founders, Edward and Frances Frey, was elected chairwoman of the foundation, replacing her uncle, David G. Frey. With total assets of about $150 million, the Frey Foundation was established in 1974. Edward Frey was the founder of Union Bank, now part of JPMorgan Chase Bank and Foremost Insurance Co., now part of Farmers Insurance Group. "Our foundation encourages officers to relinquish their titles around their 75th birthday," said David Frey, who assumed the chairmanship when his brother, John, retired in 2014. Frey said he and his siblings will remain on the foundation's board as trustees. Third generation trustee Eleonora Frey Zagel, who serves as director of the Family Business Alliance and resides in East Grand Rapids, was elected vice-chair. Trustee Edward J. Frey, Jr. was re-elected treasurer of the board, and third generation trustee Sara Frey Rose, of Harbor Springs, was elected secretary. Bennett, who lives in Gainesville, Fla., has been a board member 2012. Born in Grand Rapids, she graduated from Interlochen Arts Academy and Kalamazoo College, and earned a master's degree in non-profit management. She has worked in the field of philanthropy for two decades. In recent years, the Frey Foundation has been the lead donor behind the development of Rosa Parks Circle, the downtown park that was commissioned and designed by Maya Lin, the artist who gained fame for her design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The Frey Foundation has been active in many other West Michigan philanthropic projects, often working with sponsors whose name appears on the side of the buildings. Those co-sponsorships have allowed the foundation to leverage projects in spite of its mid-sized status, Frey said. David Frey was a founding member of Grand Action, the group that raised the funding for the Van Andel Arena, the DeVos Place Convention Center, the Meijer Theater and the Downtown Market. "These projects have had a tremendous catalytic effect," he said, adding the foundation also is participating in the funding for Grand Rapids Whitewater, the campaign aimed at restoring the rapids to the Grand River in the downtown area. The Frey Foundation also has endowed the Edward J. Frey dean's chair at the University of Michigan's Stephen Ross School of Business. "Our legacy is measured by our game-changing grants, the outcomes that have benefitted residents in the communities we serve, and the synergy of our partnerships with other foundations," David Frey said. "This election of new officers is another significant step in the long legacy of the Frey Foundation," said Steven M. Wilson, president of the organization in a statement. "These officers have served on the board of the Frey Foundation for the better part of a decade, learning together, leading together, and working together across generational lines in support of communities throughout our grantmaking region.

Few protections for Delawareans online Jeff Mordock , The News Journal 6:57 p.m. EST November 11, 2016 CLOSE Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Tech columnist Kim Komando shares tips on how to create a strong password, and remember it. Experts say few online protections are available to Delawareans. (Photo: Getty Images) When it comes to cybersecurity, no one is safe. Not individuals, not large corporations, not the government. Hackers have proven that they can find a way into virtually any system. Once they breach the defenses, their acts often have long-lasting consequences. And some of us are unwittingly opening ourselves up for attack. Connecting the camera in a smart refrigerator to a mobile device is a convenient way to ensure you don't forget milk or eggs at the grocery store. But hackers can access that same camera to look inside the refrigerator, too. They learn when a homeowner is on vacation because expired milk still sits on a shelf, or the fridge hasn't been restocked in a while, making the home a target for robbers. It's not just smart refrigerators that are vulnerable. An increasing number of household appliances – including thermostats, DVRs, baby monitors, home security systems, electric meters and even toasters – are equipped with connectivity that makes life easier, but also exposes its owners to wide-ranging security risks. In two widely reported incidents in 2015, baby monitors were hacked in Kansas and Washington state. Parents in the Washington case were using a camera to watch their son when they heard voices in their child’s room and assumed those voices came from outside the home. It wasn’t until the mother heard a voice from the monitor say, “She’s coming in again” – and noticed the camera move in her direction – that she realized the device had been hacked. In the Kansas case, a mother told police her son’s baby camera followed her movements around the room. Digital devices designed to make our lives more convenient are vulnerable to hackers because they collect huge amounts of data. And that provides a pathway for unscrupulous players to spy on unwitting device owners – and sell consumer shopping data on the black market, which can result in email accounts flooded with dangerous malware. Perhaps most alarming was an attack last month on Dyn DNS, a Manchester, New Hampshire, company that acts an Internet switchboard. Saboteurs were able to transform everyday items such as baby monitors, smart televisions and toasters into online weapons. Hundreds of thousands of these devices were infected with malware designed to flood Dyn DNS with thousands of messages at the same time, knocking out popular websites across the internet. Within minutes, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix and Spotify were all offline. The attacks came in waves. Dyn DNS resolved the first attack by 9:30 a.m., but a second attack was launched around noon and a third breach was reported by the company just before 4:30 p.m. It was around 6:30 p.m. before the company declared the incident over. High-profile attacks, including the recent hacking of the Democratic National Committee's emails, are frequently occurring. And it's not just homeowners that could be victims but local and national groups and corporations. Delaware is home to more than 2,000 financial services companies including some of the largest banking and insurance companies in the world, and some wonder how vulnerable we are. "We are not safe at all," said Adam Levin, a former director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs and author of an upcoming book on internet security. "Breaches have become the third certainty after death and taxes." Banks and insurance companies store tons of personal information, including account numbers for Social Security, credit cards and birth dates. In the past few years, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York all reported some kind of cyberattack. The schemes varied. In the New York Federal Reserve Bank attack, unidentified hackers pretended to be a legitimate organization and sent fake messages directing the bank to wire almost a $1 billion into a bank account they controlled. Hackers, walked away with $81 million before authorities caught on. Another popular threat is ransomware.

Anthem, one of the country's largest health insurers, exposed the data of as many as 80 million customers in a March 2015 hack. Joshua Marpet, who teaches Ethical Hacking and Digital Forensics at Wilmington University, said health care data may be more valuable than financial information. "Hackers can sell your information to someone who doesn't have health insurance, and they can get their broken arm X-rayed, treated and they can leave the hospital happy," he said. "And you can't even get the records because they are still patient-protected by HIPPA laws. It's almost a flawless crime." Identity theft has become so common that if someone is not a victim themselves, they likely know someone who is. Naomi Katz of Wilmington said she called her bank immediately after strange charges in Florida began showing up on her account. She became alarmed after noticing charges against her account ranging from $10 to $15. "They were smart about it because they took out small amounts until they could no longer get away with it," she said. Katz said all of the money was returned to her, but it was a hassle canceling the credit cards. Yet the hack has made her diligent about checking her account more frequently. "I pay attention to my finances," she said. "I go through my accounts and look for things." Lynette Crawford, also a Wilmington resident, said she had not been the victim of identity theft, but she watched a close friend panic after being hacked. Two mysterious charges – one for $100 at a Victoria's Secret store and a $30 gas purchase, both in Miami – appeared on her friend's credit card bill. "The only thing that saved her is that she was able to prove that she was in Delaware, not Miami, at the time of the transactions," Crawford said. "They did return the money." Crawford said she doesn't worry about identify theft and is confident her bank will refund any purchases she didn't make. However, she still checks credit card and financial statements on a regular basis to ensure her identity is safe. 'Internet of things' at risk The average North American home has 13 separate devices connected to the internet, according to a June report from British-based data tracker, IHS Markit. That includes smartphones, tablets, laptops, gaming consoles, televisions, smart appliances and more. In fact, laptop and desktop personal computers account for less than 25 percent of household internet traffic. The explosive use of digital devices has led to the so-called "internet of things" – tech speak for common household objects with connectivity. And their use is growing faster than the ability to defend it. "There is no secure world," said Raymond Holcomb, homeland security adviser for the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security. "That is a fallacy." A 2014 report by Proofpoint Inc., a Sunnyvale, California, internet security provider, found that more than 100,000 everyday gadgets, including smart televisions, network routers and refrigerators had been compromised to send out more than 750,000 malicious spam emails. In August, two executives of the British-based security firm Pen Test Partners demonstrated the ease in which a hacker could attack a smart thermostat and raise or lower the temperature until a homeowner paid a ransom. "Everyone has antivirus software on their computer, but does anyone run antivirus software on their toaster?" Marpet said. Some of the smart devices rolling off the assembly line come with default passwords that are fairly common. Some companies even uploaded "password" as the default password, making the system even easier for hackers to access. Consumers can adopt some protections, but those measures often reduce the product's effectiveness. Marpet said homeowners can segment their devices away from the internet. The devices can still communicate with each other, but not the internet. "The problem is these devices are most effective when they are on the internet," he said. "How can I see what's in my fridge if I can't access the camera?" Infrastructure attacks  Appliances aren't the only concern, however. Experts say infrastructure in the United States – gas lines, water systems, traffic lights, communications networks – are vulnerable to a cyberattack. While both state and federal officials are working to defend the systems we rely upon every day, resources are limited. "If a cyberwar hasn't quietly already started, the Dyn attack was a shot across the bow from somewhere," said Holcomb, who was a victim of the 2015 data breach of the U.S. Office of Management and Personnel where 18 million government employees' personal information was stolen. Buy Photo Lewis Schiliro, former director of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security.  (Photo: SUCHAT PEDERSON/THE NEWS JOURNAL) "Once a cyberwar begins, we are going to have some problems," Holcomb continued. "There are several nation states that have the ability to shut everything down." Lewis Schiliro, former director of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security, agreed with Holcomb. "Our infrastructure is the vulnerability we worry about," said Schiliro, who launched Wilmington-based Barrister Global Solutions earlier this year to tackle data breach threats. "It is the biggest national threat we have." Experts disagree on the value of Delaware as a target for sabotage. The number of credit card and financial services companies based in Wilmington would be attractive for someone looking to disrupt the nation's banking industry, some argue. "Bad guys go where the loot is," said John D'Arcy, a professor of information technology risk management and computer ethics at the University of Delaware. "Credit card data is a prime target and that makes Delaware a prime target." But others say the banks with Delaware locations do a good job of ensuring their information is well protected. Representatives from banks with significant Delaware operations – including Capital One, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase – declined to be interviewed for this story. "The banks are ahead of the government facilities because they apply so many resources to internal cybersecurity," Holcomb said. "They exchange information with each other on threats." Marpet called Wilmington a "juicy target" for hackers, but noted that internet crime is not geographically motivated and that other targets, such as hospitals and health care providers, could yield greater information. "The entire United States is flush with juicy targets," he said. "I'd rather go after health or life insurance companies because they have Social Security numbers, date of births and everything else." Holcomb said Delaware is working hard to defend against cybersecurity attacks. He did not provide specifics, citing security protocols. Last year, Gov. Jack Markell reactivated the Cybersecurity Advisory Council to share information on risks and practices to keep the state safe. The council works closely with the state's National Guard and Department of Technology and Information. Schiliro added that Delaware works very closely with the federal government and neighboring states. "The coordination between the states and federal institutions is getting a lot of better, and we are able to take advantage of the resources out there," he said. How to protect yourself  There is no perfect method to protecting your online data, experts said. "The world we live in is moving more towards monitoring and damage control because the clock is way past midnight on prevention," Levin said. But a few common sense rules can go a long way. A strong password made up of more than just different symbols and characters, but perhaps a phrase is a good first step. Customers should also demand businesses require a second identification question that changes on a rotating basis. Some companies, including banks and credit cards, already require the extra step of asking a customer for their dog's name or the name of the street where they grew up. "Password cracking tools can still find it, but the more combination of characters you use in a password, it becomes much more difficult to use one of these tools," D'Arcy said. CLOSE Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share We're all guilty of bringing too many gadgets along when we travel. But using local Wi-Fi and public outlets can put you at risk for cyber threats. Here's how to keep your personal information private while traveling. USA TODAY Individuals should also check their credit reports and financial accounts on a daily basis to look for strange transactions or a sudden dip in their credit rating. Of course, disclosing basic information on social media sites can make someone target. At first glance, an online personality quiz may seem harmless, but Levin said hackers are collating your answers to questions about your life to learn potential passwords. "Think of the details you disclose as a nuclear weapon," Levin said. "The individual components may seem harmless, but people are sewing all these bits of information together so they have everything when set against security protocols." The solution, according to Levin, is to lie when your second security check is established. "When it asks for your mother's maiden name, say it's Brown, when it is really Smith," he said. Marpet cautioned against discussing upcoming vacations or evenings out on Twitter or Facebook. He said social media sites that enable users to post where they are at any given moment "a really bad idea." Ordinary citizens need to think hard about what they share online – and constantly check financial, social media and other accounts to ensure that they haven't been hacked. "The bad guys are winning this battle," D'Arcy said. "They only have to be right once. Everyone else has to be right every time."
