After earning a top ranking for Java developers globally, Furlong was hired by JPMorgan Chase in December for its two-year technology training program. (Photo: DANIEL SATO/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo Getting some of the best and brightest computer programmers in the country to consider a job in Wilmington can be a challenge, at best. Even the biggest city in the nation’s second smallest state barely rates against more alluring destinations such as Boston, New York City and Silicon Valley. Throw in a few Murder Town headlines and selling young coders on the city can seem near impossible. That’s why some of the leading voices in Delaware’s burgeoning tech scene are turning to the promise of bragging rights and cash prizes. And it appears to be working. Nearly 200 programmers from around the country are expected to put their skills to the test during this weekend’s finals of the inaugural OpenBracket Delaware coding competition at the Grand. STORY: Delaware jobless rate holds for third-straight month STORY: Delaware public records gold mine: new open data portal The live problem-solving challenges devised by the Palo Alto startup HackerRank will begin Friday afternoon and continue through a Saturday evening block party on Wilmington’s Market Street. “There’s going to be two bands, a light show and just real party atmosphere,” said lead organizer Ben duPont, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. “We want this to be as cool as possible to really showcase what the city has to offer.” While the coders will be competing for a $15,000 grand prize, some of the state’s top financial institutions will be competing for them. Sponsors such as JPMorgan Chase Co., Chatham Financial and Capital One are planning to host events at restaurants along Market Street where they plan to pitch themselves to the assembled whiz kids. “We are viewing this as a prime opportunity for our technology recruiting efforts,” JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick said. “We’re not only sponsoring events that can help spotlight career opportunities at our company, but we’re also trying to showcase parts of Wilmington, such as the Lower Market area, that people might not otherwise experience.” Delaware entrepreneur and venture capitalist Ben duPont  (Photo: NEW CASTLE COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE) Events like OpenBracket Delaware are examples of Wall Street’s new tech meritocracy. Financial institutions traditionally coveted graduates from Stanford and other big-name schools along with people already working in Silicon Valley. But that system tends to overlook good programmers from anywhere else, including gifted dropouts. Banks also need to fill so many programming jobs that elite schools can’t possibly pump out enough candidates. So the industry is turning to outside firms to evaluate prospective programmers based on objective measurements, not their pedigree. The idea is that people lacking a computer science degree and still make the leap to well-paid careers in technology. Gregory Furlong, for example, spent five years working 50-hour weeks as a shipping clerk at a local Best Buy. It was a kind of employment purgatory for a computer obsessive who tinkers with motherboards in his free time. So the 30-year-old enrolled in Zip Code Wilmington, a 12-week coding boot camp co-founded by duPont. The school’s coursework incorporates HackerRank, a web platform that trains and grades people on writing computer code. After earning a top ranking for Java developers globally, Furlong was hired by JPMorgan Chase in December for its two-year technology training program. By using algorithms to spot talented coders, HackerRank and its competitors promise to suss out talent in the rough like Fulong. “This is purely about skill,” said 28-year-old Vivek Ravisankar, a HackerRank co-founder who used to work for Amazon.com. “Most really good programmers learn on their own and just continue to build their skills. Probably the really good programmers are college dropouts.” The service is part of a broader trend among U.S. corporations to bring data rigor into recruitment, instead of relying only on resumes and interviews. “Finding people through alternate channels, we weren’t doing that five years ago,” said Michael Zbranak, a managing director in JPMorgan’s global technology division. “Now we absolutely do it, because we’ve seen it work.” There are at least 500,000 technology workers at banks globally, and about 10 percent have to be replaced annually due to attrition, according to Chris Skinner, a London-based technology consultant to financial firms. JPMorgan, with more than 40,000 technology workers, hires thousands annually just to replace those who depart.

The firm announced in late 2015 it will add 1,800 Delaware jobs by 2019.  (Photo: SUCHAT PEDERSON/THE NEWS JOURNAL) HackerRank is free for coders and makes money from fees from corporate clients. Users perform challenges and watch video tutorials to sharpen their skills in specific coding languages such as Java; solving harder problems results in higher rankings. They can also join contests set up by employers with challenges related to jobs they want to fill. Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and hedge fund Two Sigma are among HackerRank clients. Finance firms aren’t the only ones who need help finding coders. Other clients include retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and medical products maker Stryker Corp. BlackRock uses HackerRank to evaluate each of the several hundred programmers hired annually to work on improvements to its critical Aladdin software, the investment and risk-management platform that handles $15 trillion in assets. “The old way of doing things is you cast a wide net, you get a bunch of resumes, you start screening through the resumes manually, and you hope the person looking at them is doing a good job,” said Sunil Dalal, chief operating officer of the Aladdin product group. “There’s a lot left to luck.” Programmers are especially ripe for merit hiring. They usually can’t show recruiters the code they created for past employers because of proprietary reasons, so in the past they’ve been judged solely by their resumes, Ravisankar said. The opaqueness of that talent market in turn created bidding wars for graduates from schools like Stanford or top tech firms, discounting coders from elsewhere, he said. Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi, a former IBM Corp. engineer, started HackerRank four years ago. Working in India, the pair struggled with two failed business plans until they landed on using algorithms to evaluate programmers’ code. In 2012, they were accepted into a Silicon Valley startup incubator, and soon clients included West Coast technology firms Twitter, Yelp and Dropbox. The firm, which has a million users globally, has raised almost $28 million in funding. HackerRanks’ competition model has certainly caught on with programmers. More than 7,000 coders applied to compete in OpenBracket’s initial online trials last month. Less than half of the prospective competitors were able to complete the intensive logic problems. But about 35 recorded a perfect score. Those programmers and about 150 others were offered stipends of $200 to $500 to attend the finals in Wilmington this weekend. “Ideally, we want these jobs to be filled with students from University of Delaware, Wilmington University and Zip Code Wilmington,” duPont said. “But it also doesn’t hurt if we can get these folks to move here and help establish Wilmington as a world-class coding and software technology hub.” Bloomberg reporters Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell contributed to this story.

How Zcash Tries to Balance Privacy, Transparency in Blockchain By Lalita Clozel October 31, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related  Enlarge This Image Banks' Privacy Concerns Shaping Blockchain Vendors' Strategies Can You Really 'Know' a Customer Who Uses Bitcoin? They Might Be Smart, But These Contracts Need to Be More Secure Restoring Privacy for Banks on the Blockchain (podcast) Wells Fargo's Gift to Late Night Eight Times Stumpf Was Hammered by Senators Who to Watch as Regulators Size Up Online Lending WASHINGTON — Zcash, the cryptocurrency that debuted last week, promises transactional privacy on an open blockchain. That could make distributed-ledger technology more appealing to financial institutions, but perhaps less so for regulators. The blockchain — the shared-ledger system pioneered in bitcoin — is often touted as a more efficient, transparent and resilient way to record transactions. A major sticking point for financial institutions, however, is that such a system gives every user access to the basic details of every transaction that has been conducted on it. "If you're JPMorgan, you can see all of Credit Suisse's books, and neither JPMorgan nor Credit Suisse is comfortable with that degree of transparency," said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the research director at Coin Center, a cryptocurrency advocacy group in Washington. With Zcash, the software developer Zooko Wilcox offers a solution to this problem. If the technology works as envisioned, it could not only make blockchains more palatable for banks but help resolve long-simmering tensions between anti-money-laundering regulations, which demand transparency, and financial privacy. What remains to be seen is how governments will view a system where transactions are auditable but disclosure is under the participants' control. Starting with the same basic framework as bitcoin, Wilcox added a recent cryptographic innovation, called the zero-knowledge proof, to the blockchain. This system allows users to conduct private transactions while maintaining the integrity of the blockchain that supports them. As in bitcoin, users are identified by pseudonymous addresses. Those alphanumeric strings alone do not guarantee privacy, since the flow of funds can be traced through the blockchain and addresses controlled by the same user can be linked. In Zcash, there are two types of addresses, "transparent" and "shielded." The transparent addresses and the amounts sent to and from them show up on the blockchain as they would in bitcoin. But if a user opts to use a shielded address, it will be obscured on the public ledger. And if both the sender and receiver of funds have opted to use shielded addresses, the amount sent will be encrypted as well. Eventually, the Zcash development team will add "view keys" that users will be able to share with third parties to reveal information about their own transactions — though not anybody else's. "We call this 'selective disclosure,' " Wilcox said in a statement to American Banker. "It also comes with an encrypted memo field, which allows institutions to safely attach sensitive data to transactions, and make that information visible to authorized parties." Otherwise, the blockchain operates normally; the ledger knows that the amount of funds in the system before and after each transaction remains the same. What a zero-knowledge proof "potentially gives you is the ability for you to prove something about a data structure without revealing the data inside the data structure," Van Valkenburgh said. For banks intrigued by blockchains but leery of volatile, decentralized digital currencies, Wilcox's company, Zcash Electric Coin Co., is developing enterprise software that would add an encryption layer to a private shared ledger. It's called ZSL, for Zcash Security Layer — Wilcox has likened it to Secure Sockets Layer, the encryption technology developed in the mid-1990s that made communications on the web safe for online banking. "With encryption, you can actually get many or most of the properties of transparency and privacy and data security at the same time," Wilcox said in July at American Banker's Blockchains + Digital Currencies conference in New York. "You can add encrypted data to a blockchain in such a way that's decryptable to authorized parties but not to the world." Yet it retains important properties of the blockchain — "you can't give different stories to different people and you can't change your story later," Wilcox said. After pausing work on ZSL to make sure the cryptocurrency was released on time and securely, the firm is now tending to both projects simultaneously. "Our code is getting a trial by fire on the wild and woolly Internet," Wilcox said by email Monday. An obvious question is whether the Zcash currency's privacy features will make it more difficult for the financial institutions involved — such as digital currency exchanges and wallet services, or their banking providers — to comply with anti-money-laundering regulations. On the one hand, Zcash's "selective disclosure" capabilities, combined with the pressure on intermediaries to comply with AML rules, would ensure that most transactions are traceable. The work of collecting basic transactional data for AML purposes would likely be performed by third parties like wallets and exchanges. To comply with rules for money-services businesses, or simply by virtue of needing to satisfy their bank partners, these companies would have to obtain data on the parties in each transaction and other information to ensure that they can flag suspicious transactions. "All of that same compliance infrastructure still needs to be in place," said Pratin Vallabhaneni, an associate at the law firm of Arnold & Porter. "If you're a user of Zcash thinking, 'Oh, I'm going to have a more anonymous transaction,'" he added, "that's not correct because you won't be able to enter into the [rest of the financial] ecosystem" without disclosing basic identifying information. « 1  |  2 »     view entire article Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION Comment SEE MORE IN Law & Regulation RELATED TAGS Bank Technology, Comments (0) Be the first to comment on this post using the section below.

(PRWEB) October 31, 2016 On November 1, 2016, at the Liberty House Restaurant in Jersey City, New Jersey at 6:00 p.m., Rising Tide Capital will honor longtime corporate partner, JPMorgan Chase as a “Champion of Inclusive Economies,” alongside inventor Joy Mangano–whose story was featured in the Oscar-nominated film “Joy,” and The Blackstone Foundation at the 5th annual Start Something Champions Gala. This gala marks the culmination of The Start Something Challenge (SSC), New Jersey’s largest business pitch competition, which JPMorgan Chase has supported since its inception. Over the past 5 years, nearly 400 entrepreneurs from 100 towns and cities across New Jersey have entered the competition, which has invested approximately $125,000 in grants to its winners’ businesses. At the gala, the winners of this year’s SSC will be recognized and receive $25,000 in grants and prizes. “At JPMorgan Chase, we are committed to addressing complex social challenges in the communities where we live and work,” said Richard Fonte, New Jersey Market Manager for Business Banking at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase’s support of Rising Tide Capital isn’t limited to the Start Something Challenge. They have also funded the organization’s Business Acceleration Services, a suite of business support services that include business coaching, micro and small business loan assistance, and access to a variety of business resources including business incubators, legal services and a network of reliable and vetted small business professionals. Added JPMorgan Chase’s Fonte,” We know that fostering local entrepreneurship is integral to the development of vibrant and economically inclusive communities. That’s why we recently announced our the expansion of our Small Business Forward program, a three-year $75 million initiative to support women, minority, and veteran-owned small businesses around the country. When we support our communities and their businesses, we all win.” “Since 2004, Rising Tide Capital has been doing the work of inclusive entrepreneurship, working to equip talented men and women to build strong businesses that can fundamentally change their communities,” said Alfa Demmellash, CEO and co-founder of Rising Tide Capital. “JPMorgan Chase has been a steadfast partner in this critical work for almost as long as we have existed. They haven’t simply provided funding, they have also provided volunteers who participate at every level of our organization, from our Strategic Advisory Board to our classrooms. This is why we are so proud to honor them as our Champion of Inclusive Economies–they understand that for a healthy economy to exist, every layer of it needs to be strengthened.” The proceeds from the gala will underwrite scholarships for entrepreneurs from urban, underserved communities to participate in Rising Tide Capital’s nationally recognized Community Business Academy, an intensive and targeted 12-week training on how to start, grow, and sustain a business. Within two years of graduating from this program entrepreneurs see a 64% increase in their business sales and a corresponding 47% increase in household income. They also experience a 56% reduction in the use of public assistance resulting from the ongoing support and resources offered by RTC. The 5th Annual Start Something Champions Gala, takes place from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the Liberty House Restaurant in Jersey City.

I’m dressing up as a tired reporter sick to death of this dismal, issue-free campaign. … The news that the FBI would review emails found on a laptop shared by top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her creepy, estranged husband Anthony Weiner walloped the political world. The news hit as Donald Trump was already drawing close to Hillary Clinton in national polls. We’ve always said wild card investigatory disclosures posed the biggest threat to a solid Clinton win. Well, we got one. Will it be enough to swing the election to Trump? Probably not. But taking the focus away from Trump certainly helps the GOP nominee and threatens to undermine Democrats’ chances for a wave that sweeps them to Senate control. Story Continued Below We don’t have enough post-Comey polling to determine the national impact. And Democrats are attempting to make Comey’s unusual decision this close to Election Day the issue. This could fire up some Democratic turnout but it’s a major net negative. Still, Trump’s path to 270 is still really, super hard. He has to win Ohio and Florida, which seems possible. But then he also has to win a bunch of other states where he trails including some combination of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Colorado, New Hampshire and Nevada. Still a giant lift. And Clinton is competitive in Alaska, Arizona, Georgia and Utah, not what you’d call Democratic strongholds. BRIEF MARKET MOVE — Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky: “The letter injected uncertainty into the 2016 election and briefly roiled markets with the VIX spiking as much as ~13 percent intra-day. … We continue to believe that the electoral math heavily favors Clinton taking the White House and maintain our ~90 percent odds of her victory. In our view, the most tangible impact of this development will be felt in down-ballot races. “The ‘Democratic Sweep’ narrative already faced long odds and we expect the most recent email development to effectively end Democratic hopes of winning back both chambers of Congress. Odds still slightly favor Democrats taking the Senate, but we believe this email scandal will ensure that the House stays under Republican control.” ASIA STUTTERS EARLY — Reuters: “Asian stocks got off to a shaky start on Monday after a renewed FBI probe of … Clinton … The Japanese yen, seen as a safe-haven in times of uncertainty, rose slightly against the U.S. dollar. … Markets have tended to see Clinton as the candidate of the status quo, while there is greater uncertainty over what a victory for … Trump might mean for U.S. foreign policy, international trade deals or the domestic economy. “The dollar surged 0.7 percent against the Mexican peso on Friday and extended those gains by another 0.2 percent to 18.9982 peso early on Monday. A Trump victory has been viewed as a key risk for the Mexican currency given his promises to clamp down on immigration and redraw trade relations with the country.” Read more. THE DAILY TRUMP — Trump campaigning Sunday night said of Clinton as president : “You could have 650 million people pour in and we do nothing. Think about. That’s what could happen. You triple the size of the country in one week.” Wait. What? TOOMEY WARNS BANKERS OF WARREN WARPATH — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Sen. Pat Toomey is trying to leverage bankers' fears of Sen. Elizabeth Warren to rally support for his tough reelection fight. In a conference call with a pro-industry group Friday morning, the Pennsylvania Republican said Warren has frightened Democrats from pursuing regulatory changes that would help banks, according to a paraphrased summary of the call obtained by POLITICO. “‘While there are individual Democrats that support traditional banks and reform, there is little to no chance of reform passing if the Democrats take control of the Senate due to Elizabeth Warren's influence on leadership,’ Friends of Traditional Banking Chairman John Boyer wrote in the email describing Toomey's comments.” Read more. ICYMI: GDP WAS PRETTY GOOD — POLITICO’s Ben White (right before the Comey thing blew up the news cycle): “The U.S. economy grew at a nearly 3 percent pace in the third quarter of the year, a better-than-expected reading that dents … Trump’s case that growth has stalled out. The faster pace of 2.9 percent may not hold up in the final quarter of 2016 but it offers a positive headline to … Clinton less than two weeks until Election Day … Republicans, even those still supporting the GOP nominee, view 2016 as a largely lost opportunity to frame the race as a referendum on the economy … “‘At every turn I urged him to talk about the economy and tax cuts, particularly business tax cuts, where there is virtual unanimous agreement to do something,’ said Larry Kudlow, an informal Trump economic adviser. ‘It was a tactical mistake not to and it was a strategic mistake because the economy is poor and the country believes we are on the wrong track and a lot of that is about the economy.’” Read more. GE NEARS $30B DEAL — WSJ’s Dana Cimilluca, Dana Mattioli and David Benoit: “General Electric Co. is nearing a roughly $30 billion deal to combine its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc., creating an energy powerhouse that would give GE a cost-effective way to play any recovery in the industry. GE plans to contribute its oil and gas business and some cash to the new entity, which would have publicly traded shares and be controlled by GE” Read more.

NO BIG CENTRAL BANK MOVES THIS WEEK — Mohamed A. El-Erian: “The central banks of Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. will hold policy meetings this week. These three systemically important institutions are inclined to implement new policy measures, albeit different ones. Yet all three may end up keeping their policy stance as is. Their individual and collective dilemmas will illustrate the current policy funk facing the global economy, as well as the urgent need for a macroeconomic policy pivot on three continents.” CETA SIGNED — POLITICO EU’s Christian Oliver, David M. Herszenhorn and Anca Gurzu: “The European Union and Canada signed a landmark trade deal Sunday, drawing a line under four months of political conflict across Europe that at times looked likely to scupper the pact. “The deal is now expected to enter force on a provisional basis early next year, as long as it wins support from the European Parliament, which is seen as likely.” Read more. HOPE FOR TTIP? — Reuters’ Robert-Jan Bartunek: “A much-debated trade deal between the European Union and the United States is not dead and negotiations will continue with the new U.S. administration after November's elections, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Saturday. “‘TTIP is not dead, but TTIP is not yet an agreement,’ she told reporters after a ceremony in Brussels, in which Belgium signed its addendum to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada. ‘The U.S. election will naturally bring the negotiations to a pause and we will resume after with the new administration,’ she added.” Read more. OPEC TALKS FAIL — Bloomberg’s Grant Smith and Elena Mazneva: “OPEC’s internal disagreements over how to implement oil-supply cuts agreed to last month prevented a deal to secure the cooperation of other major suppliers. “More than 18 hours of talks over two days in Vienna yielded little more than a promise that the world’s largest oil producers would keep on talking. Discussions will continue in late November, just days before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is supposed to finalize the accord that lifted oil prices to one-year highs.” Read more. RUSSIA SLASHES SPENDING — FT’s Kathrin Hille: “Russia is preparing to slash government spending across the board over the next three years as it struggles to bring down a budget deficit swollen by lower oil prices and recession. “The scale of the proposed austerity measures, at a time when Russia’s recession is bottoming out but incomes continue to fall, illustrate how badly the country’s public finances have been hurt by the oil price slide, which has also forced Gulf states to slash spending.” Read more. LONDON RULES FOR UBER DRIVERS — Washington Post’s Karla Adam: “In a landmark ruling Friday that could impact Britain’s wider “gig” economy, a London employment tribunal ruled that taxi drivers using the Uber ride-hailing app are “workers” and entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. “Uber said Friday it would seek to appeal the judgment, which applies to the two drivers who brought the case to court. But analysts said it could also open the floodgates to claims from other Uber drivers in Britain, as well as the thousands of independent workers in Britain’s gig economy, in which temporary positions are the norm and independent workers perform short-term jobs.” Read more. VENZEULAN SHOWDOWN — FT reports: “Venezuela’s political crisis comes to a head this week in a mass march on the Presidential Palace that raises the risk of a crackdown. “The march, which follows opposition-led mass protests and a general strike last week, is slated to take place even as Vatican-mediated talks between the government and the opposition Democratic Unity coalition (MUD) began on Sunday.” Read more. AMAZON PRIME COMPETES IN CHINA — Bloomberg’s Lulu Yilun Chen: “Amazon.com Inc. has started offering its Prime free-shipping service in China, ratcheting up attempts to compete with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. for the rising number of shoppers hankering after overseas goods. “From Friday, Chinese Prime subscribers get free shipping on orders exceeding 200 yuan ($29.50) on millions of eligible overseas goods, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Domestic goods will also be delivered free and a membership costs 388 yuan a year, lower than the U.S. fee of $99. Amazon China representative Wu Shanhan said membership won’t include access to any digital content.” Read more. INFLATION’S BACK (A BIT) — WSJ’s Greg Ip: “After being given up for dead, inflation is gradually coming back to life. It’s not roaring back. Indeed, it’s still below the 2 percent level the Federal Reserve targets, one reason the Fed is almost certain to leave interest rates unchanged when it meets this week. But economic circumstances and attitudes of policy makers have shifted in the past year in ways that suggest the likeliest path of inflation is up, not down. “Data released Friday showed that core inflation … reached a two-year high of 1.7 percent in the third quarter … Other data found stirrings of wage acceleration. The intellectual case for low inflation is also showing cracks. Central banks now openly entertain, and even welcome, inflation bubbling over 2 percent. This isn’t bad news. To the contrary, markets and central bankers alike will be relieved that the world is no longer skirting a deflationary abyss” Read more. TRADE SLOWING — NYT’s Binyamin Appelbaum: “The volume of global trade was flat in the first quarter of 2016, then fell by 0.8 percent in the second quarter … The United States is no exception to the broader trend. The total value of American imports and exports fell by more than $200 billion last year. Through the first nine months of 2016, trade fell by an additional $470 billion. It is the first time since World War II that trade with other nations has declined during a period of economic growth.” Read more. CARNEY WANTS TO STAY — FT’s Chris Giles: “Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is ready to serve a full eight-year term, facing down Brexiter critics campaigning for him to resign ahead of time. Mr Carney has told friends that he is likely to make a statement on his future this week to put an end to damaging speculation. “The governor is expected to confer with prime minister Theresa May and chancellor Philip Hammond before making a final ‘personal’ decision, potentially ahead of the publication of the BoE’s inflation report on Thursday.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements.

It’s neither, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore its stock. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 31, 2016 at 7:11AM JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. If you're thinking about buying JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stock, the first question you should ask yourself is whether it's cheap or expensive. Unfortunately, the answer is: neither. But this doesn't mean you should avoid its stock. A wonderful company at a fair price One of Warren Buffett's famous sayings is, "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." This fits JPMorgan Chase to a tee. No one who follows bank stocks closely would argue right now that JPMorgan Chase's stock is cheap. To be considered cheap in the context of bank stocks a bank's shares need to trade below book value. This is the case at Bank of America and Citigroup, shares of which are priced at approximately 30% discounts to book value. In other words, investors think these banks are worth roughly a third less than the banks claim to be. JPMorgan Chase, by contrast, trades for an 8% premium to its book value. Compared to Bank of America and Citigroup, it's clear that JPMorgan Chase's stock is far from cheap. Yet, shares of the nation's biggest bank by assets aren't expensive either. Typically speaking, for a bank stock to be considered expensive, it would have to trade for two or more times book value. Few banks trade at such high multiples today, given the hangover from the financial crisis, which has caused short-term interest rates to hover right above 0% for much of the past decade. Because this weighs on the profitability of banks' loan and securities portfolios, it's also reflected in the valuation of their shares. The net result is that JPMorgan Chase's shares are neither cheap nor expensive right now. A healthy dividend But to Buffett's point, this alone shouldn't dissuade investors from buying JPMorgan Chase's stock. By most knowledgeable accounts, the New York-based megabank is an incredibly well-run company. It's efficient, with an efficiency ratio of 59% in the latest quarter. This means that 41% of its revenue is left over after operating expenses are deducted to cover loan losses, income taxes, and then to distribute to shareholders. Most other banks, by contrast, have efficiency ratios in excess of 60%. JPMorgan Chase is also in a commanding position on Main Street, through its robust commercial banking operations, and on Wall Street, by way of its investment bank. This gives it a diversity of revenue streams that can help offset fluctuations in the business cycle, making it a more stable holding for risk-averse investors. Finally, JPMorgan Chase pays a generous and growing dividend. Its stock currently yields 2.8%. That ranks it sixth on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen blue-chip bank stocks. And it means that owners of JPMorgan Chase's shares earn considerably more in dividend payments than owners of the typical stock on the S&P 500, which yields 2.1%. JPM Dividend data by YCharts. While JPMorgan Chase certainly isn't a screaming bargain, I believe it's reasonably priced and offers considerable room for growth once interest rates begin to rise in earnest.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 31, 2016 at 2:21PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. October was a good month for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) investors. Shares of the nation's second-biggest bank by assets rose 6.6% through the month, outperforming its closest competitors JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. BAC data by YCharts. Two things explain Bank of America's performance in October. 1. Continued rebound Shares of the bank were primed to continue rebounding after dropping steeply to begin the year. Its stock bottomed out in February, at just about the same time that oil prices dipped below $30 a barrel. This wasn't a coincidence, as the low prices made it difficult for energy companies to service their bank loans. This led Bank of America to increase the amount of money it set aside in the first quarter in anticipation of future loan losses. It was around the same time that the United Kingdom announced that it would hold a referendum in June to decide whether to remain as a member in the European Union. This triggered uncertainty in the markets, which resulted in a 16% drop in Bank of America's first-quarter trading revenues. Bank stocks fell again in June in the wake of the vote, which came out in support of leaving. By the time third-quarter earnings rolled around last month, Bank of America's investors were looking for any reason to conclude that its otherwise dismal performance for the year would improve. And that's exactly what they got. 2. Better-than-expected earnings As I discuss here, almost all of Bank of America's headline metrics went in the right direction in the three months ended Sept. 30. Revenue was up 3% on a year-over-year basis, thanks to higher interest and noninterest income. Expenses at the $2.2 trillion bank were down. And its net income came in 7% above the same quarter in 2015. Investors responded by sending Bank of America's shares higher, as they did with most other bank stocks. Since reporting earnings on Oct. 17, the North Carolina-based bank's share price has climbed 4.3%. The good news for enterprising investors is that there's still a lot of fuel in the proverbial tank when it comes to Bank of America's shares, as they continue to trade for a 31% discount to book value, making the stock the second-cheapest blue chip bank stock after Citigroup. The true game changer will be higher interest rates, which could very well be in the works for later this year, if JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is right. According to Bank of America's third-quarter earnings presentation, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates will translate into $5.3 billion more net interest income over the next 12 months. That would go a long way when you consider that Bank of America earns less than $5 billion a quarter -- its earnings last quarter were $4.96 billion. This would also consolidate the improvement in Bank of America's profitability, which has stabilized at 10.3% of its tangible common equity, suggesting that the bank is on the precipice of generating value for shareholders after taking into account the opportunity cost of owning its shares. It remains to be seen whether Bank of America can continue its momentum through the end of the year, but either way, it's headed in the right direction. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Foreign investors’ purchases of Chinese bonds will probably surge more than fourfold in the coming two years as global central banks diversify their reserves. Monetary authorities and supranational organizations will lead buying of about $48 billion each in 2017 and 2018, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 11 analysts. That’s more than four times the $12 billion of the whole of last year. Inflows have slowed to $8 billion so far in 2016 as the yuan’s 4.2 percent decline sapped investor confidence. “There’s still huge potential for reserve managers to slowly diversify their reserves into the yuan,” said Paul Mackel, head of emerging-markets currency research at HSBC Holdings Plc. “The appetite from real money managers, such as pension funds and mutual funds, is again very, very high. If China is eventually included in major bond indexes, it could bring an average $80 billion-$100 billion annually over the coming years.” While China opened up its bond markets in preparation for the yuan’s entry into the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights on Oct. 1, capital inflows have seen a limited impact. The scenario will change over time, with the Chinese currency accounting for as much as 10 percent of the world’s $11 trillion of foreign-exchange reserves in a decade’s time, according to Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and former head of the IMF’s China division. Nine of the Bloomberg News survey’s 11 respondents put more than even odds of Chinese government debt being added to major bond indexes by the end of 2018. Inclusion would help bring $750 billion of inflows in the next 10 years, according to the median estimate in the poll. PBOC Deputy Governor Pan Gongsheng said earlier this year that China will push for the inclusion of domestic notes in global measures such as those compiled by Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Citigroup said that it is seeking client feedback that can be used in any potential review, while JPMorgan said it has placed Chinese onshore government bonds on review to be included in its emerging-market indexes. Chinese sovereign bonds have handed investors a profit in all but one of the past 11 quarters amid an asset famine, with a total return of 25 percent in the period. The mainland’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index of stocks is down 12 percent for the year, the government is moving to curb rising property prices, while channels for moving money abroad have been choked as policy makers look to discourage the flight of capital. SDR-driven inflows are already showing signs of picking up, with foreign investors’ holdings of Chinese onshore sovereign debt rising a record $6 billion in September, according to data from China Central Depository & Clearing Co. Many have been drawn by the nation’s higher yields: China’s benchmark 10-year sovereign debt yields 2.70 percent, compared with 1.72 percent in South Korea, 1.85 percent in the U.S. and close to zero in Germany. The offshore yuan was trading at 6.7834 a dollar late Monday. “The IMF’s acknowledgment of the yuan as a freely usable currency enables central banks to count yuan assets as part of their official reserves, rather than just foreign-currency assets,” said Becky Liu, senior greater China rates strategist at Standard Chartered Plc. “The nature of reserves investment is to get exposure to reserve currencies, instead of hedging everything back to the dollar.” On the Way Private players are on the way too. Pacific Investment Management Co. will probably be onshore in China in a year or two, Asia Pacific head Eric Mogelof said at the Bloomberg Markets Most Influential Summit in Hong Kong on Sept. 28. Earlier this year, Bridgewater Associates became the first foreign hedge fund manager to win approval to set up a wholly owned investment-management business in China, according to Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. A Deutsche Bank survey indicated that the aggregate share of Asian local currency bond portfolios allocated to onshore yuan bonds will rise from roughly 5 percent now to almost 13 percent a year later, and over 26 percent in five years’ time. Still, a lack of liquid hedging instruments is most frequently cited as a factor limiting investments, according to the poll. China’s efforts to open its $8 trillion onshore bond market have been hampered by secondary trading that’s far less than levels seen in the U.S. While the market is the world’s third-largest, annual trading as a ratio of total outstanding debt is 1.9, compared with 4.7 in the U.S., Bloomberg calculations based on official data show. “There is certainly a lot of work to do, including improving market infrastructure, liquidity and ratings, but the obstacles should be able to be removed soon,” said Wu Qiong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at BOC International Holdings Ltd. “Once China is included in global indexes, it’s likely to see very impressive growth of holdings by foreign fund managers.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

After all, jobs are back, the Federal Reserve is close to raising interest rates again and growth has perked up after a sluggish first half. But instead of ramping up lending to keep up with deposits, banks are plowing into U.S. government and related debt at the fastest clip since 2014. The easy answer, of course, has to do with post-crisis financial regulations, which were designed to curb risk-taking and have compelled banks to hold more high-quality assets. Yet in many ways, the buildup reflects a more worrying sign. In the past year, more loan officers at large and midsize banks have tightened credit to businesses than at any time since 2009, when the U.S. was still reeling from the housing bust. Americans are also saving more rather than taking on extra debt, damping demand for new loans. Though it’s hard to say whether that means the seven-year-long U.S. expansion may be closer to an end than the upbeat data suggest, the demand for bonds is welcome news for investors buffeted by the biggest monthly selloff since 2010. “Banks continue to buy Treasuries as we move further through the economic cycle,” said Jeff Caughron, chief operating officer at Oklahoma City-based Baker Group, which advises community banks with over $45 billion in investments. And there are just “fewer good loans out there to be made.” That may help contain the backup in Treasury yields as rates rise and foreign demand slows. Global Selloff Yields on the U.S. 10-year note have climbed about a half-percentage point since falling to an all-time low of 1.318 percent in July. They were about 1.84 percent today. Losses have accelerated as bonds globally head for their worst month in about six years on speculation major central banks are moving closer to reining in stimulus. But with banks finding fewer opportunities to lend, it’s raising deeper questions about the prospects for future economic growth. Commercial banks in the U.S. have amassed $90 billion of Treasuries and non-mortgage debt from federal agencies this year alone, bringing the total to $754 billion, according to data compiled by the Fed. Including federally guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, banks now own $2.4 trillion of government bonds, which would be the most since the central bank began compiling data in 1973. The five biggest lenders -- Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and U.S. Bancorp -- held a combined $206 billion of government debt at the end of the second quarter, according to the latest available filings. That’s a 74 percent increase over the past three years. Banks aren’t lending more because the economy “isn’t growing as fast as we’d like it to grow,” said Paul Miller, a bank analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. “Banks are only able to take a certain amount of risk.” Bank of America, the only big lender to provide supplemental data on its investments through September, has doubled its “available-for-sale” holdings in government debt to $45 billion over the past six months. AFS excludes securities used in daily trading and those intended to be held until maturity. Citigroup has also increased its exposure in a big way, boosting its holdings to $126 billion at the end of June, the most since at least 1999. What’s more, banking organizations across America have boosted the stakes they plan to hold to maturity (meaning they can keep those investments on their books at the price they paid and not worry about market fluctuations) to almost a half-trillion dollars in the second quarter, based on New York Fed data. At the end of 2013, the figure was just $50 billion. A big reason banks are funneling so much money into safe assets is that deposit growth is outstripping loan demand. For the biggest lenders, deposits increased by 6.7 percent to $5.2 trillion in the third quarter from a year earlier, exceeding loan growth by a full percentage point. Few Alternatives “We have more deposits coming in than we have loans,” Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive officer, said on its Oct. 17 third-quarter earnings call. “We don’t take credit risk there, and so we have two alternatives, Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.” Over the past year, the rate of Bank of America’s commercial-loan growth has fallen from more than 10 percent to less than 5 percent. At the same time, consumer lending remains stagnant, contracting for a 23rd consecutive quarter. Citigroup’s retail loan business has also shrunk, while JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, two of the strongest banking franchises in the U.S., have seen gains in their overall lending slow in recent quarters as well. Instead of leaving idle cash parked at the Fed, where its earns only 0.5 percent, U.S. government bonds are providing banks an increasingly attractive spread over what they pay depositors. Two-year Treasury notes yield 0.85 percent, while the average deposit rate for interest-bearing checking accounts is 0.31 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Interest Margins For JPMorgan, the gap between yields on two-year U.S. notes and the bank’s average deposit rate has been roughly 0.64 percentage point this year, the widest in a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Banks need yield wherever they can so this is an interest-margin story also,” said George Goncalves, the head of U.S. rates research at Nomura Holdings Inc. Banks have also become more reluctant to take on too many risks and expose themselves to potential loan losses, especially as growth remains lackluster and borrowers seek to reduce their indebtedness. According to the Fed’s quarterly senior loan officer survey, a majority of large and medium-sized U.S. lenders have tightened lending standards for four straight quarters. That hasn’t happened since 2009, when the U.S. was still struggling to emerge from the worst economic crisis in seven decades. Even banks that are faring better have grown more cautious. “We are being very selective in what loans we make and who we make one to,” said Thomas Wornham, CEO and president of San Diego Private Bancorp of America, which extended loans at almost twice the rate of its deposit growth last quarter. “What you are seeing out there is a slowdown.” Both Ways To some, that’s just how banks should behave, since excessive risk-taking was exactly what led to the financial crisis. “It’s one of those paradoxes,” said David Keeble, the head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole SA. “The Fed probably wants it both ways -- they want more lending to keep the economy going, but more safe lending, which means less lending.” Whatever the case, it’s clear that while the excess liquidity from the Fed’s easy-money policies has been a boon for government securities, banks are still wary of putting much of the cash to work. “Banks have lots of customer deposits and corporations aren’t spending cash,” said Moorad Choudhry, a professor in the business school at University of Kent and the author of more than a dozen books on finance including “The Principles of Banking.” “There is nowhere else for banks to put this money.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Citigroup said that it is seeking client feedback that can be used in any potential review, while JPMorgan said it has placed Chinese onshore government bonds on review to be included in its emerging-market indexes. Chinese sovereign bonds have handed investors a profit in all but one of the past 11 quarters amid an asset famine, with a total return of 25 percent in the period. The mainland’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index of stocks is down 12 percent for the year, the government is moving to curb rising property prices, while channels for moving money abroad have been choked as policy makers look to discourage the flight of capital. SDR-driven inflows are already showing signs of picking up, with foreign investors’ holdings of Chinese onshore sovereign debt rising a record $6 billion in September, according to data from China Central Depository & Clearing Co. Many have been drawn by the nation’s higher yields: China’s benchmark 10-year sovereign debt yields 2.70 percent, compared with 1.72 percent in South Korea, 1.85 percent in the U.S. and close to zero in Germany. The offshore yuan was trading at 6.7834 a dollar late Monday. “The IMF’s acknowledgment of the yuan as a freely usable currency enables central banks to count yuan assets as part of their official reserves, rather than just foreign-currency assets,” said Becky Liu, senior greater China rates strategist at Standard Chartered Plc. “The nature of reserves investment is to get exposure to reserve currencies, instead of hedging everything back to the dollar.” On the Way Private players are on the way too. Pacific Investment Management Co. will probably be onshore in China in a year or two, Asia Pacific head Eric Mogelof said at the Bloomberg Markets Most Influential Summit in Hong Kong on Sept. 28. Earlier this year, Bridgewater Associates became the first foreign hedge fund manager to win approval to set up a wholly owned investment-management business in China, according to Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. A Deutsche Bank survey indicated that the aggregate share of Asian local currency bond portfolios allocated to onshore yuan bonds will rise from roughly 5 percent now to almost 13 percent a year later, and over 26 percent in five years’ time. Still, a lack of liquid hedging instruments is most frequently cited as a factor limiting investments, according to the poll. China’s efforts to open its $8 trillion onshore bond market have been hampered by secondary trading that’s far less than levels seen in the U.S. While the market is the world’s third-largest, annual trading as a ratio of total outstanding debt is 1.9, compared with 4.7 in the U.S., Bloomberg calculations based on official data show. “There is certainly a lot of work to do, including improving market infrastructure, liquidity and ratings, but the obstacles should be able to be removed soon,” said Wu Qiong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at BOC International Holdings Ltd. “Once China is included in global indexes, it’s likely to see very impressive growth of holdings by foreign fund managers.” — With assistance by Molly Wei, and Helen Sun Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Dollar-yen swings for 2-week options climb before Nov. 8 vote Campaign vies with central-bank meetings as market landmine Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mail The U.S. presidential election is back at the top of currency traders’ list of worries. After the revelation last week that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is reopening its inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s use of private e-mail, implied volatility in two-week options in the dollar-yen exchange rate timed to the Nov. 8 vote climbed to the highest levels since September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The foreign-exchange market had been looking past the campaign, putting greater emphasis on global central-bank meetings in December, when the Federal Reserve is forecast to raise interest rates. Sentiment in the currency market shifted after the FBI’s Oct. 28 announcement shattered a period of relative calm. Investors had been betting a likely Clinton victory would prompt the U.S. to uphold global trade agreements denounced by rival Donald Trump, who has also called for tighter immigration controls. Clinton’s odds of victory have fallen to 75.6 percent, according to poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight, from 81.6 percent last week, while traders on online betting market PredictIt give Clinton an 71 percent chance of winning the election, compared with 81 percent on Oct. 19. "There will be some volatility before the election and the market may get a bit nervous, especially if it’s a very close one," said Ugo Lancioni, a money manager in London at Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which oversees about $250 billion. "The market still believes Clinton is going to win, but that may change." Market Swings The increased likelihood of a Trump win helps to explain why the JPMorgan Chase & Co. global currency volatility index rose Monday by the most in two weeks, after falling to the lowest level this year on a closing basis on Oct. 24. Implied volatility on two-week options on the dollar-yen pair was 12.1 percent, up from 8.9 percent last week. That on two-month options timed to the December central-bank meetings is 11.2 percent, below the 2016 average of 11.7 percent. Investors speculate a win by Democratic nominee Clinton would mean support for Asian and European trade deals and the independence of the Fed, while a win for her rival may mean a material shift in policies. Republican nominee Trump included several trade elements in his list of actions that he would take during the first 100 days of his presidency, including a plan to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and directing his Secretary of the Treasury to label China, the biggest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, a currency manipulator. Implied volatility for the currency pair most closely tracking the election outcome is also taking a similar view. Expected swings for two-week options on the dollar-Mexican peso pair climbed to about 30.6 percent around the U.S. elections, according to Bloomberg data, compared with 12.5 percent last week. Brexit Concern Investors "don’t want to get into the election and have a Brexit happen," said Andres Jaime, a foreign-exchange strategist in New York at Barclays Plc, referring to the U.K. vote in June to leave the European Union. "That’s why the market is being a bit more cautious." Others are downplaying the election risk and are focused on central-bank meetings at year-end. Implied volatility on two-month options on the euro-dollar, the world’s most-traded currency pair, is 8.5 percent, up from a low in August of 7.1 percent. "The markets are downplaying the possibility of a U.S. election victory for Trump and are looking toward the Fed announcement" in December, said Samir Sheldenkar, an investment partner in London at Harmonic Capital Partners, with $1.8 billion under management. Futures show a 73 percent chance the U.S. central bank will raise rates by year-end, up from 59 percent a month ago, based on the assumption the effective fed funds rate will trade at the middle of the new Federal Open Market Committee target range after the next increase. The anticipation pushed a gauge of the dollar to the highest levels since March last week. With just a week to go before the White House vote, traders will remain on edge as they re-calibrate expectations for a Clinton win and brace for any additional surprises. "Uncertainty is increasing because the odds are tightening," said Van Luu, head of currency and fixed-income strategy in London at Russell Investments, which has $244 billion under management. "A Trump victory has the potential to cause exchange rates to break out of the range. In the case of a Clinton victory, the focus will shift back to central-bank policy."

Trader Pete Najarian said he would look at stocks that have already been "working" like semiconductor and financial stocks. He said that in particular, he would look at financial stocks that have been able to perform well in a low interest rate environment and have strong quarterly results. Najarian said stocks like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup look attractive at current valuations. Trader Steve Grasso disagreed and said the financials face major headwinds in regulatory issues. He said both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have been rhetorically tough on Wall Street. Grasso said he'd rather own something like United Rentals because both candidates have called for more infrastructure spending. Trader Brian Kelly agreed with Grasso and said to stay away from the financials. Kelly argued that there's too much risk in the sector. Trader Dan Nathan said that biotechnology stocks are interesting, no matter who wins. Clinton has taken down the key biotech ETF with a single tweet. Nathan admitted it'll likely be "messy for a little bit." He said, however, that the sector has been "so beaten up" that stocks like Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb could see some upside after.

The committee has retained Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Moore & Van Allen PLLC as its legal counsel, and Goldman, Sachs & Co as its financial adviser to help evaluate the proposal, Reynolds American said. (http://bit.ly/2fobo9M) The company retained Jones Day as its legal counsel and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Lazard as financial advisers, it said. The tobacco company also canceled its investor day, which had been scheduled for Nov. 14, 2016. Earlier in the month, BAT had offered to buy Reynolds American in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall. Analysts have said they expect the deal would be approved but that Reynolds would receive a higher price. The deal is expected to spark further consolidation, such as a reunification of Philip Morris with Altria, analysts said. It would also put further pressure on smaller players Imperial Brands Plc and Japan Tobacco International to do deals of their own.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    If you’re like most Americans, the idea that our country doesn’t have a unified cyber defense agency is about as unthinkable as a presidential contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Welcome to the desert of the real. Our cyber defenses are scattered across three agencies that don’t always communicate well (a generous appraisal) or in a timely fashion, and we’ve never been more vulnerable. As Ronald Reagan (quoting John Adams) famously said during his address to the 1988 Republican National Convention, "Facts are stubborn things." On October 21, there was a cyber attack in the United States. At least two "cause hacking" organizations have taken credit for it. If it had been conducted by state-sponsored hackers, it would have been an act of war. How many of your friends and family know about it? A lot, if they only knew how it affected them. A distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) at around 7 a.m. EDT targeted servers belonging to a company called Dyn, causing severe disruption of Internet traffic to major sites, including Amazon, PayPal, Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Verizon, Pinterest, Etsy, Spotify, Comcast, HBO, and even Playstation; the first attack was followed by at least two more attacks. A Dyn statement said: "this was a sophisticated, highly distributed attack involving 10s of millions of IP addresses." The way this attack was perpetrated matters. Targeted here were Internet of Things (IoT) devices wrangled together in a botnet that took advantage of weak default passwords set by their manufacturers. These connected and interconnected items (think home routers, smart televisions and security cameras to name a few) were infected with malware and then triggered to send a staggering amount of traffic to select servers in order to overwhelm them and ultimately shut them down. This is way beyond inconvenience. In 2012, a DDoS attack took out the websites of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and other financial companies. Imagine for a moment that the October 21 DDoS attack had been a test conducted by state-sponsored hackers — and consider, if you will, the possibility that those hackers were gaming a bigger plan — one targeting critical infrastructure such as our power grid, the banking system, our weapons systems, or one designed to disrupt our elections. Why It Matters The 2015 attack on the Office of Personnel Management, the human resources department for the United States, where 21.5 million files, containing the personally identifying information of, and deep background investigative reports on, top current and retired national security players and their families, were grabbed should be reason enough to focus serious resources at the problem of our national cyber security. A more recent attack, equally troubling no matter your political outlook, is the hack of Democratic National Committee emails. We are living in a world where hackers have the capability to disrupt our elections, put key military assets in danger, and shut down our financial institutions. As things stand currently, the NSA is responsible for protecting national security systems and the DHS takes care of all other security systems. The FBI’s job is to investigate cyber crimes. Because each agency has to enlist one or both of the others to help, the process can be slowed down, which means precious leads can go cold and clear and present dangers can unfold without an optimal defense. Three Agencies Need to Be One On October 18, NSA Deputy National Manager for National Security Systems, Curtis Dukes, gave a speech at the American Enterprise Institute detailing two years worth of cyber attacks. During the Q&A, he stated that it was time for a more unified approach to our cyber defenses. “I am now firmly convinced that we need to rethink how we do cyber defense as a nation,” Dukes stated, saying that parts of the response teams at the FBI, NSA, and DHS might be combined under one authority to both improve reaction time during a cyber attack and oversee our nation’s defenses against future attacks. He pointed to the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, which currently approaches cyber in this way. In a different setting, a call for a three-in-one approach would start a heated discussion about the need for the separation of Church and State, but the three-in-one proposed here requires no mystery and no Holy Ghost. In fact, the only mystery is why we still don’t have an agency dedicated to cyber defense. Adam K.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 31, 2016 at 2:21PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. October was a good month for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) investors. Shares of the nation's second-biggest bank by assets rose 6.6% through the month, outperforming its closest competitors JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. BAC data by YCharts. Two things explain Bank of America's performance in October. 1. Continued rebound Shares of the bank were primed to continue rebounding after dropping steeply to begin the year. Its stock bottomed out in February, at just about the same time that oil prices dipped below $30 a barrel. This wasn't a coincidence, as the low prices made it difficult for energy companies to service their bank loans. This led Bank of America to increase the amount of money it set aside in the first quarter in anticipation of future loan losses. It was around the same time that the United Kingdom announced that it would hold a referendum in June to decide whether to remain as a member in the European Union. This triggered uncertainty in the markets, which resulted in a 16% drop in Bank of America's first-quarter trading revenues. Bank stocks fell again in June in the wake of the vote, which came out in support of leaving. By the time third-quarter earnings rolled around last month, Bank of America's investors were looking for any reason to conclude that its otherwise dismal performance for the year would improve. And that's exactly what they got. 2. Better-than-expected earnings As I discuss here, almost all of Bank of America's headline metrics went in the right direction in the three months ended Sept. 30. Revenue was up 3% on a year-over-year basis, thanks to higher interest and noninterest income. Expenses at the $2.2 trillion bank were down. And its net income came in 7% above the same quarter in 2015. Investors responded by sending Bank of America's shares higher, as they did with most other bank stocks. Since reporting earnings on Oct. 17, the North Carolina-based bank's share price has climbed 4.3%. The good news for enterprising investors is that there's still a lot of fuel in the proverbial tank when it comes to Bank of America's shares, as they continue to trade for a 31% discount to book value, making the stock the second-cheapest blue chip bank stock after Citigroup. The true game changer will be higher interest rates, which could very well be in the works for later this year, if JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is right. According to Bank of America's third-quarter earnings presentation, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates will translate into $5.3 billion more net interest income over the next 12 months. That would go a long way when you consider that Bank of America earns less than $5 billion a quarter -- its earnings last quarter were $4.96 billion. This would also consolidate the improvement in Bank of America's profitability, which has stabilized at 10.3% of its tangible common equity, suggesting that the bank is on the precipice of generating value for shareholders after taking into account the opportunity cost of owning its shares. It remains to be seen whether Bank of America can continue its momentum through the end of the year, but either way, it's headed in the right direction. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

This story is part of Delaware Election Trump country: Delmarva's Trump voters send message Wilmington race with 11-vote difference to be recounted Return Day heals political wounds Delaware's third-party candidates tout their outsider advantages Matthew Albright , The News Journal 2:59 p.m. EDT October 31, 2016 Scott Gesty is a Libertarian candidate for Congress. (Photo: Submitted) They know they have little to no chance of winning, but Delaware's third-party candidates say they are running because the state deserves more choices. "This is a year when so many people are disillusioned with the two parties," said Scott Gesty, who is running for Delaware's seat in Congress as a Libertarian. "Our pitch to the voters is, there's never been a better year to look at other candidates." Gesty is a CPA and an adjunct professor at Goldey-Beacom College. There are 15 candidates seeking statewide or local offices in Delaware this year that are not running as a Democrat or Republican. Most are from either the Green Party or Libertarian Party. That's fewer than there have been in recent years. There were 18 running in 2014 and 27 running in 2012 when a wave of Libertarians jumped on board. LINK: Learn more about candidates for office with our Delaware Voter's Guide LINK: Report floats Joe Biden as possible Secretary of State Third-party candidates are counted out of most elections, even for seats on local school boards or the General Assembly. They have next to no political machinery to support them, few connections with social and business heavyweights and little money to run advertisements. A September poll by the University of Delaware found no third-party candidate for governor or Congress getting more than six percent of the vote. In 2012, the last presidential election, most third-party candidates got around one percent of the vote. Despite these disadvantages, third-party candidates say voters should pause to consider what would happen if Delaware put someone other than a Republican or a Democrat in office. Since he comes from outside the state's political system, Green Party gubernatorial candidate Andrew Groff says he would be beholden to no one but the voters if he were elected. "It's very easy in this state to get caught up with the very large corporations and the political power players and take your eye off the ball of the experience of an everyday Delawarean," Groff said. Buy Photo Andrew Groff, the Green Party candidate for Governor.  (Photo: William Bretzger, The News Journal) Groff, a computer consultant and adjunct professor at Delaware Technical Community College, said a third-party governor would be less eager to spend millions of taxpayer dollars on enticing massive corporations like J.P. Morgan Chase or DuPont, Instead, he would focus on building up small businesses with roots in Delaware. Arguments like these appeal to people like Vanessa Thomas, a Delawarean who is registered with the Green Party. "I talk with people and they are just so, so frustrated," Thomas said. "They feel like there's nobody that they can vote for who they really believe in. If I don't vote my heart and my beliefs, then what does my vote mean, anyway?" Thomas says two-party dominance means people often find themselves voting for people who hold contradictory views. A person could vote Republican because they are "pro-life," but the GOP candidate also likely would support aggressive military action. "I wish we could get rid of having any politicians at all," Thomas said. "But if we have to have them, I think we really need to have more than just two options. The whole system needs to be changed." Sean Goward, the Libertarian running for governor, argues someone elected from a third party would be perfectly positioned to make dramatic changes. He is an Air Force veteran who works as a railroad signal maintainer. Goward wants to vastly increase the openness of government records and meetings and allow the public to pursue ballot initiatives that would create new laws or recall politicians. "None of the people who are there now have an incentive to talk about things like that," Goward said. "The system is what keeps them in power." Sean Goward, the Libertarian candidate for governor.  (Photo: Submitted) Mark Perri, the Green Party candidate for Congress, says electing third-party candidates who don't come from the "professional political class" could restore some enthusiasm for politics. Perri is a clerk and chemical engineer. He thinks partisan infighting has "turned off" many people, especially younger residents, from getting involved in public service. "When you look at our campaigns, we are having a ton of fun," Perri said of his fellow Green candidates. "You know why? We're in this because we want to be. We're not people who are paid just to win elections." Mark Perri, the Green Party candidate for Congress.  (Photo: Submitted) A common argument third-party candidates make is that Delaware's Democrats and Republicans aren't really that different from each other. They point to recent debates between Republican gubernatorial candidate Colin Bonini and Democrat John Carney in which the two often found themselves agreeing as much as they disagreed. "We don't really have a party that's on the left in Delaware," said Goff. "You've got a far-right party in the Republicans and a moderate-right party in the Democrats." Groff said there's a reason why figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren have gotten so much support, particularly among young people. It's their call for more solidly progressive policies like higher taxes on the wealthy, free college tuition and tougher regulations on polluters and the financial sector. "When you look at who they've nominated, you can see that the Democratic Party insiders just aren't going to embrace these ideas," Groff said. "And they point at Trump and perpetuate this myth that voting for a third party is somehow voting for Trump. People need to vote their values — that's the only way we get a government that supports their values." Goward says both Democrats and Republicans in Delaware have allowed the federal government to interfere in local affairs, particularly education. He criticized the state for allowing federal school officials to push Delaware into over-testing and gathering large amounts of data on kids. "I can deal with a little bit of government intrusion," Goward said. "But I don't want my children to grow up seeing this level of government intrusion as normal. That's the reason I decided to run." While many third-party candidates will say outright that they don't think they will win this year, they are all optimistic that their parties are gradually becoming more competitive. "The two parties have been entrenched for well over 150 years," said Gesty. "If you're going to break the idea that these are your only choices, it's going to take time."

"What we pay attention to is our profits after 10 to 20 years." JD.com is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's biggest competitor in China's online shopping market, which is on track to show almost $700 billion in spending this year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Unlike Alibaba, the Beijing-based company has invested heavily in its own fixed assets such as warehouses and delivery trucks to ensure good service, and facilitate the buying and selling of everything from electrical goods to boxes of kiwi fruit. JD.com's logistics network has also helped win more users through speedy shipping, and the company is competing with Alibaba to sell consumer goods, electronics and home appliances. Liu pointed to stepped-up investments in logistics automation as well as financial and technology services as areas that will ensure success for China's second-largest online retailer for the coming decades. E-commerce is already contributing substantial cash flow, Liu said. JD.com is on track to handle 14 percent of China's total 2016 e-commerce spending, compared with Alibaba's 78 percent, according to JP Morgan. The bank's analysts, led by Alex Yao, said in August that JD.com's gross-margin improvement was positive, but had a cautious view of its operating expenses. "The investment for growth could delay JD's path to profitability," Yao said, pointing to rising expenses and competitive pressure from Alibaba. On Oct 20, the company announced new initiatives in its partnership with Wal-Mart Stores Inc, including adding a Sam's Club to its website and two-hour delivery in select cities. JD.Com is also pouring large amounts of capital into new ventures, including an expansion into Southeast Asia via Indonesia, new financial services such as online loans and cloud-computing products. Liu's strategy is to emulate Amazon.com Inc by investing early profits back into new and existing businesses to grow scale and market share, according to Mitchell Kim, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities. "The asset-heavy model will probably not generate profit for the foreseeable future," Mitchell Kim said. "If you look at the margin difference of Alibaba versus JD, JD just does not have the profitability and cash-flow to invest in all these other new areas whereas Alibaba does."

David Hammer created a company to do something he claims Google can't: give salespeople insights they need to do their jobs. Hammer, who spent six years as a product manager at Google, said his new company, Emissary, connects salespeople with former executives who have accumulated "invaluable knowledge throughout their careers." Hammer describes Emissary as a marketplace where salespeople connect with advisors who give them the inside scoop to win deals. It launched in beta in 2015 and publicly debuts today. Emissary includes thousands of business leaders, referred to as “Emissaries" from companies such as Nordstrom, Estee Lauder, Coca Cola, Samsung, Caterpillar, JPMorgan Chase, FedEx, Costco, The Home Depot, Uber and Omnicom Media Group. "Emissary lives where sales reps live — mostly their email," Hammer, founder and CEO of New York City-based Emissary, told CMSWire. "We offer a Salesforce sync that ensures 'Emissaries' are easily matched to a client's opportunities, but we view ourselves as a different part of the stack. We don't have any direct competitors. Before us, you either hired one-off consultants, who were hard to find and expensive, or used LinkedIn to network your way to these people the hard way."  Where Google Stops ... Hammer and the Emissary team claim this type of insight is unavailable anywhere online. In fact, Hammer said where Google and social searches and network and sales automation platforms end, Emissary can take over by directly connecting clients to Emissary. Ironically, the revelation about the vast amount of relevant data offline came at the company that made people billionaires with internet technology. "At Google I came to realize that we all have valuable, tacit knowledge that was not available online,” Hammer said. "With Emissary, we’re using technology to gain access to relationship-driven knowledge from trusted sources that can often make the difference between whether or not you close a deal.” David Hammer Salespeople can tap into a pool of more than 5,000 experienced business leaders on Emissary. They can get insights from them on the company to which they're targeting: what the company culture is, who the key decision-makers are and how the company makes buying decisions. "We think we're unique because we're serving clients down-funnel, after the deal has been qualified," said Hammer, a former intern at Microsoft. "Most sales acceleration tools are designed to generate more leads, not to close more deals."   Glory Google Days While at Google, Hammer worked alongside current Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. He led the team that developed the DoubleClick Bid Manager ad technology. He also created the initial product vision, built engineering and initial sales team and helped manage acquisition and integration of Invite Media. "Overall, my experience at Google was spectacular," Hammer told CMSWire. "I learned a ton of important things, including how to think at a truly global scale and the value of being stupidly ambitious. One thing my friend Hunter Walk said is that you get to see what world-class really looks like on a regular basis." Funding Boost Bob Hower, co-founder of Emissary investor G20 Ventures, said in a statement that human intelligence is the most important data for enterprise salespeople. Emissary, he said, is a "one-stop shop for intelligence that eliminates the blind spots we all face along the sales journey.” To spur early growth in his startup, Hammer and Emissary recently closed a $10 million Series A funding round led by Canaan Partners and G20 Ventures. This follows a previous $2 million seed round from The New York Times, Google Ventures and Nextview Ventures.  "Part of what inspired Emissary's creation was working at one of the most data-driven organizations in the world and realizing that we still didn't always make the right decision," Hammer said of his Google run. "Often times, we didn't have access to a piece of knowledge that sat in someone else's head, and we didn't know who that person was. I created Emissary because I believed if we faced that problem at Google, that organizations of all sizes must be facing that challenge." 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Think of Microsoft’s New Outlook Customer Manager as Salesforce Light Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' The Collaboration Community's Big Dirty Productivity Secret 7 Big Problems with the Internet of Things Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Think of Microsoft’s New Outlook Customer Manager as Salesforce Light 10 Social Media Tactics for B2B Marketers Design Through Customer Use Phil Fernandez Out at Marketo, Marc Andreessen Joins Dialpad Board, More News Microsoft Takes a Swipe at Salesforce with Dynamics 365 Release Useful Article?

It’s one of those scenarios we all hate. Ross Kenneth Urken, personal finance editor at TheStreet, has a few ways for us avoid those fees. It’s one of those annoying instances. It’s not breaking the bank, but in aggregate those fees add up. Your approach to anything, should be your approach to everything. Be savvy, money conscious and those habit will inform the rest of your financial life. Plus it is big money; last year, the three big banks earned almost 1 billion in ATM fees. What can we do to avoid these pesky fees? One easy solution is to open a High Yield Investor Checking Account with Charles Schwab. This gives you Unlimited ATM fee refunds on any ATM worldwide. There are no minimum balances and no monthly fees. Banks are getting competitive with each other and looking for ways to distinguish themselves and earn your business. But thinking outside the bank box can help, too, right. Ding, ding, ding. Of course, the big banks, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank are charging you $2.50. For consumers looking to avoid ATM fees, join a credit union that belongs to the nearly 30,000 ATM network operated by credit union service organization CO-OP. Transactions are surcharge free. To put the 30,000 number in perspective, Bank of America, which operates one of the largest — possibly the largest — bank-owned ATM network, has a tick over 16,000 ATMs. The CO-OP network is huge and it came about because tiny credit unions (which often own just a few ATMs themselves) realized long ago that to compete against the big banks they had to band together and their ATM network is how. Some options won’t provide entirely fee-free ATM use but will cover you more often than not. That’s absolutely right. Ally Bank, for example, will refund $10 a month in ATM fees. That’s going to cover you more often than not. USAA refunds $15 a month. Discover Cashback Checking, from the company with the same name credit card, is fee-free, no minimum balance and it boasts an ATM network of 60,000, via networks provided by AllPoint and Moneypass. If you really need cash, use a debit card to buy groceries at a local pharmacy or supermarket, and then get free cash back. Usually you can get up to $40 or so per visit. Use a credit card as much as possible for ‘walking around’ expenditures. Not only will you have better protections against potential fraud and other coverage, but you will earn miles, cash back, or other loyalty currency.

After all, jobs are back, the Federal Reserve is close to raising interest rates again and growth has perked up after a sluggish first half. But instead of ramping up lending to keep up with deposits, banks are plowing into U.S. government and related debt at the fastest clip since 2014. The easy answer, of course, has to do with post-crisis financial regulations, which were designed to curb risk-taking and have compelled banks to hold more high-quality assets. Yet in many ways, the buildup reflects a more worrying sign. In the past year, more loan officers at large and midsize banks have tightened credit to businesses than at any time since 2009, when the U.S. was still reeling from the housing bust. Americans are also saving more rather than taking on extra debt, damping demand for new loans. Though it's hard to say whether that means the seven-year-long U.S. expansion may be closer to an end than the upbeat data suggest, the demand for bonds is welcome news for investors buffeted by the biggest monthly selloff since 2010. "Banks continue to buy Treasuries as we move further through the economic cycle," said Jeff Caughron, chief operating officer at Oklahoma City-based Baker Group, which advises community banks with over $45 billion in investments. And there are just "fewer good loans out there to be made." That may help contain the backup in Treasury yields as rates rise and foreign demand slows. Yields on the U.S. 10-year note have climbed about a half-percentage point since falling to an all-time low of 1.318 percent in July. They were about 1.84 percent today. Losses have accelerated as bonds globally head for their worst month in about six years on speculation major central banks are moving closer to reining in stimulus. But with banks finding fewer opportunities to lend, it's raising deeper questions about the prospects for future economic growth. Commercial banks in the U.S. have amassed $90 billion of Treasuries and non-mortgage debt from federal agencies this year alone, bringing the total to $754 billion, according to data compiled by the Fed. Including federally guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, banks now own $2.4 trillion of government bonds, which would be the most since the central bank began compiling data in 1973. The five biggest lenders -- Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and U.S. Bancorp -- held a combined $206 billion of government debt at the end of the second quarter, according to the latest available filings. That's a 74 percent increase over the past three years. Banks aren't lending more because the economy "isn't growing as fast as we'd like it to grow," said Paul Miller, a bank analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. "Banks are only able to take a certain amount of risk." Bank of America, the only big lender to provide supplemental data on its investments through September, has doubled its "available-for-sale" holdings in government debt to $45 billion over the past six months. AFS excludes securities used in daily trading and those intended to be held until maturity. Citigroup has also increased its exposure in a big way, boosting its holdings to $126 billion at the end of June, the most since at least 1999. What's more, banking organizations across America have boosted the stakes they plan to hold to maturity (meaning they can keep those investments on their books at the price they paid and not worry about market fluctuations) to almost a half-trillion dollars in the second quarter, based on New York Fed data. At the end of 2013, the figure was just $50 billion. A big reason banks are funneling so much money into safe assets is that deposit growth is outstripping loan demand. For the biggest lenders, deposits increased by 6.7 percent to $5.2 trillion in the third quarter from a year earlier, exceeding loan growth by a full percentage point. "We have more deposits coming in than we have loans," Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive officer, said on its Oct. 17 third-quarter earnings call. "We don't take credit risk there, and so we have two alternatives, Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities." Over the past year, the rate of Bank of America's commercial-loan growth has fallen from more than 10 percent to less than 5 percent. At the same time, consumer lending remains stagnant, contracting for a 23rd consecutive quarter. Citigroup's retail loan business has also shrunk, while JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, two of the strongest banking franchises in the U.S., have seen gains in their overall lending slow in recent quarters as well. Instead of leaving idle cash parked at the Fed, where its earns only 0.5 percent, U.S. government bonds are providing banks an increasingly attractive spread over what they pay depositors. Two-year Treasury notes yield 0.85 percent, while the average deposit rate for interest-bearing checking accounts is 0.31 percent, according to Bankrate.com. For JPMorgan, the gap between yields on two-year U.S. notes and the bank's average deposit rate has been roughly 0.64 percentage point this year, the widest in a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show. "Banks need yield wherever they can so this is an interest-margin story also," said George Goncalves, the head of U.S. rates research at Nomura Holdings Inc. Banks have also become more reluctant to take on too many risks and expose themselves to potential loan losses, especially as growth remains lackluster and borrowers seek to reduce their indebtedness. According to the Fed's quarterly senior loan officer survey, a majority of large and medium-sized U.S. lenders have tightened lending standards for four straight quarters. That hasn't happened since 2009, when the U.S. was still struggling to emerge from the worst economic crisis in seven decades. Even banks that are faring better have grown more cautious. "We are being very selective in what loans we make and who we make one to," said Thomas Wornham, CEO and president of San Diego Private Bancorp of America, which extended loans at almost twice the rate of its deposit growth last quarter. "What you are seeing out there is a slowdown." To some, that's just how banks should behave, since excessive risk-taking was exactly what led to the financial crisis. "It's one of those paradoxes," said David Keeble, the head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole SA. "The Fed probably wants it both ways -- they want more lending to keep the economy going, but more safe lending, which means less lending." Whatever the case, it's clear that while the excess liquidity from the Fed's easy-money policies has been a boon for government securities, banks are still wary of putting much of the cash to work. "Banks have lots of customer deposits and corporations aren't spending cash," said Moorad Choudhry, a professor in the business school at University of Kent and the author of more than a dozen books on finance including "The Principles of Banking." "There is nowhere else for banks to put this money."     Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed. Comment threads are monitored for 48 hours after publication and then closed.

The entire process has been an emotionally draining, frustration-inducing, rage-inflaming spectacle of repellent form over shallow substance. For many, the third debate evoked fatigue. More worrying, there was again no discussion of how to prevent another financial crisis, an ominous possibility in the next presidency, whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton enters the Oval Office — given that nothing fundamental has been altered when it comes to Wall Street’s practices and predation. At the heart of American political consciousness right now lies a soul-crushing reality for millions of distraught Americans: the choices for president couldn’t be feebler or more disappointing. On the one hand, we have a petulant, vocabulary-challenged man-boar of a billionaire, who hasn’t paid his taxes, has regularly left those supporting him holding the bag, and seems like a ludicrous composite of every bad trait in every bad date any woman has ever had. On the other hand, we’re offered a walking photo-op for and well-paid speechmaker to Wall-Street CEOs, a one-woman money-raising machine from the 1% of the 1%, who, despite a folksiness that couldn’t look more rehearsed, has methodically outplayed her opponent. With less than two weeks to go before E-day — despite the Trumptilian upheaval of the last year — the high probability of a Clinton win means the establishment remains intact. When we awaken on November 9th, it will undoubtedly be dawn in Hillary Clinton’s America and that potentially means four years of an economic dystopia that will (as would Donald Trump’s version of the same) leave many Americans rightfully anxious about their economic futures. None of the three presidential debates suggested that either candidate would have the ability (or desire) to confront Wall Street from the Oval Office. In the second and third debates, in case you missed them, Hillary didn’t even mention the Glass-Steagall Act, too big to fail, or Wall Street. While in the first debate, the subject of Wall Street only came up after she disparaged the tax policies of “Trumped-up, trickle down economics” (or, as I like to call it, the Trumpledown economics of giving tax and financial benefits to the rich and to corporations). In this election, Hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against Trump, but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the American economy. The meltdown of 2007-2008 was not mainly due to “tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy” or a “failure to invest in the middle class,” two subjects she has repeatedly highlighted to slam the Republicans and their candidate. It was a byproduct of the destruction of the regulations that opened the way for a too-big-to-fail framework to thrive. Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era act that once separated people’s bank deposits and loans from any kind of risky bets or other similar actions in which banks might engage, was repealed under the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. In addition, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed, which allowed Wall Street to concoct devastating unregulated side bets on what became the subprime crisis. Given that the people involved with those choices are still around and some are still advising (or in the case of one former president living with) Hillary Clinton, it’s reasonable to imagine that, in January 2017, she’ll launch the third term of Bill Clinton when it comes to financial policy, banks, and the economy. Only now, the stakes are even higher, the banks larger, and their impunity still remarkably unchallenged. Consider President Obama’s current treasury secretary, Jack Lew. It was Hillary who hit the Clinton Rolodex to bring him back to Washington. Lew first entered Bill Clinton’s White House in 1993 as special assistant to the president. Between his stints working for Clinton and Obama, he made his way into the private sector and eventually to Wall Street — as so many of his predecessors had done and successors would do. He scored a leadership role with Citigroup during the time that Bill Clinton’s former Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs co-Chairman) Robert Rubin was on its board of directors. In 2009, Hillary selected him to be her deputy secretary of state. Lew is hardly the only example of the busy revolving door to power that led from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration via Wall Street (or activities connected to it). Bill Clinton’s Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, Timothy Geithner worked with Robert Rubin, later championed Wall Street as president and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve while Hillary was senator from New York (representing Wall Street), and then became Obama’s first treasury secretary while Hillary was secretary of state. One possible contender for treasury secretary in a new Clinton administration would be Bill Clinton’s Under Secretary of Domestic Finance and Obama’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, Gary Gensler (who was — I’m sure you won’t be shocked — a Goldman Sachs partner before entering public service). These, then, are typical inhabitants of the Clinton inner circle and of the political-financial corridors of power. Their thinking, like Hillary’s, meshes well with support for the status quo in the banking system, even if, like her, they are willing on occasion to admonish it for its “mistakes.” This thru-line of personnel in and out of Clinton World is dangerous for most of the rest of us, because behind all the “talking heads” and genuinely amusing Saturday Night Live skits about this bizarre election lie certain crucial issues that will have to be dealt with: decisions about climate change, foreign wars, student-loan unaffordability, rising income inequality, declining social mobility, and, yes, the threat of another financial crisis. And keep in mind that such a future economic meltdown isn’t an absurdly long-shot possibility. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the nation’s main bank regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the government entity that insures our bank deposits, collectively noted that seven of our biggest eight banks — Citigroup was the exception — still have inadequate emergency plans in the event of another financial crisis. Exploring a two-faced world Politicians regularly act one way publicly and another privately, as Hillary was “outed” for doing by WikiLeaks via its document dump from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s hacked email account. Such realities should be treated as neither shockers nor smoking guns. Everybody postures. Everybody lies. Everybody’s two-faced in certain aspects of their lives. Politicians just make a career out of it. What’s problematic about Hillary’s public and private positions in the economic sphere, at least, isn’t their two-facedness but how of a piece they are. Yes, she warned the bankers to “cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors!” — but that was no demonstration of strength in relation to the big banks. Her comments revealed no real understanding of their precise role in exacerbating a fixable subprime loan calamity and global financial crisis, nor did her finger-wagging mean anything to Wall Street. Keep in mind that, during the build-up to that crisis, as banks took advantage of looser regulations, she collected more than $7 million from the securities and investment industry for her New York Senate runs ($18 million during her career). In her first Senate campaign, Citigroup was her top contributor. The four Wall-Street-based banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) all feature among her top 10 career contributors. As a senator, she didn’t introduce any bills aimed at reforming or regulating Wall Street. During the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, she did introduce five (out of 140) bills relating to the housing crisis, but they all died before making it through a Senate committee. So did a bill she sponsored to curtail corporate executive compensation. Though she has publicly called for a reduction in hedge-fund tax breaks (known as “closing the carried interest loophole”), including at the second debate, she never signed on to the bill that would have done so (one that Obama co-sponsored in 2007). Perhaps her most important gesture of support for Wall Street was her vote in favor of the $700 billion 2008 bank bailout bill. (Bernie Sanders opposed it.) After her secretary of state stint, she returned to the scene of banking crimes. Many times. As we know, she was also paid exceedingly well for it. Friendship with the Clintons doesn’t come cheap. As she said in October 2013, while speaking at a Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments’ Symposium, “running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it. New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle.” Between 2013 and 2015, she gave 12 speeches to Wall Street banks, private equity firms, and other financial corporations, reaping a whopping $2,935,000 for them. In her 2016 presidential run, the securities and investment sector (aka Wall Street) has contributed the most of any industry to PACs supporting Hillary: $56.4 million. Yes, everybody needs to make a buck or a few million of them. This is America after all, but Hillary was a political figure paid by the same banks routinely getting slapped with criminal settlements by the Department of Justice. In addition, the Clinton Foundation counted as generous donors all four of the major Wall Street-based mega-banks. She was voracious when it came to such money and tone-deaf when it came to the irony of it all. Glass-Steagall and Bernie Sanders One of the more illuminating aspects of the Podesta emails was a series of communications that took place in the fall of 2015. That’s when Bernie Sanders was gaining traction for, among other things, his calls to break up the big banks and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Clinton administration’s dismantling of that act in 1999 had freed the big banks to use their depositors’ money as collateral for risky bets in the real estate market and elsewhere, and so allowed them to become ever more engorged with questionable securities. On December 7, 2015, with her campaign well underway and worried about the Sanders challenge, the Clinton camp debuted a key Hillary op-ed, “How I’d Rein in Wall Street,” in the New York Times. This followed two months of emails and internal debate within her campaign over whether supporting the return of Glass-Steagall was politically palatable for her and whether not supporting it would antagonize Senator Elizabeth Warren. In the end, though Glass-Steagall was mentioned in passing in her op-ed, she chose not to endorse its return. She explained her decision not to do so this way (and her advisers and media apostles have stuck with this explanation ever since): “Some have urged the return of a Depression-era rule called Glass-Steagall, which separated traditional banking from investment banking. But many of the firms that contributed to the crash in 2008, like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, weren’t traditional banks, so Glass-Steagall wouldn’t have limited their reckless behavior. Nor would restoring Glass-Steagall help contain other parts of the ‘shadow banking’ sector, including certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank institutions.” Her entire characterization of how the 2007-2008 banking crisis unfolded was — well — wrong. Here’s how traditional banks (like JPMorgan Chase) operated: they lent money to investment banks like Lehman Brothers so that they could buy more financial waste products stuffed with subprime mortgages that these traditional banks were, in turn, trying to sell. They then backed up those toxic financial products through insurance companies like AIG, which came close to collapse when what it was insuring became too toxically overwhelming to afford. AIG then got a $182 billion government bailout that also had the effect of bailing out those traditional banks (including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which became “traditional” during the crisis). In this way, the whole vicious cycle started with the traditional banks that hold your deposits and at the same time could produce and sell those waste products thanks to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. So yes, the loss of that act caused the crisis and, in its wake, every big traditional bank was fined for crisis-related crimes. Hillary won’t push to bring back Glass-Steagall. Doing so would dismantle her husband’s legacy and that of the men he and she appointed to public office. Whatever cosmetic alterations may be in store, count on that act remaining an artifact of the past, since its resurrection would dismay the bankers who, over the past three decades, made the Clintons what they are. No wonder many diehard Sanders supporters remain disillusioned and skeptical — not to speak of the fact that their candidate featured dead last (39th) on a list of recommended vice presidential candidates in the Podesta emails. That’s unfortunately how much his agenda is likely to matter to her in the Oval Office. Go regulate yourselves! Before he resigned with his nine-figure golden parachute, Wells Fargo CEO and Chairman John Stumpf addressed Congress over disclosures that 5,300 of his employees had created two million fake accounts, scamming $2.4 million from existing customers. The bank was fined $185 million for that (out of a total $10 billion in fines for a range of other crimes committed before and during the financial crisis). In response, Hillary wrote a letter to Wells Fargo’s customers. In it, she didn’t actually mention Stumpf by name, as she has not mentioned any Wall Street CEO by name in the context of criminal activity. Instead, she simply spoke of “he.” As she put it, “He owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.” She added, “Executives should be held individually accountable when rampant illegal activity happens on their watch.” She does have a plan to fine banks for being too big, but they’ve already been fined repeatedly for being crooked and it hasn’t made them any smaller or less threatening. As their top officials evidently view the matter, paying up for breaking the law is just another cost of doing business. Hillary also wrote, “If any bank can’t be managed effectively, it should be broken up.” But the question is: Why doesn’t ongoing criminal activity that threatens the rest of us correlate with ineffective management — or put another way, when was the last time you saw a major bank broken up? And don’t hold your breath for that to happen in a new Clinton administration either. In her public letter, she added, “I’ll appoint regulators who will stand with taxpayers and consumers, not with big banks and their friends in Congress.” On the other hand, at that same Goldman Sachs symposium, while in fundraising mode, she gave bankers a pass relative to regulators and commented: “Well, I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and [I have] a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it.” She has steadfastly worked to craft explanations for the financial crisis and the Great Recession that don’t endanger the banks as we presently know them. In addition, she has supported the idea of appointing insider regulators, insisting that “the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.” (Let’s not forget that former Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Hank Paulson ran the Treasury Department while the crisis brewed.) Among the emails sent to John Podesta that were posted by WikiLeaks is an article I wrote for TomDispatch on the Clintons’ relationships with bankers. “She will not point fingers at her friends," I said in that piece in May 2015. She will not chastise the people who pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop to speak or the ones who have long shared the social circles in which she and her husband move.” I also suggested that she wouldn’t call out any CEO by name. To this day she hasn’t. I said that she would never be an advocate for Glass-Steagall. And she hasn’t been. What was true then will be no less true once she’s in the White House and no longer has to make gestures toward the platform on which Bernie ran and so can once again more openly embrace the bankers’ way of conducting business. There’s a reason Wall Street has a crush on her and its monarchs like Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein pay her such stunning sums to offer anodyne remarks to their employees and others. Blankfein has been coy about an official Clinton endorsement simply because he doesn’t want to rock her campaign boat, but make no mistake, this Wall Street kingpin’s silence is tantamount to an endorsement. To date, $10 trillion worth of assets sits on the books of the Big Six banks. Since 2008, these same banks have copped to more than $150 billion in fines for pre-crisis behavior that ranged on the spectrum of criminality from manipulating multiple public markets to outright fraud. Hillary Clinton has arguably taken money that would not have been so available if it weren’t for the ill-gotten gains those banks secured. In her usual measured way, albeit with some light admonishments, she has told them what they want to hear: that if they behave — something that in her dictionary of definitions involves little in the way of personalized pain or punishment — so will she. So let’s recap Hillary’s America, past, present, and future. It’s a land lacking in meaningful structural reform of the financial system, a place where the big banks have been, and will continue to be, coddled by the government. No CEO will be jailed, no matter how large the fines his bank is saddled with or how widespread the crimes it committed. Instead, he’s likely to be invited to the inaugural ball in January. Because its practices have not been adequately controlled or curtailed, the inherent risk that Wall Street poses for Main Street will only grow as bankers continue to use our money to make their bets. (The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to help on this score, but has yet to make the big banks any smaller.) And here’s an obvious corollary to all this: the next bank-instigated economic catastrophe will not be dealt with until it has once again crushed the financial stability of millions of Americans. The banks have voted with their dollars on all of this in multiple ways. Hillary won’t do anything to upset that applecart. We should have no illusions about what her presidency would mean from a Wall Street vs. Main Street perspective. Certainly, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn’t. He effectively endorsed Hillary before a crowd of financial industry players, saying, “I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle.” For Wall Street, of course, that aisle is essentially illusory, since its players operate so easily and effectively on both sides of it. In Hillary’s America, Wall Street will still own Main Street. Nomi Prins Nomi Prins, a TomDispatch regular, is the author of six books.
